When I announced last December that the Government had agreed to increase the price of the television licence fee by €43, I also announced a wide range of measures that will be implemented to strengthen the accountability and transparency of RTE in relation to the use of the substantial public funding being provided to it.These measures include the following: RTE will operate on the basis of a public charter – I will shortly initiate a public consultation on a draft charter; future funding of RTE will be linked to multi-annual business plans with outputs that can be independently verified; RTE will publish an agreed statement of programme commitments that can be measured; RTE will establish an audience council in the first half of this year to act as an advisory body to the authority; RTE will publish a code of fair trading practice in the first quarter of this year; and RTE is implementing a change management programme supported by a new financial management system that will bring greater transparency and accountability in relation to the cost of each RTE service. My officials will continue to meet RTE management over the coming months to ensure compliance with the commitments given.RTE will not receive the full increase of €43 as it was an integral part of the Government decision that 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee – approximately €7 to €7.50 –  is to be ring-fenced as a special broadcasting fund to encourage new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting. The remaining €36, approximately, will go to RTE. This is still a very significant increase and, accordingly, I am committed to ensuring that the licence fee paying public get good value for money. The package of reforms announced and the associated accountability and transparency measures are designed to ensure that this objective is realised.

There are many questions I would like to ask. What percentage of the licence fee increase will go towards programme making? Has the Minister made any provisions to increase the level of programme making? Every time one turns on the television one notices that Irish-made programmes are fewer and fewer. One could almost count on one hand the number of Irish-made programmes.I know the Minister said he will continue to meet RTE to ensure the licence fee increase is justified. However, has anybody from the Department been appointed to RTE to ensure that is the case?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I am not at all surprised that the Deputy and his party are disappointed by the increase in the RTE licence fee. When we increased the fee previously we were castigated by the Opposition for not making the increase greater.A policy adviser and a number of public servants work full time in my Department on the issue of RTE. There were more meetings with RTE personnel in the six months before Christmas than were held with them since the formation of the Government. RTE personnel said they never had as many meetings with a Department as took place over those six months. The purpose of those meetings was to examine the general and financial management of RTE and the result has been certain understandings predicated on a licence fee increase. My Department will continue to work day-to-day with RTE to ensure that the commitments it made are fulfilled.Commitments regarding home-produced programmes are set out in documents available on the websites of RTE and my Department, although those were predicated on a full €43 licence fee increase which was not approved. On RTE 1, RTE has undertaken to increase home-produced drama at peak time by 15%, home-produced news and current affairs by 10%, home-produced music by over 12%, home-produced factual and historic programming by 8% and home-produced entertainment by 14%. The issue is not as acute in radio because most of the programming on that medium is home-produced. On Network 2, increases in home-produced programmes will be in the order of 7% in news and current affairs, 6% in music and 8% in entertainment. RTE has committed to increase dramatically the extent of home-produced programmes which is the main reason the licence fee was increased.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The main purpose of my meeting with the Greek Fisheries Minister and current President of the Fisheries Council, Mr. Georgios Dris, was to discuss with him the Irish box and to seek his support for urgent actions at Council level to provide for its continuation. I outlined in some detail the history of the Irish box and its critical importance to the conservation of fish stocks and the livelihoods of Irish fishermen. Those fishermen are substantially dependent on fishing within the box.I explained that Ireland is totally opposed to the Commission proposal which was presented at the December Council on western waters on the basis that it seeks to eliminate the Irish box as a separate zone. It also proposes scrapping current vessel limits on Spain within the box as well as the effort limits on other member states without imposing an equivalent restriction for the Irish box area. I pointed out that the Commission's approach, which is to introduce effort limits across very large areas of western waters, would not be effective. It would prove very difficult to control and would lead to a transfer of fishing effort into the Irish box from outside, increasing fishing pressure in this very sensitive zone. I pointed out that the Commission's proposal would give Spain's entire "Grand Sol" fleet of 230 large whitefish vessels access right up to the 12 mile zone of the Irish coast.I set down the amendments Ireland is seeking to the Commission's proposal. These involve the establishment of the Irish box as a sensitive zone, establishment of effort limits for the box based on recent fishing effort history of each member state, including Spain, and the continuation of the effort regime for the rest of western waters as at present. I found Mr. Dris open and sympathetic to my proposals for the box. I sought and received a commitment from him to give priority during the first part of the Greek Presidency to working to achieve a compromise that recognises the ecological sensitivity of the Irish box and its importance to the Irish fishing industry. I had the Irish box included on Monday's Fisheries Council agenda. At the conclusion of the debate in Council, the Greek Presidency restated the commitments given at our bilateral meeting and called on COREPER to commence working on a draft compromise for presentation to the Council as soon as possible.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	21	We have not had the opportunity to question the Minister since before Christmas. Will he confirm that the Commission has taken the view that the Irish Box is a bilateral issue for Ireland and Spain to resolve? Will he also confirm that he has effectively lost the legal  argument? For example, he has given no indication that the matter might be referred to the European Court.The Spanish armada of vessels has been lying quietly off the coast of northern Spain while problems relating to the recent oil spillage there have been addressed. However, it is now slowly moving towards Ireland's key interests in the 50 mile box. Recently, the first of these vessels was arrested. Will the Minister concede that he has lost the battle and shown the white flag to Spain?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I do not accept that. The Irish Box requires more attention than the issuance of a few press statements or discussions with a few journalists. The Deputy referred to a Spanish boat detained over allegations of fishing offences. It was not inside but outside the Irish Box. Despite the portends of doom and gloom since 1 January, the number of Spanish vessels within the box has not even reached double figures on any day. While there are Spanish vessels outside the box, their presence this year is less than usual.This issue was not formally placed on the agenda of the Council meeting last December and it was never going to be decided then, despite efforts to suggest otherwise. It was originally contained in the Commission's proposal for resolution throughout this year, with a view to taking action in 2004, not only with regard to the Irish Box but also the Shetland and plaice boxes, also within European Union waters. Last October the Spanish requested a legal opinion which was subsequently tabled although there would not have been enough time to address it. We strongly objected to the opinion.Some may wish this to be a bilateral issue, but this Government and others do not take that view. For example, at Monday's meeting, the Portuguese publicly and strongly supported the Irish position, as did the United Kingdom. The Commission's proposals will affect issues beyond the Irish Box which will impact on other countries. In view of this we have a number of allies. The issue may ultimately go to court, but I would like to think we will reach a compromise. In this regard, the Greek President of the Council was very accommodating.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Common Fisheries Policy reform package agreed at the December Council was a complex compromise which contains many of the recommendations of the national strategy review group which worked with me in preparing the national position in the reform process. The reform package included key national priorities  such as the continuation of the Hague quota preferences, an action plan to address the problem of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.The result of the Council agreement must be seen in the context of rapidly declining fish stocks and reduced quotas for all member states. Agreement was secured in the new framework regulation that when the Community establishes new fishing opportunities the Council shall decide on the allocation of the opportunities, taking into account the interests of each member state. In addition, in the face of concerted pressure from five member states, I was successful in having the Hague preferences specifically recognised within the framework regulation, something greatly welcomed by the industry. The Hague preferences are of critical importance to Ireland as each year they deliver additional quotas for many of the key whitefish stocks in our waters.There has been a sustained attempt in recent years to eliminate the Hague preferences and thereby reduce Ireland's share of the total EU quota allocation. There was an intensified effort in December to deny Ireland these extra quotas and, heading into the Council, I was faced with the situation whereby the draft framework regulation contained no reference to the Hague preferences, with the very real risk of these additional quota entitlements being lost for good.After lengthy and at times fraught negotiations, I succeeded in overcoming the legislative obstacle and I formally achieved the reinsertion of the Hague preferences into the new CFP regulation, as well as securing the extra whitefish quotas of about 2,000 tonnes for 2003 under the Hague preferences. I also secured changes to the new CFP regulation to ensure there is flexibility in relation to revisions to allocation keys.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	24	While the Minister may have been fraught over there, it is guaranteed that fishermen were frothing over here and not for love of the Minister. Following the fisheries negotiations in Brussels recently, the Minister stated that he had negotiated a satisfactory deal for fishermen. I wish to pose several questions with regard to what the Minister means by "satisfactory" and state what I consider unsatisfactory.In 2002, the total quota tonnage was over 200,000 tonnes; in talks in which the Minister participated recently, he achieved a little over 190,000 tonnes for 2003, a reduction of 10,000 tonnes. I cannot understand how the Minister can claim this was a satisfactory deal. This will devastate the whitefish fleet in the west and north-west due to boats being restricted to nine days at sea per month. The Minister's claims that he would protect the Irish Box by restricting the number of foreign trawlers to 40 rings hollow on this side of the House. The Minister has totally conceded to the Spanish in giving greater access to the Irish  Box while the Irish fleet has access for just nine days per month.Is the Minister receiving a list of the vessels entering the Irish Box at present? He said the number had not reached double figures but I do not care what the figures are. I want to know if the Minister knows the names of the vessels entering and the times of entry. During the negotiations, the Taoiseach said that we had to broker a better deal. I want to know what the Minister said to the Taoiseach when he came back from the negotiations.

That is in the context of a position where there were huge reductions in stocks and scientists were calling for a moratorium on fishing in all the waters around our coast with regard to a number of species. Going into the Council meeting there was no possibility of having the Hague preferences, which are very important to us. I was faced with the possibility of either a moratorium or a days-at-sea restriction in relation to all Irish waters. Despite the message put around at the December Council, where it was said this would devastate the entire west coast of Ireland, a small portion of the north-west of Ireland, from Donegal Bay upwards, not from Galway Bay, is affected. In answer to a later question, which may not be reached during the time for oral questions, I point out that at the very most only 20 boats will be affected by the days-at-sea limitation.

I accept they are affected and that  is unfortunate. That small section was included in the days-at-sea limitation because the UK is a supporter of the days-at-sea limitation in relation to cod and hake. The scientific proofs strongly suggested that there should be a moratorium. I do not accept it was a bad deal. It was a very good deal.

Indeed, I met the Dublin Chamber of Commerce informally on 3 December last year and part of the discussion related to the report.While the provision of communications infrastructure and services is a matter in the first instance for the private sector, my Department has undertaken a number of initiatives to accelerate and promote investment in telecommunications infrastructure with the co-operation of the various development agencies and following consultation with the communications operators.To date ten private sector contracts have been signed under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department is also funding the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns and the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin to facilitate the provision by the private sector of advanced communications services to consumers, educational establishments and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million. Construction of networks will begin shortly in Cork, Galway and  Mayo and further projects will commence once contracts have been completed.In Dublin specifically, my Department is overseeing the development of the digital hub, which is the Government's flagship project in the digital content sector. I met the Dublin Chamber of Commerce on this matter. This project aims to cluster Irish and international new media companies, research and development and educational-community initiatives in the Liberties-Coombe area of Dublin.To date, the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill completed all stages in the Seanad before Christmas; the construction of a 3 km, high speed, open access, fibre broadband network in the hub was completed in September 2002; Media Lab Europe, a third level research and development educational facility, has been established as a partnership between the Irish Government and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It is the flagship project of the digital hub.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Has the Minister visited Greencastle and Castletownbere since he got his famous fishing deal? Does the Minister agree that Ireland is now in the third division and that, in English terms, we are at the bottom of the second division? The Dublin Chamber of Commerce report makes it clear that cities such as Helsinki, Seoul and Singapore have the quality broadband network which gives video quality services and are in the premiership.Cities such as Copenhagen, London, San José, Sydney etc. are in the second division. We are in the third division with Prague, Tel Aviv, Dubai and so on. The Minister has been in office for six months and it is fair to say he has taken little initiative which would change that position. Is it not the case that he slashed the capital budget in this regard? Will he take on board any of the 40 or 50 major recommendations on how to accelerate broadband access for not only Dublin but every part of the country. In relation to regional policy this is vital. What is the Minister's policy on an enhanced tax regime to a lower VAT rate for e-commerce? In other words, will the Minister take a significant initiative to haul us out of the third division where we have been since 1997 The Minister is always harking back to ancient history. When the rainbow Government left office we were top of the league. The Minister did not retain that position. There was no interest the last time around and now he is in a disastrous situation.

That is, in effect, a flat rate rather than a taximeter type charge per month, which will be up to speed with the Internet. In relation to broadband, this week I launched an initiative on pilot projects and money has been spent in this regard on wireless lam. I very much disabuse the Deputy and others on the spend on broadband. There is no cut in regard to broadband. We will spend as much money as we can on that –€60 million will be spent between now and next year on the roll-off of fibre optic cable to 19 towns and cities around the country.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Section 19(11) of the Broadcasting Act, 2001, provides that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, which is a statutorily independent body, shall draw up new codes and rules relating to advertising likely to be of direct or indirect interest to children. In November 2002, I formally directed the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to draw up new codes and rules relating to advertising and that priority be given to those codes pertaining to advertising directed at children, and the Commission has commenced that process.The question of advertising directed at children is a sensitive and complex matter. While there is broad agreement that children should be protected and should not be exploited as consumers, there are many differing views as to how this objective can be best achieved. The Oireachtas decided in 2001 that the best way to proceed was to provide the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland with the power to draw up and implement codes and rules on children's advertising that would apply to all broadcasters licensed in Ireland.The Deputy makes a link between additional increased revenues that will flow to RTE as a result of the increase in the television licence fee and the possibility of restricting advertising directed at children. I am of the view that it is better to have clear codes and rules that will apply to all broadcasters licensed in this jurisdiction. The purpose of the codes and rules will be to set standards and ensure that children are adequately protected.The approach at EU level to the question of advertising directed at children is of direct relevance to us in Ireland. The European Commission presented the findings of a study on the impact of advertising and teleshopping on minors in March 2001. The main finding was that the provisions of the television without frontiers directive provide an adequate and flexible framework for member states rules in this area. The EU Commission has recently published its work programme for the review of the directive, and the work of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland on its new codes and rules will help inform Ireland's approach to the review of the directive.

When should we expect a report from  the commission? Is he aware Sweden bans television advertising directed at children under 12 years of age? This ban has been commended by the United Nations as a good example for others to follow. I am sure the Minister is aware that many of his constituents from poorer backgrounds, particularly coming up to the Christmas period, are under pressure from advertising specifically geared towards children. There is the crazy situation where children are targeted by advertisers trying to sell products as early as August.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I wrote to the chairman of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in November 2002 and have had discussions with him about this issue to try to bring forward these standards as quickly as possible. I cannot give a time scale as it is up to the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland but in the meantime, the existing codes of standards and practice drawn up in 1995 by one of my predecessors are in situ and will remain so. It may well fall for some consideration during Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004 and it might be one of the issues to the fore. It is an issue we are trying to address to build on the international experience from Sweden, to which the Deputy referred, and other countries and the current codes of standards in place.

Late last year my office did some work on it and looked at advertising on children's television. We surveyed 200 advertisements during the afternoon on "Den 2" and looked at what was being advertised. It was incredible to see it was typically the highest fat food and products with the highest sugar content – the worst products one would want for one's children.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	69	Rather than the Minister say the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is looking into this issue or what Television without Frontiers states, I would like to hear his view. Has he expressed a view in his discussions with the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland or has he a completely open mind and is waiting to see? Will he instruct the commission in any way to try to protect children?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Under the legislation the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland is independent of me, although the Minister has the power to instruct or direct the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to bring forward codes, a power which I exercised. It would be wrong for me to give a formal view. Obviously, as a parent with young children I have a view but, as Minister, it would be wrong for me to pre-judge any consideration of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland. The level of complaints brought to our attention is extremely low, and this is also the experience at  EU level. Apparently, it is accepted at EU level that the existing directive works pretty well, although there are differences between member states as Deputy Crowe instanced. Part of the review will take into account the differing approaches to see how the matter can be addressed. I accept, however, that the level of advertising targeting children seems to be on the increase. It is something of which we should be very conscious and that is why I took action in November.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I expect to receive the report of the sea-fishing boat policy licensing group by 30 June 2003. The review group can make interim recommendations at any stage on issues requiring urgent decisions.The review group has made two conservation-related interim recommendations, which I have accepted. These are: first, that polyvalent boats not precluded from fishing for herring and/or mackerel but which did not fish for those species in 2002 or 2003 will not break the active pelagic requirement of fishing for either of those species for 16 weeks in each of four successive years; and, second, that polyvalent boat owners also have the option to have 2002 and 2003 included for the purposes of active pelagic track record, subject to their having fished for at least a minimum period of eight weeks in each of those years.This is the first comprehensive review of licensing policy for more than a decade and there are many complex issues to be considered before substantive recommendations can be made for a reasonable number of years ahead.Clarification is awaited in relation to decisions on the EU Common Fisheries Policy last month affecting some key issues which the review group has to address, notably regarding the permitted overall size, composition and capacity of the Irish sea-fishing boat fleet.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Given that the quota and tax negotiations have been completed, why do we not have the report? While my second question may cover some earlier ground, it is relevant to the new licensing regime. The Minister has admitted that area six of the Atlantic has been devastated because the British Government did not defend Scottish fishermen and the Minister himself did not defend our Donegal fishermen. Coastal communities such as Greencastle are facing an appalling future as a result of the Minister's incompetent negotiations and the seeding of area six. Fishermen are being restricted to nine days at sea, so will the new licensing regime take into account the fact that our fishermen will be at a  disadvantage? They will be facing an enormous challenge in the Irish Box from a huge foreign fleet, so will the Minister be able to organise licensing policy in such a way as to remove these major disadvantages?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The time for this supplementary question has concluded.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The Minister refused to answer me when I asked him about a decision of the former Minister, Deputy Fahey, concerning a large trawler in the Donegal area, which apparently had a negative impact on the negotiations the Minister has just conducted. That decision may well have to be revisited because it was a bizarre one.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I do not accept the Deputy's contention concerning the discussions before December. At the Fisheries Council we achieved hake preferences and, in addition, we succeeded in defeating the proposal to make the entire Irish Sea and Celtic Sea up to Donegal subject to a days-at-sea limitation. The fact is that a relatively small area is affected within which only about 20 boats are affected, despite exaggerations the Deputy may have heard on the airwaves and which he has just repeated.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Has the Minister visited Greencastle?

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Every day.

The 20 or so boats that are affected, out of the entire Irish fleet, have choices to make. They can make them because, based on their previous track record, quite a number of them will be able to fish for at least 25 days a month if they fish a particular species with a particular mesh size.One of my first acts on taking up office was to put the licensing of fishing vessels on an independent basis. I established an interim appeals mechanism so that the designation of licences would be at arm's length from the Minister. The Deputy should compliment me on that.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Can the Minister orchestrate the licensing arrangements in a way which ensures smaller vessels or a large fleet of inshore vessels will be allowed to fish? New vessels with technical conservation measures would be of advantage to us in that they might keep the larger international fleets, which would not have the same rigging for such new measures, out of Irish waters. Has the Minister considered this in his negotiations and licensing arrangements?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Yes, those issues would have been considered, particularly in relation to protecting small inshore fishing boats of which a substantial number are unregulated. My officials and I have had discussions with the Commission on how we can address the matter so that we can get a greater number of unlicensed small inshore fishing boats registered with a record of active fishing. Those discussions are ongoing. We are also discussing the implications of that with fishing industry representatives. I take on board the Deputy's points.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	82	The Seven Heads gas field, which lies in the North Celtic Sea Basin some 50 km. off the Cork coast to the south-east of the Kinsale Head gas field and for which a plan of development, POD, accompanied by an environmental impact statement, EIS, has been submitted to me for approval, is estimated by the developer, Ramco Seven Heads Limited, to contain some 300 billion cubic feet with an estimated economic field life of 15 to 18 years. The application is currently under consideration in my Department and I hope to be in a position to make a determination in relation to it in the coming weeks.Ramco Seven Heads Limited hope to bring ashore the gas in the autumn of 2003. The field will supply Ireland with between 10% and 15% of its requirements for the next 15 years approximately. Moreover, the development will use the processing and export pipelines of the Kinsale gas field. This, in turn, will extend the economic life of the field and its associated employment.The company will be liable to pay corporation tax at the rate of 25% on profits from the sale of gas. The corporation tax yield to the State is estimated in the region of €60 million to €100 million.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	83	What is the Minister's initial reaction to the plan of development? Would he agree that many citizens noticed the widespread publicity given a few weeks before Christmas to the deal between Ramco and the German com pany, Innogy? They were surprised by the estimate put on the value of this resource and the fact that there seemed to be no way this State could acquire any royalties from this flow of wealth. Is it not the case that some of the estimates in the energy press refer to a capacity of 500 billion cubic feet and perhaps more? While I understand Ramco is a specialist company and that it has organised its finance through Bank of Scotland, it seems this small company and others like it are getting a bargain basement deal from the Irish State.We sometimes hear that we may be the Norwegians of the future given that our coastal shelf, with new technology, is an immensely valuable resource given its energy freedom and potential exports for many centuries into the future. If that is the case, should it not be a priority of this Administration to look urgently at the return to this State in terms of royalties, the workforce and all other benefits gained from our oil and tax regime?Is it not time for an urgent review?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	84	I am surprised Deputy Broughan is so critical of his former colleague, Mr. Spring, who was in my position years ago and oversaw the conditions under which oil companies got into this country. Despite all the publicity which people like the Deputy might seek when in opposition as opposed to what they might do when in government, the reality is that the level of exploration around our coast is at an all time low. The vast majority of companies have not even drawn on any of the conditions about which there is so much publicity. This is a relatively small company which had the courage to stay in Ireland and investigate the possibilities. As I said earlier, it is estimated, based on certain price levels which are verifiable, that in the range of €60 million to €100 million will come to the State based on the corporation tax rate, which for oil companies is still very high in comparison to 12.5% for everything else. An objective analysis of oil exploration off our coast over the years will show that, despite what might be perceived as favourable conditions for oil companies, there has been little or no exploration. Many issues about royalties are similar to those granted in the UK and elsewhere.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I am surprised at the Deputy's negativity because this will sustain the jobs of many Irish people in the area as well as throughout the country. It will ensure we have at least some portion of our energy supplies available to us in the future rather than having them  imported. Indeed we may get to a situation with the gas interconnector where we will be able to trade some of this outside the State and be an exporter of gas.

Under that directive, the Commission must verify that the measures proposed are compatible with EU law, communicate them to other member states and seek the opinion of the contact committee established under Article 23a of the directive.A meeting of the contact committee, which is chaired by the Commission and includes representatives from all member states, will take place tomorrow. Among the items to be discussed at that meeting are Ireland's proposals on Article 3a. My Department will be represented at that meeting. Provided the contact committee and the European Union raise no objections to Ireland's proposals, I intend at an early date to bring before each House of the Oireachtas a draft order designating the listed events.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Can we take it that the list of key sporting events are home and away championship games, the European football championships – like many other citizens, I am pleased we have such a distinguished new football manager, Mr. Brian Kerr – the World Cup, All Ireland senior hurling and football finals, the Derby, the Grand National and possibly the Six Nations Cup? Will these vital events, about which all sides in this House felt very strongly six or eight months ago, be broadcast by the national broadcaster on terrestrial television?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	92	If the contact committee approves the list tomorrow – we have not heard anything to the contrary – the Commission will publish the Irish list in the EU journal and it will write to each permanent representation confirming the list is compatible with EU law. I must  then kick in with the legislative requirements in relation to the draft order before each House. It will then be a matter of what matches are included under the designation. As far as we and the Attorney General are concerned it will cover the events included in the proposed list which has been sent to the Commission.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The European Parliament is considering a new directive on the concentration of media ownership, including cross-ownership of local radio, newspapers and television networks in this country in relation to VCI decisions and so on, some of which are sub judice. Has the Irish Government made any input into the debate at Commission level in relation to concentrations of media ownership?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	94	The Deputy is correct in saying that we are continuing to make an input. I hope I will be Minister this time next year when Ireland holds the Presidency. This is an issue which I hope to take up in the review of the television without frontiers directive. It is necessary to have a review in regard to that directive to, in effect, deal with matters about which many member states are somewhat uneasy. This will be very much an issue on my agenda next year if I continue as Minister.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	95	As the Deputy is aware, RTE is dual funded, receiving moneys from the proceeds of the television licence fee and commercial revenue. As the national public service broadcaster, RTE is mandated to provide a comprehensive range of programmes on radio and television that reflect the cultural diversity of the whole island of Ireland and that entertain, inform and educate. This mandate includes the provision of a programming schedule that will cater for the expectations of the community generally as well as members of the community with special or minority interests.The purpose of the licence fee increase was to ensure that RTE had the necessary resources to fulfil its statutory mandate. It was accepted there was a strong case for improving the quality of RTE's programme schedules with more home-produced programming in peak time in particular. RTE's application for a licence fee increase of €43 was based on an assumption that this would generate additional income of €50 million of which €32 million would go directly to additional programming.Through the implementation of its change management programme, RTE is committed to achieving efficiencies so that the benefit to the licence fee payer from the substantial public funds provided to RTE is maximised.An integral part of the Government decision to increase the licence fee was that 5% of the net proceeds of the television licence fee, approximately €7 to €7.50, would be ring-fenced as a special broadcasting fund to encourage new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting. The remaining €35.50 will go to RTE. This is a significant increase for RTE and is accompanied by a package of reforms to ensure that the paying public get good value for their money. The decision to establish the special fund was an integral part of the comprehensive programme of measures that I announced last December to bring about a fundamental reform of public service broadcasting in Ireland. The special fund will result in enhanced public service programming on a nationwide basis over and above that provided by RTE, which will be in receipt of increased funding, and over and above that already provided by other broadcasters.It is my intention that the scheme will be administered by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in the first instance and ultimately by the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland. I will bring forward shortly more detailed proposals in connection with the establishment and operation of the fund.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	96	People will expect to see something in return when they pay increased television licence fees. This question was tabled in the hope of discovering whether the money will be invested in Irish programme making. On what sort of programme does the Minister envisage the licence fee money will be spent? Will it be spent on Irish soaps or other programmes?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	97	There will be an increase in home produced programmes. The Irish people want an Irish broadcaster that produces programmes here, to help to keep jobs here and to support our culture and traditions. It is not desirable to have outside broadcasters always pushing programmes that are produced abroad. If we do not pay for an indigenous service, we will have to do without it. The Government took a strategic and courageous decision to give what is, in effect, a substantial licence fee increase to RTE. I assure the Deputy and the House that my Department will continue its detailed discussions with RTE and will ensure that the commitments made by RTE will be delivered.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	98	When RTE management and trade unions attended a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, it was striking that trade unions made the point that RTE's regional structures have been grossly run down. It is inappropriate that the committee is sitting at the same  time as questions are being asked of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in the House, given that Deputies do not have the gift of bi-location. Is the Minister concerned about the regional aspects of RTE's service, for example in his territory in the north-east? Despite the fact that there are a few remarkably good regional correspondents, some of whom are justly famous, I do not get the feeling that RTE is sufficiently responsive to regional needs.Deputies are probably aware that the local authority of which I am a member had to conduct some important business in recent weeks. I found that my colleagues on Dublin City Council and I had to educate certain journalists, including some from RTE, about some basic facts relating to the operation of local government in Dublin. The Minister is aware that RTE does not have a Dublin correspondent and I believe there should be correspondents in all other areas, including Cork, Louth and Wexford.Has the Minister any strong views about RTE's coverage of politics, especially the attention it pays to this House? Does he have any ideas about how television coverage of the House could be enhanced? I appreciate that the Oireachtas needs to make changes so that it can be televised and the new Oireachtas commission should take action in that regard. I hope this debate on broadcasting will be covered on "Oireachtas Report" tonight and that it will not seem as if we are in a wooden atmosphere.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I call the Minister for a brief reply.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	104	Can we make this House more exciting on television and radio? Has the Minister held any discussions with RTE management in that regard? The programmes on BBC2 from 10.30 p.m. each night provide vivid coverage of the proceedings in Westminster and I wonder why we cannot have the same.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	106	Perhaps we would be more entertaining if we argued in the Chamber more often. I assure Deputies Broughan and Kehoe that the issues they have raised were very much to the fore during my discussions with RTE in recent months. I assume the Deputies did not see  the advertisements placed by RTE in newspapers late last week – the station is recruiting a north-east correspondent, which I welcome.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I am glad to hear it.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The problem in the north-east used to be that matters in that region were covered by reporters and cameras from Belfast. I do not think the areas represented by Deputies Broughan and Kehoe have had to tolerate such a situation. I understand, as part of the commitment made by RTE when the licence fee increase was being discussed, that the station will increase its coverage of the proceedings of this House. I may be incorrect, but I understand that Leaders' Questions will be televised live today. I am not involved in the day-to-day running of RTE, but I am sure certain commitments have been made. The expansion of its service in the areas I have mentioned is an immediate priority – RTE has admitted that its regional coverage can have certain deficiencies. The station intends to appoint an education correspondent and a science correspondent, which is important, and it plans to expand its foreign operations.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	117	We must move on to Question No. 121.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Deputy Broughan should not claim credit for the good news.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I propose to take Questions Nos. 121 and 577 together.As the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has indicated, funding available this year under the forestry subhead will be focused on the maintenance of a viable planting programme. In this regard, approvals for new afforestation projects will continue to be issued. Planting levels in 2003 are expected to reach at least 10,000 hectares and I hope this figure will be increased during the year. Despite the changed budgetary situation, the Government remains fully committed to the long-term development of the forestry sector and I will ensure that this commitment will be reiterated in the current negotiations on a new national partnership agreement.I am conscious of the serious concerns among forestry stake holders in relation to the budgetary situation. There have been extensive consultations with the forestry sector, involving the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and my officials. These consultations were undertaken to ensure a positive outcome in terms of maintaining confidence in the sector, with regard to the contribution of forestry to the economy, rural development and sustainable local employment. On that basis, following the feedback which the Minister of State and my officials received from the sector, I decided that the primary focus in 2003 should be on maintaining the afforestation programme. As I stated earlier, approvals for new afforestation projects have been issued. I have also introduced new procedures in relation to processing afforestation applications, to ensure that those who wish to plant in the short to medium term will be accommodated during the current planting season. This is a pragmatic response to the changed budgetary situation and will allow the delivery of a viable planting programme in 2003.I assure the Deputy that the Government remains strongly committed to the continued development of the forestry sector. I welcome the input of the various forestry stake holders to the process in light of the changed budgetary situation and I look forward to working closely with representatives of the forestry groups in taking these matters forward.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The Minister did not say that when the Book of Estimates was being discussed before Christmas, when aspects of the forestry industry, such as planting, were suffering. I am worried that the moneys that have been invested in forestry by nursery stock owners planters and others will be lost as a result of the cuts in the Estimates. Did the Minister say he hopes to increase planting in 2003, compared with the 2002 figure?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I hope that planting levels will reach more than 10,000 hectares this year
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I would like the Minister to ensure that money continues to be invested in forestry, as it is a viable alternative to agriculture for many people. I am glad to hear that planting is to be increased.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	123	The amount of taxpayers' money to be invested this year in the forestry area is €82.58 million, which is a substantial sum. This is a reduction from the all-time high of the previous year of more than €100 million. Since 1997, more than €540 million – an average spend of €90 million per year – has been spent on forestry. That is, in anyone's terms, a very substantial investment by the taxpayer and a commitment by the Government to invest in the forestry industry.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	124	From the Minister's comments that the limited resources will be concentrated on continuing the current forestry programme, I infer that the two innovative schemes that held great hope for environmentalists and people interested in forestry, namely, the neighbourhood wood scheme and the native woodland scheme, are effectively being cut, as their budgets have been slashed. These programmes have taken years in development and represent a move away from the concentration on soft wood and exotic conifers, which have very low economic value, towards not only forests of high amenity value but also, in the long run, high-value native hardwood timber. Those projects have been the first to suffer in the fairly dramatic cutbacks introduced by the Minister. Can the Minister confirm that they will get funding this year? Roughly how much will they get?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Are we not hopelessly behind the targets set in the 1996 programme? Could the Minister explain again why he opposes part of the current EU directive on the protection of the forest environment?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	126	Decisions on the neighbourhood wood and native woodland schemes will made shortly by the Minister of State, Deputy Browne.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	127	What about the Minister?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	128	The Deputy is right: they are excellent schemes.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	129	They are about to be cut.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	130	It is important that I restate that the amount of taxpayers' money going into this area is nearly €86 million in the current year, which in anyone's terms is substantial.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	131	Would the Minister not put some of that into—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	132	Would the Deputy please allow the Minister to reply?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I do not for one minute accept that there will be doom and gloom in this area. As Deputy Broughan has said, it will allow for the commitments made to be achieved.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	134	If the Minister put some percentage of the money into the schemes—
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	135	If Deputies wish to ask a supplementary question they should write it down.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	136	The native woodland scheme was the one scheme which gave hope to environmentalists – an innovative scheme that showed there was a future that did not involve producing Sitka spruce from the top to the bottom of the country. The Minister may be spending €90 million but if he does not spend it on the native woodland scheme there is no long-term future for the forestry industry.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	137	That is not a question. I said in response to the Deputy's earlier question that decisions would be made shortly on those schemes.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	138	It is to be hoped they will be the right decisions.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	139	Following consideration of the recommendations of the Forum on Broadcasting and of submissions received on its findings, I announced a comprehensive programme of measures to be implemented that will result in a fundamental reform of public service broadcasting in Ireland. Some of these measures will be implemented in the immediate future, while others will take a little longer.One of the key recommendations of the forum was that there should only be one content regulator for Irish broadcasters. I concurred with that recommendation and the Government agreed to my proposal to establish a new regulator – the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland – that will have responsibility for content regulation and for the independent broadcasters currently licensed by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland as well as RTE. New legislation will be necessary to give effect to the decision to establish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland and to the establish  RTE as a commercial state company. Work has commenced in this regard.In the short-term other measures will be implemented. For example, I will shortly initiate a public consultation on a draft charter for RTE and RTE's statement of commitments for the current year will be agreed. In the first quarter of this year RTE is committed to finalising its new code of fair trading practice and to the appointment of a process auditor to its independent production unit. By the middle of the year, RTE will have established an audience council. I am also considering options for the introduction of the special fund for new, innovative and additional public service broadcasting in the period prior to the establishment of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	140	In the lengthy debate we had in the run up to the Minister's decision on the licence fee, it was noted by many commentators that every few years we seem to have a similar debate on the future of public sector broadcasting. Does the Minister think the programme he detailed, particularly the launching of a charter and a customer charter, secures the future of public broadcasting? Will we need to have this debate again in three or four years or more crisis discussions on the future of public broadcasting?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I agree with the Deputy – there has been a change of attitude within RTE in regard to the delivery of public service broadcasting and the commitments it made as a result of the licence fee increase. As I said on a previous question, RTE has been very quick to respond to some of the key issues. My Department officials and I will continue to meet RTE officials on a regular basis to ensure that its commitment will be fulfilled.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The House meets today at a time of great uncertainty, when parliaments and people all over the world are discussing the possible onset of war in Iraq. I consider it an indictment of the Government that this House has not yet had a full, open debate, with questions to members of the Government, about the Government's stance on the possible catastrophic economic and social consequences for humanity of such a war. The Government has been hiding behind language. I hope the Taoiseach will answer this simple question in simple and understandable language: has the Cabinet discussed, and made a decision on, this country's attitude towards the facilities for refuelling being made available at Shannon, first, in the event of UN sanction being given under a second resolution for a military invasion of Iraq, and second, in the event of a military invasion taking place unilaterally? What would the Government do, in the latter case, about the refuelling facilities? Would  they be closed down or would the Government continue to make them available?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	143	A detailed debate on this matter will take place tonight.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	144	It is totally disorderly to have a display of this manner. The Deputies are completely out of order.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The Deputy is out of order and should resume his seat.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Deputy is in blatant contravention of Standing Orders. He should resume his seat and the other Deputies should remove the notice.

There is a degree of deafness and there may also be a degree of blindness.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	151	The Deputy should resume his seat. He is in blatant contravention of Standing Orders and he knows it. The Deputies should remove the notice.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	152	To make the point, the notice is required. We will obviously not get a reply from the Government, so we will have to leave. I make the point that the Government has not respected the Constitution.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I am not coming into this House to have its regulations and rules disobeyed.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	158	Order. This is Leaders' Questions. The Taoiseach, to continue his reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	159	The Minister for Foreign Affairs will make a detailed statement on all the circumstances tonight. The Deputy asked what would happen over the next few weeks because there is much uncertainty about what may or may not happen between the US and the UK. The Government totally and absolutely supports the position as set out by the Secretary General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan – we want to see a peaceful resolution to this issue. The Secretary General does not consider that we have commenced a war. He is not opposed to any military build-up to try to get compliance with Resolution 1441 of 8 November 2002. Until action takes place, the traditional arrangements for fuelling and flyovers will remain. Our preferred solution is that the Security Council debates the new report when it is issued, probably in mid-February, and agrees a new resolution. Whatever happens from that point will be based on the report and its contents. We would like to see this dealt with successfully without military action but that is in the hands of the Iraqi authorities.If there is no resolution at the UN , or it does not get to debate or agree a resolution, and there is unilateral action by the US on its own, the US and the UK, or the US, the UK and others, without a mandate from the Security Council, we will have to consider the position at that stage. We would have to revert to the House and the Government would have to make a decision. I hope it does not come to that but we have put contingency arrangements in place if that is the way it falls. I think that answers the Deputy's questions.For the information of the House, many issues were raised over the Christmas break about the various procedures and we will outline them in great detail in a contribution this evening.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	160	I am not a supporter of the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein and we completely understand the economic, political and social ties between this country and the United States, however we are a sovereign independent people. The Taoiseach did not answer whether the Cabinet had discussed or made any decision on this, nor has he referred to Ireland's central role in European affairs – this country was critical to the expansion of the European Union arising from the people's decision in the referendum on the Treaty of Nice. We should know what the position and attitude of the Cabinet will be in the event of an invasion taking place without UN sanction. It is a shame the Dáil has not had an opportunity to debate this, not just by way of Private Members' motion, but with questions and  answers so the people's representatives can give their views on what could be a catastrophic occasion. When the first bombs fall on Baghdad it will be too late to call the House back for such a debate. Will the Taoiseach tell us what is his and the Government's attitude regarding the need for UN sanction for action and is he bringing that response to the other leaders of Europe as is his duty and responsibility?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Our view is in line with that of the vast majority of European countries although I am not here to answer for them. In the event of military action being initiated against Iraq, either with or without UN sanction, the Government will review the situation, initiate a debate in the Dáil, including, if appropriate, the adoption of a motion similar to that which we passed during the Gulf War in 1991. I will not try to predict, as the Deputy is asking me, what Saddam Hussein and his corrupt regime will do or what he has done with the 6,500 chemical bombs, the equipment – logged on previous inspections and now missing – and the implements he is known to have and cannot account for or why he is not fully co-operating with the inspectors who have been unable to meet scientists. I hope he will listen to what the world is saying – the Security Council vote in November was 14 to 0, the meeting in Turkey of Saddam's neighbours last week asked him to co-operate. Practically everyone in the world has asked him to co-operate fully and comprehensively but to date he has refused to do so.I share Deputy Kenny's view. I do not want to see this turn into a catastrophe but the one person – it is ironic in the modern age that one person can call the shots – who can end all this, send everybody home and stand down the military action is Saddam Hussein. It is a matter of grave concern that he is prepared to allow the world to get into a complex and difficult situation with all the ramifications that might have. I would prefer to see this issue resolved within the international body of the United Nations which is designed to bring world peace and stability. I do not like unilateral action – I have said so inside and outside the House. I would prefer if the Americans gave more time. I hope they do, and that is what the Security Council is saying – Kofi Annan has set out the terms clearly. I reiterate that Kofi Annan does not consider the military build-up to be an act of war. He sees it as the only way of forcing Saddam Hussein to deal with issues he has refused to deal with for 13 years. I hope that will resolve the problem. If the situation changes, I will keep Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte and others informed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	162	There was another killing in this city last night. There were 62 homicides in Dublin last year and the city is now more deadly than London. At least eight of those killings were so-called gangland killings as far as we know. No one has been charged with any of these killings. We know from official Garda figures that the  level of violent assaults rose last year by 93%. The Taoiseach will be aware of a horrific incident last week involving the alleged rape of three young women, in which case a prosecution is being taken. Joyriding is at epidemic levels in some parts of Dublin and outside the city. Women, in particular, are afraid to walk some of the streets of our cities.What will the Taoiseach do to address this problem? The only Government action I can see is an offer from the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to mediate among the warring gangs in Limerick, an idea not without its attractions. Other than that tomfoolery, what does the Taoiseach intend to do to prevent a situation where crime bosses think they can kill at will and with impunity? What does he intend to do to ensure these people are brought to justice?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	163	There has been a number of serious and violent acts. While many of the people who have suffered from these have been engaged in crime, their families endured enormous hardship and I extend my sympathies to them.In recent years, the Government has implemented and has had before this House stringent legislation to try to deal with crime. Our Garda force is at a record high this year due to further recruitment and full capacity in Templemore. We have resourced the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to a record level. We would like to have done more this year but that was not possible. The Government will continue to initiate and implement public order legislation and to support the targeted operations, which are aimed at the precise criminal activities to which Deputy Rabbitte referred and which exist. Such schemes include operations Encounter, Dóchas, Cleanstreet and Nightcap, all of which involve Garda units combating sophisticated and high level crime. The extension of CCTVs and the enforcement of the dedicated units of the Garda have to be taken into account also.Deputy Rabbitte knows well that we are up against very sophisticated gangs which are, in some cases, very well equipped. The only way to break up those gangs is with heavy resources deployed by specialised units. It is difficult and specialised work. The precise answer to Deputy Rabbitte's question is that the Government has to continue to resource the special units and make them available to break up the gangs. Normal Garda surveillance activities will not break up the gangs that are involved in the kinds of gangland activities to which the Deputy referred. We have to target our resources into particular areas, and that is what the Minister is doing. At times, it means pulling resources from other areas because infinite resources are not available. The Public Order Act will help in some areas, but I am not a great believer that new legislation alone will resolve these issues.Perhaps I am wrong in thinking that Deputy Rabbitte said the records of detection are not  good. The records of detection in respect of murders that relate to domestic and other activities are very good, but not, admittedly, in respect of gangland murders, as I think he said. The Garda feels that the only way to deal with this problem is through specialised units, and that is where the Government is offering the most support.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Talking about reality, is it not the reality that we have had two gangland killings already this year and that two youths were abducted who are feared dead? There is little point in telling me of the rate of detection in respect of domestic violence when this is the record.Is it not also the reality that the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform promised 2,000 additional gardaí, but not one additional garda has been appointed? The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, a man who has an opinion on everything but a policy on nothing in his own area, in one of his many interviews over Christmas told us that the Minister for Finance has capped the number of gardaí at 12,500. We were not told that in this House. How does one get 12,500 when one adds 2,000 to 11,800? The Government promised the additional 2,000 gardaí and it is not only in terms of gangland violence that problem exists. It exists on the streets in terms of joyriding in communities that are besieged in their homes. No remedy is offered by the Government.The Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, went on radio and advised the nation that he went to his local Garda station to promise it additional resources. It is news to me that a Minister of State can go around advising of additional resources. Maybe when he is finished he can come to my Garda station and that of every other Member of the House to do the same. If the Government's response is to send the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to talk on "Morning Ireland" to address the situation five years after a Minister came to office beating the drum of zero tolerance, it must be the sickest, most cynical joke in Irish politics in recent years.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Deputy Rabbitte has raised three points. The abduction and detention of the young men, allied to the difficulties in Limerick, is obviously totally unacceptable in a civilised society. All the resources that are necessary to find these young men are being, and will continue to be, made available. The Army, the Garda, the air support unit, the dog unit and special units have been involved for several days. The dog unit is very important in trying to find these young men so the Deputies should not sneer at it. The only way the young men will be found at this stage, unfortunately, is with the dog unit. That is the regrettable part. Searches have proved negative so far but they are still taking place.The last Government increased the Garda numbers to the current figure of 11,900, as  Deputy Rabbitte knows. Within the Garda Training College in Templemore it is hoped to bring the Garda authorised strength up to 12,200 this year. It will not be possible to go beyond that figure this year, but the figure must be considered in light of resources as they exist within the overall framework to keep a sustainable economy and to keep people in employment.In respect of Deputy Rabbitte's question on overall crime, there is crime in other areas. The Public Order Bill, I hope, will give the Garda significant additional powers to deal with drunken, disorderly and riotous behaviour which is evident in beleaguered communities. As soon as the legislation is passed the Government will take the necessary action to try to enforce order in these areas, as we have been doing.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Why has the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, and not primarily the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and Transport, colluded in flagrant and persistent breaches of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973, which expressly prohibits weapons of destruction or munitions of war to pass through our airports without permission? Does the Taoiseach realise the anger among ordinary citizens over the blatant dishonesty of his Government in respect of the way Shannon Airport has been allowed to be used by the US military?Last night the Department of Transport admitted that, in the eight days up to Monday, 19 aircraft carrying weapons or munitions of war sought and were given permission to land at Shannon Airport. For the whole of last year, one single aircraft notified that it was carrying weapons and was given permission to land. Were the other 552 military aircraft – mainly US aircraft – that used Shannon Airport last year carrying only soggy lollipops or did the Government recklessly allow the US military to flout, persistently and with contempt, the regulations governing the transport of munitions of war through our airports?Does the Taoiseach know what weapons were carried through Shannon in those planes? He is very much in favour of inspecting the weapons or alleged weapons of destruction of the horrific dictator Saddam Hussein. Why did he not carry out an inspection of the planes using Shannon? Did a single inspection take place or is it the case that a blind eye was deliberately turned to the hundreds of aircraft which were undoubtedly carrying huge quantities of arms without permission and in breach of regulations?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The Deputy stated that one aeroplane went through last year, but my information is that 30 aircraft were given permission to carry weapons or munitions last year. I do not agree with the Deputy's assertions. The arrangements whereby Shannon is used as a refuelling stop by the US military have been in place for many years under successive Governments. As  the Deputy knows – I told him before Christmas – we do not board the aircraft of friendly countries to check precisely what is on them. There has been a working arrangement for 40 years which has operated well. The United States of America knows what the regulations are and the Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterated them some weeks ago. The airlines involved were reminded of their legal requirements and they go through a procedure which we have always followed.US military aircraft have been granted permission to land at Shannon according to the requirements of the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order, 1952, for a number of decades. It has been the practice for commercial charter aircraft carrying US servicemen between the USA and overseas bases to refuel at Shannon. Refuelling aircraft which travel all over the world constitutes about 40% of the activity at Shannon Airport. Such activity has always gone on. The regulations are set down and I do not see anything wrong with them. If a war arose, the Government would review the matter, but no additional facilities have been requested by the USA over and above the standing arrangements. If I believed the Americans were storing weapons of mass destruction at Shannon Airport and hiding them from the United Nations inspectors, I would take a different view. That is why I am very concerned about the fact that Saddam Hussein has held such weapons for many years which he has used against the people of his own country, as well as against Iranians and the Kurds whom he tortured and caused to suffer. I am sure Deputy Joe Higgins would join with me in hoping he complies fully with Dr. Hans Blix and others.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	168	It was the United Nations that gave him those weapons in the first place.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	169	He has used them against his people and all we are trying to do is get him to comply with international law. It is a good thing to help to force him into that.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	170	I am reminded of what a farmer said recently about a different member of the Government. Asking the Taoiseach a question is like trying to play handball against a haystack. You hear a dull thud and the ball does not come back to you. It goes all over the world, but it certainly does not come back to the person asking the question.I would like a specific answer from the Taoiseach. The Taoiseach knows that President Bush, the fundamentalists who surround him and his fellow fundamentalist, Prime Minister Blair, intend to attack Iraq no matter what. He should be very clear that they have made up their minds. He knows that doing so will wreak havoc on the peoples of Iraq and has nothing to do with weapons of mass destruction, but is about oil, power and influence in the world. By colluding with that, by facilitating the US military build-up, the Taoi seach will have on his hands the blood of the innocent Iraqi people who will undoubtedly be slaughtered.The Taoiseach now says that 30 aircraft passing through our airports, mainly Shannon, notified that they were carrying munitions of war and were given permission to land. The other 532 aircraft neither sought nor received permission to carry munitions of war. Will the Taoiseach tell the Dáil that those aeroplanes, whether freight or passenger craft, did not have any weapons on board or munitions designed to wreak havoc on people or property?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I am satisfied the regulations were followed.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	172	What changed last week?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	173	Due to a recent increase in the number of aircraft, the Minister reiterated the message. What might have changed is that there is a more difficult state of affairs where they are going now. The Deputy says I will not answer his first question. If Saddam Hussein changes the regulations, complies with the inspectors, international law and the UN mandate, we will not have this problem.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	174	It is not about weapons of mass destruction.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	175	We will not have this problem if he complies in a very friendly way with the inspectors who stated that he has been helpful in process but not in substance. They have urged the Security Council, the USA and the UK to hold back. If he complies with them fully, none of us will have a problem—
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	176	The Taoiseach knows what this is about.

I also refer Deputies to my reply to parliamentary questions on 18 December, reported in Volume 559, No. 6, of the Official Report.I visited Mexico from 13 to 17 January, 2003, repaying the visit to Ireland last November of its President, Mr. Vicente Fox. A business delegation involving 25 Irish companies was organised by Enterprise Ireland in association with my visit. During my meetings with the President, discussion of a wide range of issues took place including consideration of the bilateral relationship, culture, human rights issues and preparations for the summit meeting to be held during the Irish Presidency between EU and Latin American countries. The President and I will co-chair the summit which will be held in Mexico city.Throughout the visit, particular emphasis in our discussions was placed on trade issues. Mexico is now Ireland's largest trading partner in Latin America with the annual combined volume amounting to approximately €800 million. I was received at the House of Deputies by the Permanent Commission, a cross-party group representative of both Houses. Our discussions focused on economic co-operation and the forthcoming changes in the European Union. I also had the opportunity to meet privately with the leadership of the two main political parties.The principal event of the economic programme was a well attended business breakfast, hosted by Enterprise Ireland. In my address to the breakfast I stressed the opportunities for Mexican firms through investment in Ireland or co-operation with Irish companies. It also facilitated Irish companies in establishing contacts with selected potential business partners in Mexico. Software and language education enterprises were strongly represented. I had the opportunity to meet with several Irish companies of different sizes that have successfully established themselves in Mexico city and the state of Guanajuato. In addition, I met with senior executives of Bancomext to discuss the potential for Mexican investment in and trade with Ireland. Bancomext, the counterpart of Enterprise Ireland, advised me of the strong Mexican interest in Ireland evidenced by the participation of over 300 firms in a recent seminar it organised.I was delighted to meet with many friends of Ireland at a reception hosted in honour of my visit at the ambassador's residence. Although I cannot list now the many guests from all sectors, I would especially mention that I met a cross- section of the large Mexican team which will participate in the Special Olympics in June of this year. I have a strong commitment to developing the excellent relationship that Ireland enjoys with Mexico. We have much in common in our cultures and traditions and there is great scope for our businesses to work together in a complementary way. Mexico and Ireland will work together to be of mutual assistance in market access for the European Union and Latin America.The cost arising to my Department from the visit has not yet been finalised. Costs to date amount to €8,892. A number of travel and subsistence claims relating to the visit remain to be submitted. In addition, outstanding invoices in respect of hotel accommodation and other costs, will be forwarded to my Department by the Department of Foreign Affairs in due course.With regard to my plans for official visits abroad in the first half of 2003, I will visit the Czech Republic on 30 and 31 January. The visit will coincide with a trade mission organised by Enterprise Ireland. I will be accompanied by the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for trade, Deputy Michael Ahern. As part of the official programme, I will attend a working lunch hosted by the Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vladimir Spidla. The principal topics of conversation will centre on the accession of the Czech Republic to the European Union and the ongoing work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. In the afternoon, I will have the pleasure of meeting the outgoing President of the Czech Republic, Mr. Vaclav Havel. The evening will be taken up with business related events and media interviews. On Friday morning, following a call on the Chamber of Deputies of the Parliament, I will return directly to Dublin. Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, will remain on for an extra day to attend further business events.On 6 February I will visit Lisbon and will meet Prime Minister Barrosa to discuss issues of mutual concern regarding both European Union and international matters. In accordance with established practice, I expect to undertake a visit to Washington for Saint Patrick's Day. On 20 March, I will travel to Brussels to attend the social summit along with the current Greek and future Italian Presidency. The spring European Council, which will also take place in Brussels, will follow the social summit on 21 and 22 March. On 3 April, I will visit Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Schröder and Brussels for a meeting with Prime Minister Verhofstadt of Belgium. I am scheduled to attend the EU-Africa summit in Lisbon on 5 April. On 16 April, I will travel to Athens for the signature of the treaties of accession for those countries due to become full members of the European Union on 1 May 2004. On 30 May, I am due to travel to St. Petersberg for the EU-Russia summit and on 19 June I will travel to Thessolonika for the Greek Presidency European Council meeting.The President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, will visit Dublin on 26 March. His visit will provide a useful opportunity to discuss the progress being made by the convention, including the recently presented preliminary draft constitutional treaty. The first meeting this year of the National Forum on Europe took place on 14 January and a further meeting took place on 23 January. Six further meetings are scheduled for the period to March. The focus of these meetings will be the ongoing debate on the future of Europe including the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe, currently sitting in Brussels. Two of the meetings will be plenary sessions in Dublin Castle while the other four will be regional public meetings.Although there are no plans for a bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Simitis, I expect that we will be in contact as needs arise during the Greek Presidency. I had a meeting with Prime Minister Simitis at the European Council meeting in Brussels in October last and I expect to meet him next March and again during his tour of European capitals prior to the June Council in Thessolonika. I have ongoing contacts with the President of the European Commission, both at European Council and as required. The need for a bilateral meeting is kept under constant review.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	190	The grouping of 21 questions by the Taoiseach is ridiculous. Questions relevant to European Union matters should be grouped together separate from questions relating to visits to Mexico. There is to be another European Union Intergovernmental Conference out of which will emerge a further treaty of even greater importance than the Nice treaty. In view of this, how does the Taoiseach propose to keep an open and continuous dialogue with the electorate to ensure it is as properly and fully informed as possible when the times comes for it to decide on the treaty?I fully support the repeated claims for extra resources for the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the National Forum on Europe. The forum's budget has been cut by 65%, which means that only three meetings can be held outside Dublin. How does the Taoiseach propose to properly resource the facilities for the convention and the next Intergovernmental Conference to ensure that their deliberations are properly presented to and debated by the electorate so that it can as fully as possible understand the issues involved? I am sure the House would not quibble with allocating the necessary resources. Will the Taoiseach act accordingly?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I agree with Deputy Kenny on this issue which can be addressed in a number of ways. The Forum on Europe will hold at least eight meetings, at plenary and regional level, before Easter. The cost of holding regional meetings is worth it in terms of the benefit they bring.  Last year they proved to be very effective and we should continue with them.The Oireachtas will have to provide its own resources, including staff, to ensure the proper functioning of its relevant committees. I appreciate the valuable work undertaken by Oireachtas Members in this area, including at the Convention on the Future of Europe. This issue was raised with me previously and I have allocated to those working on the convention dedicated staff, including research staff and access to legal staff. Additional staff resources have also been allocated to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs. Requests for further resources are under consideration.We are also seeking to increase the number of meetings on European affairs to be addressed by Ministers. Since the start of the year three or four such meetings have been addressed by Ministers and it is my intention to continue with this process. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Agriculture and Food and I have already addressed large meetings where we have presented and explained the issues addressed by the convention. There has also been greater involvement by the media in this process.I hope we continue to attract to the Forum on Europe people of interest who are involved in the convention, including Oireachtas Members and others who can advise on the up to date position at the convention. When the convention reaches the drafting stage of a new constitution the public will become more interested, in addition to the specialists who are already closely involved. It is in our interests to keep this issue in the public domain.I appreciate the enormous work done by the Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, Deputy Gay Mitchell, and others and I hope matters will be quickly addressed as they arise. In this regard, the Department of Foreign Affairs is dealing with issues that arise on a weekly basis. This means we can keep up to date with progress. We have resolved most of the staffing difficulties although a few problems need to be resolved.

The President of the Convention on the Future of Europe, Mr. Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, is due to visit Dublin on 26 March. Will the Taoiseach consider asking him to address the House as president of the convention in which capacity he has already addressed the French National Assembly? The Taoiseach might give consideration to that.What is the Taoiseach's view with regard to Turkey? Was he disappointed with the outcome of the Copenhagen Summit which agreed that there should be a date for examination of whether Turkey had complied with the requirements for entry to the European Union, as distinct from a date for accession to negotiations?I do not wish to know whether the petrol cap fell off the jet in Mexico but it was a source of embarrassment to the country and the Taoiseach for him to be at the end of the red carpet and to have a no-show with regard to take off. On a more serious matter, arising from his observations on his Mexican visit—

In respect of the Taoiseach's observation that the cost of a hit of cocaine has now dropped to 30 cent, is he concerned about the possibility of cocaine importation to this country from Mexico by drug barons? Has he brought his concerns to the attention of his fellow prime ministers in Europe; has he issued instructions that security be tightened; and does he propose to issue further resources to drug enforcement agencies and the Garda to attempt to prevent that?

Deputy Kenny knows that some people interpreted it to mean that Turkey will definitely get a decision next time but that is not what was decided. It is very much up to Turkey how it progresses, particularly on the human rights issues that confront it. As I have said, the tactics adopted at the European Council backfired on Turkey and it will have to understand that it is not a question of pressure but of complying with the rules that everybody else has to live by. That will be a useful exercise and, as far as I can see, Turkey seems to have accepted that fully. It is now a question of whether the new Administration will implement, as it has stated, domestic human rights measures and deal with outstanding issues regarding Cyprus. We will see what happens in that regard.A report was published concerning what was happening on the streets of Mexico with regard to cocaine, and it was a topical issue. There has been a dramatic drop in the price of cocaine and  the security arrangements in the UK were very clear when I arrived back in London. There is concern there due to fears that cocaine is coming on flights directly from Mexico, and that this is having an effect on the price of cocaine in the United Kingdom. Obviously, that will have a knock-on effect and I have brought that to the attention of everyone concerned here. It is feared that this problem is coming from Mexico and Colombia. This is creating a security problem in Mexico, particularly Mexico City.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	200	In areas of Mexico, including Chiapas, the indigenous people still have serious issues with the Mexican Government in terms of institutionalised poverty and violations of civil rights, as have other sections of the Mexican people. Did the Taoiseach meet any of the organisations representing indigenous peoples or civil rights groups? Did he discuss their concerns and raise those concerns with President Fox?St. Patrick's Day is only seven weeks away. The Taoiseach has announced his intention of visiting Washington and, presumably, of being the guest of President Bush. The United States may at that time be engaged in a war in Iraq without the sanction of the United Nations Security Council, although just because Russia and China – great violators of the human rights of their own peoples – give approval for a war does not make it right. Leaving that aside, in the event of the United States and Britain going it alone, will the Taoiseach cancel his visit to Washington in protest?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	201	With regard to Mexico and civil rights issues, I agree with Deputy Higgins that many areas of the country have seen abuses. I met some of the political leaders and representatives in Parliament of the indigenous population and those who help fight their causes. A group also came to see me. My understanding is that President Fox is anxious, and is endeavouring to the best of his ability, to implement reforms – this is not just from what he said but from what others told me. However, he is meeting substantial resistance.Mexico has a presidential system where Mr. Fox is President and head of the Administration. He does not have control in Parliament and, as I quickly learned, there is still in Mexico an old regime and people in the system from previous times who are against reform. These people are working to thwart the President and this is very much the issue of concern for the summer elections, in which the President is involved. He is endeavouring to implement reforms and has done a substantial amount. However, from what I heard from other political leaders, members of the media, and human and civil rights advocates, he is unlikely to get the necessary reforms through unless there are changes in Parliament. It is a major issue.In so far as it is progressing, the reform programme is fine but I do not want to give the House the idea that the present reforms will work  fully. President Fox made it clear to me that he has not got support for many of the reforms he is trying to bring in to help the indigenous population or to stop some of the human rights abuses. As the Deputy knows, there are many security difficulties in Mexico and within the security forces, which are not totally controlled by the Administration. Strange as it seems, that is the reality of the situation.With regard to my proposed visit to Washington, I will make no change in the arrangements until I see what ultimately happens at the Security Council.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Short of the jet breaking down, I presume the Taoiseach will be going. As a matter of no great significance, but for the record, has the Cabinet decided to purchase or lease a new jet?Does the recent conversion of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to the importance of the convention mean that the Government is now resigned to whatever comes out of that convention being endorsed by the Intergovernmental Conference without significant change? Will the Taoiseach confirm that preparations are under way for the Irish Presidency and can he indicate any priorities in that area? In particular, is it intended that there will be an accession ceremony in Dublin Castle for the ten applicant states?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There is no new decision since last year when the Minister for Defence was asked to look at the various options in preparation for the Presidency, That report is awaited. There is no further decision on the question of the jet. I will say no more about it.Regarding the intergovernmental conference, I do not think Deputy Rabbitte is saying the Minister was not interested. Since last February the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Minister have put an enormous amount of effort into the Intergovernmental Conference, as have all the members. The Minister does not attend those sessions himself but there are five Foreign Ministers on the conference. Deputy Rabbitte will have seen the objections to people attending the European Parliament for only a short period and that is a contentious matter. The arrangements that have been made and the effort that has been put into this matter are immense.As time moves on it looks more likely that the Intergovernmental Conference will probably get a final document. That is certainly the intention of the chair and of the member countries. The Intergovernmental Conference is both the political and legal mechanism for dealing with the convention. Therefore, no matter how much work the convention does matters will still have to be put to the Intergovernmental Conference. At present, it is the intention that the Intergovernmental Conference will be a short one. That is not agreed by everybody. There are other elections and other votes. Principally, the Swedish  Prime Minister is very anxious not to move into the Intergovernmental Conference prior to Sweden's vote on the currency in September or October, so that discussion will be in June. I suspect that Mr. Giscard d'Estaing will be almost finished his work at the June European Council meeting but we will not know this for certain until Mr. Giscard comes here. The question then is when it will go to the Intergovernmental Conference. It is well known that Prime Minister Berlusconi is anxious to receive the Convention report quickly and to move quickly to a further treaty of Rome. That is his stated position but it is not clear if that will happen.We have been working on the Presidency for some months and I believe a ceremony will be organised. A number of discussions are going on regarding what will happen on the May weekend. No decision has been made on that yet but active discussions have been going on since the start of the year.At this stage I begin to take up the agenda from the Troika meeting in two months time at the Social Affairs Council meeting. I am anxious to tidy the arrangements around the spring session to try to have social issues discussed at that spring session so that it is not just an economic discussion. The full social agenda of Europe, which can get sidelined at European Council meetings, should move in as part of the plan for Europe to become the strongest and most innovative economy in the world by 2010. I have started discussions and I will formally join the Troika for March in order to start driving that agenda. I have made my views known on this matter. Otherwise I fear that the other European Councils will centre around justice and home affairs and international issues and that the social issues will be pressed off the agenda. That is an issue I am anxious to pursue during the Irish Presidency.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Regarding the historic enlargement of the EU to 25 states, I understand from what the Taoiseach has said that the Government supports the concept of referendums in all the EU member states on an EU constitution. A conference in Sweden last November considered the possibility of a Europe-wide referendum on the outcome of the Convention on Europe. This concept was also promoted at the convention by my colleague, Deputy Gormley. Has the Government considered that matter and will it be given the active support of the Government internationally?In relation to the Copenhagen summit and the agreement to take over the NATO military mission in the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, will Ireland participate in this mission? If so, what moneys will Ireland contribute to the mission? Am I right in thinking that the EU budget cannot be used for such a military operation and that the cost must be borne by member states? Will the mission be UN mandated?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	205	It will be a matter for every member state to decide on its own referendum process. I do not think there will be a change from that. Deputy Gormley has raised these issues and Deputy Sargent has seen the replies of Germany and other member states that they have their own referendum processes which they will maintain. We may regard these processes as limited but that is their legal position. In many countries unless the competencies of the European Union were to be extended dramatically – in Germany, for example, if the Lander were being reconstructed by something Europe was trying to do – there would not be grounds for a referendum. That is not likely to happen.Deputy Sargent should raise his second question with the Minister for Foreign Affairs. This question came up in the foreign affairs section of the European Council. The Deputy is correct regarding the budgetary aspect of the matter. However, I was not party to those discussions and I would not like to give Deputy Sargent wrong information.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Does the Taoiseach know if Irish money is to be used?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I cannot say that.

Any increase in trade between our two countries that would be beneficial to the people of both countries is something we would all welcome. Is the Taoiseach aware of the aquiladora industry in Mexico where multi-national corporations are allowed to employ Mexican workers in low wage sweatshop conditions, specifically in the area adjacent to the US border where special supports are in place in order to attract such industry? Given that health and safety standards in these jobs are questionable and that concern about them has been expressed in Mexico itself, will the Taoiseach ensure that trade with Mexico will be based on ethically approved working conditions and that imports to Ireland will not be of goods produced by exploitative employment practices?I heard the Taoiseach's earlier response regarding indigenous peoples in Mexico. In speaking with President Fox did he raise the current peace process in the Chiapas region and the need for justice and peace for the indigenous people of that area?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	209	On the issue of working conditions, nobody would want to see us doing business on the backs of people who have been badly treated. I was not made aware of that. I want to follow the ILO conventions the same as everybody else. Workers in Mexico are paid low wages and the minimum wage per week is $8. A good industrial worker would receive $10,000 per year, while a top class technical person or experienced  person would probably get $30,000. The salaries are low. So far as hardships or discrimination against people is concerned, we would not condone that in any way. The Irish companies there are noted for paying their workers better and providing better facilities for them than most of the traditional industries. They set their own example. When I visited the parliament, both Government and Opposition Deputies were appreciative and aware of the Irish companies and had been invited to and engaged with Irish companies in their regions. Our track record on any exports or imports holds up.To reply to Deputy Ó Caoláin, I did not go into any particular region. I had been briefed in advance by civil rights and human rights groups here and spoke on those issues as I said earlier. Just to reiterate, in my discussions with Mr. Fox last autumn and my discussions with him this time, he is determined to do all he can to help individuals and the indigenous populations in every way possible. That was part of his electoral platform. He has already been credited for having done much in this area. However, he accepts that he needs to get reform packages through which, for one reason or another, he has not been able to do. I think Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me a third question.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	211	May I ask the Taoiseach a few more questions arising from his long replies? The EU-Latin American summit is to be chaired by Mexico in 2004 during Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. Given that it is obvious that South America, as an economic entity, holds massive potential in terms of trade and given Ireland's strengthening special relationship with Mexico, are there any specific proposals to avail of that opportunity to bring further trade delegations to South America in general or to countries close to Mexico? Having had the privilege of bringing a number of trade delegations to countries outside the European Union, they pay enormous dividends. Is the Government activity promoting that in the context of the serious competitive nature of Irish business and the difficulties Irish business faces in terms of exports, fluctuations of currency and labour costs in other countries and so on? Has the Government a pro-active programme for international trade missions?Can the Taoiseach confirm if there will be a referendum following the next Intergovernmental Conference and, if so, what is the timescale? We discussed this matter previously. Prime Minister Berlusconi wanted it at the end of his Presidency but that is not possible. Is there a more up-to-date view as to when it might be necessary to ask the people to vote on the outcome of that Intergovernmental Conference?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	212	To reply to the Deputy's first question, because Mexico is part of NAFTA, which is an enormous bloc, business people clearly see a special relationship with the United States and the other countries in the region and recognise there are very good opportunities for them. Many small Irish companies as well as the big Irish companies such as Smurfit, Kerry, Vision and Altech employ an enormous number of people. There are many small service, education, technical and software companies involved and they see enormous opportunities. Bancomext sees it the other way round, it sees a means of trading into Europe. Mr. Fox, who is of Irish descent and proud of it, is doing all he can through the system to encourage trade into Europe. He spent some time visiting many European countries and will be back in the Netherlands and Germany next week.Mexico has centred much of the administration around a bloc of about 300 million people. Therefore, trade delegations are beneficial and we are trying as much as possible with Enterprise Ireland to build up trade delegations, to make them useful and meaningful because they are time consuming. They are costly to the individual companies but as the Deputy has said there is a different attitude to how trade delegations work in other countries. If one is coming to this country with a trade delegation one would probably be suspicious but abroad the opposite happens, everyone opens every door. That is how it operates in a different culture. Perhaps we should change to theirs in 20 or 30 years' time.There is no real decision on the referendum yet. It would be difficult to see a convention completed without a referendum. As far as a timescale is concerned, it is a long way off.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	214	Has any consideration been given by the heads of government at EU level under the current Presidency to meet to consider the Iraqi situation and would the Taoiseach consider requesting that such a meeting take place so that a common position could be worked out at EU level?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I wish to raise two issues. The Joint Committee on European Affairs and its sub-committee have taken to the boards running which I hope will have some impact when it comes to the referendum in due course. Does the Taoiseach see any merit in the suggestion, which the committee and the forum backed, to run a European week each year? Would he see merit in the Government, through the Minister for Foreign Affairs or the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, the forum and the European affairs committee getting together to try to organise such a week? Would the Taoiseach consider attending at the committee, per haps twice a year, in advance of the main EU summits? I know the Taoiseach has a huge workload and I do not wish to add to it but when the time comes for the referendum and putting the case to the people, the more we can show that we have been proactive in doing the business of the European Union, the more we would have the opportunity to be successful.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	216	When I asked earlier about the Copenhagen Summit I wanted to know if the Taoiseach was aware if any Irish money is to be used in the EU mission in regard to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I am not sure if the Taoiseach is aware of that but perhaps he will find out; I thought he would be aware as he is interested in fiscal matters. In relation to the visit to Mexico I am pleased to hear he raised the problem of cheap cocaine supplies coming from Mexico and flooding into Europe. Has any plan of action been agreed with Mexico to address that problem and, if so, what is it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	217	On the Iraqi situation, the matter is being dealt with at European level by the General Affairs Council. There is almost daily contact according to the briefs I am receiving. I am not sure when the next meeting will take place. It will not be at heads of state level but at European foreign Ministers level. There will certainly be a meeting and the Minister will refer to that this evening. On the European affairs issue, as Deputy Mitchell is aware I have attended meetings previously and I am prepared to be helpful in every way.As regards the Mexican situation and drugs, there is obviously co-operation at European level, particularly with the United Kingdom, because of the access. There is huge oversupply in Columbia, Brazil, Mexico and Peru. I am not sure why it has happened this year more than in any other year. It was a big issue when I was in Mexico and I spoke to some of the security people with me. The concern is that those involved will look for more lucrative markets in Europe. It is being dealt with at European level. I made people aware that since December, it has been highlighted through the European justice and home affairs areas. It is a big problem. Apparently, there is also a considerable amount of drugs coming into Europe from other areas. It will be a problem in the year ahead and I am sure the Deputy has seen some of the reports about the price of cocaine on the streets being significantly reduced. Apparently, this is the reason. The real issue is whether we will be able to thwart the main gangs behind this trade – international gangs across the world – which have not been thwarted for some years and have been building up this trade. As far as I know, there was no money but I will clarify it for the Deputy.

Breen – if the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is happy with the resources deployed by Clare County Council and the EPA in tracking down the odour that is currently affecting the Shannon region of County Clare and if the Minister could update the House on the current position and if he could assure people that there is no health hazard; and (11) Deputy Sargent – that the Minister for Agriculture and Food outline the integral role being played by Mellows Agricultural College in enabling the recommendations of the organic development committee to be implemented and that the threat of closure to the college be lifted through ensuring adequate funding and a serious Government commitment to the growth in conversion to organise methods in Ireland.The matters raised by Deputies Connaughton, Callanan, Ó Caoláin and Neville have been selected for discussion.

#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil on a specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent consideration, namely, the terms of agreement between the church and the Government which put a ceiling of €100 million on the amount the church would have to pay in compensation to minors sexually assaulted while resident in its care. The Government failed to research the compensation levels which could be paid by the church and, at this stage, it, rather than the taxpayer must clear this up. We propose that these terms be re-examined and the amount payable by the church be open-ended in keeping with the unknown number of cases and the unknown levels of compensation which may be payable to victims.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The Order of Business is as follows: No. 13, motion re ministerial rota for parliamentary questions; No. 14, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of a Council directive on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of effort between member states receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof; No. 15, motion re referral to joint committee of proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the State Examinations Commission (Establishment) Order 2003; and No. 21, statements on the commencement of the Dáil. It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) Nos. 13, 14 and 15 shall be decided without debate; (2) the proceedings on No. 21 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 7 p.m. and the following arrangements shall apply: (i) the statements of the Government Chief Whip, the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and the Technical Group, who shall be called upon in that order, shall not exceed 15 minutes in each case; (ii) the statement of each other  Member called upon shall not exceed ten minutes in each case; (iii) Members may share time; and (iv) the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism shall be called upon to make a statement in reply which shall not exceed ten minutes. (3) Private Members' Business which shall be No. 35 – motion re: Iraq, shall also take place tomorrow immediately after the Order of Business and shall be brought to a conclusion after 90 minutes.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. 13, 14 and 15, without debate, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I do not wish to object to the Order of Business, but I would like confirmation from the Taoiseach that, depending on the circumstances that arise from the Iraqi situation, he will give me an assurance that the House will have a formal debate with an opportunity for questions to members of the Cabinet. I know the matter will be discussed in Private Members' time this evening but there is no opportunity for Deputies from any side of the House to ask questions. Perhaps the Taoiseach will give me that assurance. I know it is close to the line, a Cheann Comhairle, but you will not mind on this occasion.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I support that request to the Taoiseach. It is unconscionable that we have had no opportunity to discuss this issue in the House. The Taoiseach knows very well that a series of statements on Private Members' Business will not deal with the matter. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should attend the House to take questions at the end of the debate.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I agree with the matter raised by the party leaders who have just spoken. Article 28.3 of the Constitution makes it obligatory on this House to debate the Iraqi crisis.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am sorry, Deputy, but you are out of order because your comments do not concern the issues we are debating.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I realise the issues we are debating are very important but they will pale when it comes to the devastation caused by the Iraqi crisis and Ireland's complicit involvement. I would ask the Government to give time for such a debate and not to depend on private Members' time, which is inadequate for that.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I object to the Order of Business as presented because there has been no Whips' meeting prior to the construction of the Order Paper for today's business. It is unsatisfactory for the Government merely to land an Order Paper on all parties and Members of the House without any prior consultation. I join other opposition party leaders in making a direct request to the Taoiseach to ensure that the House will be afforded the opportunity substantively to address the issue of the impending war in Iraq and his Government's role in facilitating the  intent of the United States in relation to the presentation of its armed might within the area.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Are you opposing the Order of Business?

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	245	That does not arise under Nos. 13, 14 and 15. Does the Deputy oppose Nos. 13, 14 and 15 being taken without debate?
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	246	I oppose the Order of Business for reasons that I have indicated.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Right, I will put the question.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	248	On a point of order, a number of party leaders have raised questions and maybe a reply from the Taoiseach would have an effect on their attitude to these three issues.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	249	To reiterate what I said earlier during Leaders' Questions, if the situation comes about one way or the other – whether it is an agreed position by the Security Council, or not – then the House will have to address it with a full debate.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 21 – Statements on the Commencement of the Dáil – agreed to?
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	251	My party will oppose this proposal. Before the Christmas recess we sought the traditional Adjournment debate for which two days have customarily been allowed. This notion of a commencement debate was presented as an innovation, yet it ends up that we are being presented with a schedule for today that provides for less than two hours, even given all the matters that have happened since the House was last in session, including major issues that have already been raised here this evening. Will the Taoiseach agree to permit this debate to continue for at least a further two hours tomorrow? We now have to start the Order of Business and there will be little more than one hour for a commencement debate. In addition, I notice that this so-called innovation, which will be sold to the media as a major breakthrough in Dáil reform, is being introduced by the Chief Whip. I have the highest regard for the Chief Whip, but I am amazed that the Taoiseach is not taking the debate himself. If the Taoiseach was serious about the issues that now confront us, he would introduce the debate. Instead of that, the ball is being passed to the Chief Whip and we will have a string of jokes at the end from the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, which were probably written for him in the Bar Library. That  is not acceptable, a Cheann Comhairle, so I am asking the Taoiseach to provide additional time tomorrow, rather than calling a vote.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	252	In the ordinary course of events, the concept of statements at the commencement of the Dáil would be a natural formality. However, in circumstances where we are facing into an international crisis it shows that the Government is not taking the situation, or the Constitution, seriously. The Order of Business should be reviewed in light of the fact that the Government is complicit in participating in preparations for war against the terms of the Constitution. We need a debate in the House on that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	253	That certainly does not arise under this item and we have already discussed the matter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	254	It does because it is referred to in the item.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	255	In reply to Deputy Rabbitte, this is purely an initiative to put the legislative programme for the session on the record and to outline some of the details behind that programme. The Chief Whip, on behalf of the Government, monitors the legislative programme through the various Departments and drafting agencies. It does not purport to be a major debate and I would ask the Deputy to accept that.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	256	That puts the Chief Whip in her place, anyway.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	257	There may be a more extensive debate on a range of matters or we could deal with them by individual debates, if the Deputy so wishes. I thought it was a good initiative to outline the legislative programme rather than just sending out a press release.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	258	If the Taoiseach asks the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, he will tell him what the intention was.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The proposed debate does not purport to deal with all the issues that have arisen in recent months. It affords the House a short period to outline the legislation as well as clarifying some of the issues that arise every day about the legislative programme.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Iraq is not mentioned.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I am bound to say that was not the understanding on this side of the House. The notion of an Adjournment debate was to review the end of the parliamentary session. The notion, as communicated to me, was that while the Government would not permit an Adjournment debate, it was bringing in this innovation to allow the House to debate national and international issues, some of which have been raised here this  evening. We are now being told that this initiative is being taken rather than the customary press conference that has probably taken place outside already in order to keep the Government's 75 spin doctors busy. It has now been reduced to the status of the Chief Whip telling the House what is in the legislative schedule which we have already received in writing. That was not our intention, Sir. If the Taoiseach is not amenable to providing for that kind of debate, then we will oppose the Order of Business.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	262	Is the proposal for dealing with tomorrow's Private Members' Business agreed? Agreed.

Will the Taoiseach allow time for a discussion on No. 48 on the Order Paper so that we can debate the important Fischler proposals which have been put into the public domain in recent weeks?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The veterinary medicines Bill will replace and update existing legislation regarding professional and related activities. The heads of the Bill have been approved. The Bill is currently being drafted and is expected in the middle of this year.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Deputy can take that matter up with the Whips.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	269	There are three Bills listed for publication in this session, by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government. I am delighted the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill is one of them.Which Bill will receive the greatest priority from the Government in this session and which one will come before the House first?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	270	The Bills in question are the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill; the Local Government Bill and the Protection of the Environment Bill. A great deal of effort is being put into drafting the Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill. The Environmental Protection Agency Bill will be introduced in the Seanad next week.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	271	Which Bill will receive priority from the Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	272	They are all important. The Environmental Protection Agency Bill will be taken in the Seanad next week. The Housing (Private Rented Sector) Bill has not yet been completed. We are anxious to have that Bill enacted over the next couple of months.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	273	When will it be published?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	276	It will be published as soon as it is ready.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I know that. We are obviously fairly close to that now.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	278	In fairness to the Deputy, it will take another couple of weeks to complete. We hope to have it enacted this session.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	279	On a point of order, what is the answer to the question? Which of the three Bills will come before the House first?

The Health and Social Care (Professionals) Regulatory Bill is earmarked to allegedly provide for the statutory registration of health and social care professionals for the purpose of ensuring a quality service for the public. When will that Bill be presented and will it address the disgraceful situation where consultants are, in many ways, dictating the configuration of the health service and the Minister will not address them?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Deputy must ask a question on promised legislation

Can we expect legislation regarding the Commission to review constituencies? Will that be done by way of legis lation or regulation and can we expect a decision on that shortly? In other words will we see legislation on the boundaries commission?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	287	On the Dáil boundaries?
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	288	When will we see legislation to ban the dual mandate?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Not until the census reports are finished. I do not know when, perhaps some time in the summer.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	295	My question relates to legislation already passed by this House. I do not know if this has happened before. With the help of the Opposition, the Minister for Health and Children was able to put through legislation dealing with tobacco advertisements and promotions. He has now been put in the position, because he has failed to comply with an EU directive on transparency, where he has to re-introduce this legislation or part of it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	296	A question please or I will have to move on to Deputy Boyle.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	297	There is no indication in the programme of legislation with which we have been presented as to when the Minister intends re-introducing this legislation which was already passed by this House. It is due to the incompetence of the Minister for Health and Children this legislation must be re-introduced.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	298	I do not have a date for the re-introduction of that Bill. I suggest, if what the Deputy says is correct, that she table a question to the Minister for Health and Children in that regard.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	299	Will any sense of urgency be attached to the water services Bill in light of the continuing failure of group water and sewerage schemes to fulfil European Union directives?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	300	The Heads of the Bill, which is to consolidate and update water services legis lation, have been approved and will be introduced mid-year.

Does that mean the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív will not introduce legislation until that time?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	302	Public consultation is envisaged prior to the preparation of the draft heads for the Charities Bill. A target date for drafting of that legislation will not be set until the consultation process has been completed, which will take about two years.

Arising from the published statement by the Minister for Education and Science that none of the 12 school programmes in north Kildare will be moved forward in 2003, is there a legislative proposal in the list published to reverse the situation in north Kildare so that I might be able to take some credit for getting it reversed if not brought forward?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Tá áthas orm tús a chur leis an díospóireacht seo, nuair atáimid at tosú seisiúin nua sa Dáil and bliain nua freisin. Ar dtús, I acknowledge your impartiality, a Cheann Comhairle, as Chair of the House. My position as Chief Whip means I spend a considerable amount of time here. It is an education few people get to share. It is also an education in parliamentary skills. I would like to pay tribute at the beginning of this session to the impartiality in judgment and fairness that you, a Cheann Comhairle, and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle exercise during debates here.Our role as a parliamentary democracy is one which is very important to us and the people of this country because the right to free political  expression has strong resonance in our history. It is a right that countless generations of past patriot have fought for. We are privileged to live in a generation where it is a central tenet of our democracy. The freedom we have as elected representatives to plan, implement and debate here in the Dáil the policies intended to safeguard and transform our nation is one that should never be taken for granted.Our national Parliament is a concourse of ideas, the stage of our national debate and the corporeal expression of the national will. What we do in this House, indeed what we are doing now, is an important and timely initiative in offering Members of the House a chance to take stock of what has been achieved, to review progress and set out our legislative priorities for the session ahead. This commencement debate will give us all a platform to debate the direction of Government, to place our views on record and to put forward suggestions in a constructive fashion. It is a new initiative which I believe can be built on and developed over the coming sessions.The task of Government is about getting the job done. Our task is to implement the key pledges on which every Member on this side of the House was elected when the Irish people renewed and strengthened the mandate of the Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Our policy platform has been endorsed as a blueprint for our future.The mandate of the sovereign people is a great honour. It brings with it a great responsibility for public service. An Agreed Programme for Government sets out what we want to achieve. It is not an à la carte menu. It is not something we can just dip in and out of as taste or appetite might dictate. The Government is keenly aware of our solemn obligation to the people of Ireland to implement the programme in its entirety. The legislative agenda I set out today builds on what we have accomplished as a Government since the Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern, formed his first Administration in 1997.Over the past five and a half years, the social and economic policies generated by the Government have been responsible for the creation of 380,000 new jobs, the highest minimum wage in Europe, over 90% of which is entirely free from tax, almost 420,000 removed from the tax net, a cut in long-term unemployment by 80%, the most generous social welfare improvements since the establishment of the welfare state with minimum rates of payments up by 43%, record increases in pensions, with the old age contributory pensions up by 60%. The monthly rate of child benefit trebled; the Government introduced €5 billion in personal tax reductions, weighted heavily in favour of the less well-off; there was a 147% increase in health spending and a 77% increase in education spending. These are just the highlights, but the list could go on and on. We do not have reason to be complacent, but we can take a justified pride in our country's progress since 1997. We see our achievements to date as a foundation  on which to build even more ambitiously for the future. In the six months since the formation of the current Government, it has continued to work steadily, building on what has already been achieved.In implementing the commitments of An Agreed Programme for Government, the Government is progressing the most ambitious legislative agenda in the history of the State. The programme sets out a strong framework for all major aspects of Government activity. It is divided into five major parts and contains 477 specific pledges. Since the Government took office on 6 June 2002, 18 Bills have been published, 12 Bills have been enacted into law and 34 Bills are currently before the Oireachtas. It is anticipated that a further 17 Bills will be published in the life of the current Dáil session. Every Member has received a copy of the Government's legislative programme and the schedule for progression.The State has its roots in the republican ethos of cherishing all the children of the nation equally. At the heart of An Agreed Programme for Government is a commitment to people with disabilities. The Government is committed to building service provision and legislative frameworks which enable people with disabilities to fulfil their potential. In particular, the Government is resolved to meet the special education needs of every child.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The Minister of State can actually keep a straight face.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	347	It is the Government's firm belief that a person with a disability has the same right as a person who does not have a disability to avail of and benefit from education.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	348	Was the Minister of State in the Mansion House yesterday?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	349	The Government will publish a Bill relating to the education of persons with disabilities in this session, following an extensive consultation process. The guiding principle of the Bill is to provide the statutory framework within which the education of children and those who have special educational needs because of disability can be guaranteed as of right. The Bill will also establish a national council for education which will have wide-ranging functions in the area of planning, assessment, service delivery and research and policy development.Adequate housing is central to the health and well-being of families and communities. The Government's record in the housing sector since 1997 is unparalleled.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The Minister of State is right about that.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The year 2002 was another record year for new housing output, surpassing the previous year's record of almost 53,000.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	352	The Government has broken all records.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	353	In line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government, we will continue to implement a multi-stranded approach to addressing housing needs across the spectrum. We will work not only to improve the quantity and quality of houses but to provide a range of housing solutions to meet the needs of tenants. We will publish a Bill in this session containing a full package of reforms in the private rented accommodation sector, arising from the report of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. The key objective of the Bill will be to move towards achieving a better managed and more professional sector, with improved security of tenure for tenants and greater certainty for both landlords and tenants.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	354	That is a laugh.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Among the measures included in this comprehensive legislation are the establishment of a private residential tenancies board on a statutory basis, to resolve disputes arising in the sector; improved security of tenure for tenants and graduated notice to quit periods, as recommended by the commission; and rent levels to be no greater than the market rate and reviews generally no more frequently than once a year.As pledged in the programme for Government, a Bill dealing with the proceeds of corruption will be introduced, modelled on the proceeds of crime legislation, to further target white collar crime and corruption. A corruption assets bureau will also be established under the legislation. It is hoped that the Bill will be published in the current session. It will ensure that assets acquired through corruption, or the value of which was enhanced by it, can be frozen by the High Court and ultimately seized by the State. The Bill will ensure that we can tackle white collar crime in the same manner as we have tackled other crime through the Criminal Assets Bureau.Other legislation that will be published in this session and which will fulfil the promises made in An Agreed Programme for Government include an employment permits Bill, which will provide for a comprehensive, transparent and sound statutory footing in this sphere; a protection of employees (fixed-term contracts) Bill, which will improve employment protection for fixed term contract workers; a local government Bill, which will provide for the abolition of the dual mandate and continue the process of local government reform; and an Abbotstown sports centre authority Bill, which will establish a sports centre authority for the development and management of the Abbotstown project.This session will also see the introduction into the House of the Finance and Social Welfare Bills, which give effect to the budget day decisions. While not without some pain, the budget was fair and progressive and looks after  those who are less well-off. It strikes the right balance between social protection for today's people and today's needs and investment to underpin and secure our economic prospects into the future. In particular, I draw the attention of Deputies to the €10 increase for pensioners; the €8 and €10 increases in child benefit; the €7 increase for widows and widowers under the age of 66, carers and those on the invalidity pension under the age of 65; and the special €11 per week increase for widows and widowers aged 66 and over on a contributory pension.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The budget also allowed for an increase of €100 in the respite care grant, an increase in income disregards for carer's allowance and an increase of €140 in the employee PAYE credit. I look forward to hearing Labour and Fine Gael Deputies explain why they will vote against the provisions I have mentioned, which are far more generous than anything they delivered while in Government. I also look forward to the Deputies opposite addressing their erroneous forecasts in relation to the public finances. During the last session of the Dáil, we heard much hyperbole from the doom and gloom brigade on the Opposition benches.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Last year was not a vintage one in economic terms. As Ireland is one of the most globalised economies in the world, our economy slowed down as the world economy slowed down. Our real difficulties must be put in perspective – we continue to outpace most of our competitors. While difficulties undoubtedly exist, these are far from the worst of times. The Government is charting the country through difficult circumstances with skill and resolve. It is the Opposition's luxury to have a problem for every solution, but the Government's duty is to achieve real and steady progress. We are doing just that in a way that is economically sustainable for Ireland in the long-term. During this session of the Dáil, we will maintain our unwavering commitment to prudent spending, responsible fiscal policies, debt reduction and fair and competitive taxes.

Ireland needs to be poised to take best advantage of the inevitable upturn when it comes. Social partnership is a central part of our preparation for the future. We have every reason to remain confident about this country's prospects, as per capita GDP surpasses the European average, the national debt is the second lowest in the EU and the employment rate compares favourably to our EU partners. These achievements have been built on the foundations of social partnership. We have kept our discipline for more than 15 years through national agreements.

It is the best way forward for the country as it involves a collective effort. The country has been transformed by social partnership and that process will continue. Great credit is due to the Taoiseach, officials, the social partners and others who have continued to make great efforts in this regard at a time when the plenary session of this House was adjourned.A positive development in Northern Ireland is the Government's great political goal in the coming weeks. I know that it is an important priority for the Taoiseach. In recent weeks and months the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs have been working intensively with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, to bring stability to the political process and consolidate the Good Friday Agreement. Naturally, the happenings there will have a bearing on the debates that take place during this session.This is also the case with issues of international peace and security. Ireland has a well-earned reputation as a peace-loving nation and this Government views it as important that we continue to contribute solutions to global problems and play an active role in promoting peace, democracy and human rights in the world. Our  Ireland Aid programme will play a full part in countering the growing global divide between rich and poor and help tackle poverty, inequality and exclusion. We discussed earlier, and will discuss again later, the prospect of war. While it is a huge concern, the war is not inevitable and we have a role to play in making every effort to avoid hostilities. The Government will continue the work it began in the past two years on the UN Security Council to promote peace.We believe Security Council Resolution 1441 represents a road map to a peaceful settlement. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has consistently made it clear that the Government's position is based on the conviction that all who believe in an international order based on justice and law have to stand up for the authority of the Security Council and for compliance with the decisions it takes, and with the resolutions it adopts on behalf of the UN members. In the period ahead there will undoubtedly be much debate and many developments. In this House we will continue to monitor changing and unfolding events and will be open and flexible to having debates and to allocating time for Members to air their views on the international situation should the need arise.As we embark on a new Dáil session, it is fair to say that all of us in this Chamber have an onerous responsibility. We were elected to do a job and to take responsibility for shaping the Ireland we want for ourselves, our communities and future generations. We are an island nation, small in size, with fewer than five million in population, but huge in history and potential for the future. That potential is at last being realised. As Members of Dáil Éireann, we are at the centre of change in our country. We are called upon to mediate the competing aspirations and demands of our community. Our challenge is to shape the aspirations of our people into a credible plan for our future. I am especially proud to be a member of a Government that is making a difference in the daily lives of Irish families and communities. The vision of the Government is to build a fair society on an island at peace with itself. The work of this Dáil session will be driven towards reaching this objective because, as we have set out, this is our ambition for our country, this is our mandate from the people, and this is our pledge.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I have the utmost admiration for the Minister of State opposite and I know she is a serious-minded person, but I sympathise with her for having to come into the House and deliver that oration, knowing in her heart that it is not serious, that it does not address the issues, that it is not even aspirational, let alone inspirational. It is not her fault, but the one Bill that is missing from the current proposals is one that would ensure access for the public to the services, supposedly provided by the State, that they are now denied. We could go through a whole list of these. One thing the Government achieved was winning the general election. The slogan was "A lot done, more to do."  That could now be changed to "Damage done, worse to come" because things have got completely out of hand.Let us look at access to services. Remember that we have had five years of unprecedented growth, development and wealth creation. At the end of that, we are seeing a curtailment of services in virtually every Department, some of which seem to have disappeared altogether, and it now appears that the Government is preparing for the next election by cutting off finances in every direction so that it can release them in four or five years' time. That used to be the practice of Fianna Fáil in the past, but we had moved away from that. There was general recognition among all the parties in the House that it was necessary to have some continuity and consistency and that it was better for the economy to be that way.There is a crisis in education. It encompasses the size of classes at both primary and secondary level, the degree to which children with special needs can gain access to education, notwithstanding what the Minister said about a second attempt at a disabilities Bill, and school accommodation. Travelling through my constituency the other day, I saw two trucks carrying prefabs for a school, which is about all they will get for the next four years. It is clear that the Government is saving up for the next general election. All the schools, of which I am aware, to which Deputy Stagg referred will either receive nothing or be fobbed off with various developmental stages over the next three to four years. The Minister has no intention of providing anything for them.A crisis exists in agriculture and there is no plan for the short, medium or long-term. The Minister goes to Brussels and opposes everything, and then we hobble on to the next crisis and the ones after that. There is no forward planning, nothing in anticipation of the WTO or the competition that will arise from that, and disaster will be the consequence. That is why the agricultural community is protesting. Its members are uneasy about the future and do not know what it holds because the Minister has not made any plans.Let us look at what has happened in the fisheries industry. I had to laugh at Christmas when I saw a Minister of State from Donegal coming forward to speak out on behalf of the fishermen and their families. It is up to the Government to deal with it, notwithstanding the fact that the CFP has proceeded in a particular direction. It is within the remit of the Government to seek to improve matters and to pursue these issues with our European counterparts in an effort to protect the interests of our citizens.I cannot understand why the Minister referred to housing. Last week I experienced something I had never experienced before in my political lifetime. I had to ring the Garda to see if it would arrest a person on some pretext or other because he had nowhere else to go. He is a single male, of a certain age, on the street at night with no place to go, no hostel or rented accommodation. There is no town, city or village at present that  does not have homeless people. There are more homeless people in the city of Dublin than there are in the city of London, which has ten times the population of our capital city. I cannot understand what has gone wrong. The Minister mentioned legislation dealing with private rented accommodation. What will that do about providing extra houses? Nothing. The market dictates everything. Once a year is enough for rents to go up because they will go up enough to create the same problem that exists at present.I cannot understand how anybody, or any Government, can claim credit after five years for the awful housing situation, not only for applicants for local authority houses but for first-time buyers. Not only are our houses the most expensive in western Europe but we have some of the most expensive in the world. That has never been known anywhere. I do not know what is happening. I cannot understand why the Government does not recognise this. Tax incentives and breaks have been created for people to build houses, but no effort has been made to ensure that they were ultimately available to first-time buyers. That is the snag in all the legislation, and that should be obvious to the Government. In the current market, investors are buying houses as soon as they are built and they are then let at high rents. The people who need homes, including those on middle income, will never get them. People travel 60, 70 or 80 miles a day from Longford and further afield to my constituency and this city because they cannot afford a house anywhere else.An access to services Bill in the area of health services would be a great advantage to consumers. Never has more money been hurled, or intervention made, by a Government for any service than by this one on health. The reform of the Eastern Health Board just two years ago introduced a huge number of administrators who were given new jobs. This was supposed to help the delivery of health services but those services have instead become more remote from the people, more expensive and ultimately non-existent. Anyone who has experienced access to hospitals at first hand must have come to the conclusion that the service was better and more efficient 25 years ago and I cannot understand why the Government has been unable to recognise this. We now export patients to Northern Ireland, the UK and France, yet we are supposed to be providing our own health service. It is falling down around the Government. Much has been done but I am concerned about what will be done because, to date, nothing has happened. What is particularly problematic is that this comes, not after five years of zero growth, deprivation or poverty, but after five years of unprecedented growth and wealth.The Government has spoken about waste management and the protection of the environment for some years but it has done nothing. In this context, we have heard much talk about flooding  and drainage, yet nothing has been done in terms of proposed legislation. We hear about the alleviation of pollution, yet grants that might have helped have been withdrawn.I cannot understand the extent to which the rule of law has broken down under the management of this Government over the past five years. The homicide rate is now on a par with that of New York. Ten years ago, the rate of homicides in New York was about six or seven times that in Ireland but, this year, we may well overtake New York in the rates of unlawful killing. Last year, 82 people were killed in New York; we are rapidly approaching that figure now in Ireland and may well exceed it. Hardly a night passes without a fatal shooting, stabbing or beating somewhere in the country. People are afraid to leave their homes and youngsters are afraid to go out at night to socialise. The Minister and his predecessor have been in office for five and a half years and have looked Caesar-like at what is happening around them without making any concrete suggestions about how to deal with it.The saddest part is that the Minister of State – for whom I have the greatest sympathy – is forced to come into the House and read out a list of so-called achievements on her colleagues' behalf. I know she is a compassionate person and did this out of compassion but I can assure her that their record is deplorable. In the history of the State, there has never been a group of people in Government who managed to talk so much for so long, have so much money at their disposal, make so many promises of a wild and expansive nature but deliver so little at the end. I have no doubt that the intention is to run to the next general election and save as much money as possible. They will cut health services and spending in justice and housing and will go to the country again with those savings. The mothers of Ireland will receive arrears in a lump sum in the middle of the election campaign and there will not be a sports ground in the country that will not receive a grant in excess of €1 million or more.The Government has expressed its annoyance at certain things – the Taoiseach was humiliated recently when the Government jet would not start. Imagine the humiliation when Mr. Blair and the German Chancellor took off in their sleek machines at the first attempt while the Irish delegation had to jump start the jet or, worse still, the Taoiseach had to take an ordinary commercial flight and leave it to the lads to push the jet.

I am glad to see the Government is to purchase another faster, sleeker jet and that, when abroad, the Irish delegation will never again be humiliated as they have been by having to slum it with the rest of the populace.A lot of damage done and worse to come. I hope that, by the time of the next general election, the outgoing Government does not attempt to repeat the performance of the past five and a half years because on this occasion, the members of the public will be ready. If they are not it will be our fault. I wish the Minister of State well. I assure her that she will get plenty of constructive opposition from Fine Gael and the other Opposition parties but we will prosecute the Government and hold it accountable. We will do so regularly because that is our job and I hope the public will come to recognise that what we have been saying is true and that the only people who pay in the end are the consumers – the people of Ireland.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	375	In this commencement debate of a new parliamentary session and in this new calendar year, the Taoiseach ought to commit to requiring the Dáil to sit for a duration more in line with other parliaments. During his tenure as Taoiseach, Deputy Ahern has contrived for the Dáil to sit for the minimum periods possible and the number of sitting days for 2002 was especially lamentable. The tradition of returning towards the last days of January derives from when the budget was published at the end of January. What is the excuse for continuing as if the budget day had not changed? The schedule of Dáil sittings is fixed by the Government, not by the Whips or the Opposition. The Taoiseach would prefer that the Dáil not meet at all and that, unhindered, he could get on with his interminable schedule of openings, launches, international visits, soft interviews and stage-managed sound bites as well as the serious work. The problem is that this style of leadership is diminishing the Dáil and, more importantly, public confidence in and respect for it.During 2002 further damage was done by the decision to delay the appointment of the parliamentary committees until the end of the year because it was not expedient from the point of view of internal Fianna Fáil Party considerations. It was a rocky period for the Taoiseach as the more naive backbenchers were taken aback by the breath-taking abandon with which the Government parties shelved their election promises. To hold out the promise of committee chairmanship was a useful weapon to stifle revolt.Excuses about the election of a new Seanad do not wash. Why, for example, was the Committee of Public Accounts not appointed last June, given the volume of work to be done? There are no Members of the Seanad on that committee and the backlog of issues was allowed to accumulate deliberately. A functioning, competent public accounts committee can effectively police public spending from a value for money standpoint and expose waste inefficiency and indifferent management. Yet, it was put into abeyance for six months. Why?Unfortunately, the Government seems intent on continuing as it started. Piecemeal, minimal  reforms of Dáil procedure are gradually introduced depending on whether they are judged to be to the advantage of the Government. The settled policy is to sanitise Dáil procedures to the extent that all spontaneity is stifled and Government backbenchers do not even have to show up for the Order of Business nowadays. Public confidence in Dáil Éireann will continue to diminish if it is not seen as a functioning, relevant forum where the Government makes itself amenable and the procedures are such that it can be held to account by the Opposition.A calculation is made concerning how many parliamentary questions are likely to be reached on any given day. Then the remaining questions on the schedule are, where necessary, the subject of vague, abridged, obfuscating replies designed, if not to conceal, not to reveal information to the questioning Deputy. This attitude has given birth to tribunals that have provided information, transparency and entertainment, but which have also been very costly. Deputy John Bruton has remarked that if a Deputy wants to keep his views secret, the place to detail them is in the Dáil Chamber. Certainly, the last place in Ireland that the Taoiseach or one of his Ministers would choose to announce a policy initiative would be Dáil Éireann. A parliamentary question can be replied to misleadingly on the same day as the true position is being unveiled at a ministerial press conference by an army of taxpayer-funded spin doctors. It is all calculated to downplay the role of Parliament and boost the image of the Executive and the great populist leader.At the outset of a new Dáil session it is appropriate to put down this marker about real Dáil reform, to ask the Taoiseach and his Ministers to show some respect for Dáil Éireann and to begin by limiting the number of 12 hour days and extending the number of sitting days.Throughout this session and the rest of the year, the impact of the Government's ill-judged and unsound economic policies will become increasingly clear. It is now well established that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, seeking to return to office at any price, perpetrated a massive fraud on the people. The litany of broken promises goes on and on. In the dog days of Christmas week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform finally conceded that he will not deliver the 2,000 extra gardaí he promised the people. Just last week, the Minister for Education and Science finally came clean on Fianna Fáil's electoral promises to provide a decent schools building programme. Again, the promises were completely empty and fraudulent, deliberately calculated to win pockets of votes in marginal constituencies.Let me give an example from my constituency, which is replicated throughout the country. In Kingswood on 26 April, just before general election day, my newest colleague in Fianna Fáil stated the following in respect of St. Killian's primary schools: "I recently raised the matter with the Minister for Education and Science, Dr.  Michael Woods."  That will not do a lot of good for anyone, as his colleagues in Fianna Fáil know.

The Taoiseach stated the following to the humble councillor, as he then was, who raised this matter with him: "I am pleased to inform you that approval has been given to go to tender which, as you know, has been outstanding for some time."  That is what was stated in the circular put around to win valuable marginal votes. Of course, nothing has happened and the schools are not on the schedule. It was a lie and it was replicated several times throughout the country.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Nowhere are the lies and deceit of the Government more evident than in the health sector. Before the election, a health strategy was launched with extraordinary pomp and ceremony. Once the Government's re-election was secure, the health strategy, like the reputation of the Minister, Deputy Martin, was shredded in favour of an onslaught of cuts and increases in health, VHI, and hospital and drugs charges. The only thing that has not gone up is the desperately low income level needed to qualify for a medical card. While a single person with an income of over €138 per week cannot get a medical card, retired judges, bankers and retired Taoisigh can simply fill out a form and get one. The Government could not even get its sums right in the disastrous handling of the over-70s issue.Meanwhile, our accident and emergency departments are overloaded and our disability services are underfunded. I could not believe that the Minister came in here this evening and appealed to our republican ethos to demonstrate her commitment to the disabled. Given the protest that she must have seen outside the Mansion House yesterday it is incredible that she could come in here and make a commitment like that and about equality of educational opportunity. She should tell that to Jamie Sinnott and his mother.That the Government parties have behaved dishonestly is now well known. Apart from the dishonesty of their economic policy, it is also unfair and unsound. The Government manages the economy not in the interests of the people but in the interests of its own political survival. It squeezed public expenditure in the aftermath of the 1997 election to build up an electoral slush fund, as Deputy Durkan has just said. Then it cut taxes for the rich and splurged on public expenditure in advance of the general election. No thought was given to either structural reform or  value for money. In doing so, it pushed up inflation and dealt a severe blow to our competitiveness, with not a whisper of concern from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment until after the election. We are now seeing the direct result of redundancies, which have doubled in the past two years, and inflation, which will certainly be over 5% this year. Working families pay the price for this mismanagement and suffer the consequences of the rising figures on the live register.Now the stop-start cycle has begun all over again. The cuts impose hardship while the war chest is already being amassed for the next election. Again, working families pay the price in higher bills and poorer services. It need not have been like this. In 2002 the Government recorded a current budget surplus of €5.4 billion. A sum of €5,400 million more was taken in than paid out on the day-to-day running of the State. Because the Government is ideologically opposed to public services, it is squeezing the current budget to support capital spending. Its objection to borrowing for capital purposes makes no sense in good times and is even more foolhardy during a downturn. By abandoning the national development plan the Government is causing long-term damage to our economy. What foreign country wants to invest in a country that does not have decent infrastructure?The Taoiseach and the Tánaiste, who delighted in running around the country announcing new jobs in times of boom, now have nothing to say to working families who are facing redundancy and short time work. If they do not have the confidence to invest in the economy, how can they expect others to have it?Public services are being squeezed continuously. A current budget surplus of €5.4 billion existed, yet we learned this week that severely mentally and physically handicapped people in St. Mary's in Drumcar are living in conditions that are an affront in a civilised country. Working families bear the strain of this Government's failures and of its abuse of power. They bear it in the form of rising prices, higher charges and stealth taxes while dealing with crises in education, health, housing and child care. This Government has made promise after promise to address child care, but nothing of substance is ever done and nothing will be done.The Government does not want to take responsibility for anything, but is happy to lay the blame for every problem at the door of a so-called international recession. It wants to go back to the days of the poor mouth when every problem was met with a shrug of the shoulders and the comment "Ah sure, we are a poor country". Ireland is not a poor country; it is, in fact, one of the richest in the world with the second highest GDP per capita in the EU. We are not, by any stretch of the imagination, at risk of returning to the dark days of the 1980s as the Taoiseach regularly attempts to suggest. We have the second lowest debt-GDP ratio of any EU country. We  are not poor, but we are poorly governed. We suffer from a poverty of aspiration and a paucity of governmental competence. Blaming the international recession for every ill when we have a current budget surplus of €5.4 billion is simply another example of a dishonest Government which will not deal with issues affecting ordinary working families.We commence a new parliamentary session with the world on the brink of a war which is to be launched by the United States of America against Iraq. There is nothing in the preliminary report of the United Nations arms inspectors that justifies the headlong dash to a war that could, according to the UN's own estimates, lead to over 500,000 direct or indirect casualties, the outbreak of disease and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of civilians. In light of the reports of the UN's Dr. Blix, it is essential that the inspectors be given all the time necessary to fully discharge the mandate provided to them by the Security Council. It is not possible to develop or test weapons of mass destruction while the UN inspectors are in the country. Ireland should join with France and Germany, the latter of which is about to take up the presidency of the UN Security Council, in their efforts to secure a peaceful settlement of this dispute. Instead, the Government is dissembling and making things up as it goes along, hoping that something will turn up. It gives information only when it is unavoidable and changes that information depending on which Minister is speaking.In two months of work, the inspectors have found no evidence of weapons of mass destruction and Dr. Blix has told the Security Council that, on the whole, Iraq has co-operated rather well in the process. While some of the criticisms of the Iraqi authorities made by Dr. Blix are significant and while pressure must continue to be exerted on Baghdad to co-operate, these do not constitute grounds for war. I draw the attention of the House to the statement by Dr. Blix in which he said that the 1991 to 1998 inspectorate achieved results. Dr. Blix stated that the disarmament achieved by his predecessors was greater than that achieved by allied bombing during the Gulf War. Given the manner in which the US and British military is proceeding, there are real concerns that it was always the intention to proceed to war regardless of the findings of the inspectors and irrespective of whether further military action is sanctioned by the Security Council. US disengagement from events in Palestine and its approach to the more unpredictable regime in North Korea is more than a hint that this war is about oil and the strategic interests of the United States. No democratic country has gone to war in recent times other than in direct response to an act of aggression. Launching a massive war over a possible threat from another country will create a very dangerous precedent indeed. Furthermore, as it is put in the current edition of the American journal Foreign Affairs, the United States of  America risks alienating those it is most likely to need as its 21st century allies.Even though ours is a small country, we must do all we can to ensure that a disaster is averted. The Government should cease to be silent in respect of the drift towards war and join with others in campaigning for a peaceful settlement. Instead, it is complicit in the warmongering. This is evident in the revelation this morning by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, that he has given US civilian aircraft permission to transport military equipment through Shannon Airport in direct contradiction of the legal and political position adopted by some of his colleagues. It is another aspect of the Government's desire to be closer to Boston than Berlin, as is the Taoiseach's action to have a vital Dáil debate on this issue postponed. The Government says there has been no change in policy and that all Governments have provided facilities at Shannon Airport for US troops in transit to and from the United States of America. This is true, of course, but the circumstances have changed. Facilities which can properly be made available to a friendly nation at a time of peace may not be appropriate when the nation appears to be embarked on a course of belligerent military action without the approval of the Security Council of the United Nations.The Irish public is not being told the truth about the full use of Shannon Airport. Figures given out by the Department of Transport suggest that just seven civilian aircraft carrying weapons or munitions were given permission to land at Shannon Airport in the first three weeks of this month, but that a further 19 were given permission last week. This suggests that there has been either an astonishing increase in the number of such aircraft using the airport or that the law and the requirement to seek sanction was being widely ignored. It emphasises the need for some system of inspection and verification of these aircraft at Shannon.I draw the attention of the House to the conflict within the Government with regard to the application of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act, 1954, which explicitly states that no person shall, save with the consent in writing of the Minister, enter or land in the State while wearing a foreign military uniform. Deputy Michael D. Higgins tabled a question on this issue before Christmas and was told by the Minister for Defence that the provisions of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act had not been exercised by him in the period in question. On the other hand, I received a letter from the Taoiseach yesterday which told me that the requirements of section 3(1)(vii) of the Defence Act regarding the wearing of uniforms are being complied with fully. The US authorities have been given express permission which allows their military personnel to wear their uniforms in the transit areas of Irish airports. Who is telling the truth, the Minister for Defence or the Taoiseach?

Earlier, I listened carefully as the Minister spoke about the republican ethos of the State in cherishing all the children of the nation equally. Tell that to the thousands of children who live in poverty, to the children with disabilities who are on waiting lists and to the 38% of the poorest families who feel completely excluded. These families are so disillusioned that they do not vote in elections. We need a republican ethos in this House, but it has to be a radical, civic form of republicanism which protects the poor and the less well off, otherwise we are dealing with empty words.We need only look at the figures published over the last few days which demonstrate the lack of disability services, including the lack of support services at St. John of Gods, County Louth, for 250 adults with intellectual disabilities. There are 1,711 families which need full-time residential service, 861 families in need of a day care service and 1,014 who need some form of respite service. Waiting lists for St. Michael's House catalogue 344 people with intellectual disabilities, three of whose elderly parents are terminally ill. If the Government is serious about disabilities, it will introduce a supplementary budget of €20 million to deal with the crisis and emergency cases. The Taoiseach stated that there were only four groups involved in the protest at the Mansion House yesterday. Many parents from Dublin, Cork and Limerick who gave much time and incurred much expense to be there took great offence at these dismissive remarks, particularly those on the waiting lists. I call on the Taoiseach to withdraw those remarks and to apologise to the 1,711 families on the waiting lists for full-time residential services and to the 861 families who need a day-care service. His remarks had nothing to do with civic republicanism and the equal cherishing of all children.On the question of corruption, I will strongly support the proceeds of corruption legislation, which is modelled on other crime legislation. This is a progressive step, but once again, I ask that all confiscated finances and wealth be put back into the poorest communities.With regard to the North, we must all work hard to ensure the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and to tackle sectarianism, which is destroying this country, particularly in the Six Counties. The peace process is like the Irish football team, it belongs to us all and we all have a duty to move it forward each day by demanding equality and an end to injustice. I  look forward to helping in a small way to building a new and inclusive Ireland.

A plethora of reports on the health services points fingers but ultimately amounts to nothing. Actions speak louder than words and in this regard the national health strategy has done nothing but increase expectations. It has made no major improvement to the health services. As a doctor working at the coalface of health, I do not want to see today's problems become crises prior to the next general election.The Government has overseen the demise of the Celtic tiger. At this stage it does not even tread in parts of my county. In west and north Mayo, where Asahi, Warners and Babygrow have closed and where Bellacorick is due to close, the census of population predicts that by the end of this century not a living soul will remain in the region. Decentralisation, special tax designation status and infrastructure is urgently needed in the region if it is to survive. Today in Ballinrobe, 16 jobs have been lost due to the closure of Ablecrest Limited, leaving 16 families devastated. I urge the Government to act immediately with the IDA to secure a replacement industry for the town. Sixteen jobs may not be a great number, but it is huge for Ballinrobe and will create great hardship.Ballina hospital is without any X-ray facility since the breakdown of obsolete equipment, which should have been replaced years ago, as demanded by the Western Health Board. A similar situation exists in Mayo General Hospital, the county's main hospital, where no X-ray scanning is possible. This means that the diagnosis of bowel cancer and other illnesses is not possible in Mayo. The Western Health Board has sought this equipment for months, indeed a year. A sum of €140,000 would purchase new digital X-ray equipment for the hospital which could be of use to the 2,500 people who are waiting for the service. At present, the Western Health Board is reduced to looking for a second hand X-ray machine. What kind of health service is that? I demand that the Ballina machine be immediately replaced.The Government should start with the basics and provide a basic health service and employment opportunities for young people and farmers who must leave the land. It got money on the back of the deprived areas in the west of Ireland, including my county, yet we do not have basic services. We must survive and it is only right that we try to do so. It is not asking much.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Last year, the 28th Dáil met for 26 days while the 29th Dáil met for 41 days, the same number of days that the Dáil met in 1923, the founding year of the State when a civil war took place. That the Government sanctions meetings of the Dáil on such an infrequent basis negates its claim to have a radical legislative programme. To date it has enacted 12 Bills, nine of which passed through the House on the last week of the previous session with the use of the guillotine and most of which were technical in nature.The programme presented to the House today is startling in its lack of imagination. The Bills presented do not go near meeting the needs of those seeking the kind of change required in so many areas of Irish life. For example, the decision to reintroduce the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill with no indication as to when the Disabilities Bill will be reintroduced shows a further contempt of those with disabilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	387	That Bill is subject to an ongoing consultation process.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	388	The memorandum for the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill refers to guaranteeing the needs of people with disability. Has the Government not learned that both Bills fell in the last Dáil because of its unwillingness to recognise the rights of people with disability? The proposed legislation will not address this.One additional health Bill is proposed in addition to the three already before the House. None deals with the central question of health provision and the lack of equity for people who suffer from a health service that is more sick than many of those in need of it. Where is the innovation and the radicalism? This is a tired Government. It has achieved what it wanted and is content to be back in office without knowing what it wants to do.The housing Bill is an indication that the Government is only concerned in the environmental area with meeting the needs of property over people. It fails to recognise the problems faced by many in our society. The protection of the environment Bill is indicative of the loose way in which the Government uses language. The Bill is not concerned with the protection of the environment, rather it will be a licensing of pollution Bill, in line with all environmental legislation introduced by the Government.It is a pretence to suggest that the local government Bill will improve the powers of local government when its only two provisions will be to eliminate the dual mandate, which should not exist and which all Members should give up voluntarily, and to remove the power of people to democratically elect first citizens in their respective local authorities. The legislation does not contain one initiative in terms of improving the power of local government.The Dáil is reconvening three weeks after the Westminster Parliament returned from its Christmas recess. In that time members of the  Government, especially the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Transport, have signed orders without scrutiny or debate in this House on matters that are slowly dragging the country into involvement in a foreign conflagration which the people do not desire and which the world does not need.

The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism will conclude this very short debate on behalf of the Government. He will ignore the fact that the Government will not introduce any significant legislation in this session. While we will get the knock-about debates, the House deserves more than the Cahirciveen chancer routine. We deserve a more significant legislative programme and we need active debate of sufficient length and depth. Unless the Government changes its ways, this will not happen in this session.

The Government has taken a leaf from the British book and is attempting to rule the State by fooling the people. However, there are not as many fools as it might like to think. I doubt that so many people have ever been so disappointed and enraged at the performance of a Government so soon after it came to office. What angers people most is that the Government has been engaged in transparent efforts to deceive them, something they find insulting.As we begin this session the real policies, as against those promised before the general election, are clear. The cuts are beginning to bite. On the eve of the commencement, people with disabilities had to protest outside the Taoiseach's launch of the European year of people with disabilities to highlight the savage cuts in the budget allocated to health boards. For example, the budget for intellectual disability services in 2004 has been cut from €38 million to €13.3 million. This cut has been described by the Federation of Voluntary Bodies and the National Association of Parents and Friends of the Mentally Handicapped of Ireland as bringing us back to the mid-1990s.As I said previously, these caring agencies and voluntary bodies will not be able to maintain existing services, let alone proceed with badly needed new developments in this area. It will mean longer waiting lists for day care and respite care, and affect the long-term residential care needs of many, as I highlighted to the Taoiseach at the conclusion of the last term of this Dáil. I also highlight the continuing scandal of some 500 people with intellectual disabilities being detained inappropriately in psychiatric insti tutions. There is no provision to address this scandal.Yesterday, on the eve of the commencement, the community platform representing a host of groups working with the disadvantaged and marginalised in our society pointed out at a press conference that there was nothing in the proposed new partnership agreement to address many pressing social issues. The focus of this Government, the employers and, scandalously, the trade union movement is on pay and appears to be only on pay. That is a failure on their part to address what is essential within any proposed agreement, and that is the pressing social needs of many in our society today. Addressing pay alone will not do that.While we are talking about the marginalisation of those with particular needs – the intellectually disabled and others – let us look at the reality of this negotiation of a new partnership agreement. This Dáil has been marginalised because an agreement will be negotiated and, presumably, concluded without the elected representatives in this House having any opportunity to have an input, which is another scandal.

After the broken promises to extend the general medical services scheme to an additional 200,000 people and to end waiting lists within two years, we have had more crises in the health services. Accident and emergency units are unable to cope with the number of patients presenting and this is at a time when major changes in training practices are imminent and could lead to the closure of accident and emergency units in a number of additional hospitals throughout the country, not only at Monaghan General Hospital where the hospital has been deemed off call.I will restate my point because it is crucial. Major changes in training practices are imminent and there are consequences following from that. I asked the Taoiseach on today's Order of Business, with regard to planned and proposed legislation, whether there was any proposal to curtail the scandalous dominance of the representative bodies of the various consultant specialities over the configuration of the delivery of health care services in this State. I cannot get an answer. The referee or full-back on behalf of the Taoiseach prevented a response.There are many issues on which this Government has failed. Regrettably, within the few minutes I have, I will not be able to address them further. While the Government has abandoned so many of the promises and commitments  presented in its pre-election programme, I thought, prior to the arrival of the Ministers for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Arts, Sport and Tourism, that it had also abandoned Deputy Hanafin who cut a lonely figure on the Government benches for most of this so-called commencement debate.

The press release was headed "Government must not impose policy on new commission". He opposed my efforts to drive communications policy and my efforts to introduce flat rate Internet access until he read the newspapers the next morning. He then saw that my move was widely welcomed, as it still is.

The primary task of this House is to ensure that the people of this country are provided with the legislation necessary to ensure the orderly running of society, the efficient and equitable management of our resources and the means of fairly achieving legitimate democratic goals.Debate, questions and parliamentary scrutiny are hallmarks of democracy. They are the means by which the people ensure that their taxes are being responsibly spent and by which Government accounts to the people. However, they are not the sole tenets of democracy. Informed choice is the essence of democracy. To make an informed choice the people must know not just where the Government stands but also where the various and often contradictory strands of the Opposition stand.The legislative programme which the Government has set out for this session is challenging. It builds on the democratic foundations endorsed by the people in the last general election. Then, the largely complementary manifestos put forward by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats were, to different degrees, endorsed by the Irish people. Post-election negotiations between the two parties resulted in An Agreed Programme for Government and, in turn, were endorsed by this House in its selection of Taoiseach and Ministers.That programme for Government represents a blueprint for stability and advancement. Its aims are to consolidate the gains made over the past half decade and to prepare the way for future growth and development. Its aim is to safeguard existing levels of employment and to provide real opportunities for expansion.For the past decade and a half Ireland has pioneered the concept of social partnership which has brought economic peace and spectacular growth. It has resulted in many long-term unemployed securing gainful employment and in advances for many of the disadvantaged in society. It is a process which must be continued for the same reason it was started – to ensure the long-term survival of a vibrant Irish economy and to ensure that the benefits of that economy are shared fairly among all our citizens.We have heard much in recent days of the desire of the smaller parties to hold the Government to account. This is a legitimate function of Opposition in a democratic state but I am somewhat concerned that the Opposition parties have a blinkered and limited view of their own role. Democracy is about choice. It is about the people being properly informed so as to enable them to make an informed choice. In order to make a choice the people have to know where the Opposition stands. Criticism of the Government is but one part of the role of Opposition. Postulating viable alternative policies and actions is the other part. For the past five and half years we have had an admittedly fractured Opposition—

This may continue but if  it does it serves both the Opposition and the people of Ireland poorly.The Fine Gael Party under the leadership of Deputy Enda Kenny has undergone a period of introspection or, as Deputy Hogan more colourfully put it, of navel gazing.

If today each member of the Fine Gael parliamentary party were asked to state what the party stood for and enunciate what policies it would pursue in Government each would give a different answer. Not alone do people on the Government benches not know what Fine Gael stands for, people on the streets do not know either.

Aimlessly it floats backwards and forwards on the treacherously alluring tide of populism, mistaking opportunism for initiative and confusing existence with substance.

Time may show that it is also untrue for political parties.The other fallacy which pervades the flawed view of the role of an Opposition is that it is the role of the Opposition to ask but never answer questions. In a democracy people have a right to  information. They have a right to information about the Government, about Government policies and about Government intentions.

In short, the people have a right to know who the Opposition are and what, if anything, they stand for. They have a right to know how much the Opposition's policies would cost to implement and how they should be funded.In this regard at least the Labour Party, under the leadership of Deputy Rabbitte, has been focused and consistent. It is a party irrevocably wedded to a policy of borrowing. Many in this House and more among the electorate consider this to be a recipe for economic catastrophe and social impoverishment. It was a policy which was fully utilised by the last full-term Government in which the Labour Party participated, the ill-fated coalition of 1982-87. There, the policy of borrowing was so pervasive and its implementation so profligate that the national debt was doubled in the lifetime of a single term Government, a feat never achieved before and, I hope, never to be repeated in the future.No lesson appears to have been learned by the new leadership of Labour from the calamitous mistakes of its past.

The challenge I pose to those on the Opposition benches for this coming Dáil term is to engage in  responsible Opposition, to be honest with themselves and with the people, to spell out their alternative policies and when they would implement them and to state loudly, clearly and without equivocation what their policies would cost and how they would be funded.There is no magic attaching to the management of the public finances, only prudence. Every penny spent must be raised by taxation, saved elsewhere or borrowed. It is time the do-it-all and do-it-now Opposition became a responsible Opposition—

It is also their democratic duty to answer them. Deputy Rabbitte would have us believe that his ambition for this Dáil session is to usurp Deputy Kenny's position as Leader of the Opposition.

It is a legitimate inquiry to be made of a leader of a political party. A simple syllable will suffice, "yes" if he informed the tribunal and "no" if he did not. I await his response.I also await the response to my call for responsible opposition. I await hearing in debate, questions and documents the individual policies of Opposition parties. I await hearing how they will be funded and when they will be implemented and I await hearing their priorities. From now on, the hitherto universal Opposition call of do-it-all and do-it-now will be met with the refrain of, "Tell us how and tell us how now". Penny by penny, tax rise by tax rise, service cut by service cut, the Opposition must be forced to engage with reality. I challenge the Opposition for the duration of this Dáil term to compile a schedule of the expenditure it proposes and the reductions it opposes. At Easter let the Department of Finance measure the magnitude of the tax increase necessary to fund its fantasies. I await its response. This Dáil session has the capacity to be provoking and challenging.

The display of posters or exhibits of any kind are strictly prohibited under long-standing rules of this House and such behaviour has long been regarded as being of gross disorder. The reason for the rule is obvious but it is worth mentioning lest its intention is misunderstood. As duly elected representatives of the people in the national Parliament, each Member when given the floor is entitled to have his or her say in a debate in a civilised manner. Any attempt to upstage legitimate parliamentary activity as witnessed today is totally unacceptable and unfair to Members at large and demeaning to the serious work that this House is charged with under the Constitution. I intend to have this matter brought to the attention of the Dáil Committee on Procedure and Privileges and in the interim I fully intend to take whatever action is necessary to uphold the rulings of my predecessors and protect the rights of Members participating in debate in this House.

We simply cannot claim to be neutral while the Government actively facilitates and effectively subsidises a military build-up by allowing Shannon Airport to be a critical link in what is clearly now an inevitable US-led war against Iraq. More important, it is clear that many hundreds of US planes landed at Shannon during the past year without declaring they were carry ing munitions and in clear breach of our Defence Act 1954 and the Air Navigation Order 1973.From the over 500 planes that landed in Shannon last year, the House was told only today that a mere 30 sought and obtained the necessary permission. It was on 17 January 2003 that the United States was reminded by the Department of Transport of its obligations to seek the required permission. We know full well that this happened only as a direct result of the huge protests at Shannon by concerned Irish people. Will the Minister answer the question that the Taoiseach failed to answer today? Why did the Government collude with the United States for the past year in violation of this country's laws? Why were no inspectors sent on board US military planes at Shannon?Iraq is already devastated by the massively destructive weapons used by the United States during the Gulf War. Much of Iraq's infrastructure has already been bombed out of existence. Even its sewerage and water treatment systems were destroyed to such an extent that disease has spread causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of babies and children. Iraq is militarily no longer a threat and the United Nations inspectors should be given all necessary time to deal with any outstanding issues. The United States has said it has information about weapons of mass destruction. If so, why has it not given that information to the arms inspectors instead of undermining their work and treating them with contempt?It is clear Bush and Blair are intent on war but what is the real motivation for this impending war? If the United States was genuinely concerned about weapons of mass destruction, then it would be directing its attention to the nuclear threat from North Korea. If the United States was motivated by breaches of United Nations resolutions, then it would have to deal with the state which for far longer than any other has been in breach of UN resolutions. I refer to its own satellite client state – Israel – which continues to occupy, terrorise and savagely suppress the Palestinian people in what amounts to a campaign of ethnic cleansing. If the United States was acting in defence of human rights, then Iraq would be just one on a long list of states requiring so-called "regime change".The truth is that the only motivation for this war is oil, and everyone in this House knows it. Iraq possesses the second largest reserves of oil in the world. We only have to look at the report commissioned by the United States Institute for Public Policy entitled, Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st Century. This report details that America faces the biggest energy crisis in its history.

Of course, most of President Bush's closest advisers and leaders of his Administration have backgrounds in the US oil industry.Shannon Airport is being used as a military tool to assist the United States war machine in its plan to invade Iraq, install a puppet client state and exploit its oil reserves. That is what this war is about. This motion calls on the Government to oppose this preparation for an unjust war by withdrawing landing and refuelling facilities at Shannon from US military planes.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	471	I welcome this opportunity for a debate on our motion regarding the terrible potential of another Gulf War. This motion is about peace and about trying to prevent the deaths of tens of thousands civilians in Iraq. This debate is not about being anti-American, and I challenge anyone in this House in that regard. The motion is about a group of Irish citizens being anti-war and not anti-American. We are pro-peace, pro-equality, pro-justice and pro-ending forever weapons of mass destruction. This motion is also about Ireland's neutrality and the need for our country to stand up and be counted.Let me also commend the peace campaigners at Shannon Airport. I visited them last Saturday, 25 January, to express my support and solidarity. I thank them for their courage, integrity and love of peace. I urge every Irish citizen to support them in their noble campaign. I remind the people that they are being conned by their Government on this issue. It knows all the planes are coming through with weapons. I ask people to stop fuelling the war at Shannon. We should follow the example of the girls from the Loreto College, Swords, who yesterday and today protested against fuelling the war at Shannon. They are a noble group of students and fair play to the teachers and those involved.Let me say why I am opposed to the war. A war against Iraq could result in massive loss of life for innocent men, women and children in that country as well as serious casualties among American and other troops. In the 1991 Gulf War, tens of thousands of innocent Iraqi men, women and children were killed or injured and many are still dying as an after effect of that battle. Among the American casualties not only were 148 killed in action, but close to 100,000 are still suffering from the ill-effects of Gulf War ill ness. Some 5,000 British servicemen are also suffering from the same condition. A new war with Iraq could bring massive destruction and pain.Unfortunately, the proposed war against Iraq should not be seen as an aberration of Bush's foreign policy; it is an integral part of his preventative war doctrine which would allow the US to go into battle any time and any place he deems appropriate. With the end of the Cold War, people throughout the world looked forward to a century of peace and improved international relations. The Bush doctrine could result in decades of unending warfare and billions of dollars being spent on weapons of mass destruction rather than on human needs.Of course, the Americans feel hurt and destroyed by the tragic events of 11 September but they are lashing out at the wrong target. While Saddam Hussein is a terrible dictator, few people outside the White House believe he would launch an attack on America. His country is militarily weak. We, and the Americans, know where he is and if he ever launched an attack, it could be met with overwhelming military force, and he knows that.A US-led war with Iraq will increase the likelihood of attacks against Americans and other citizens throughout Europe, particularly in Ireland. When the most powerful nation on earth unleashes a premeditated offensive attack against a poor and relatively defenceless nation killing thousands of innocent people and occupying that country, there will be massive resentment not only among the billion Muslims but also among people in the developing world. Already in the last year, respect and admiration for the US has plummeted in almost every nation. A pre-emptive war against Iraq would increase anti-Americanism and could result in a massive recruitment boost for others. I say this as a friend and as someone who has many relations who live in America. To be critical of American foreign policy does not mean one is anti-American. It is important we understand that and put it on the record.If the United States goes to war without UN approval, it will move the world towards international anarchy and a mindset in which all nations will feel free to attack other nations for whatever reason. That is not a good idea in a world in which at least eight countries have nuclear weapons. What moral authority will the US have in calling for peace and negotiations in the Middle East or between India and Pakistan after it launches a major offensive against Iraq?I urge everybody to support our motion. This is an historic moment in world history and I urge people to come out strongly against this proposed war.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I am glad to have the opportunity of speaking in support of this motion. It is not every day that one can contribute something to a debate in this House which may have the effect of saving lives. Hopefully, this debate is about doing  something to help people. Like you, a Cheann Comhairle, I work as a medical practitioner at the coalface. I am concerned about all that is happening and this major rush to war. It seems to me that we are being rushed along in a mad way towards a conflict. We can all remember wars, including Vietnam, in which so many people died. As well as the fatalities, many more suffered ongoing disabilities to which previous speakers have alluded.A war in Iraq will cost billions of dollars but where is the money going to come from and what will happen as a result of its expenditure? Everything in the garden is not rosy: the United States is a very wealthy country, yet it has domestic problems. I wonder what is really happening. We are now hearing what is happening at Shannon Airport but only for the protests there we would have heard nothing. When all this was happening why did we not know about it? What about our Constitution and the right of the Dáil to have a say in these matters? We have been elected by the people and we should know what is happening. These are the questions that disturb me most and I am demanding answers to them.I respect America but what standing will the US have if it rushes into a war without UN sanction? I want to know what all this means to ordinary people on the ground. I hope that what I am saying today may help to save a few lives or maybe even a million lives, who knows? We must consider the reports that are emanating from paediatricians in Iraq who have calculated the effects of the Gulf War. Millions of Iraqi children are in a desperate situation, starving as a result of sanctions, but what will it be like after a war? There have been disturbing reports from psychologists in Iraq saying that children are not even talking about what is happening because they are so afraid. Parents are afraid, also, so how can they reassure their children? I have children and I do not know how I would react in such a situation. We should consider all of this.There is an obligation on the House to ensure we know exactly what is happening. We are being rushed headlong into a war that will not do anyone any good. It is time to pause.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	473	During the debate on the Nice treaty referendum the Government told us the amendment it proposed would enshrine the concept of neutrality in the Constitution. Anyone who has observed the comings and goings in Shannon will know that they were grievously misled by the Government on this issue and, indeed, by other parties. The question we must ask ourselves is what does neutrality mean now. According to the Government in its own wonderfully flexible way, it means exactly what it wants it to mean. It means it can assist the American war effort, that planes with war munitions can land at Shannon, and that uniformed troops heading for the war zone can walk freely around Shannon. So, it is not quite in keeping with the Hague Con vention on neutrality, or with our Constitution and legislation.The House has been deliberately misled on these issues. On 26 November 2002, I received a reply from the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on the question of arms being carried through Shannon. The reply was deliberately misleading. The Minister sought to give the impression that no arms were going through Shannon but, of course, we now know that this is not the case. We know from a report in The Sunday Business Post that the Minister had at that stage a confidential memorandum in his possession that showed clearly that soldiers were going through and that they required permission under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973. That is what it said in the newspaper so perhaps the Minister could refute it.Only the week before last, the Minister was forced to concede that American troops were indeed carrying arms, but only when he was caught. He knew he had to concede the point because people in Shannon had witnessed it. Last week, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, granted such permission surreptitiously and retrospectively. This all reveals an unprecedented level of contempt for the House. Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Cowen, might be good enough to tell the House when he granted permission to uniformed US troops to disembark at Shannon under section 317 of the Defence Act 1954. I would like to have a clear answer to that question. The Minister might also wish to tell the House why he continues to refuse to have checks carried out on planes at Shannon. Is he afraid that such checks will reveal that these cargo planes are carrying munitions, as so many people suspect?The Government's position on Shannon and Iraq has exposed its dishonesty, duplicity and hypocrisy. In Finland and Austria, both neutral and non-aligned states, no refuelling of US war planes is taking place. France and Germany, who are members of NATO, are displaying more backbone than Ireland. The Government, however, lacks courage and conviction, unlike the peace campaigners in Shannon who have acted out of conviction. I congratulate my Green Party colleagues in Shannon – Tim Hourigan, Ed Horgan and Mary Kelly, who stood for our party in Donegal and who this evening is sitting in a Limerick jail.Recently, a Minister appeared with me on a radio programme and claimed that in international diplomacy there are no principles, only interests.

By assisting the American war effort the Minister is complicit in acts of terrorism against the Iraqi people. He will have the blood of innocent Iraqi women and children on his hands. Let us be clear that the Minister does not speak or act in my name and he certainly does not act in the name of the Irish people. The latest survey shows that the majority of Irish people are opposed to this war. That is a fact.I make a distinction between the American people and the Government of George W. Bush. In the same way, I make a distinction between the honourable people of Iraq and the tyrant Saddam Hussein. As Deputy Finian McGrath said, we are not anti-American. Mr. Bush is a dangerously simplistic individual, trying to grapple with some of the most complex foreign policy issues that have ever faced an American president. A war in Iraq will destabilise the entire region. It will be very difficult to keep the lid on civil unrest in countries like Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Jordan. In addition, it will also act as a recruiting call to terrorists, not just in al-Qaeda but also in other organisations. The result will be more retaliatory terrorist attacks leading in turn to greater security measures and, obviously, the erosion of civil liberties.We are entering a period of prolonged darkness in human history. The cost to humanity, the global community and future generations is incalculable. At a time when we have the capability and resources to solve global poverty, to rid our world of hunger and disease, we are about to embark on a mad and obscene war which will divide humanity on ethnic and religious grounds, widen the gap between rich and poor and squander billions of dollars on weapons of mass destruction.The greatest challenge now facing humanity is not global terrorism, it is global warming. We know Mr. Bush's attitude to that and to the  Kyoto Protocol in particular. This is about vested interests, and Mr. Bush's vested interest in relation to the Kyoto Protocol is oil, as it is in relation to Iraq. One has only to look at the Cheney report which states that the US has to make the security of oil supply a major plank of US foreign policy. To maintain the consumerist lifestyle of the Americans and the West, oil imports in America will have to increase from the current 10.4 million barrels a day to a massive 16.7 million barrels in 2020. That is a lot of oil, a lot of carbon dioxide, a lot of global warming and a hell of a lot of irresponsibility. Can one doubt this is about oil when one looks at the Bush cabinet, Mr. Cheney, Condoleeza Rice, Don Evans and Gale Norton, all of whom have associations with oil companies?Despite all this evidence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, on a radio programme, dismissed the idea that this could be about oil. I listened very carefully to what he had to say and he very quickly jumped to the defence of the USA. The Minister has become very good at jumping. The only question now is, how high? That is determined by George W. Bush. There is something rather pathetic about this self-styled rottweiler now a performing poodle.

The Government has been very evasive in its answers to questions raised by me and other Deputies as to whether it has offered co-operation to the US in its war preparations. Recent revelations have shown that the Government has allowed Shannon Airport to be used as a pit-stop on the way to war by civilian and military aircraft. The Security Council has not authorised force and any facilitation of the current US-led war is not in keeping with UN Security Council policy. The Government has, therefore, deceived the Dáil and the public about the true position.

The Air Navigation Order 1973 states that it is against the law to carry munitions of war on an aircraft. We now know that this is happening in Shannon. The Air Navigation Order 1952 states that no foreign military aircraft shall fly over or land in the State without the express permission of the Minister.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in reply to a question tabled by me on 10 December said that no routine applications for overflights or landing had been refused because the Government had confirmed that the aircraft did not carry arms or ammunition and were not part of a military exercise or operation. Yet, we know these things have happened. The Minister also said that no applications were made for ministerial exemptions of these conditions. If this is so, either the Government has extended permission so that the applications for exemptions are not required or it is in dereliction of its duties in enforcing the law. We deserve full disclosure in this regard.The Defence Act 1954 states that no one can enter or land in the State while wearing any foreign military uniform save with the express permission in writing of a Minister. Yet, we have photographs to prove otherwise. They have been printed in all the national newspapers and throughout the world.The Government has breached not only that legislation but the obligations of a neutral State as per the Hague Convention which states that belligerents are forbidden to move troops or convoys of munitions of war or supplies across a territory of a neutral power. Article 5 of that convention states that the responsibility lies with the neutral power to ensure this does not occur. This has not happened in the past six months while US troops have used Shannon on its way to war. This has been done without the consent of the Dáil and in violation of Article 28 of the Constitution and is contrary to the spirit of Articles 29.1 and 29.2.In response to a question tabled by me on 3 December the Minister reassured me that the Government would at all times act in accordance with its constitutional and legal obligations with respect to the granting of overflight and landing permission, but it has not done so.I first sought a full debate on Iraq last September, but the Government has repeatedly refused to hold such a debate.

It joined NATO's PfP despite promises to the contrary. It went around the country last year saying it would protect neutrality through the Nice treaty but did the exact opposite as soon as the treaty was passed. It says "here, we have our airport and you can use it". Some 250,000 troops travelling to Iraq is no tea party. They do not have a UN mandate because they are not UN soldiers, but are British and American soldiers on their way to war. For a neutral country to allow its airports to be used breaches any definition of neutrality. These overflights and the permission to land and allow our airports to be used for the transfer of munitions must stop immediately. I urge the Government to withdraw any permission it has issued and use its position, whatever is left of it at this stage, to try to ensure we withdraw from the brink of war and try to deal with international conflicts in a peaceful manner.

Before doing so, however, I wish to deal with comment and speculation on current arrangements to allow for access to Shannon Airport by transiting US military aircraft and personnel.Let me begin with the historical and geographical background. Ireland's geographical position places it on the main flight path between North America and Europe. Shannon was initially developed as a refuelling point for transatlantic flights, when limited aircraft range obliged most aircraft to touch down in Ireland when travelling to and from the US.For many decades, military aircraft of various nationalities have been refuelling at Shannon or, as aircraft ranges have extended, overflying Ireland on their way to or from North America. There has also been a practice, again going back  decades, for civilian aircraft carrying US and Canadian military personnel and civilian staff to refuel at Shannon on their way to and from various bases around the world. Shannon has continued to be popular because of its efficient and friendly service. This business has brought jobs and income to the wider Shannon area and generated revenue for Aer Rianta.The fact that these connections developed should come as no surprise to anyone. Ireland is not a military ally of the United States. We are not obliged to the United States by any mutual defence commitment. Ireland and the United States are good friends, and these good relations are obvious. We are bound to America by close ties of blood and history. Irish men and women found prosperity and a future in the United States when Ireland could offer them nothing. These men and women helped make the United States what it is today. Ireland's recent prosperity and the staunching of the haermorrhage of emigration is party due to US investment. Our newfound peace is in no small measure due to the support received from successive US Administrations, Congress and private interests. These facts do not make us a military ally of the US, nor do they require us to uncritically support US foreign policy. They are factors which no responsible Irish Government, conscious of the interests of the Irish people, would wish to ignore.The practice of facilitating the overflight and landing of US military aircraft and personnel dates back to a time before many of us in this House, including myself, were even born. This practice continued throughout the Cold War, and all the conflicts, wars and upheavals of the past 50 years. It has been maintained under successive Governments, comprising various political parties. Claims that this Government has adopted a new policy which undermines Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality are nonsense. They are nothing more than political opportunism.Let me now explain in full the details of the arrangements which apply, and the steps I initiated last September to improve the implementation of these arrangements. These improvements have been introduced with the full co-operation of the US authorities. I will deal first with military aircraft.The legislative basis for control of military overflights and landings is the Air Navigation (Foreign Military Aircraft) Order 1952 which prohibits foreign military aircraft from flying over or landing in the State except by the express invitation or permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Successive foreign affairs Ministers have routinely granted permission on condition that the aircraft is unarmed, that is, not carrying arms, ammunition or explosives, not involved in intelligence-gathering and not engaged in military exercises. It should be noted that these conditions are policy stipulations applied at the discretion of successive Ministers and not legal requirements. Under the 1952 order, the Minister for Foreign  Affairs has full discretion in the granting of permission to foreign military aircraft to overfly or land in the State, which is the legal position.The arrangements for granting permission for the landing of foreign military aircraft are the same for all countries. The embassy of the country concerned is required to submit a written request, via a third party note, in respect of every landing. In almost all cases, this will include confirmation that the aircraft carries no arms, ammunition, explosives, photographic or intelligence gathering equipment. After consultation with the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform, my Department, if satisfied with the application, issues a written response by third party note to the embassy concerned granting permission for the overflight. Any request for a landing by a military aircraft carrying munitions would be examined particularly closely.Many of the landing requests relate to refuelling of VIP transports, which are military airplanes. In the case of the US, there are also a substantial number of cargo planes, which we are informed do not carry munitions.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	514	The same procedure and conditions applying to landings of military aircraft generally apply to the granting of permission for overflights of military aircraft, that is military aircraft flying through sovereign Irish airspace but not landing in Ireland. In other words, permission must be sought and granted for the overflight of every military aircraft.There are two categories of exception to this rule. First, there is a group of 17 countries which has at different times over a long period of years, been granted blanket permission for the overflight of military aircraft on condition that they give my Department advance notice of the details of each flight. If they give us advance notice of the details of each flight, there is no requirement for a confirmatory note from us.The specific arrangements that apply to the United States regarding overflights were agreed in the exchange of letters in January 1959 between the then Minister for External Affairs, Mr. Frank Aiken, and the US ambassador. Under this agreement, the US is granted blanket permission for overflights of unarmed military aircraft. The terms of the permission specify that the aircraft be unarmed, carry only cargo and passengers and comply with the navigational requirements and flight patterns specified by the Government of Ireland under the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The blanket permission includes a stipulation that the permission will be subject to reconsideration in the event of a serious deterioration in the international situation. In exchanges between the embassy and the Department of External Affairs, which preceded the exchange of letters, "cargo" was defined generally as "support supplies", for example, food, clothing and household equipment. The US  Embassy provides regular post hoc statistics of overflights, broken down by month, which is totally in compliance.Requests for overflights by US military aircraft carrying munitions are extremely rare. I understand that internal US guidelines make clear that Ireland does not generally permit the overflight and landing of armed military aircraft. At my direction, officials of my Department have reminded the US authorities that advance permission must be sought for every flight not meeting the usual conditions.Another point needs to be made in relation to the overflight and landing of foreign military aircraft. On 21 September 2001, the Taoiseach, with my full agreement, announced that the State would facilitate military aircraft operating in pursuit of UN Security Council Resolution 1368 by waiving the normal conditions that apply to the granting of permission for landings and overflights by such aircraft – that they be unarmed, carry no ammunition or explosives, not be involved in intelligence-gathering and not engaged in military exercises. Deputies will recall that in this resolution, the Security Council classified the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 as a threat to international peace and security and called on all states to work together urgently to bring to justice the perpetrators and organisers. In the event, no request seeking to avail of this waiver has been received. The US has continued to follow standard procedures, notwithstanding the availability of this exemption from normal requirements.The arrangements in relation to civilian aircraft are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport, but I will address the matter on behalf of the Government with a view to providing a complete account of the present arrangements. Civil aviation standards in force internationally are governed by the provisions of the 1941 Chicago Convention, to which Ireland is one of the signatories. Article 35 of the convention states that "no munitions of war may be carried in or above the territory of a State in aircraft engaged in international navigation, except by permission of such State". The provisions of the convention came into effect in Ireland through the Air Navigation and Transport Act 1946, which made provision for the making of ministerial orders to give effect to the terms of the Chicago Convention.Sections 6 and 7 of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973, which was amended in 1989, prohibit the carriage of munitions of war, including weapons and dangerous goods by aircraft overflying or registered in Ireland. In this context, "munitions of war" includes weapons and ammunition designed for use in warfare and ammunition and parts thereof on an aircraft in or over the State. Under section 5 of the order, as amended, and in the context of a specific aircraft operation, the Minister for Transport is empowered to exempt a specified  aircraft from this prohibition to allow for the carriage of munitions of war. The requirement for an exemption does not apply to munitions of war carried on board aircraft registered in another state where munitions of war may legally be carried to ensure the safety of the aircraft or persons on board, for example, weapons carried by authorised air marshals or bodyguards. Any civilian aircraft seeking to land or overfly the State requires the permission of the Minister for Transport to carry, military weapons or munitions. Civilian aircraft carrying unarmed troops are treated as normal passenger freight and do not require special authorisation to overfly or land, aside from permission to wear military uniform. As I have indicated, under the 1973 order carriers of troops accompanied by arms are obliged to seek exemption from landing and overflight prohibitions.It came to the notice of my Department during the course of a review of arrangements, initiated at my direction, that US troops travelling by civilian aircraft were often accompanied by their personal weapons, a matter to which I referred in a recent statement. The US authorities made clear that such weapons are not loaded, are normally stowed in the hold and are not taken off aircraft while on the ground in Ireland and that troops are issued with ammunition only on arrival at the ultimate destination. It was pointed out to the US authorities that the airlines concerned were nevertheless obliged to seek the permission of the Minister for Transport to carry such weapons and ammunition and the Department of Transport wrote directly to the carriers concerned reminding them of this requirement. The civilian carriers involved are now routinely submitting advance information on side-arms and any other military cargo to the Department of Transport to facilitate compliance with the terms of the 1973 order. This accounts for the reported rise in the number of authorisations issued by the Minister for Transport for the shipment of so-called "munitions of war".We are not talking about large scale movements of heavy munitions, but the personal weapons of the soldiers on board and limited quantities of ammunition for the weapons. I am informed that the practice of troops being accompanied by their personal weapons and limited quantities of ammunition is not unusual and has sometimes been followed by contingents of the Defence Forces when travelling abroad on overseas missions. Some 43 overflight exemptions to the 1973 order for overflights of civilian aircraft carrying munitions were granted between 11 September 2001 and early January 2003. The only permission for the landing of a civilian aircraft carrying munitions granted during that period involved the delivery of munitions to the Defence Forces.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	583	We stand on the brink of a third Gulf war, the consequences of which, if it takes place against our wishes, could be very grave. Apart from the horrific human suffering that is likely to accompany the outbreak of war, there is a risk of destabilising an already volatile region. Support for terrorism could grow and economies may suffer.The Irish Government does not wish to see war take place. We have raised our voice and used our influence in every forum available to us to urge the need for a peaceful solution. We are determined to discharge our international obligations, both in trying to avert conflict and in carrying out the decisions of the Security Council.Ireland's approach to this crisis is based on our long-standing commitment to international peace, justice, security and stability upheld by the rule of law, peaceful settlement of disputes and respect for human rights. These are the principles which have informed Irish foreign policy under successive Governments ever since the foundation of the State. Ireland is a strong supporter of the system of collective international security set forth in the United Nations charter. We regard the United Nations as the centre of this system of collective security. We attach particular importance to the role of the Security Council as having primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security. In carrying out its duties under this responsibility, the council is acting on behalf of the entire membership of the United Nations.Under Article 25 all members agree to accept and carry out the decisions of the council. This is a clear obligation on all states. Iraq's continued defiance of the lawful decisions of the Security Council is a challenge to the authority of the council and the legitimacy of the post-war international order. It undermines confidence in the rule of law and the efficacy of international arms control regimes. This defiance is ultimately as much a threat to international security as is the possession of weapons of mass destruction. However, the possession of these dreadful weapons is the immediate threat which must be dealt with. There should be no doubt that possession alone, regardless of whether there is a proven intent to use these arms, is a real and intolerable threat, as well as being banned by international treaties. There is nothing abstract about this. The Iraqi regime has initiated two major wars and used chemical weapons against both enemy soldiers and its own people.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	584	The Government supported it.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Iraq has done all in its power to thwart the efforts of arms inspectors and to conceal its weapons holdings and programmes. The regime has spent vast sums of money, diverted a great part of its national effort and subjected its people to severe deprivation rather than co-operate sufficiently with inspectors. The people of Iraq have suffered as a consequence of UN sanctions. Some countries, including Ireland, have striven with limited success to reduce the impact of these sanctions on the most vulnerable elements of society. The Iraqi authorities could have ensured the lifting of sanctions by co-operating with the inspectors. Instead, they sought to use the sanctions as a propaganda tool, disrupting revenue flows to the oil for food programme and failing to concentrate contracts on areas of greatest humanitarian need. UN reports confirm this. They blatantly sought to buy political support for the ending of the sanctions by offering contracts to foreign oil companies. They sought the dismantling of the sanctions regime without complying with the resolutions of the Security Council. What is the purpose of this determined and reckless stand, if not to intimidate and perhaps once again coerce their neighbours and those who stand against them?The authority of the Security Council must be upheld. Kofi Annan has said: "All states have a clear interest, as well as a clear responsibility, to uphold international law and to maintain international order." He could not have been more direct when he said last September: "If Iraq's defiance continues, the Security Council must face its responsibilities." This has been clear from the beginning. In the debate which took place in this House on 24 July 1946 when Ireland decided to apply for membership of the United Nations, Eamon de Valera stressed that Article 25 contained a serious obligation and went on to say that "we should be bound to take whatever action  the Security Council should decide upon, and to participate in the enforcement measures . . . " He then commented on the difficulties which would be created for the effectiveness of the UN where "nations want to have it both ways. They want to have the advantages of collective security and of avoiding obligations."Ireland long ago reached the decision that it would live up to its responsibilities as a country proud to be a member of the United Nations. We took this decision on grounds of principle, acting on the belief that nations can order the conduct of international relations so as to deter aggression and remove threats to international peace and security. We also adopted this course on the grounds of national self-interest, knowing that the safety and prosperity of small countries in particular require an international order based on justice and law and respect for the less powerful.The United Nations is a body committed to the maintenance of international peace and security, but it is not a pacifist organisation. The Security Council is empowered under Chapter VII of the charter to determine the existence of any threat to the peace and to decide what measures are necessary to restore international peace and security. These measures may include the use of force where sanctions and other means of pressure have failed. No one is under any illusion that military action provides a desirable solution. On the contrary, force must be used only as a last resort when all other means have been exhausted. Ireland very much wants to see a peaceful solution to this crisis. This is why Ireland, together with our fellow members of the Security Council, made such an effort to agree Resolution 1441 on 8 November last. This resolution was adopted unanimously by all 15 members of the Council, including Syria, an Arab state and Iraq's neighbour.The resolution brings the entire issue of the use of military force back within the framework of the United Nations. It gives Iraq a final opportunity to demonstrate that it has rid itself of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons as it has been required to do by successive Security Council resolutions. It is designed to avert war. However, the resolution makes it clear that Iraq will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations. In other words, the risk of war can be avoided if Iraq complies fully with the terms of the resolution. The decision is in Iraq's hands. The resolution sent the arms inspectors back into Iraq with a strengthened mandate to complete their task. It requires Iraq to make a complete and accurate declaration of all holdings of prohibited weapons or programmes to develop them and to co-operate fully in the implementation of the resolution and with the arms inspectors. If Iraq should fail to meet these conditions, then the Security Council is to convene immediately to assess any alleged material breach of Iraq's obligations, to consider the situation arising, and to decide upon any  further steps necessary to bring about full compliance with its resolutions.The resolution does not specify that a further resolution is required to authorise the use of force. This would simply not have been acceptable to either Britain or America, both of whom hold veto power on the council, and was not attainable. These two countries have long held the view that earlier Security Council resolutions already mandate the use of force and that no further authorisation is required. There is no international legal consensus on the validity of the different interpretations. There is no definitive position of the international community on what is still a hypothetical question. Regardless of the legal arguments which have been advanced on both sides, Ireland considers that there is an overriding political need for the Security Council to determine whether its resolutions have been breached and to take a further decision on what measures should be adopted in response.Resolution 1441 makes clear that any material breach of Iraq's obligations will come before the Security Council for consideration. We hope that this will inhibit the use of force without a further decision of the council. Deputies will recall that in the months before this resolution was adopted, there was a widespread expectation of unilateral use of force by the United States among some commentators. Today the issue is still before the Security Council and efforts continue in the council to secure a peaceful solution in line with the terms set out in the resolutions. War can be averted and is not inevitable if Iraq divests itself of its weapons of mass destruction now.Nevertheless, the Government's amendments to the motion before the House make clear that in the event of military action being initiated against Iraq, either with or without further UN sanction, the Government, having reviewed the situation, will initiate a debate in this House on the position to be adopted by Ireland. All of us in this House hope that military conflict can be avoided. It has to be said, however, that there is still some considerable way to go before this danger can be averted. On 7 December the Iraqi Government submitted its declaration on weapons of mass destruction to the Security Council. Two days ago, the arms inspectors made a report updating the council on the progress of inspections. The report delivered by the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency, Dr. El Baradei, was fairly positive and took the view that Iraq does not have any current nuclear weapons programme. However, he did cite the need for more active Iraqi co-operation with the inspectors.The report delivered by Dr. Blix, head of UNMOVIC, the main weapons inspection body, was far less positive and raised a number of serious questions. He pointed out that Resolution 1441 required Iraqi co-operation to be immediate, unconditional and active. He then made it clear that such co-operation had not been forth coming. Dr. Blix reported in his own words that "Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptance – not even today – of the disarmament which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace." He went on to say that "Iraq has decided in principle to provide co-operation on process, notably access," but that "[a] similar decision is indispensable to provide co-operation on substance."He then listed a whole series of areas where the Iraqi declaration is incomplete or Iraq has failed to produce evidence to support its claims that it has destroyed weapons or that they are absent. He pointed out that it was for Iraq to produce credible evidence to this effect and not for the inspectors to prove the contrary. Among the discrepancies he listed were 6,500 chemical bombs containing 1,000 tonnes of chemical agent, holdings of VX nerve gas precursors, quantities of anthrax and 650 kilograms of bacterial growth media sufficient to produce 5,000 litres of concentrated anthrax as well as numbers of Scud missiles and further missile development. Iraq's account so far is simply not believable and that is not acceptable. The arms inspectors are not in Iraq to play hide-and-seek with the authorities. They are there to verify that Iraq's claims to have disarmed are true and can be demonstrated. It is not the inspectors' job to search for evidence of Iraqi wrongdoing and deception. It is for the Iraqis to prove they have in fact done what they claim to have done. The Iraqis were known to be in possession of well-documented quantities of weapons. Where are those weapons now? The sums have to add up, and Dr. Blix has made it clear that as of now they do not add up. Instead there are glaring discrepancies.The Iraqis are not being asked to do the impossible. They are being asked for normal documentary proof or, failing that, simple human testimony that they have actually destroyed these weapons. They cannot expect the rest of the world just to accept their word without a shred of evidence that these weapons have been destroyed. Nothing Iraq has done merits such trust. It is deeply worrying that Iraq is not prepared to co-operate actively with the inspectors as it is required to do under Resolution 1441. This is not new, however.Regrettably, the record shows that the regime in Baghdad responds only to the threat of military action in the face of further non-compliance. For that threat to be credible, it has to be real and visible. When Deputy Gormley says that I have blood on my hands, to which I take grave exception, he should know that Kofi Annan, the Secretary General of the United Nations, who has done more than any other individual to prevent war, has made the same point. Only two weeks ago, he said:I would want to make a distinction between pressure and the threat of use of force and the actual use of force. I think there is no doubt in anyone's mind that the pressure has been effec tive, has worked, and without that pressure, I do not think inspectors would be back in Iraq today.The military build-up in the Gulf has to be seen in that context. If Deputy Gormley is not prepared to say that Kofi Annan has blood on his hands, he should not claim I do when I say the same thing.We have all heard what the President of the United States had to say in Washington yesterday. Even those who disagree with him should be able to recognise his determination. War is avoidable but the plain fact, evident to all except the leadership in Baghdad, is that Iraq will no longer be allowed to evade its disarmament obligations. Anyone, however well intentioned or motivated, whose positions have the effect of encouraging the Iraqi leadership to believe it can evade its disarmament obligations serves only to increase the likelihood of war.I expect arms inspectors to be given more time to test the willingness of the Iraqi authorities to co-operate fully and proactively with them. We consider that they should be given as much time as they reasonably consider to be both necessary and useful. It is clear that the inspections will not go on forever in the absence of progress, nor was this envisaged. It should be for the Security Council to make a determination as to whether the exercise continues to be worthwhile. It is for Iraq to respond truthfully, effectively and promptly.The Iraqi leadership pretends it can do nothing to stop an attack. This is not true. Saddam Hussein still has time to defuse this conflict by accepting the rule of law and accounting for his extraordinary discrepancies in the record of Iraq's weapons holdings. It is time for him to end the evasion and special pleading, if not for the sake of the United Nations, for the future and well-being of his people.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	590	When Resolution 1441 was agreed by the United Nations Security Council, including Ireland, few voices, if any, were raised here against multilateralism, that is United Nations solidarity. The difficulty I have with the motion before the House is that it makes no mention of multilateralism, that is approved UN action against the Iraqi regime. In his paper, Iraq, Consequences of a War, Paul Rogers of Bradford University sets out the possible consequences of a war with Iraq for the civilian population. The  paper, which was forwarded to Members by Trócaire, is graphic and horrifying. No Member of this House wants to see such consequences.The way to prevent such consequences in Iraq or anywhere else is to have good order and democratic institutions whose authority is respected and upheld. The UN, with all its faults, is such an institution. We cannot expect others to be bound by UN resolutions if we, in turn, will not be bound by them. Eleven million people signed a petition in Britain in the 1930s seeking appeasement of Hitler. The number of people who support or oppose an issue does not indicate the rightness or moral worth of such an issue. If the UN passes a new resolution authorising attack against Iraq we in Dáil Éireann must have our say as to whether we will authorise the use of facilities here for such an attack. Let us be aware, therefore, that we cannot have it both ways. The day may be coming when we will be asked to decide.If, however, unilateral action by the United States supported by Britain is taken, I have no hesitation in proposing that Dáil Éireann denies facilities such as refuelling and overflight. This brings me to the current use of Shannon Airport. Much has been made of US soldiers bringing arms and weaponry with them via Shannon. Is this really relevant?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Yes, it is.

If there is an argument for preventing troops from using Shannon, it should apply regardless of whether they have weapons.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	594	The Government's usual doublespeak on this matter has been appalling. If US troops go to the region, they may have the effect of preventing war or Saddam Hussein may get or be given the message by his own people. Alternatively, if the UN sanctions attack against Iraq, those troops may be used to carry out a UN mandate. We will certainly not be volunteering to carry out that UN mandate. What is the message to Saddam Hussein? Have we not read Dr. Hans Blix's comments, as reported in Tuesday's edition of The Irish Times which states:Iraq does not accept UN disarmament. Iraq has failed to account for 6,500 chemical bombs. There are strong indications that Iraq has produced more anthrax than declared. There is evidence that Iraq has weaponised VX nerve gas.There is no mention in the motion this evening about those quotes from Dr. Hans Blix.Speaking in the Dáil on 23 October 2002, I said:The attitude taken by the United Nations towards the Iraqi dictatorship on its activity is one of the most important items on the international security agenda and may well become the most important. As the attitude of the public on the first Nice treaty referendum has shown, it is no longer acceptable for the Government to make decisions of such vital importance without the authority of the people as expressed in the Oireachtas and, specifically, in Dáil Éireann, given the role which Bunreacht na h-Éireann reserves to the Dáil.I went on to set out the key five measures of concern:First, unilateral action against Iraq by any state is not acceptable. Action, if taken, must have multilateral support and must be authorised in the appropriate way through the UN Security Council. I was alarmed to read recently in a survey that a sizeable proportion of the Irish population is not only against unilateral action, but is also against multilateral action, even if duly authorised through the United Nations. This is an untenable position for Ireland to hold.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	595	No, it is not.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I stated that Ireland should support a UN resolution in relation to weapons inspections in Iraq. That has been adopted as Resolution 1441. I said:If this resolution is not adhered to Ireland should participate in the debate on a further resolution, setting out the action to be taken by the UN to meet such failure. We cannot have it both ways and this approach will allow us to explore, to the maximum extent possible, all other avenues before considering the authorisation of military intervention.The second point I made was in relation to independent verification. I said:I was interested to note the Blair dossier on Iraq which was presented in September to the British Parliament. That dossier contained some information that was already in the public domain and made various claims. These claims include that Iraq: continues to produce chemical and biological agents, has military plans for the use of chemical weapons and has command and control arrangements to use them; has tried covertly to acquire technology and materials which could be used in the production of nuclear weapons, has sought significant quantities of uranium from Africa – despite having no active civil nuclear power programme that would require it – has recalled specialists to work on its nuclear programme and has constructed a new engine test stand for the development of missiles capable of reaching parts of the EU. These are British claims and must be treated with some caution  but if they are correct and can be verified they are of the first concern.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I continued:The concerns being expressed by the US and British Governments are grave. To assist the Dáil in any consideration we may have to make in support of Ireland's stand at the UN Security Council, the Government should seek to independently verify the claims being made and make such independent verification available to Dáil Éireann. The sources for such independent verification could be the common foreign and security resources of the EU; its support structures and information gathering facilities; the United Nations itself, where our representatives have access to representatives of all countries, large and small; our resident embassies abroad; and non-governmental organisations and churches which have their own network.The key question for Europe now is whether it decides its response on the basis of co-operation or otherwise with the US unilateral action or whether we are prepared to take a role as a regional organisation in contributing to world security under the auspices of the United Nations.The third point I made was that we must make it clear that we stand with civilised states against demagogues and dictators. In particular, we must remember the enormity of what happened on 11 September 2001 in the United States and the ongoing campaign of terrorism, as demonstrated in Yemen and Bali, and perhaps attempted more recently in London.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	599	What about state terror?

The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has set up a group under David Begg, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, to look at this issue. I hope it will be a Presidency priority for us next year.We must stand up against anti-Americanism. When we wanted US intervention on this island we got it. The United States played a major part in bringing about the Good Friday Agreement and in bringing peace to this island. It has over the years welcomed our emigrants and its businessmen have invested heavily in our country, providing much employment. I am not suggesting that we should be beholden to or blinded by the US, nor am I suggesting that we should be bought by it. However, we should be fair in our assessment.Srebrenica was not sorted out by the neutral countries, such as Ireland, or even by the EU; it  was sorted out by NATO, led by the US while cowardly, self-serving European and Irish politicians spoke in the most hypocritical and unpardonable language imaginable.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	602	Not even the atrocities of Srebrenica moved them from their self-serving and self-satisfied outpourings. They asked where the crowd was going and how they could get ahead of it faster than anybody else.The fourth point I made was that we need an independent assessment of Ireland's and Europe's security and defence needs. This will not come about as a result of courageous leadership in this House because we have, in the main, been cowed into outbidding each other by eulogising neutrality to the advantage of politicians while denuding the people of even the most basic capacity for self-defence.Prior to 11 September 2001, the American public was quite cosy about the fact that its internal flights lacked any form of real security. It found out to its horror it had to pay for it. We are similarly cosy about our neutrality. However, unlike other neutral states, we are not prepared to defend our neutrality and therefore we are probably the least-defended state in Europe. If we knew a plane was taking off from anywhere within or without our jurisdiction and was to be used to target either a facility within the State or a facility outside it, such as Sellafield, which would have disastrous consequences for us all, we would not have the capacity to deal with it, even if we had notice in advance. We are soon to have the second highest income per capita in an EU with 27 members but our Government has failed to do its first duty, namely to provided for the security of its citizens. That is the issue we should be debating tonight. An appalling lack of leadership has been demonstrated.I called on the Government to appoint a committee of wise persons to examine independently the security needs of Ireland and Europe and to report directly to the Dáil, not the Government. Such a committee should examine the role Ireland should play as one of the architects in bringing about a security architecture in Europe which meets our concerns and needs. We have been running away from this issue for far too long. It is an issue of urgent public policy and concern and should be addressed without further delay.The European Union should consider what its contribution should be to Iraq when, at last, it is freed of the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi people were forced in recent months, in a so-called referendum in which they had to show their votes publicly, to fully endorse Saddam Hussein. Is this the action of a free people? The three main elements of Iraqi society – Sunni Muslims, Shiite Muslims and Kurds – are kept together within the Iraqi borders by a mixture of cajoling and oppression. Succession from any  state has serious implications for neighbouring states. Succession from Iraq could have serious implications for Turkey and Iran and other parts of the region.The EU is already heavily involved in the Middle East and is trying to bring about a settlement between the Palestinians and the Israelis. It should now be examining ways and means to assist Iraq in the event that Saddam Hussein falls. That should not be left to the Americans and should be well under way.I hope that the five points I set out last October will be and have been given consideration by the Government and that when the time comes, as it likely will, for a decision to be made by Ireland on the role of the UN in Iraq, we will be in a position to make an informed one based on reason, good judgment and the rule of law. All we have had so far are statements on Iraq. We need to be able to question our Government so our deliberations and decisions are informed. I have repeated the five points I made last October because I want to remind the Government of Fine Gael's concern. Furthermore, what has the Minister done to address these concerns? What information and advice does he have for the House?I call on the Government to respond to my five points. It has had three months notice. I want the Minister to make himself available for a question and answer session so these issues will be addressed in the House. These are matters that run to the heart of the constitutional role of Dáil Éireann. Fine Gael has set out in the motion before the House the issues it believes must be addressed by the House.I was more than surprised by the last point in the Minister's amendment, which seems to indicate that he is moving away from the multilateralist policy he has been espousing in recent months and is open to asking this House to support unilateral action. That support will not be forthcoming from my party.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I thank Deputy Gay Mitchell for sharing his time. As the Member of this House who resides closest to Shannon Airport, I have a special interest in what has been happening there. I am totally against war, as is the majority of people in Ireland and the US. However, the refuelling of military and commercial flights has been part of Shannon Airport's business for many years. This is because it is located on the eastern Atlantic seaboard, and refuelling has helped build up our airport and the local economy to what it is today. About 40% of the airport's business is depending on refuelling.I accept that there has been a substantial increase in US military flights in recent times, but 35 other countries have had military aircraft refuel in Shannon in 2001. This is a very complex issue for the people of Clare and the surrounding areas and it is not as straightforward as people claim. Stopping the US military planes refuelling, as some people demand, will not solve the prob lem. Sixty percent of the industries in the Shannon free zone are American. This was brought to my attention by the many phone calls I have had from constituents whose livelihoods depend on the jobs provided by these companies.

We must recognise the good work done by former President Clinton in the Northern Ireland peace process. I agree that the Americans should abide by the air navigation Acts. I believe the Minister, Deputy Cowen, should have instructed US commercial carriers to comply with Irish law much sooner than he did.I am worried by the many breaches in security in Shannon Airport in recent times and as late as this morning when €500,000 worth of damage was done to a United States aircraft. I condemn this, as should every Member of the House, because if we do not we are encouraging others to do damage as well.

#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Furthermore, I am delighted the Minister has said he will improve security at Shannon Airport because that is what is needed. Last week we were informed of 15 people who breached security at a US military base in England. While security cannot be fully guaranteed, I suspect that it will be increased at the airport. Transferring refuelling facilities to another European location will not prevent the anticipated war on Iraq. What is happening at Shannon Airport is not breaking the UN resolution. Every effort must be concentrated on giving the UN inspectors extra time in Iraq and to push the Americans into co-operating under a UN mandate. The EU can play a very important role in preventing a war. Shannon must not be used as a pawn.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise the matter of the disastrous closure of the Square D factory in Ballinasloe two weeks ago. I bring to the floor of the House the enormous anxiety and fear shared by the almost 400 people who have lost their jobs and face the dole queue in a couple of months' time. I must tell the Minister that there is great anger in Ballinasloe where people in the town and its hinterland genuinely believe that the Government has let them down. No amount of camouflaging can disguise  that. The Celtic tiger boom was a time of unprecedented job creation, but not alone did Ballinasloe not attract industrial jobs, over the past five years it lost almost 1,000 jobs, beginning with substantial redundancies in the local psychiatric hospital. Just over two years ago a further 350 jobs were lost at the AT Cross factory and this latest news sees almost a further 400 watch their employment disappear before their eyes.I question the sincerity of the Government and the Tánaiste's intention to bring an industrial project to the town. The Tánaiste is a native of the area and this matter has been put to her on numerous occasions over the past five to six years without result. I also question the sincerity of IDA Ireland. Since the closure of the Digital factory in Galway seven or eight years ago, there has been a massive explosion in the number of new industrial jobs created in the city, but not one has come to Ballinasloe. It is very difficult to understand why some industrialists could not be convinced to locate in a town which has an excellent workforce, swimming and leisure facilities, an excellent golf club, excellent shopping facilities, a new marina and inexpensive housing relative to Galway and Dublin. The town has a mainline railway station and excellent primary and postprimary schools.Whatever the reason, the Government seems to want to turn its back on Ballinasloe, but it was there last week that I saw the biggest public meeting I have ever seen in any town in the constituency in all my years in politics. Thousands of people came out in a spontaneous response to what they see as the death of their town. The crowd included the workers, their families, community leaders and politicians. Everybody who has anything to do with the well-being of Ballinasloe was in the town square the other night.The people of Ballinasloe feel very angry on another level and I ask the Minister of State to relay that to the Government. While the Government says it has no control over industrialists, although I do not believe that in so far as IDA Ireland is concerned, it is within its power to decentralise. When the Government announced its national spatial strategy before Christmas, Ballinasloe was omitted for some unknown reason. On one side, Athlone was looked after and Galway was taken care of on the other, but Ballinasloe was ignored. There is a new unity of purpose in Ballinasloe and the various bodies and authorities are welded together with a common aim under the county manager, Donal O'Donoghue. Everything that can be done locally will be done, but Ballinasloe must receive outside help from the Government to ensure that it gets an anchor industry to replace what has been lost and to give some hope to the people who have lost their jobs in Square D and AT Cross.The Government will have an opportunity when the decentralisation of Departments is announced to make sure that, for once, Ballinasloe is not overlooked. It will not be able to hide on this because it is within its remit. We do not  want something small, it must be a substantial section of a Department.
#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The announcement of the closure of Square D came as a huge shock to Ballinasloe and east Galway. I sympathise with all 385 workers of Square D who constituted a great workforce. Square D was a great factory. I also sympathise with the management of the company who are also unemployed. They provided excellent jobs at the factory for 31 years – my wife was employed there for ten years.I express my thanks to the Tánaiste for meeting a deputation from Ballinasloe last week, every member of which was encouraged by her promise to get each Department, IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Board and FÁS to help to provide employment for the town. The loss of 385 jobs comes after the closure of AT Cross one and a half years ago, a company which employed more than 300 workers. These losses have the same effect on Ballinasloe as the loss of Digital had on Galway some years ago.The town needs help, but we do not intend to lie down and die. Ballinasloe has much to offer. It is situated on the N6, 40 miles nearer to Dublin than Galway. It has great hotels, a marina, new educational facilities and a new swimming pool and leisure centre which has almost been completed. Houses are good value, there are no traffic problems, there are 80,000 square feet of factory space at Square D and a workforce which is prepared to adjust and train to suit other employment. The AT Cross factory is also lying idle and there is a new IDA Ireland business park. Ballinasloe is ideally situated for decentralisation and I appeal to the Minister for Finance to transfer a worthwhile Department to the town. The people of Ballinasloe will welcome civil servants.I call on the Tánaiste to redouble her efforts to bring new industry to the town and to help other employers there to expand. A number of small industries in the town are hoping to grow with her help and the enterprise centre in the town is doing great work. Ballinasloe should get extra incentives to attract new industry. There is no point putting more industry into cities which are choked with traffic when Ballinasloe has so much to offer. As a local Deputy, I call on everybody to work together to promote and market the town to attract new industry and decentralisation. I compliment Galway's county manager, Donal O'Donoghue, and Ballinasloe town council who have brought together all the agencies in the area to promote the town. Together, we will ensure Ballinasloe returns to prosperity.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I thank the Deputies for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The announcement by Square D on 15 January 2003 to close its Ballinasloe plant by the end of June 2003 with the loss of all 387 jobs on its books cannot be described as anything other than  a body blow for the workforce, their families and the local community. It is very much a priority for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that everything possible will be done to find new investment and new sources of employment for Ballinasloe, although I know this will not be an easy task.Established in 1971, the Ballinasloe facility manufactures the Square D brand of electrical circuit breakers, sold primarily within North American markets. The closure decision, according to the company, reflects significant change in market demand for circuit breakers, resulting in over-capacity in manufacturing operations at the group's North American division. A number of the group's North American manufacturing operations have already been moved to Mexico.In an effort to lessen the impact of the closure, the North American division of the parent company, Schneider Electric, has stated that it is committed to working with IDA Ireland and the Irish authorities to find manufacturing firms that are interested in the Ballinasloe plant and may be in a position to offer suitable job opportunities to a well-qualified workforce; assist Ballinasloe employees obtain new jobs; provide out-placement assistance and job search training; provide counsel and information to employees on company-paid benefits; and provide five weeks severance pay per year of service, in addition to statutory redundancy entitlement. The agencies under the remit of the Minister and her Department are also working to lessen the impact of the closure. IDA Ireland has been aware of the difficult market conditions being experienced by the company for some time and began to intensify discussions late in 2002, when it became apparent that the company was in difficulty. The IDA has already brought one potential client to view the plant and will continue to explore other possibilities as well as seeking out other potential clients.FÁS, the national training authority, has already been in contact with the company and is to meet the company management with a view to offering its services to all staff. FÁS will register people as job seekers, provide career information and guidance and carry out a training needs analysis. It will provide a range of training courses which will be designed to meet the skills needs of individuals to enhance their employability, while also providing the area with a skilled workforce. Enterprise Ireland began discussions with the company last week to discuss supports for any possible start-ups by local senior management.The industrial development agencies were working hard in Ballinasloe, prior to the closure announcement. The IDA was already active in the promotion of Ballinasloe for new inward investment, with the key focus being on providing international standard property solutions in the town to attract new companies. In light of the closure of Square D, the IDA has now finalised plans and a planning application has been lodged with Galway County Council for a new 27,000 sq.  ft. technology unit on the IDA's 30 acre business park in Ballinasloe. When planning permission is granted, construction will be undertaken by private developers and the IDA has already begun to actively market this facility together with promoting the Square D facility in the town.Enterprise Ireland has approved funding of €120,000 for the work in progress at the community-owned enterprise centre and it is understood that there is still some space available for potential projects. The Galway County and City Enterprise Board has been actively involved in industrial and community development in Ballinasloe. During 2002, considerable progress was made with the area community development group with €63,000 allocated to the small business development park, which now houses four start-up businesses. Over the last three years Ballinasloe has received €350,000 in support from the county enterprise board.At Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology and Galway university, there are enterprise platform programmes with places available for staff of Square D who might have an idea to start up their own manufacturing or internationally traded services businesses. This programme affords the opportunity to develop business plans and to carry out market research for ideas before actually starting a business. A similar programme is about to commence in the Athlone Institute of Technology.In regard to development in the Galway area, it is significant that five new IDA investment supported proposals, announced in 2002, will ultimately provide almost 2,200 new high quality jobs in the health care and internationally traded services sector. The companies concerned are Abbott, Churchill, Medtronic, Micros and Net IQ. Recognising that urban environments are generally more attractive for mobile investments, the IDA has adopted a target of having 50% of all new greenfield investment located in the Objective One region. It has sought to encourage investments in defined sectors to specific regions, which seeks to build on the relative advantages in different towns. An essential part of this endeavour has been the refining of IDA property offerings. This is a key tool in winning investments.The IDA has, and is continuing to design and develop, high quality business parks, fully serviced up to international standards. In Tuam, the IDA has acquired 27 acres and is currently carrying out site development works after which it intends to have a high quality facility provided by the private sector. At Loughrea it is upgrading land to make it more marketable. In Gort it has a 20,000 sq. ft. high quality building which it is actively promoting for suitable projects.While the IDA is convinced that it has excellent quality property solutions in the larger towns in the county, it is also cognisant of the slower inward investment climate that has prevailed for the past two years. This also has had an impact on jobs in existing client companies. Much pro gress has been recorded over the past several years in many of the companies that have been attracted here, in the shift up the value chain in many of the companies and in many aspects of our competitiveness.Costs are a big issue for all companies. They have moved out of line with our competitors, and this impacts heavily on lower technology businesses. Hence, the IDA has a major emphasis on the health care and internationally traded services sectors. There is now a well developed health care cluster in the west region, especially in Galway, which includes companies like Transition Optical in Tuam, StarGuide in Oranmore, Medtronic, Boston Scientific and Abbott in Galway city.Working with the third level institutes in the area, Enterprise Ireland has approved €2.6 million for the development of campus incubator units at Galway/Mayo Institute of Technology in Galway and €695,000 for units in the National University of Ireland, Galway. Some €2.54 million has also been approved for the development of units at Athlone Institute of Technology. These incubation centres support the development and expansion of campus company activity, encourage and support the commercialisation of research and development carried out in the institutes of technology and embed the institutes of technology as major supports for the development of high-tech companies in the regions.All of the State agencies under the auspices of the Minister's Department will continue to work closely in the interests of developing Ballinasloe. The Minister has met with many of the Ballinasloe interest groups and hopes to do so again in the near future, to reassure them of her ongoing commitment and that she will continue to work on their behalf.

#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The Minister for Health and Children must act as a matter of urgency to address the severe staffing shortage at St. Mary's residential care facility at Drumcar, County Louth, and to ensure that the residents at the centre have all the personnel and other resources they need to live with dignity and safety. As I speak, thousands of people, including the families of over 250 people with physical and intellectual disabilities resident at Drumcar, are sick with worry about the welfare and safety of their loved ones. The consultants' report published yesterday highlights the unacceptable conditions which exist for many residents in Drumcar as a direct result of understaffing. Understaffing leads to inadequate supervision, inappropriate mixing of residents with very different abilities and disabilities, including very aggressive individ uals with passive and introverted individuals, the overuse of restraints in some cases, the leaving of some residents locked up and unattended at night, and increased risk of mortality from fire.We can only imagine the distress to the people concerned, the residents of Drumcar, because they cannot articulate it. However, we are aware of the distress to their relatives and friends. This afternoon I was contacted by two sisters from County Cavan, in my constituency, whose brother is a resident in Drumcar. Their aged parents are infirm and in their twilight years, yet they have again been visited with the deep anxiety which never leaves the parents of people with severe disabilities, but which is alleviated by the care and concern shown in facilities such as that in Drumcar, when they have the proper resources to provide that care.My brother, Dermot, who has Down's syndrome, spent many years as a resident at St. Mary's and our family has great appreciation and admiration for the religious and secular staff of dedicated carers. I emphasise that in raising this matter I am in no way critical of the staff and management of St. Mary's – quite the opposite. They are a dedicated, hard working, committed and well trained staff, eager to deliver an excellent service to the residents. However, they are prevented from exercising their skills to the full because staff shortages often mean they can only carry out essential duties.The joint report of 1066 Consultancy and Healthcare Consultancy identifies clearly that the problem in Drumcar is caused by inadequate levels of staffing. Fr. Fintan Brennan-Whitmore of St. Mary's has accepted the findings of the report. I ask the Minister if he in turn accepts the recommendations of the report and the crying need for additional staff, and if he will act on them. When will the resources be provided to allow St. Mary's to engage the 30 additional staff for night duty necessary to deal with the serious and dangerous situation at night time? When will the 64 extra staff required for St. Mary's be provided to ensure a safe environment during the day?I must point out that the Department of Health and Children approved the engagement of the independent consultants who produced the report. These consultants have an international reputation and were engaged by the Minister for Health and Children last year to advise on the nursing crisis in the accident and emergency services.I am informed that for the past two years the St. John of God order has contracted the whole time equivalent of 23 nursing staff over and above their approved compliment in an effort to maintain the service, even at present levels. The commitment of the Order of St. John of God, the hospital order, is undoubted. It is my hope and that of the thousands of people I have referred to that the Minister will advise this House that he has, as Fr. Brennan Whitmore has, accepted the recommendations of this report, which the Minister sought. I hope the Minister will confirm that  he will provide the necessary resources to see these recommendations implemented with the urgency that is clearly required.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	613	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise this issue. The treatment of 250 mentally and physically handicapped patients at St. Mary's, Drumcar, County Louth, is a disgrace and should not be meted in a civilised society. Like the previous speaker, I complement the staff at St. Mary's and its head, Fr. Fintan Brennan Whitmore, for their initiative in commissioning this report to assist them in making their case to the Minister.The Minister should immediately sanction 100 extra staff, including 30 night nurses. It is not acceptable that patients are locked up and left unattended at night while staff deal with others, leaving epileptic and other high risk patients open to danger. As the consultancy report on the St. John of God-run home stated, in the event of a fire the mortality rate would inevitably be high and the organisation culpable. The chief fire officer for County Louth should examine the situation with regard to the fire hazards in the home.In St. Mary's, some of the patients are epileptic, some have IQ levels of less than 20, some are prone to injure themselves, some are autistic, some are schizophrenic, some in their 40s already have Alzheimer's disease and some are very aggressive. There is a need for fundamental change in the home. It is not acceptable and is inhuman that strait-jackets are used to restrain patients and that they are locked in rooms. That practice should have finished long ago but staff are forced to engage in it due to staff shortages. There is also a risk of harm to patients and staff due to lack of supervision. The Minister must address the situation where currently whole wings are left unattended, particularly at night, while staff struggle to cope with demand elsewhere, leaving residents at risk, particularly those with epilepsy and with the potential to self-harm.The overuse of mechanical restraints to subdue difficult patients during the day and particularly at night is likely to be in violation of European human rights directives. There is evidence that some staff more than others use restraint in the form of all-in-one suits as a matter of routine. The report also draws attention to the mixing of violent and aggressive residents with more passive and introverted patients, which puts the latter at a disadvantage as staff spend a greater percentage of their time with the demanding residents. It is unacceptable that those who are mentally retarded, passive and introverted are intimidated by more aggressive residents. Their quality of life is severely damaged because of this. Arrangements should immediately be put in place so that people live with those of similar disabilities and abilities.The report also draws attention to the lack of stimulation available to patients which is causing serious problems. As a consequence, their behav iour becomes more aggressive, destructive and violent. At night many of these residents are locked or shut in their rooms and unable to open the door unaided.Reading details of the report, the institution is more like a prison than an institution of support for the physically and mentally handicapped, and custodial practice has become the normal routine. Staff should ensure that they support the residents to lead a life that is as fulfilling as possible, including their physical, psychological, social and spiritual needs. This seems to be largely absent in this institution due to the lack of resources available to the Order of St. John of God.I ask the Minister to immediately sanction 30 whole time equivalent nursing staff to cover the night shift as a matter of urgency to ensure that the staffing levels do not put residents' safety at risk. The institution heavily relies on seasonal workers and is short of nursing staff and there is a lack of evident space for a clinical nurse specialist. The result is that practice is out of date, the care is custodial, restraint is common practice and residents' needs are not always met.The head of St. Mary's, Fr. Fintan Brennan-Whitmore, has conceded that it is a very difficult place for staff to work, that as patients get older their needs are greater. The Minister must immediately ensure that the conditions for these most vulnerable people are addressed by ensuring that Fr. Brennan-Whitmore and his staff have the necessary resources available.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	614	I thank Deputies Ó Caoláin and Neville for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the position concerning the issue. St. Mary's, Drumcar, is a specialist residential facility for people with an intellectual disability. There are 246 residents living in 28 separate units, with a wide range of problems from moderate to profound disabilities and an age range of 19 to 60.The Government has made a significant level of additional funding available to services for persons with an intellectual disability and autism. In 2003 additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to these services. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The figures are as follows, to the nearest million: €15 million in 1997; €14 million in 1998; €23 million in 1999; €49 million in 2000; €48 million in 2001; and €39 million in 2002. Additional capital funding of €139 million has  been made available since 1997. The additional funding provided between 1997 and 2002 was used to put in place about 1,700 new residential, 470 respite and 3,000 day places.Despite this very significant and unprecedented investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.Due to the changing profile of those who have been in services for many years there is a need to review issues such as staffing levels and skills mix. For example, an increased need for additional night cover has arisen in many agencies because of the more dependent profile of the residents, due to old age, illness or behavioural issues. An ongoing review process has been under way for a number of years with the health boards and the voluntary agencies, with funding allocated annually over recent years to meet these identified needs.The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.Responsibility for the provision of funding for organisations providing services for people with an intellectual disability or autism in the north-eastern region is a matter, in the first instance, for the North-Eastern Health Board. The situation in Drumcar will be discussed at a meeting between my Department and representatives of the health board on Tuesday, 4 February in the context of the board's service plan for 2003. A meeting between my Department, the health board and representatives of the St. John of God order is also scheduled for the following day. Within the resources available to the North-Eastern Health Board this year, I am hopeful that progress can be made at these meetings on the most pressing problems facing St. Mary's at present.The Dáil adjourned at 9.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 30 January 2003.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	615	As the Deputy is aware, the Government recently made very difficult choices in the area of the public finances. In making these decisions, the Government was not in a position to make as much money available for all programmes as we would all wish to see across the whole range of public expenditure.The average spend per annum on forestry for the period 1997-2002 was €90 million, with an increased spend of €107 million in 2002. The 2003 Estimates provide for expenditure of €82 million.While the funding available for forestry for the year 2003 will be less than what would have been expected, this does not take from the strong commitment on the part of the Government, as articulated in repeated programmes for Government, to afforestation policy in Ireland. The Government remains fully convinced of the long-term value of the forestry programme in terms of regional development, strong and sustainable local employment, import substitution and the environment. Over the past weeks my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for forestry, Deputy John Browne, has undertaken extensive consultation with representatives of the various groups right across the forest sector. Following this it has been decided to focus resources primarily on maintenance of a viable planting programme in 2003. This will initially mean some curtailment of a number of the schemes, including the native woodland and neighbour wood schemes. I expect to finalise arrangements in respect of such schemes as soon as possible.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	616	There is a wide range of technical conservation measures already in place in Community waters generally, including the Irish Box. I would also stress that a number of specific technical conservation measures involving closed and restricted areas have been implemented in recent years in the context of various recovery plans for cod and hake stocks in the Irish Sea, the Celtic Sea and also in waters off the north-west coast of Ireland. Separate from the issue of the Irish Box, to which I will return later, the Commission has presented a proposal for a new Council Regulation providing for the incorporation of all existing technical conservation measures in a comprehensive package together with a number of new measures to further protect juvenile cod and hake stocks in particular. Commissioner Fischler gave a presentation on this subject at the Fisheries Council yesterday. My view is that the Commission's proposal is highly technical and we are now examining it in detail. In that regard, I have asked my Department to work closely with BIM, the Marine Institute and with industry representatives in developing our approach. In that context  my Department has met the industry twice in the past two weeks to discuss the proposals.As such measures would apply to all Community fishermen, the introduction of such measures would not of themselves reduce the entry of new fishing fleets into the Irish Box. In relation to the Irish Box issue specifically, Ireland's position is that the existing western waters regime remains in place unless otherwise decided by Council. The Commission has tabled a proposal involving the elimination of the Irish Box which is totally unacceptable to me. My position is that any new regime must provide for the establishment of the Irish Box as a sensitive zone, with specific effort allocations based on recent fishing effort history.

Under the Act the board is required to publish a report of any investigation it undertakes into a marine casualty after having sought and received the observations of parties likely to be adversely affected by publishing the report. The Act provides for a copy of the board's report to be transmitted to me as soon as it is published. I am advised that under the statutory consultation procedure, a substantial volume of observations has been submitted. These are being assessed in detail by the board.I am also advised that the board intends to be in a position to publish the report within the statutory time limit of nine months from the date of notification of the casualties, that is no later than end April 2003. The Deputy will appreciate, therefore, that it would not be proper at this time for me to discuss any aspects of the board's investigation, but I assure him that I will respond quickly to any recommendations made by the board to improve maritime safety generally.

The Deputy will, however, be aware that the Revised Estimates for 2003 included major adjustments in marine spending. The very limited funds allocated to marine tourism in 2003 are already fully committed to a small number of flagship projects.The reduction in funding means that there will be no funds available for any additional marine infrastructure projects under the NDP marine tourism grant scheme in 2003. Dungarvan Town Council was informed of the position on 5 December last.

What is of immediate concern to me is the environmental impact of using fossil fuels and the putting in place of policies and measures to alleviate such impacts.The Government has elaborated on a number of such policies in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy and the national climate change strategy. In addition the recent setting up of Sustainable Energy Ireland as an independent, non-commercial State body focused exclusively on sustainable use of energy, including deployment of renewable energy sources, is an indication of Government resolve to see those policies implemented. This represents a good beginning on the road to a cleaner and more sustainable energy future.

Coastal mapping, which is associated with the study, may take longer and is dependent on the rate at which it is to be progressed. The process of appointing consultants is currently under way and it is anticipated that the contract will be awarded in early 2003.Priority coast protection works are being addressed in consultation with the local authorities concerned. I have approved a national coast protection programme for 2003 to utilise the Exchequer allocation of €1.072 million for the year and have advised the local authorities concerned. The question of what Exchequer funding may be available for coast protection works in 2004 or later will have to be decided by Government in due course.Legislative proposals to support the development and effective operation of integrated coastal zone management will be formulated by my Department in co-operation with the other public bodies concerned. My objective is to have these proposals published in 2004.

It is the task of the Commission for Communications Regulation to supervise access and interconnection among operators for the purpose of the provision of electronic communications services, including Internet access. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.Since the publication of the OECD report there have been a number of significant developments which should lead to a greater take-up of the Internet and broadband services. In accordance with the provisions of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, I published draft policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation in December 2002. It is my intention that the directions will focus on a number of key policy priorities for the Commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat rate Internet access. The public consultation process closed on 10 January and the all of the submissions received are presently being evaluated. I propose to issue the final directions shortly. I am confident that my initiative in this regard should bring about a substantial improvement on the current position in this area.

At the time I was informed of the difficulties which the company had experienced and the delays which resulted. The company has since indicated that one million items of mail, which were due for delivery before Christmas, were delayed and not delivered until early January. Most of these items were Christmas cards. Business mail was at all times prioritised and the usual level of service for this time of year was maintained for these customers.The major difficulties arose within the catchment area of the Dublin mails centre which handled 50 million items of mail during the Christmas period. The main reason for the delay in deliveries was due to operational changes at the Dublin mails centre. An Post has given an assurance that these delays will not be repeated. The Commission for Communications Regulation, which has statutory responsibility for the quality of service to customers within the reserved area, has also requested a report from An Post on this matter.
Question No. 131 answered with Question No. 129.

This is expressly stated and the regulations do not contain any time limit. Accordingly, as provided for in regulations 685/95 and 2027/95, the number of Spanish fishing vessels within the Irish Box is limited to 40 at any one time.

To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, my Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. These programmes have been designed following consultation with, and obtaining the support of, the various development agencies, including the IDA,  Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Údarás na Gaeltachta.In 1999, under the National Development Plan, 1994-1999, and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. Thirteen projects which rolled out broadband infrastructure nationwide to a value, both public and private funding, of €70 million were supported and are now completed.Under the National Development Plan, 2000-2006, approximately €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.A first call for proposals was run in 2000, and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. The projects involved are scheduled to be completed by the end of 2003 and will entail an overall investment of €160 million in broadband, leveraged from grant assistance of approximately €55 million. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, the development of regional e-commerce centres by Nevadatele, the extension by Esat of its national network, and the acceleration of the Esat roll-out of DSL in 40 locations.Under a second call for proposals held in 2001, €3.7 million has been made available to Eircom in respect of DSL roll-out at 14 exchanges nationwide. This will be of benefit to both the business sector and domestic users. I also understand that Eircom is rolling out DSL at 32 centres in the greater Dublin area and have DSL enabled 500,000 customer lines which will greatly facilitate the deployment of broadband nationwide.The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns around the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of always on, low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €60 million.

This information is based on the most recent forecast statement, entitled Generation Adequacy Report 2003-2009, which was published by ESB National Grid last November in accordance with section 38 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. The forecast statement has identified that it would be prudent, based on a median demand-low plant availability scenario, to obtain at least 300mw of centrally dispatched, large-scale plant by 2005 in order to maintain supply-demand balance.Under section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999, the CER, in carrying out its duties, is required to have regard to the need, inter alia, to secure that all reasonable demands for electricity by final customers are satisfied, in addition to promoting the continuity, security and quality of supplies of electricity. Given that at present there is no firm commitment from prospective participants to construct the amount of capacity required, the CER, in exercise of its responsibilities, published on its website in October 2002 a consultation process, Investment in new Electricity Generation Capacity. On foot of that process, the CER announced on 20 December 2002 that, following extensive consultation and having examined a number of options, it was of the view that the most appropriate approach to securing additional capacity is to award a contract to one or more successful bidders, through a competitive process for the purchase of 300mw – 400mw of electricity. The CER is also of the view that ESB, operating as the Public Electricity Supplier, PES, is best placed in the market to offer such a contract. The CER is currently developing the framework for the competitive process and for awarding the final contract with ESB PES. Further details will be published by the CER in the near future.

It is the task of the Commission for Communications Regulation to supervise access and interconnection among operators for the purpose of the provision of electronic communications services, including Internet access. My responsibility is for public policy in the sector within which these companies operate. The widest possible availability of competitive services has traditionally been an important objective of Irish telecommunications policy.My Department is exploring the potential of satellite and wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising VSAT and wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions are currently under way. WLAN is a technology that was originally developed for in-house use, such as office local area networks but is increasingly seen as an alternative technology in the delivery of broadband services. Five projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003.

Among the specific measures proposed are an increase in the minimum level of emergency stocks from 90 to 120 days of consumption; a central role for the Commission in deciding on the release of the member states' stocks in the event of a supply crisis or where prices spike in antici pation of such a crisis; a requirement that all member states should establish a national stockholding agency; liberalisation of the conditions under which stocks may be held in another member state; and the establishment of a system to monitor and study developments likely to effect the supply of oil and gas.Although consideration of this proposal is at a very early stage, it is already clear that there is widespread opposition among member states. There is particular concern to maintain harmony with the parallel arrangements in the International Energy Agency.

Some of these measures will be implemented in the immediate future while others will take a little longer. For example, I will shortly initiate a public consultation on a draft charter for RTE and RTE's statement of commitments and change management commitments for the current year will be agreed. In the first quarter of this year RTE are committed to finalising its new code of fair trading practice and to the appointment of a process auditor to its independent production unit. By the middle of the year RTE will have established an audience council.New legislation will be necessary to give effect to the decision to establish the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland as the single content regulator, to establish the special fund for public service broadcasting and to the establish RTE as a commercial state company. Work has already commenced in this regard.

Much of the Atlantic margin of our offshore is either untested or under-explored and every effort is being made to promote the exploration of these areas. These efforts face considerable obstacles. Unfortunately, the last 12 months have seen a very steep decline in exploration activity in north-west Europe. In Ireland there are now only seven offshore exploration licences in place – down from a peak of 32 just five years ago. In addition, western offshore areas are difficult to access and explore, in terms of water depth, distance from land and lack of infrastructure. These define both the difficulties and the challenge that face both the government and the industry.

It is my intention that the directions will focus on a number of key policy priorities for the commission in the short to medium term, including the introduction of flat rate internet access. The public consultation process closed on 10 January and all of the submissions received are currently being evaluated. Taking into account the submissions received, I propose to finalise and issue the policy directions shortly, in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

It is open to the landowners to proceed with planting without grant and premium payments. Consequently, as there is no statutory prohibition on the planting of trees on these sites, the question of compensation does not arise.

However, the mid-term review of the rural development plan to be undertaken in 2003 will afford an opportunity to look at the possible introduction of such a grant. The National Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, is currently carrying out a research project called BroadForm based at the Teagasc Research Centre, Kinsealy, County Dublin. The objectives of this research project are to determine the best regimes to produce top quality broadleaf timber and to critically examine all aspects of shaping, tending, and thinning. COFORD is also currently researching a guide to the utilisation of hardwood timber and expects to issue a report later this year.

However it is estimated that 15,000 hectares were planted of which up to 20% approximately consisted of broadleaves. My Department is committed to achieving a broadleaf planting target of 30% of total planting by the end of 2006 and I expect that the broadleaf mix in 2003 will reflect progress towards that objective. In relation to the proposed programme for 2003, I would refer the deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 121 of today's date.

The aim of the strategy is to develop forestry to a scale and in a manner which maximises its contribution to national economic and social well-being on a sustainable basis and which is compatible with the protection of the environment.At 1 March 2002 some 91% of the actions listed in the strategy had been implemented or were being implemented. The strategy is now seven years old and my Department will be undertaking a review which will cover, inter alia, planting and funding levels. Among the areas foremost in my thoughts as part of any review of the strategy will be ensuring that all three pillars of sustainable forest management, namely the social, environmental and economic aspects of forestry, are adequately and equitably addressed.

In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost of the Ballycotton harbour development plan. The proposed development is estimated to cost a total of €6 million. This includes the cost of constructing a marina. There is no funding available to my Department in 2003 under the fishery harbour development programme for works at Ballycotton pier. The question of funding works at Ballycotton pier post-2003 will be considered in the context of the funding available for fishery harbour development works and overall national priorities.The Deputy will be aware that Cork County Council applied for funding last year under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development including a marina of 18 berths at Ballycotton, County Cork. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, i.e. planning permission and foreshore lease, as required under the conditions for the scheme, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call following the receipt of the required permissions.

Specifically, the resolution calls upon the European Commission to undertake a broad consultation process, draw up an updated green paper, complete its examination within the current parliamentary term and to submit a proposal to the European convention so that the principle of freedom of the media may be given a stronger basis in the treaty. I look forward to the contribution of the Commission in that regard.In so far as the broadcasting sector in Ireland is concerned, the Radio and Television Act 1988 and the Broadcasting Act 2001 requires the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland to formulate and apply a policy that takes account of ownership and diversity of content. Following a wide consultation process the Commission published a policy statement on ownership and control which sets out the Commission's overall policy objectives and provides a clear decision making framework for dealing with issues impacting on the freedom and the diversification of the broadcast media in Ireland.

The industry accepts that measures must be put in place for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of these stocks. The debate at EU level centres around the appropriate mechanisms for achieving this objective.The Commission advocates a policy of large-scale restrictions on days at sea leading to decommissioning of fishing vessels. I believe this approach is disproportionate and not the best method to achieve a sustainable exploitation approach to fish stocks. The socio-economic effects of such simplistic policies cannot be ignored and I have consistently stressed to my EU Council colleagues and to Commissioner Fischler the unacceptable socio-economic affects which such policies would have on Irish fishermen and their families. At the December Fisheries Council a restriction of days at sea was introduced as part of a cod recovery plan, on a temporary basis, for part of the fishing grounds off Donegal.

My Department wrote to all coastal local authorities in 2002 requesting proposals, in order of priority, for consideration in the context of the 2003-2006 coast protection programmes. Fingal County Council submitted a proposal for works at Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, ranked at number one and estimated to cost a total of €125,000. In 2002, my Department contributed €37,487.86 towards the total cost of €49,983.81 of materials purchased by Fingal County Council for protection works at Velvet Strand, Portmarnock, which, I understand, will commence shortly. The results of these works will have to be assessed to establish what, if any, further works are required in the area in question.

As part of its overall arrangements to manage and develop Irelands strategic stocks, NORA has a contract with the owner of the Whiddy Island terminal to store 500,000 tonnes of oil products there, involving seven tanks or half of the terminals total capacity. With the recent acquisition by the agency of approximately 130,000 tonnes of kerosene, NORAs contracted capacity at Whiddy is now fully utilised and I understand that the agency has no immediate plans to extend its holdings at the terminal. Indeed I am conscious that if NORA was to increase its share of capacity utilisation at the terminal this could impair opportunities for developing any commercial activity there.

To this end, the directive agrees common criteria for inspecting ships which use a port of the Community. These criteria comply with the undertakings given by the authorities of the member states under the Paris memorandum of understanding on port state control.One of the directive's key provisions on port state control of ships lays down that at least 25% of the number of foreign ships entering the ports of a member state should be inspected. In Ireland, 400 port state control inspections were carried out in 2002 which represents an inspection rate of 30%. The corresponding figures for 2000 and 2001 are 14.6% and 21% respectively.

I understand that representatives of the forestry sector met recently with officials from the insurance industry to discuss the insurance needs of the sector and that further meetings are scheduled. I am hopeful that the forestry representatives can negotiate suitable insurance cover for the contractors. I should point out that employer and public liability insurance cover is available to a limited number of members of the Irish Forestry Contractors Association through a group insurance scheme. Contractors working for Coillte can avail of insurance cover through another group scheme.

In 2000, the value of cattle output accounted for about 29% of total goods output at producer prices in the agriculture sector. In 2002, the early estimate for the agricultural accounts valued it at about 26%. Goods output at producer prices values the output of the agricultural sector at the price received by the farmer. It excludes subsidies and levies. In 2000, the gross output of the industrial sector "production and preserving of beef and veal" amounted to €1,915 million. This represents about 2.1% of the total gross output of the manufacturing industry sector.

This survey will serve as the main source of statistics on poverty and related issues throughout the Union. However, examination of the proposal has been slower than originally expected and the regulation will not now be adopted until the middle of this year. As a result, the mandatory starting date for the surveys has been put back to January 2004, although countries in a position to commence in 2003 are encouraged to do so. These surveys will replace the voluntary European Community household panel surveys which were conducted in most EU countries, including Ireland, up until 2001.The allocation to the CSO in the Abridged Estimates Volume for 2003 did not include explicit provision for conducting the survey in 2003. However, a range of Departments concerned with social inclusion and combating poverty considered that priority should be given to commencing the survey in 2003. Accordingly, discussions are ongoing about a transfer of a total of €900,000 from the budgets of nine Departments to the CSO and this, together with a grant of approximately €300,000 from the EU Commission, should enable the office to start the survey in June of this year.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I propose to take Questions Nos. 178, 182, 188 and 190 together.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	667	A work permit in respect of the individual concerned has issued and has been forwarded to the employer.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	668	I have a strong appreciation of the situation of many of our emigrants overseas and have had an engagement with many emigrant groups in the UK and have been fully supportive of their efforts. In particular, my involvement with the Díon fund enabled me to see and resource the focused and locally-delivered assistance and capacity-building which the fund supports. I have been able to dramatically increase the level of funding to Díon over the past few years. It was IR£500,000 for many years and only reached IR£750,000 in 1999. I managed to increase it above the £1 million level in 2000, above the £2 million level in 2001, and maintained it at that level in real terms in 2002.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	669	A number of developments have taken place since the closure was announced by the company. Meetings took place between FÁS, trade union and company representatives on 13 and 14 January, 2003. One-to-one guidance interviews between FÁS and the employees were scheduled to start in the week beginning 27 January 2003. All employees who register with FÁS are being placed on a FÁS employment tracking system. In addition, the employees are being offered three-day planning for the future courses. These courses will start in February 2003. On completion of this course, participants will be interviewed again and, where appropriate, offered other training or further education courses.On 15 January 2003, a meeting of interested parties took place in order to explore how Enterprise Ireland in particular, could work with the other agencies such as the county enterprise board, FÁS, IDA Ireland and community groups in the area to create initiatives that would result in job replacement for the area.  At the meeting, it was agreed to establish a local working group made up of employees of the company and other interested parties to progress the employment agenda for the area. Enterprise Ireland is also prepared to discuss funding under its community enterprise scheme. The final date for submissions under the current call for proposals is 25 April 2003.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I understand there is no record of an outstanding application for a work permit for the individual concerned in the Department.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	671	An application in this case was received in early January 2003. It is the policy to process work permit applications in the order in which they are received. Assuming the application is completed correctly and is otherwise in order, it will take approximately six weeks to process.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	672	The issue of job creation is a day-to-day operational issue for the industrial development agencies under the remit of my Department and not one for which I, as Minister, have direct involvement. The main agencies under my Department's remit which deal with job creation are Enterprise Ireland in regard to the development of indigenous industry, and IDA Ireland in regard to the attraction of inward investment. The county and city enterprise boards are also actively involved in supporting the creation of employment in start-up and micro enterprises.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	673	I have no plans to introduce further legislation in this area. The current law is the European Communities (Contracts for timesharing of immovable property – protection of consumers) Regulations 1997 (S.I. No. 204 of 1997) and European Communities (Contracts for timesharing of immovable property – protection of consumers) (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (S.I. No. 144 of 2000), which both implement the European timeshare Directive, 97/47/EC.I am aware that timeshare legislation does not extend to membership of holiday clubs, a relatively new phenomenon whereby subscribers can avail of cut-price luxury holidays to popular holiday destinations each year. In this regard, the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs advises consumers to carefully consider the full implications of the contract being offered in connection with these holidays and to seek legal advice as to the terms and conditions of the contract.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The liquidation of IFI is ongoing and I understand that it could take two years or more to complete. At this stage, my Department has made payments of €2.67 million in respect of 322 claims received from former IFI workers in respect of entitlements under the Redundancy Payments Acts. A further 19 claims are being processed at present. In addition, under the insolvency payments scheme, €450,425 has been paid to the liquidator of the company mentioned in respect of claims for outstanding pay-related employee entitlements to wages and arrears of holiday pay on behalf of 323 employees. Claims in respect of a further eight employees received recently are currently being processed and a query has arisen in respect of one other claim.With regard to minimum notice entitlements, before payment can be made under the insolvency payments scheme, entitlement must first be established by appeal to the Employment Appeals Tribunal. I understand that appeals have been lodged by 327 employees of the company. A date for the hearing has not yet been set. If the employees receive favourable decisions from the tribunal, they should complete Form EIP2 which will accompany the decision and forward this form to the liquidator, who will then forward the completed forms to my Department for processing and payment. I am not aware of the position as regards the workers based in Belfast but I expect that the relevant authorities there have also dealt with any claims received for statutory entitlements in an expeditious manner.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	675	European Council Directive 98/50/EC amends Directive 77/187/EEC on the approximation of the laws of the member states relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses. The amending directive aimed to clarify the scope of the principal directive in the light of extensive case law developed by the European Court of Justice since the 1977 directive was implemented. In particular, the amending directive focused on the issue of the "contracting out of services" by the employer.Both the principal directive and its amending directive were repealed and their terms consolidated by Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	676	From inquiries I have made with FÁS I am advised that it is not aware of any particular problems being experienced in this area. If there are concerns relating to specific schemes or groups I will be happy to refer any such concerns to FÁS for examination.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	677	I propose to take Questions Nos. 192, 197 and 198 together.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	678	Where an employee remains with the same employer for five consecutive years, a permit without limit is issued to that employer from the sixth year. The employer applies in the normal way using the application form appropriate for renewal of permits.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	679	I share the Deputy's concern regarding the low level of automated teller machines, ATMs, in this country and I would urge the banking industry and prospective ATM operators to provide consumers with the maximum levels of ATM service possible.I am not aware of any confusion which may exist between my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to the installation of ATMs in this country. As there is no requirement that companies installing or operating ATMs be licensed or authorised it is difficult to see where such confusion would arise. Companies are free to engage in the installation of ATMs as they wish.Under the Consumer Credit Act 1995, approval of any charges which may be applied by credit institutions or credit institutions sponsoring independent ATM operators is a matter for the Director of Consumer Affairs, who is independent in her functions.I have no plans, therefore, to introduce any legislation in relation to the provision of authorisations or licences for companies or persons who wish to install ATM facilities.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	680	The announcement by Square D on 15 January 2003 that it is to close its Ballinasloe plant by the end of June 2003 with the loss of all 387 jobs on its books cannot be described as anything other than a body blow for the workforce, their families and the local community. It is a priority for me to ensure that everything possible will be done to find new investment and new sources of employment for Ballinasloe, although I know that this will not be an easy task.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	681	The table illustrates the expenditure levels on science and technology programmes disbursed through the office of science and technology from 2001 to 2003. The increasing levels of expenditure during this time reflect the growing priority the Government places on these key areas.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	682	The announcement of job losses by Artesyn Technologies at its facility in Youghal, County Cork was very disappointing. The Youghal operation supplies power conversion products principally to the telecoms industry which is continuing to experience very difficult market conditions. The company has recently closed other operations around the world as part of its global restructuring and unfortunately the job losses announced for the Youghal facility are a continuation of that process.As a result of the announcement, approximately 160 jobs will be lost at the Artesyn facility with the job losses taking place on a phased basis which is expected to be completed by September 2003.While these job losses are regrettable, it should be noted that the high value engineering and customer support operation, which employs approximately 80 people, will be retained in Youghal to support product design and sales.IDA Ireland has advised that it met with the company to discuss the situation, particularly with regard to the future utilisation of the building which is to be vacated by the company. The IDA is actively working with the company to prepare a profile of the building which will assist in the future marketing of the property to potential investors.The IDA and Enterprise Ireland have also advised that they met with the Youghal Chamber of Commerce to discuss the impact of the job losses and are currently working with the chamber in the preparation of a profile of the area. This profile will then become an intrinsic part of the IDA Ireland marketing material of the south west region.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	683	The Deputy will be aware that, in the context of the White Paper on Defence, the Government decided to decentralise the civil defence branch of my Department to Roscrea, County Tipperary. The Office of Public Works, which has responsibility for the provision of official accommodation for Government Departments, is in discussions with the owners of a building in Roscrea regarding leasing part of the property.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	684	Funeral grants are payable by my Department only in respect of deceased veterans of the War of Independence. The deceased person referred to was not a veteran but was in receipt of an allowance as the widow of a deceased veteran. Consequently, a funeral grant is not payable.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	685	A commencement order to give effect to the provisions of the Civil Defence Act 2002 necessary for the appointment of a Civil Defence Board was signed by me on 24 April 2002 and I subsequently appointed the full inaugural board in June 2002.The necessary support structures to enable the board to carry out its functions are in the process of being put in place. In that regard, I am anxious that the board be given responsibility for the management of civil defence at national level as soon as possible. I am confident that I will be in a position in the near future to effect a further order formally establishing the board.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	686	There are no plans to alter the status of the military post at Lifford, County Donegal.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	687	The Air Corps is responsible for the training of winchman-woman and winch operators employed by it. The amount of training required depends on the aptitude of the student, the level of previous experience and the particular aircraft.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	688	Former members of the Permanent Defence Force who were injured in the course of duty may, following retirement, apply to my Department for a disability pension under the Army Pensions Acts. Those Acts provide for the grant of a disability pension in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service. Application for a disability pension in respect of a wound or injury must be made within one year of retirement.Former members of the Permanent Defence Force are eligible for medical and hospital treatment under the Health Acts in the same way as other members of the community. There is no general provision for the continued treatment of military personnel under the auspices of the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces following their retirement.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	689	The minimum age for general service enlistment and for the enlistment of cadets to the Permanent Defence Force is 17. There is an exception to the general age limit in the case of apprentices who may be recruited at 16. However apprentices are  not assigned to any military duties until they have completed up to four years apprenticeship trade training, at which time they would be close to 20 years of age at a minimum.All applicants for the Defence Forces who are under 18 years of age must have the written consent of a parent or a legal guardian. Military personnel who are under 18 years of age are specifically precluded from overseas service.The minimum age for young people to join their local FCA or Slua Muirí unit is 17 years.I am satisfied that the existing age limits for recruitment to the Defence Forces are appropriate and I do not propose to make any changes in this area.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has now been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases.The person named submitted an application under the farm modernisation scheme category. Unfortunately, on the basis of the information supplied the applicant did not satisfy the conditions of the scheme and an allocation was not made. Notification to that effect has been sent to the applicant.An appeals procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has now submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome of his or her case.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	691	I introduced the 32 million litres scheme in order to make specific provision for milk producers whose initial quota allocations were low as a result of certain circumstances. In that regard, I decided that producers who had been following dairying development plans under the farm modernisation scheme and the reduced interest subsidy scheme for farmers in financial difficulty at the time of the introduction of the milk quota regime would benefit under this scheme. Furthermore, producers whose milk deliveries during 1983, the quota year, were adversely affected by  an outbreak of animal disease in their herd in the period 1978 to 1980, were also eligible to apply.In setting down the criteria for eligibility in the allocation of the 32 million litres, I adhered to the objectives of providing additional quota to active producers in the small and medium size category who had demonstrated their commitment to milk production. These are the broad criteria which I have used in allocating all of the additional quota available to Ireland under agenda 2000.The conditions of the scheme are set down in Public Notice 94/15.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	692	My Department, as successor to the former Irish Land Commission, does not have responsibility for the maintenance, repair or restoration of river banks or embankments, or other works to prevent flooding.However, arising from the acquisition of certain estates, the former Irish Land Commission retained a portion of the purchase money due to the estate owner for the ongoing maintenance and upkeep of embankments on those estates. These retained funds were entrusted to the public trustee, who is now an officer of my Department.The public trustee has responsibility for the investment of these funds and the income earned may be applied for the specific purposes described in the trust deed for each estate. In the context of an ongoing or perpetual trust, it is established practice that the capital sum should not be used for general repairs except in very exceptional circumstances.The persons concerned should contact the public trustee at my Department's Cavan office if the lands in question are located in an area subject to a trust fund.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	693	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has now been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has now been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases. In the case of the person named an allocation was made and the person named was notified accordingly.An appeal procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named, has now submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome of his or her case.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	695	The person referred to has only recently furnished to the district veterinary office the required documentation to enable the payment to be made. This has now been processed and payment will issue shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	696	No area aid application was received in my Department from the person named for the 2002 scheme. Consequently no payment under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme can be made to him. The person concerned was not an applicant for suckler cow or ewe premium.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	697	Up to the end of September 2002, 4,808 applications had been received by my Department under the farm waste management scheme, which was established pursuant to the National Development Plan 2000-2006. Payments had been made in 845 of those cases, by end-September 2002, at a cost of €6.355 million. The land area involved in those 845 cases is 40,000 hectares approximately.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	698	Compensation in respect of animals slaughtered as a result of BSE issued to the person concerned on 22 October 2002.In relation to the milk quota, it is possible for herdowners to temporarily lease an unused part of their milk quota to their milk purchaser for the current quota year. The herdowner in this case was advised by letter on 10 December 2002 that this can arranged by contacting the relevant milk purchaser.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	699	The person named submitted one application for 2001 special beef premium in respect of ten animals. The area aid application of the person named indicates that the total forage area for premia payment purposes is 24.34 hectares thus entitling the person named to a total of 48.68 reckonable livestock units, i.e. 2.0 livestock units of premium per hectare. The milk quota of 41,307 gallons of the person named utilises 47.15 livestock units, 41,307 divided by the national average yield of 876 gallons. This left a total of 1.53 reckonable livestock units for special beef premium purposes which entitled the person named  to a reduced payment on 2.55 animals, 1.53 divided by 0.6.The person named was paid his full entitlements under the 2001 slaughter premium scheme and national envelope.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	700	The person named failed to submit his second-year REPS payment application form within the required timeframe. Consequently my Department had no alternative but to terminate his participation in 1998 and seek full recoupment of the payment he had already received. He was reminded of the overpayment on a number of occasions since then but my Department has no record of any correspondence from him in reply and my Department will be pursuing the matter further with the person named.Under the EU rules governing the rural environment protection scheme, the annual submission of a payment application form within a specified timeframe is a mandatory requirement. Failure to abide by the scheme conditions in this regard means that all aid paid must be recouped.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	701	The information requested by the Deputy is detailed on the following schedule:Staff Numbers Department of Agriculture and Food by County
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The allocation of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota to certain categories of small and medium scale milk producers has been completed and applicants have been notified of the outcome in their own cases. The person named submitted an application in relation to this quota, under the animal disease category. Unfortunately, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied an allocation was not made. Notification to that effect has been issued.An appeal procedure exists in relation to this scheme and the person named has now submitted an appeal. The assessment of appeals will be based on recommendations from the milk quota appeals tribunal. When the appeals process is completed each appellant will be notified of the outcome of his or her case.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	703	Payment of €14,284.34 will issue to the person named shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	704	The maximum pension payable under the current early retirement scheme is €13,515 per annum for a period of up to ten years. This is made up of a basic payment of €5,403 plus €338 per hectare up to a maximum of 24 hectares. In its proposals for this scheme, which commenced in November 2000, my Department had made provision for annual increases in the rate of pension. However the European Commission  rejected this proposal and insisted that a fixed rate be set for the full period of the CAP rural development plan 2000-06.The rate of pension payable under the 1994 scheme of early retirement from farming is the maximum provided for in the EU Council Regulation under which the scheme was introduced. The regulation does not provide for indexation of payments. The maximum pension rate for this scheme is €12,075 per annum made up of a basic payment of €4,830 plus €301.90 per hectare up to a maximum of 24 hectares.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	705	Because of temporary human resources issues, about 80 REPS applications in Sligo and 40 in Leitrim are now outside the target periods for processing set down in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers. Until processing is completed it is not possible to say what volume of payments these applications represent. Staff have  been temporarily redeployed to the Leitrim office and it is hoped to have the backlog cleared within the next few weeks. The position in the Sligo office is also being actively examined and I am hopeful that a solution can be found shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	706	REPS is a demand-led scheme and I have made provision for €190 million in my Department's 2003 Estimates. This is an increase of 12% on the €173 million expenditure outurn for REPS in 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	707	I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 226 together.The information requested by the Deputy is contained in the following schedule.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	708	The following table gives the information requested by the Deputy.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	709	The person named applied for her second year's payment in REPS 2 on 11 December 2002 and the application is being processed in accordance with the targets set out in the Protocol on Direct Payments to Farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	710	The person named was paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area-based compensatory allowance scheme on 8 January 2003. The person named submitted one application in respect of one animal under the 2002 special beef premium scheme. Advance payment issued on 16 October 2002. Final payment will issue at balancing payment stage.

The tribunal is the body established to consider and advise on applications for additional quota from individual producers who have suffered severe hardship in the context of the milk quota system.The person named submitted an application for additional quota on the grounds of hardship and his application was was examined by the tribunal in November 2002. Unfortunately the tribunal was unable to recommend an allocation in this case. While every application is treated in a fair and sympathetic manner, the amount of quota available for allocation is limited in the context of the large numbers of applications that are submitted and therefore the tribunal is not always in a position to recommend the allocation of quota to an applicant.My Department has not received an appeal against this decision.

My Department keeps its expenditure and deployment of resources under constant review with the aim of achieving maximum efficiency in the provision of income supports for farmers, support for the agri-food industry and food safety programmes.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	715	The position is that under new arrangements introduced with effect from 1 January 2002 all bovine premia scheme applications must be processed at producer level rather than appli cation level. This means that before balancing payments can be made all applications under the special beef premium scheme, the suckler cow premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme must be examined together to establish, in the case of the suckler cow premium and special beef premium, if stocking density levels have been complied with and-or if there is non-compliance under any of the schemes. Any penalty arising from non-compliance would have to takes into account the total number of eligible animals under each of the schemes.While the producer approach will cause a slight delay in the issue of balancing payments under the suckler cow scheme the overall effect will be that any penalties imposed will be more proportional than heretofore. This arises because the number of non-compliant animals are divided by all the eligible animals under the three schemes as distinct from the number of eligible animals for the individual scheme as was the case up to now.An additional factor in 2002 is that the national quota for the special beef premium scheme has been exceeded with an increase in the number of animals submitted for the premium in late December 2002. It will not be possible to definitively determine the exact percentage overshoot until such time as the two months retention period has ended and all applications are processed. When eligibility has been established under the bovine schemes and the special beef premium quota overshoot has been determined balancing payments will commence.My Department is conscious of the pressures on farm income and will make every effort, taking into account the outstanding issues referred to above, to ensure balancing payments will issue at the earliest possible date. Last autumn I negotiated an 80% advance payment level under these schemes for 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	716	The person named applied for premium on 26 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 28 June 2002. An inspection of all claimed and unclaimed animals in his herd was carried out on 13 August 2002. During this inspection it was found that 20 unclaimed animals were not registered on the cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, and my Department wrote to him on 9 December 2002 advising that, accordingly, his premium entitlement would be subject to a reduction penalty in accordance with the terms and conditions governing the scheme. He was given the opportunity to have this decision reviewed. The person named wrote to my Department on 23 December 2002 requesting a review and explaining that he had not been well during the year. As a medical certificate was pro vided to substantiate his illness and as all animals in his herd have now been registered on the CMMS my Department has written to him to advise that the decision to apply the penalty has been rescinded. The 80% advance under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme will now issue to the person named.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	717	Under the 1998 agreement with the EU Commission, which secured generous REPS payments of up to €242 per hectare on commonages, my Department together with Dúchas undertook to have individual framework plans prepared for each commonage. It is not possible to exclude specific areas of commonage from this undertaking. Each commonage has been assessed by a team of two, one agriculturalist and one ecologist, under the overall supervision of the two Departments. The framework plans are objective scientific assessments of the environmental state of the commonages and the impact on them of grazing by sheep. The percentage destocking is directly related to the environmental condition of the commonage and this is reflected in the varying degrees of destocking required across different commonages.In October 2002, farmers with commonage land were notified by my Department of their individual stocking levels for 2003 and were told that they had the following three options: to accept the recommended destocking, to have the Department's calculations checked by an agricultural consultant, or to opt out of using their commonage altogether and claim no area-based or REPS payments on it. Farmers who opt out of using their commonage will not be subject to the destocking recommendations, though they must follow any environmental requirements in the relevant framework plan.

However, in 2002 a total of 1.77 million cheques issued to farmers and traders combined, of a value in excess of €1.7 billion. During that year, a total of 10,538 cheques, totalling €3,586,464 in value, remained uncashed at the end of the six-month valid period.

The area aid unit wrote to him in this regard and a reply is awaited. Until this matter is resolved his area aid application cannot be fully processed and no area related payments can issue.The person named had five eligible animals for 2002 slaughter premium and five eligible animals for national envelope payment. Advance payment totalling €320 in respect of all eligible slaughter premium animals, has issued to the person named. A further advance payment of €91.40, in respect of all eligible national envelope animals, has also issued to the person named.

As part of this process, my Department has engaged in an extensive consultative process.Having received submissions from a number of interested parties and having had a number of follow-up meetings which had been requested by some of the parties, my Department is finalising proposals for prospective changes to the relevant legislation so as to take account of the recommendations of the IMB and, in so far as possible, the views expressed by interested parties, in implementing a practical solution.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	721	A total of 445,000 tonnes of beef was exported in 2002. Of this 245,000 tonnes were exported to the UK, 110,000 tonnes to other EU countries and 90,000 tonnes to third countries.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	722	The biggest importer of Irish beef in recent years has been the UK. In 2002 the UK imported some 245,000 tonnes of Irish beef.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	723	I expect that enlargement will broaden the opportunity for Irish beef exporters to sell a greater proportion of beef products into an enlarged European Union. According to the EU Commission beef production in the CEEC's decreased by 40%, to less than one million tonnes, in the period 1989 to 2001. Production is forecast to decline further in the period to 2009 to some 0.77 million tonnes, while consumption will remain static at one million tonnes. As a result net imports are expected to increase to 214,000 tonnes by 2009. The main beef producing countries among the new members are Poland and the Czech Republic, while Romania, which is among the next group of accession candidates, is also a significant producer of beef.

Issues have subsequently arisen in relation to eligibility for payment of some for the lands included in his plan, and these have been the subject of correspondence. My Department wrote to him on 22 January 2003 requesting additional information about documentation relating to ownership that he had supplied, and asking him to reply by 18 March 2003. My Department would hope to finalise matters when the reply is received.My Department's area aid unit also wrote to the person named on 26 November 2002 and again on 9 January 2003, requesting proof of entitlement to a land parcel he has claimed as part of his 2002 area aid application. To date no proof of entitlement has been received.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	728	The ring-fencing provisions in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations 2000 as amended, apply where milk quota is attached to land in a less favoured area that is transferred, by sale, lease, or gift. They require that the milk produced in respect of that quota be produced on the lands that have been transferred or other lands within 48 km of those lands.As regards a producer who wishes to transfer his-her milk quota to a different dairy-co-operative, he-she may do so provided he-she satisfies the normal transfer conditions i.e. notification of the transfer is given in accordance with time limits and he-she commences deliveries to the new co-op. I am not considering removing the existing ring fencing provisions.

At that time, some 500 other applications for the new scheme were being processed.249.Mr. P. McGrath asked the Minister for Agriculture and Food if in relation to the recent changes in the farm retirement scheme, the Minister will confirm if the present income ceiling for farmers by which those pensioners are prevented from benefiting from state pensions will be removed.

These changes were approved by the European Commission and remove the obligation on transferees to have enlargement land and to engage in farming as a main occupation once five years' participation in the scheme has been completed.The changes have no bearing on the provision in both the 1994 scheme and the new scheme that the early retirement pension may be granted only as a supplement to any national retirement pension that the participant, and his or her spouse or partner in a joint management arrangement, may receive. This provision is a requirement of the European Council Regulations governing the two schemes.

The following tables, which were complied from data supplied by that office, set out the details requested by the Deputy. In relation to the tables the following points should be noted: data is not available for the last quarter of 2002; in certain cases the record of import may include the re-import of Irish products that were originally the subject of an export from this country; the information available for imports from member states of the European Union does not differentiate between imports originating in the EU country and those originating from third countries that may already be in free circulation within the Community.On a more general point, it should be noted that under EU harmonised rules, imports into the European Union from third countries must have been sourced in premises and in countries which are approved by the European Commission and which are subject to veterinary audits by the EU's food and veterinary office. In addition, such imports are subject to checks on import laid down in harmonised rules prescribed at European level, and must be accompanied by veterinary health certification from the authorities in the country of export.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	732	The person named participated in 2001 extensification premium opting for the simplified  system. He undertook to maintain a stocking density of less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare for each and every day of 2001.Under EU regulations, prior to payment, the Department is required to carry out CMMS based stocking density cross-checks to ensure that chosen stocking density payment limits are not breached. In this case cross-checks were carried out at 1 June and 15 October 2001. Respective stocking densities of 1.0226 and 1.6060 livestock units per hectare were found at the dates in question and accordingly the person named was found ineligible for 2001 extensification premium. In order that the person named could check the accuracy of the findings at 15 October 2001, a CMMS based herd profile showing the eartag number and date of birth of each bovine animal over the age of six months present on the holding on 15 October 2001 issued to him on 18 December 2002. He did not revert to the Department to confirm any discrepancies that appeared on the profile which when corrected might bring the stocking density of the holding to less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare on the date in question. An official from my Department was in touch with the person named in recent days in the matter. The person named has stated that some discrepancies appear on the profile and that he has now passed it to his farm adviser with a view to having the discrepancies notified to the Department for updating in early course.On receipt of the updated information in the Department, the matter will be attended to without delay and if it can be established that the stocking density of the holding was less than 1.60 livestock units per hectare on 15 October 2001, the person named should qualify for payment of 2001 extensification premium at the rate of €66 per eligible animal.Payment of 2002 extensification premium is not scheduled to commence until June 2003. Prior to payment CMMS based stocking density cross-checks will be carried out and eligibility on stocking density grounds cannot be established until then.

Payment will commence in respect of December applications in March 2003 when the two month retention period is complete, subject to compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme.The person named had 73 eligible animals for 2002 slaughter premium and 22 eligible animals for national envelope payment. Advance payments totalling €4,672, in respect of all eligible slaughter premium animals, have issued to the person named. A further advance payment of €402.16 in respect of all eligible national envelope animals, has issued to the person named.Balancing payments under these schemes will commence in April 2003 when all checks are complete and when the final special beef quota position is established.

This included some emergency works to the rear of houses off Tolka Road, which were in danger of subsiding, by constructing a new concrete wall, in the weeks after the flooding. Some trees, which were obstructing water flow, were also removed.The city council has also asked the Office of Public Works for funding to carry out some flood alleviation measures which were identified in the interim report on the River Tolka catchment. The Office of Public Works has agreed to undertake emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area. As part of the emergency works, embankments are being constructed from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.

These include eligible charities, approved for that purpose by the Revenue Commissioners for more than three years, first, second and third level educational institutions as well as a number of other named bodies. The relief is available in respect of donations by individuals as well as by corporates and is based on donations in any year being in excess of €250. There is no upper limit on the level of donations which can avail of the relief.In the Finance Act 2002, I introduced a similar scheme of relief to fund approved capital projects by sports organisations. The scheme is structured in exactly the same way as that for the donations to approved bodies. However, there is an upper limit set in respect of projects estimated to cost in excess of €40 million.It may be that certain of the bodies the Deputy is referring to have, or could obtain approval from the Revenue Commissioners as bodies established for charitable purposes only in their own right. As such and subject to the three year rule I mentioned earlier, tax relief would be available for donations to them. Furthermore in certain situations, payments made to community funds/initiatives, for example, for sponsorship may legitimately be characterised as business expenses. These payments would then be deductible for tax purposes in the normal way. The specific circumstances would determine the appropriate tax treatment.If the Deputy has any specific community fund-initiative in mind, I suggest that he write to me with the details and I will be happy to arrange to have it followed up at official level.

In order to qualify for relief under the scheme, the applicant must meet the medical criteria specified in the regulations and be in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, who is an official of the relevant health  board. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concession under this scheme are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that they are severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons who are without both hands or without both arms; persons who are without one or both legs; persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.I understand that the person concerned has been refused a primary medical certificate by the relevant heath board and that they have appealed the decision to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal. I have no function in the determination of whether a person meets the strict medical criteria in order to qualify for the various concessions under the scheme.

Certain provisions, in particular those relating to retirement on ill health grounds, also exist within section 9 of the Civil Service Regulation Act, 1956. Other issues relating to sick leave may arise consequent on various social welfare legislation and regulations.The general position is that staff who are absent from work through sickness are required, if their illness persists for more than two working days, to produce a medical certificate. Staff returning from sick leave are expected to report for duty on the third day or at the expiry date of their medical certificate(s). Staff are expected to resume duty promptly on their return to full health – they may not, for example, take annual leave immediately following a period of sick leave.

The breakdown of these appeals in terms of the year of receipt of the appeal is as follows: 1999 –  seven cases; 2000 –  85 cases; 2001 – 264 cases; 2002 – 284 cases; total – 640 cases.All review applications received since 1 April 2002 are being dealt with immediately by the Office of the Information Commissioner. These cases are not being delayed pending the clearing of the historical backlog of arrears cases. It is the commissioner's objective, in relation to review applications received since 1 April 2002, that to the greatest extent possible they should be decided within the three month guideline timescale provided for at section 34(3)(b) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997.Cases received prior to 1 April 2002 will continue to be processed alongside the more current cases. The commissioner envisages that it may, unfortunately, take two to three years to clear this backlog. The commissioner will, however, keep all of his working arrangements – including those for dealing with the arrears cases – under regular review.

Finally, the Group recommended that the supervision of the credit unions by the SRA should be done in a way that would recognise and be supportive of "the uniqueness of credit unions and would give comfort that their voluntary character would not be threatened by the establishment of the SRA while still addressing the appropriate regulatory and consumer protection requirements that arise".In October 2000, my officials informed me that the Legislative Committee of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, had asked if we would open consultations with them concerning how we would envisage credit unions being regulated within a single regulatory authority. My officials indicated to me that they intended to respond to the request by outlining to the ILCU how we would envisage the McDowell proposal for a statutory Registrar of Credit Unions might operate. I was happy for my officials to talk to the League on this basis and there were three meetings between then and May 2001.

The inspector's records indicate that the taxpayer paid no income tax during the 1999/2000 tax year and that she paid the correct amount of tax in 2000/2001 and in the short tax year 2001. The inspector does not have sufficient information to determine the taxpayer's tax liability for 2002. The taxpayer should obtain her form P60, certificate of pay, tax and pay-related social insurance, for 2002 and send it to her inspector of taxes, together with any information which the taxpayer wishes to include as to why she may be due a refund. When the inspector of taxes receives the information required the taxpayer's liability will be reviewed.

In recent years, I have taken action against a number of tax avoidance schemes which used tax incentives in artificial ways to reduce effective tax rates on high incomes to very low levels. For example, in the 1998 budget, I took action against "asset-backed" schemes, where individual passive investors used special incentive reliefs in relation to expenditure on certain buildings so as to reduce the tax liability on their employment income. If unchecked, schemes such as these would allow individuals with high income to avoid paying their fair share of tax to the disadvantage of the general body of taxpayers. This resolution is entirely consistent with my approach, in other instances in recent years, of ring-fencing losses and capital allowances for passive investors so that they prevent a reduction in tax on their employment income. The measure is targeted at passive investors who do not participate in such businesses in an active way. It was estimated at the time of the budget that this anti-avoidance measure would prevent tax leakage of up to €10 million per year for the next five to eight years.The alternative energy requirement programme is the primary state support mechanism for renewable electricity generation. AER offers a guaranteed price for the power produced through a 15 year power purchase agreement with the ESB. Successful applicants are those who comply with the terms and conditions of the competition and who offer to sell the electricity to the ESB at the lowest price at or below the cap price previously notified to the market in each technology in the published terms and conditions of the competition. Five AER programmes were held since 1995. AER VI was held late last year. The total number of megawatts to be provided for by AER V and AER VI combined will be 500MW, the target of additional electricity generating capacity from renewable sources provided for in the Green Paper on Sustainable Energy.

The scope of the relief was also considerably widened. Generally speaking, the tax relief now covers tuition fees paid by undergraduate students in Ireland and elsewhere in the EU. It also applies to tuition fees paid by postgraduate students both here and abroad. Undergraduate courses, which may be full or part time, must be of at least two academic years' duration while postgraduate courses must be of at least one, but not more than four, academic years' duration. Tax relief is available up to a maximum of €3,175 per annum at the standard rate of tax.The relief is restricted to tuition fees paid and does not include amounts paid in respect of registration fees, maintenance or other expenses incurred by third level students. I have no plans at present to change the relief as suggested by the Deputy.

A report was presented to Dublin City Council and the Office of Public Works, which contained a number of recommendations aimed at reducing the risk of flooding in these areas.Following detailed examination of the interim report the Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council have now agreed a package of works to be carried out on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin City. These agreed works will be undertaken by Office of Public Works on behalf of the city council. The proposed works are currently the subject of a public consultation procedure by the city council as required by Part 8 of the planning and development regulations. Included in this are the raising or construction of walls and embankments at various locations between Glasnevin and Drumcondra, replacement and raising of Woodville Road footbridge, and also the raising of some ground upstream of Tolka Park. I am advised that city council officials hope to put the report on the Part 8 public consultation before the March meeting of Dublin City Council for approval. If it is approved, work on these measures will take place immediately thereafter. In the interim the city council are also consulting with the relevant bodies in relation to any environmental implications of the proposed works. The agreed programme of works will be funded by Office of Public Works and is expected to cost in the region of €600,000 –€700,000. The Deputy will be aware that in addition to the above, Office of Public Works is already undertaking emergency works in the form of the maintenance cleaning of the channel from Distillery Weir in Drumcondra to Glasnevin, to remove accumulated silt and debris in order to maximise channel capacity in this area and construction of embankments from Woodville Road footbridge upstream along both sides of Griffith Park.

This clock face dates from c.1900 and is not the original clock face which was completely weathered and was restored by Henry Spring and Company of Dublin in 1987 before being replaced in Bedford Tower. The original mechanism is too worn to run the clock face but has been left in place. An electronic mechanism has been installed alongside this to ensure that the clock keeps good time.When this now restored clock face was removed, an older, marble clock face was found behind it. This clock face dates from the mid 18th century and it is thought to be the original clock face. However, given its condition and the material used in its construction, it was not amenable to restoration. It now stands on display in Castle Hall, which is directly behind the Bedford Tower.

Relief is also available for expenditure on the construction or refurbishment of related residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities. Guidelines on the operation of the scheme were issued by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government in August 1999. The guidelines set out various criteria which a park and ride development and residential developments which are located at park and ride facilities must meet in order to qualify under the scheme. Certification of a development for the purposes of obtaining relief under the scheme is carried out by certain local authorities.The Finance Act 1999 also provided for capital allowances for commercial developments located at these park and ride facilities. Guidelines in relation to the commercial development element of these park and ride facilities were issued in July 2001 after discussions with EU Commission officials on State aid rules. In my recent budget I extended the qualifying period from 30 June 2004 to 31 December 2004.The Department of Transport is currently in the process of contacting all the relevant local authorities to provide an estimate of the number of persons who have availed of capital allowances for the construction of park and ride facilities. This information will then be supplied to my Department.

The general aim of the project is to assess the positive road safety effects of daytime running lights use and to investigate possible and perceived negative effects including effects on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motorcyclists. It is intended that the results of the study should inform the future requirements of the European Union in this regard.A pilot campaign by Dublin City Council to encourage the use of daytime running lights on a voluntary basis in the greater Dublin area has recently been completed. I understand that evaluation of the effects of the campaign is being conducted currently for the City Council. The use of dipped headlights – daytime running lights – is not currently subject to regulation.Pending the outcome of the comprehensive European Commission's study, the Minister for Transport does not propose to make any decision in regard to the use of daytime running lights in Ireland. Consequently, I do not propose to issue any instructions on the matter at this time.

While it is not possible for me to comment on measures that may or may not be included in the forthcoming Finance Bill prior to its publication, the Deputy will appreciate that given the complex and dynamic nature of the housing market, careful consideration would have to be given to the impact of the suggested change and would necessitate extensive consultations between my Department, the Department of the Environment and Local Government, local authorities and the Revenue Commissioners.

The existing legislation does not grant any specific entitlement to capital allowances in relation to the construction or refurbishment of guest houses. To grant such an entitlement to guest houses generally would  greatly widen the tax relief leading to a significant erosion of the tax base. Also, it may lead to calls to extend the regime to bed and breakfasts and other tourist accommodation facilities.However, under the current legislation, capital allowances may be available in limited circumstances in relation to the construction or refurbishment of a guest house which is open to all comers, if the number of rooms in the building, the standard of the facilities available and extent of the services provided in the building are similar to those which would be found in a hotel, that is, where the claimant proves that the trade of hotel-keeping is, in fact, being carried on in the building.As there is currently a need to widen the tax base rather than narrow it, there are no plans to grant any specific entitlement in relation to the construction or refurbishment of guest houses generally in the capital allowances regime.

Work on the Lyreen and Meadowbrook Rivers has been completed. Works to bridges on the Morrell have been completed and work to embankments partially completed. The remaining works were suspended with the onset of winter and adverse weather conditions. This work will be completed as early as possible in the current year.Discussions between Office of Public Works and the county council are continuing in relation to flooding at Maynooth, Straffan, Ardclough and Leixlip. The Office of Public Works will consider any proposals for further works which may emerge from these discussions in the context of existing commitments and the many requests for flood relief works and funding which are on hands from other local authorities.The Deputy will be aware that I have established a group to review Government policy on flood relief. The purpose of the review is to assess the causes and extent of the problem countrywide, assess the impact of flooding on different sectors of society, clarify roles and responsibilities of the various agencies involved, establish criteria for the prioritisation of expenditure, examine the extent and adequacy of existing powers and processes, identify strategies to manage any increase in the present extent of areas at risk of flooding with particular reference to current predictions regarding the effects of climate change, and consider criteria for initiation of any future humanitarian aid schemes. I regard this as a priority and have asked the group to report to me by August of this year.

These recommendations were estimated to cost in the region of €6.2 million. The  consultants also recommended that a further study – the Dublin coastal zone study – which had already been under consideration by Dublin City Council, should be carried out. The estimated cost of this study is €1.1 million and I understand that the city council is pursuing this.Following detailed examination of the interim report the Office of Public Works and Dublin City Council have now agreed a package of works to be carried out on the River Tolka in the Glasnevin and Drumcondra areas of Dublin city.

Given the requirements for site investigations, detailed design of the works, public consultation and public procurement procedures and environmental considerations, it would take a considerable time to implement all the recommendations of the interim report. The concern of the city council and Office of Public Works has been to devise a package of works which can be carried out before next winter and which will provide a substantial degree of protection should similar flood events recur. I am conscious also that the full report on the River Tolka catchment is due to be completed in May and will provide additional information on which decisions in relation to the entire Tolka catchment can be made.

The purpose of this scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off cost of purchase and installation of: small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and security lighting; and socially-monitored alarm systems, such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, I understand that the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees.As regards the VAT treatment of such services, in general, VAT applies equally to all individuals irrespective of status. The VAT rating of goods and services is largely subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. While we can maintain the zero rating on those goods and services which were zero-rated before 1 January 1991 the monitoring services do not fall within this category. Since we cannot introduce any new zero rate of VAT, we cannot therefore relieve such services as referred to by the Deputy. Under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) No. 15 Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system, as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Applicants should contact Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayment (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare.

Details of the New Bishops Weir, which is currently under construction, along with the historical flow rates within the River Nore have been forwarded to the expert for his assessment.If it proves feasible to provide the playwave, the issue of who would take responsibility for its construction and provide the necessary funds would have to be resolved. There is no provision for this in the budget for the flood relief scheme and I am keen to ensure that available funding is not diverted from essential aspects of the scheme. There are also other issues such as safety, design, and maintenance to be borne in mind. These matters can be discussed with the city council after the feasibility report is received.

In July 2002 my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Kitt, launched a new Ireland Aid – Department of Finance strategy in the issue of developing country debt. This comprehensive strategy sets out in detail the Government's approach to the problem and updates the principles on debt relief announced by the Government in 1998.The debt relief strategy indicates, inter alia, that the Government believes total debt cancellation to be a politically acceptable objective and one that it would support. However, the strategy also emphasises that the funding of debt cancellation would have to come from additional overseas development assistance from donors.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	782	The Government wants to see the present differences between Iraq and the international community resolved peaceably, through the United Nations. We want to avoid any recourse to unilateral action.UN Security Council Resolution 1441, which Ireland supported and worked hard to secure, is designed to avoid war by giving the Iraqi authorities a final chance to comply with their obligation to divest themselves of their chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities. Unfortunately, the Iraqi leadership has refused for more than a decade to comply with this demand, inflicting further wilful suffering on its people. It is a matter of considerable regret that only the credible threat that further non-compliance will lead to military action appears to hold any prospect of inducing a change in this attitude.In their report to the Security Council, delivered on Monday, the UN weapons inspectors have made clear that while some progress has been achieved, the co-operation of the Iraqi authorities has fallen short of what is demanded and that they can and must do more to demonstrate that they have met the requirements laid down unanimously by the UN Security Council.It is obvious to all that, one way or another, the Iraqi leadership will no longer be permitted to evade its disarmament obligations. Those who suggest otherwise serve only to increase the likelihood of war. In the interests of peace, the Iraqi leadership must be left in no doubt that it has no viable alternative but to comply quickly, fully, and unambiguously with the demands of the Security Council. If it does, then war can be avoided. The fact is that Saddam Hussein could end this confrontation tomorrow by simply ordering his regime to co-operate fully and proactively with the UN inspectors.The Government will seek to use all its influence in favour of a peaceful solution. Ireland is no longer a member of the Security Council, but we will continue our efforts, through the UN, the EU and bilateral contacts with the US and others, including the countries of the region.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	783	The Government's official development assistance programme, Ireland Aid, funds a wide range of programmes and activities carried out by NGOs, non-governmental organisations, and missionary orders in developing countries.Projects supported are poverty focused with a key emphasis on basic education, primary health care, water sanitation, income generation, rural development, urban community development and training. The Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development assistance, Deputy Tom Kitt, has recently announced the establishment of a new, dedicated missionary development fund which will facilitate missionaries in their important development activities. The establishment of a new fund means that missionaries will have, for the first time, a dedicated budget designed to help them carry out development projects at community level. The new fund will be administered by APSO, Agency for Personal Service Overseas, which has established a close working relationship with missionaries over many years. Applications for funding may be made to the Missionary Development Fund, Ireland Aid, Bishops Square, Dublin 2, via the order's house in Ireland.All applications for funding need to conform to a detailed set of criteria and guidelines to ensure maximum effectiveness and impact. Applicants for funding must demonstrate a capacity to carry out the tasks envisaged as well as a clear and coherent strategy to achieve the aims and objectives of the project. The guidelines are available from Ireland Aid which can also provide assistance to applicants regarding their particular project to ensure that it falls within the missionary development fund criteria.On receipt of a completed application for funding, in this instance, a detailed assessment will be made of the project proposal with a view to possible funding.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The Population Research Institute, PRI, a private US body, has repeatedly alleged that the UN Fund for Population Activities, UNFPA, has supported coercive policies on family planning in China, including the Chinese Government's one child policy. There have been a number of hearings in the US Congress on the basis of these reports.UNFPA has categorically denied that it has facilitated the implementation of coercive family planning methods in China or anywhere else. It has invited a number of independent investigators to examine its Chinese operations to assess whether or not there was any justification for the allegations which PRI has made. Two independent investigations, one commissioned by UNFPA and the second undertaken by a number of British parliamentarians, came to the same conclusion that the UNFPA is not involved in supporting coercive family planning methods in China. Both investigations emphasised that UNFPA is promoting a voluntary approach and is working to encourage the Chinese authorities away from coercive measures.The US Administration also carried out its own fact-finding mission to UNFPA's operations in China. This mission which reported in May 2002 also found no support for the allegations made by PRI. The report of the mission, addressed to Secretary of State Colin Powell, found "no evidence that UNFPA knowingly participated in the management of a programme of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation in China" and therefore recommended that "the $34 million which has been appropriated should be released to UNFPA."In the event the US Administration did not accept the recommendation of its own fact-finding mission and decided to withhold its financial support from UNFPA. This decision was taken by the State Department which voiced concern that it was possible that some of UNFPA's activities – such as the funding of the purchase of computers – might unwittingly be used to support China's one child policy. UNFPA has denied this possibility and no investigation to date has found any evidence that this is the case.

Last September, I ordered a review of  arrangements to ensure that regulations governing foreign military personnel were being complied with. The US authorities have co-operated fully in this exercise.In particular, civilian carriers are seeking permission from the Minister for Transport for the transit of the personal weapons of military personnel through Irish airports, in accordance with the terms of the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order, 1973.As regards the wearing of uniforms, the US authorities have been given express permission for their military personnel to wear uniforms in the transit areas of Irish airports. Further permission must be sought for them to wear uniforms outside these areas. I am satisfied that, in this regard, the requirements of section 317 of the Defence Act, 1954, are being complied with.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	791	The embassy in Washington DC is in ongoing contact with the US authorities across the full range of our interests, including the status of Irish citizens in the US. In this regard, and despite what all of us may wish, the reality is that at present there seems no likelihood of any special measures being introduced to regularise the position of undocumented Irish people in the US.Our embassy and consulates maintain a close working relationship with Irish immigration groups in the United States. Through this channel, and through their broader contacts with the Irish community, the embassy and the consulates monitor the situation with regard to the undocumented Irish in the United States.An annual sum, $300,000 in 2002, has been provided in the Vote for Foreign Affairs to assist groups in the US working with Irish immigrants there. One very welcome development is the close co-ordination and co-operation between immigrant advice groups funded by the Government largely as a result of the formation of the coalition of Irish immigration centres in 1995.The diversity programme, DV, or Schumer visa lottery was introduced in 1994, and remains an important avenue of legal emigration from Ireland to the US.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	792	The House will recall that the two individuals in question are members of Falun Gong, which was banned by the Chinese authorities in July 1999. Falun Gong is regarded by the Chinese Government as an evil cult. The persons concerned are Chinese citizens and are, therefore, subject to the laws of China while in that country, including those in respect of Falun Gong. As they are not Irish citizens, Ireland has no consular function in this matter, and the matter currently rests with the Chinese authorities.However, the Government takes concerns about human rights in China, including those of Falun Gong members, seriously. Officials of my Department have examined this case and met to discuss it with members of the Irish Falun Dafa Association. They have also met representatives of the Chinese Embassy in relation to the Falun Dafa, or Falun Gong, movement. A meeting will shortly take place to discuss the case between my colleague, Deputy Tom Kitt, Minister of State for overseas development and human rights, Amnesty International and the NGOs concerned.Our embassy in Beijing will continue to monitor these cases, and I will keep the House informed of any progress made.

The details have been forwarded to our embassy in Madrid and our honorary consul in Malaga and they have been asked to report on the current state of the investigation into this matter.I understand that the Garda has also been asked for their assistance and that it has been in contact with Interpol with a view to locating this missing person.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	794	The Government established an interdepartmental working group last October to examine the recommendations of the task force on policy regarding emigrants with a view to submitting proposals to Government for future action. The  working group, which included representatives of the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Social and Family Affairs, the Environment and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Health and Children, held a number of meetings in October and November last year. The report of the working group has not yet been finalised.I will consider the submission of proposals to Government in due course, in light of the resources that can be made available to implement the recommendations of the task force.

He is always welcome to visit Ireland whenever he might wish to come here.I wish to assure the Deputy that in its bilateral contacts with China, and through the European Union, Ireland has consistently called on the Chinese Government to fully respect the rights of the Tibetan people and to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama.The Taoiseach raised the situation in Tibet during his meeting with the Chinese Premier, Mr. Zhu, in Dublin in September 2001, and called for a dialogue between the affected parties with a view to overcoming the current impasse.I reiterated this position during my meeting in Beijing with my Chinese counterpart, Minister Tang, on 23 January of last year. I highlighted, in particular, the level of concern in Ireland in relation to Tibet and strongly encouraged the Chinese authorities to engage in meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama on the issues of concern.Ireland is also pursuing the issue of Tibet through the EU-China human rights dialogue, which has proven to be the most effective fora in which to raise human rights issues of concern with the Chinese authorities. At the session of the dialogue on 5-6 March 2002, the EU raised its concern about the situation in Tibet, in the context of the political and cultural rights of minorities. The EU put forward its concerns, in particular over the detention of monks, closure of monasteries, and discrimination in population control policies.The EU will continue to raise these concerns at all appropriate opportunities, including at the forthcoming EU-China human rights dialogue, to be held in Athens on 5-6 March 2003.

Most recently, on 27 January, I issued a statement deploring the loss of life resulting from Israeli military action in Gaza on 26 January. It has always been Ireland's position that closures, restrictions on movement and collective punishments are both contrary to international humanitarian law, including the Fourth Geneva Convention, and counterproductive in the search for peace. Demolitions, whether of homes or of businesses, constitute a form of collective punishment. These views have been made known to the Israeli Government and their diplomatic representatives in Ireland on many occasions and have been the subject of numerous statements by the Government.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	797	The National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, does not keep a waiting list of all children awaiting psychological assessment. Instead, there is effectively a waiting list kept in each school, by the school principal or by a nominated contact teacher. During the first visit of the academic year made to a school by its assigned  psychologist, there is a discussion about the school's priorities for psychological support during the coming year, including the needs of children who have been identified as possibly needing psychological assessment.In line with my Department's policy, as outlined in the "Learning Support Guidelines", NEPS operates a staged model of assessment. This is explained in its leaflet "Working together to make a difference for Children." A copy of the leaflet will be made available to the Deputy.At the first stage of the assessment process, parents and class-subject teachers meet to discuss their concerns and to devise an individualised programme to meet the child's needs. If significant concerns remain after a period of implementing this plan, the child moves to stage 2. This stage involves input and advice from the school's relevant support teachers. A more detailed or intensive programme will be devised at this point. After a further period of implementation, a review takes place and, if necessary, a referral may be made to the school's psychologist. A number of options will be explored with the psychologist, including the possibility of an individual psychological assessment. The psychologist may, at any stage in this process, offer advice on such matters as behavioural management, learning support programmes, resource materials and such like. Children benefit more from this indirect approach that supports the adults who engage with them on a daily basis and more children can receive help in this way.Gathering statistics of children awaiting assessment would therefore be difficult to achieve with any degree of accuracy, as many children who are initially referred by schools as needing individual assessment are, in fact, helped during stages 1 and 2 without the need for individual interview. Furthermore, the attempt to gather such statistics would divert the psychologists from their core work in schools for a substantial amount of time.I believe that the system outlined enables schools to address their current priorities and to re-prioritise children as circumstances change. It also allows for a measure of equity of access to the service as between different schools. A strict fixed waiting list system would not allow for this flexibility. However, it can be said that the experience of NEPS psychologists is that the demand for casework generally exceeds the time available. This is in line with the experience of longer established psychological services in other jurisdictions.

Against a background of stringent overall control of public expenditure increases for the coming year, this  increase reflects my commitment to maintaining the progress being made to engender the requisite skills in third level to develop a knowledge-based society.The costs of the scheme administered by IRCSET will be met from this overall provision, along with other current research costs associated with programmes administered by the Higher Education Authority, the institutes of technology, the Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences and HEAnet. As part of the process of determining the allocations for 2003, officials of my Department have met with a number of these agencies, including the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology.My Department is finalising the allocations to the various bodies at present and it is expected that these will issue in the near future.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	805	In October 2000 the Government agreed to establish a scheme through which victims of childhood abuse while in institutional care could apply for compensation for their injuries. The Government's decision was taken regardless as to whether the religious congregations who owned and managed the institutions concerned would contribute to the scheme.Shortly after the Government's decision, the religious congregations indicated that they wished to contribute to the compensation scheme. The Government welcomed this approach because apart from the financial contribution, the Government felt that some closure to the issue of childhood abuse could best be achieved if both the religious congregations and the State participated.Negotiations between representatives of the religious congregations and the State followed and arising from this an indemnity agreement was signed on 5 June 2002. Under the terms of the indemnity it was agreed that 18 religious congregations would contribute a total of €128 million to the redress scheme.In return for this contribution the Government agreed to grant an indemnity to the congregations that are parties to the agreement. This indemnity applies only to cases which are eligible to be dealt with under the terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002, which are not resolved within this scheme and in respect of which litigation is commenced within six years of the date of the agreement. It is hoped that all or certainly the vast majority of cases will be dealt with through the redress scheme rather than the courts. Therefore, it is expected that the indemnity will apply to relatively few cases.There is no scope within the agreement for the congregations to increase their contribution in the event of the cost of the scheme exceeding a particular level. However, as I have already outlined, the Government's initial decision to set up the scheme was made regardless of whether the religious congregations concerned would contribute. The agreement was not based on any expected total cost for the redress scheme. The breakdown of the contribution is as follows: cash €41.14 million; counselling service €10 million; property €76.86 million.

In order to re-evaluate the overall position and establish priorities for future years, I have instructed officials in my Department to meet with the Higher Education Authority and the institutes of technology to review the entire set of demands in the third level sector, to establish prioritisation and agree re-phasing in preparation for a building programme in 2004 and future years.Capital Funding Provided to Institutes of Technology 1998 to 2002

There is no basis for this statement. National policy is that, apart from the most disadvantaged, part-time adult education provision should be self-financing. Accordingly, vocational educational committees administer local adult education services with funding from two sources.My Department provides funding for basic education courses, which are provided free of charge or at nominal costs to participants. The allocation to the City of Waterford VEC for this purpose has increased constantly over the last few years, thereby allowing the service to expand correspondingly.Other types of course are required by my Department to be entirely self-financing. Fees are payable by participants. The nature and scale of such courses, and the level of fee charged, are matters to be decided by the VEC.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	817	Three proposed syllabi in physical  education for junior cycle, senior cycle and leaving certificate, have been received in my office from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, and are currently being evaluated by my officials. The NCCA, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Science, undertook an extensive consultation process prior to the submission of the syllabus documents to my Department. Much of the feedback obtained during this process has been incorporated in the final documents.The content of leaving certificate physical education marks a significant departure from existing practice in that it explores the theoretical foundations underpinning physical education and physical activity. The syllabi advocate that this integration of theory and practice should be a primary concern, both in teaching and in assessment, and that this should be reinforced through the structure and methodology of the examination procedures. In addition, the non-examination syllabi, particularly at senior cycle level, seek to encourage and emphasise the importance of greater participation in physical activity.My Department is currently examining the extent to which in-career development for teachers may be needed to support the implementation of these syllabi and how this support might be delivered having regard to the need for in-career development in relation to other areas of second level curriculum. When these and other details relating to the assessment of leaving certificate physical education have been agreed by my Department, I will be in a position to make a decision on a date for implementation for all three syllabi.

In the case of the five languages Irish, French, German, Spanish and Italian a combination of a terminal written examination, oral and aural examinations is used.

When the analysis is complete and, if in order, the school authorities will be authorised to proceed to construction during 2003.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	820	My Department allocates resource posts, special needs assistant posts and concessionary teaching hours to second level schools to cater for the needs of special needs pupils. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authorities. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupil(s) in question and determined on the advice of the psychological service.The number of pupils with special needs who are attending mainstream second level schools is not readily available. To date, my Department has allocated in the order of 690 wholetime equivalent teaching posts and over 360 special needs assistants to second level schools for the school year 2002-03 to cater for the needs of students with special needs.In addition, I am taking steps to ensure that the necessary arrangements are put in place for an efficient and effective system for service delivery. A key development in this regard has been the decision to establish the National Council for Special Education. The council, which will have a local area presence, will play a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs. It will also have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to address specific areas of special needs provision. Such areas would include the question of the future role of the special school sector and how the reservoir of experience, expertise and commitment which the special school sector represents can be better utilised to support the special education system. Arrangements for the establishment of the council are well advanced. A chief executive has recently been appointed to the council and it is intended that it will be vested by the end of March 2003.I also intend to bring forward legislation, based on the Education for Persons with Disabilities Bill, to clarify the rights and entitlements of persons with disabilities to an education service and to put in place the necessary framework to deliver the required services. My Department is consulting interested parties on the proposed legislation. My objective would be to secure the passage of this legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer recess. I am confident that the measures I have outlined will ensure that all children with special needs receive the support they require to enable them to gain maximum benefit from the education system.

Indeed, following negotiations with teacher representatives, there have been many improvements in the conditions of service of teachers in recent times. These include the introduction of release time for teaching principals, improvements in conditions for the appointment of administrative principals, the introduction of payments in respect of supervision duties and the provision of increased substitute cover for absences.My Department is in ongoing discussion with the teachers' representatives concerning the conditions of service of primary teachers. The recruitment and retention of teaching staff is a difficulty for many boards of management at present due to the current shortage. The difficulty is not confined to disadvantaged schools alone. The action being taken to increase the teacher supply generally will ensure that the current difficulties with regard to teacher supply will be eliminated. The difficulties currently being experienced are added to by the number of teachers currently availing of the career break and job sharing schemes.In the context of the commitment concerning retention and support policies referred to in the programme for Government, I have asked officials of my Department to examine how best this commitment can be implemented over the next five years and to consult with the partners in education in that regard.I understand that a sub-group of the statutory committee on disadvantage is currently examining the issue of recruitment and retention of teachers within schools in disadvantaged areas. I will examine any recommendations, which this sub-committee may make on the issues.

It is hoped to discuss proposals with the colleges of education in the near future.As part of the minimum academic requirements specified by my Department for entry to primary teacher training, all candidates, including school leavers, mature students and university graduates, must have a minimum of a grade C in higher level in Irish in the leaving certificate or an approved equivalent.The approved equivalents in respect of this Irish requirement can be found on the Department's website under the teacher training category of the learners and trainees section. This requirement embodies both the written and oral element of a student's proficiency in Irish. In the event of a modular course being introduced, it is expected that this requirement would also apply.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	878	Dealing with educational disadvantage remains a key priority of this Government and my Department has introduced a range of key interventions and programmes in primary schools aimed directly at tackling the problem of educational disadvantage. The early start pre-school pilot project is in place in 40 selected schools in designated areas of disadvantage. It is aimed at children who are considered to be most at risk of not reaching their potential and are aged between three and four years. Early start units have been established in two schools in Dublin 24 and both schools are benefiting from additional resources to cater for the pre-school children attending.A new disadvantage programme – Giving Children An Even Break – was launched in 2001 to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of primary schools carried out in March and April 2000 by the educational research centre in Drumcondra on my Department's behalf. Over 75% of primary schools took part in the survey. Indicators such as unemployment, medical card possession and rented local authority housing have been found to be reliable indicators of levels of disadvantage in schools. The survey provides a valuable basis for directing resources to the areas of greatest need. All the schools identified as having enrolled pupils with characteristics of disadvantage have been invited to participate in Giving Children an Even Break.Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual at risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.

The institutes of technology are statutory bodies established under the Regional Technical Colleges Acts and Dublin Institute of Technology Acts 1992 to 1999. Under these Acts, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institutes, including admissions, are a matter for the institutes concerned and I have no function in this area. The enterprise platform programme offered by institutes of technology is a training and enterprise support programme that specifically targets graduate entrepreneurs who have an innovative, knowledge-based business idea and hold a recognised third level diploma or degree.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	902	Educational publishers from Ireland and overseas publish textbooks and activity  books to support the implementation of curricula and editors of textbooks and activity books for use in primary schools select the content of such books. The material selected for inclusion in textbooks reflects the personal preferences of the editors. When selecting material for textbooks, editors are required to follow guidelines drawn up by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment. It is common practice for school authorities and teachers to introduce a new series of textbooks to a school on an incremental basis over a number of years, thereby replacing existing textbooks gradually. It is therefore not unusual for schools to purchase, for example, the books for the junior classes before the books for the senior classes are published. While some changes in textbooks as a result of introduction of revisions to curricula are inevitable, it must also be recognised that textbooks play only a limited role in the teaching and learning process.The selection of textbooks for primary schools is a matter for the principal and staff of the school, under the authority of the board of management. The textbooks selected should present positive images of people from different cultures. The guidelines for publishers from the NCCA specifically state that textbooks written ab initio by publishers should present multi-culturalism in a manner that reflects “a balance between the child's experiences and the educational responsibility of fostering attitudes of equity and tolerance.”  Many books, stories and poems contain passages, which, if taken out of context, could be regarded as portraying people from particular backgrounds in an unfavourable light. Examples of passages from books set in the Second World War immediately come to mind where variously Jews, English, Japanese and Germans are depicted both favourably and unfavourably. Equally, some of the folk tales and fairy tales that are part of our rich literary heritage could be cited in this regard.I cannot therefore definitively state that a passage from a book used in a primary school should never contain a negative racial or social portrayal, because to do so would be unduly censorious. Rather, I believe that teachers should be aware of the importance of presenting such material in a manner that challenges prejudice and discrimination.

I am conscious of the need to ensure that parents are fully represented as partners in the education system. To this end, my Department financially aids the National Parents Council and recognises it as representing the views of parents in a wide range of fora. Following its decision in relation to membership of the National Prices Commission, the CSPA has also advanced a case for funding and recognition. Before reaching a decision in relation to these matters and mindful of the significance of any decisions for future parental representation, I have put in place a collaborative review process. I have requested Mr. Jack O'Brien, a retired Assistant Secretary General of my Department, to comprehensively review the issue of State financial support for and recognition of parental organisations at second level. My Department has requested the co-operation of all the parental organisations at second level in the conduct of this review.

The standard per capita grant increased from €224.74 in 1997 to €256.49 in September 2001 and was further increased to €266.49 in September 2002. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from €25.40 per pupil in 2000 to €88.88 from September 2002 and to €99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	905	The Registration Council is the statutory body responsible for the recognition of qualifications for the purposes of teaching in voluntary secondary schools. Each applicant for registration as a secondary school teacher must, among other things, hold a third level degree which must be adequate to enable the holder to teach at least one of the approved subjects or areas of study approved for the purposes of a course of instruction prescribed in the rules and programme for secondary schools and a training in teaching qualification acceptable to the council and which is directed towards those between 12 and 18 years.Qualifications obtained through third level colleges in the UK do not have general recognition in this country for the purposes of teaching in a secondary school. It is a matter for college authorities to seek recognition for the third level courses they provide. Procedures are in place in my Department to facilitate any such request from a recognised third level institution here or abroad. The only college from the United Kingdom which has sought and received recognition of certain of its qualifications is St. Mary's College for Physical Education, Strawberry Hill, London. Any teacher who holds a qualification obtained in the UK may apply, as an individual, to the Registration Council to have the qualification recognised for the purposes of registration as a secondary school teacher. Applications should be directed to the secretariat of the Registration Council which is located in my Department's offices in Athlone.

The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. The fund operates on a discretionary basis. Applications for assistance are made in October of each year by the individual students through their third level institution or post-leaving certificate centre. The allocations are paid to the relevant institutions in respect of the particular students.Decisions on applications are taken by an ad hoc advisory group which, in 2002, consisted of representatives of the Department – from the sections dealing with administration and inspectorate, the latter a retired officer – a representative from the Association for Higher Education Access and Disability and a representative of the Higher Education Authority. There have been no cutbacks in the services referred to by the Deputy; funding has increased from €1.565 million in 2000 to €3.682 million in 2002 and the number of students benefiting has increased from 511 to 1,132. Following the issue of awards, my Department received representations and appeals which related, in particular, to applicants who had, unsuccessfully, requested the services of a note-taker. In view of those appeals, officials from my Department who were not members of the original advisory group conducted a review of all those applications where a note-taker was applied for, but not granted. Following completion of this review, an additional 52 applicants are being awarded funds in respect of note-takers, including the student referred to by the Deputy. The outcome of the review is being communicated to the disability officers, who will then inform the successful applicants.

The school referred to by the Deputy has not been designated as disadvantaged.There are no plans at present in my Department to designate further second level schools as disadvantaged. However, I wish to assure the Deputy that the needs of the school in question will be considered in the context of any future review of the disadvantaged and home school community liaison schemes at second level.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	914	My Department operates a grant scheme towards the cost of providing school textbooks for needy pupils in post-primary schools. For the purposes of this scheme a needy pupil is a pupil from a family where there is genuine hardship because of unemployment, prolonged illness of a parent, large family size with inadequate means, single parenthood, or other family circumstances, such as substance abuse, which would indicate a similar degree of financial hardship.Principal teachers administer the book grant schemes in schools in a flexible way under the terms of the schemes based on their knowledge of particular circumstances in individual cases. A consultancy report, which was submitted to my Department in 1993, dealt with the factors which contribute to the cost of school text books. The main conclusion of the report was that book rental schemes are the most practical way of limiting the cost of school books to parents. The report, copies of which were sent to all schools, contains a number of useful suggestions, including a code of good practice for successful operation of book rental schemes. My Department endorses the recommendations and urges school authorities to put in place book rental schemes to the greatest extent possible.

The amount spent to date by my Department on this project is €381,469. As with all proposals involving major capital expenditure, it is essential to confirm that the provision of a new school in Newport is necessary, having regard to pupil numbers and existing provision in the general area, before it can be allowed to proceed to the next stage, that is, invitation of tenders. Accordingly, a review of second level provision in the Newport area is being undertaken at present by the planning section of my Department. A decision on the Newport proposal will be taken on foot of this review. In the interim, no further action will be  taken in relation to the development of the proposed school in Newport, including the determination of an official catchment area.

I was merely drawing a distinction between the concept of access to information which has already been published on a public website and the concept of accountability. The most efficient and cost-effective way in which Deputies can access information published on a website is by looking up the relevant website as opposed to putting down a parliamentary question or submitting a freedom of information request to my Department.My reply of 14 November 2002 also made it clear that I did not consider that any business which is proper to Dáil Éireann could be conducted via the Internet. The Deputy can be assured that I fully accept the principle of accountability to Dáil Éireann in respect of all matters within my remit.

However, when compared with the 2002 outturn, which takes account of additional income from the increase in the charge for examinations, registration and student services, the 2003 Estimates provision represents a 1% increase.The funding provision for 2003 was decided having regard to the current economic constraints and to the Government's commitments and priorities. In this regard it should however be noted that in the last five years there has been a 95% increase in the provision for the technological sector as the recurrent grant increased from €192.7 million in 1997 to €376.1 million in 2002. In the circumstances it will be a matter for the institutes to manage their resources in 2003 and where necessary to effect economies to keep expenditure within approved budgets. Under the terms of the Regional Technical Colleges Acts and the Dublin Institute of Technology Acts the control and management of the institutes are the responsibility of their management authorities.

A formal notification of intention to apply for the recognition of a school in the Glenbourne-Ballyogan area, to commence operation in September 2003 has been received from the Dublin archdiocese. This notification has been referred for consideration to the new schools advisory committee, which I established recently to provide independent advice regarding the recognition of new primary schools. The committee is at present undertaking a consultation process with the current school providers and the general public in the area in which it is proposed to locate the new school.A formal application for recognition of the school must be submitted not later than 31 January 2003. Assuming an application is received, the new schools advisory committee will consider the matter and make a recommendation to me on recognition. It is my intention to notify each applicant of my decision in their case by 30 April 2003.

This group was established in the United Kingdom in 2002. Funding is provided by my Department to a number of survivor groups both in this country and the United Kingdom. This funding is allocated for the provision of an information service for the survivors of institutional abuse. An outreach service based in the United Kingdom has been established in five Irish centres within the last two years. These centres provide information to survivors based in the United Kingdom on a variety of issues including counselling, housing, the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board.It is my view that any further funding available should be directed towards the further development of the outreach service in the United Kingdom. Officials from my Department met with two representatives from the Irish Survivors of Institutional Abuse International on 8 October 2002 and advised them that no funding would be allocated to new survivor groups in the United Kingdom.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	989	I am very aware of the issue of bullying in schools and my Department has moved to tackle the issue on a number of fronts. The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is a central part of the social, personal and health education curriculum. The social, personal and health education programme is part of the curriculum in every primary school at present and by September 2003 will be a mandatory component of the junior cycle in all second level schools. The content of the programme reflects current best practice in the area of educating children in relation to bullying. As part of school development planning schools are advised to have stated policies and to develop plans on discipline, health and safety and countering bullying behaviour.  Parental involvement in the planning process is encouraged. Through their representation on the board of management and through parents' associations parents can readily be consulted in the clarification and development of these policies and plans.Guidelines were put in place in 1994 as an aid to schools in devising their individual anti-bullying strategies. The purpose of the guidelines was to assist schools in devising school-based measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness of the problem among school management authorities, staff, pupils and parents. The national educational psychological service is also available as a support service to schools in relation to individual students who encounter difficulties.While arrangements with regard to attendance at board of management meetings is entirely a matter for the school authorities at local level, the issue referred to by the Deputy is being considered by the education partners in the context of guidelines under section 28 of the Education Act 1998.

The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools was substantially increased from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €105 per pupil in 2001-02 and €111.58 in respect of the 2002-03 school year.Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard per capita grant of €224.74 that applied in 1997, was increased to €256.49 in September 2001 and was further increased to €266.49 in September 2002. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from €25.40 per pupil in 2000 to €88.88 from September 2002 and to €99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.

Preparation for regulations providing for the first election to the council is at an advanced stage. These regulations will be the subject of consultation in the very near future. Once agreed, the first tranche of sections of the Act will be commenced. My intention is that this will be during the summer.The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act was passed by the Oireachtas in July 2001. To date, five sections have been commenced dealing with the first meeting of newly constituted committees, the designation of reserved and executive functions, and provisions relating to the chief executive officer and the staff of the committees. Consultations with interested parties are at an advanced stage regarding the commencement of the remainder of the Act and I hope to be in a position to make a further commencement order in the next month.

However, the concept of dual enrolment raises a range of practical issues which require careful consideration. These issues relate to such matters as the manner in which staffing and funding resources allocated in respect of such children should be apportioned between two schools catering for the same pupil for limited periods. Issues relating to capitation funding and entitlement to special transport services would also arise. No decisions have yet been taken in relation to these matters.

Where the condition is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of such children at present. Decisions on placements are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child and parental wishes in relation to their children.All special schools and special classes dedicated to children with specific learning disability – dyslexia – operate at a reduced pupil teacher ratio of 9:1 and pupils attending such facilities attract a special increased rate of capitation funding. Children with dyslexia attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis may be supported by the learning support teacher service or the resource teacher service. The level of support provided is based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual child. At present, there are 1,531 learning support teachers and approximately 2,300 resource teachers in the primary system.My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special needs with their education, including children with dyslexia, where recommended by relevant professionals. Grant aid is also provided to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland to aid in its work in supporting persons with dyslexia.

Certain provisions of budget 2003, in particular the extension from five to eight years of the period over which capital investment can be written off against tax liability, could impact negatively on proposed renewable energy projects. I am therefore finalising the detailed terms and conditions of AER VI in a manner which addresses the impact of certain budgetary decisions.I expect to publish the terms and conditions of AER VI shortly. The competition will be conducted in accordance with EU procurement rules. It would be inappropriate, therefore, to go into any further detail other than the general outline I have already provided until the necessary notice making the terms and conditions is published in the Official Journal of the European Communities. This is necessary to ensure the exact terms and conditions generally available are accessible by all simultaneously in accordance with the procurement rules.

In March 2002 the pensions services office of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs contacted the Department of Public Enterprise requesting confirmation of service in respect of the individual concerned in relation to a claim received for a pre-1953 contributory pension. The Department of Public Enterprise conducted an extensive search for the relevant records, including a search request to the GPO, but no record of the individual or file could be found. This has subsequently been confirmed again by my Department.In such circumstances individuals are requested to provide an affidavit in relation to the claimed period of employment. I am advised that an affidavit was provided in this case and the details were conveyed to the Department of Social and Family Affairs on 5 June 2002.

The consultants were Patrick J. Tobin Consulting Engineers, Hynes Building, St. Augustine Street, Galway. The total cost of the study was €34,001 of which my Department provided funding of €25,500, representing 75% of the total cost. This was paid to Mayo County Council in November 2002.In March 2002, Mayo County Council submitted an application for funding for a marina under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan. The Deputy will, however, be aware that the revised Estimates for 2003 included major adjustments in marine spending. The funds allocated to marine tourism in 2003 are already fully committed to a number of flagship projects. There are no additional funds available for any additional marine infrastructure projects under the NDP marine tourism grant scheme in 2003.

While members of the Western Regional Fisheries Board may from time to time, undertake inspections of salmon farming oper ations as part of the board's role of protection and development of the wild fisheries resource, the Department is not aware that any member of the board has carried out visits of any farms in regard to a possible outbreak of the disease. For some years now, all marine aquaculture sites have been subject to routine testing for the presence of the ISA virus. The testing and sampling programme, carried out under EU legislation, is undertaken by the Marine Institute on behalf of the Department.Aquaculture licences are subject to a variety of conditions designed to ensure best practice and the taking of all necessary precautionary-remedial action. It is a licence condition that fish escapes must be reported immediately to the Department and to the relevant regional fisheries board. There is no requirement on insurance companies to notify the Department or its agencies in regard to claims made in respect of losses by farms due to fish escapes.

In relation to the general issue raised, the position is that the establishment of annual total allowable catches, TACs, and quotas are part of the EU structure for the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fish stocks. These are agreed by Council and their implementation is a legal obligation on member states. In relation to the Irish Box, I am working intensively at EU level to seek changes to the Commission proposal for western waters to provide for the continuation of the Irish Box as a conservation zone with continued restrictions on fishing effort within the box.

In the past five years current grant-in-aid funding to TG4 has risen from €14.8 million in 1998 to over €21 mill ion in the current year, representing an increase of over 40%.While this year's Estimate is almost €0.65 million less than the funding provided in 2002, last year's provision included a special once off provision of €1million that was announced in the 2001 budget. In the current difficult financial climate I do not expect to be in a position to provide additional moneys to TG4 in 2003.I welcome the very positive impact that TG4 has had on the development of the independent production sector. The fact that the vast majority of Irish language programming continues to be commissioned by TG4 means that the independent sector is set to continue to benefit from the significant public moneys provided to TG4.

The National Salmon Commission recommended the limits based on the best and latest information available to it.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1022	I propose to take Questions Nos. 568 and 572 together.Like most Irish people, I am very conscious of our island status and extensive and vulnerable coastline and am accordingly only too aware of the potential for marine and environmental damage caused by pollution from oil and other hazardous substances.Legislation is continually under review at both EU and international level. Ireland has consistently supported measures to improve maritime safety and the protection of the marine environment.The catastrophe of the tanker Erika, which ran aground on 12 December 1999, polluting almost 400 km. of the French coastline, triggered two packages of measures to protect the marine environment.The first Erika package of measures comprised: a directive amending Directive 95/21 on Port State Control; a directive amending Directive 94/57 on Common Rules and Standards for Ship Inspection and Survey Organisations (Classification Societies); and a regulation on the accelerated phasing out of single hull tankers.The amending directives on port state control and classification societies were adopted by the European Parliament and Council in December 2001 and are expected to be transposed into Irish law during the first half of this year.Following agreement at the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, single hulls tankers are to be phased out in 2003 for vessels delivered in 1973 or earlier and in 2015 for those delivered in 1989 or later. While there are no oil tankers on the Irish register, I am very concerned about the dangers of oil spills in international waters close to our coast. Irish legislation giving effect to MARPOL, the International Convention on Marine Pollution, will have to be amended to provide for the phasing out of single hull tankers and, as of this process, I am examining the options for prohibiting the movement of these tankers in Irish waters at this time.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1023	Following protracted and difficult negotiations at the December Fisheries Council, agreement was ulti mately reached by EU Ministers on a new basic CFP regulation which will govern EU fisheries policy over the next decade.The reform package contains many of the recommendations of Ireland's national strategy review group. In this regard, I draw attention to an action plan to address the problem of the discarding of juvenile fish catches, stronger control and enforcement, and new regional advisory councils giving fishermen a strong voice in shaping future fisheries policy at EU level.Throughout the CFP reform process, intensive consultation was maintained by my Department with all the leading players in the Irish fishing industry. I am satisfied that this high level of consultation played a significant role in ensuring a broadly satisfactory outcome from an Irish perspective.I will continue to work intensively, in consultation with the industry representatives, to effect change to fisheries policy on an ongoing basis to ensure that EU policy takes account of Ireland's position and needs into the future.

The A licence won by Hutchison Whampoa with a total fee of €50.7 million provides for 80% population coverage with minimum roll-out requirements of 53% of the national population by the end of December 2005 and 80% coverage by the end of December 2007.The B licences, which were taken up by O2 and Vodafone with a fee of €114.3 million, provide for a minimum population coverage of 53%, equivalent to five major cities, and roll-out requirements of 33% demographic coverage by the end of June 2006 and 53% demographic coverage by the end of June 2008.The differentiation in the fees reflects the greater roll-out cost to the A licensee in meeting the coverage and time constraints compared to the minimum requirements for the B licences. All three licensees have licence commitments to launch during 2003 and the commission intends to confirm fulfilment of each operator's milestones at the relevant times.

The process which will lead to meeting that commitment will include the carrying out of a review of the current sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme and the preparation of a long-term strategy for the development of sporting facilities. It is envisaged that the national audit of local sports facilities, which the Deputy will acknowledge will be a complex and lengthy task, will be undertaken in tandem with the development of the long-term strategy.

In 2002 payments amounting to €43,229,329 were made by my Department to projects grant-aided under the programme. These payments are made on foot of required documentation and invoices or certificates of payment received, which must be for work beginning after the date of grant allocation. I have arranged for the full listing of these payments in 2002, broken down by county, to be forwarded to the Deputy immediately. The information sought by the Deputy regarding the commencement and completion dates of these projects is not readily available.Also in 2002, a total of €18,093,767 was issued to the GAA out of a total grant of €19.05 million towards the development of Croke Park. This amount was issued in two payments of €9,525,000 in March 2002 and €8,568,767 in April 2002.In addition to funding for sports-related projects, €50,000 was provided in 2002 to the Foynes Flying Boat Museum, Foynes, County Limerick, towards the conversion of a storage area for display purposes.There were no arts and culture capital projects approved during 2002. However, a number of projects under the arts and culture capital enhancement support scheme, ACCESS 2001 – 2004, and other capital projects were approved during 2001, and some may have commenced during 2002.Details of the relevant projects follow:

These are, in order of progress: preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders  have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.Under the swimming pool programme, grants of up to €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Priority is given to projects based in RAPID areas. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.The preliminary report submitted by South Dublin County Council in respect of the proposal for a new swimming pool in Jobstown was approved in October 2001. Jobstown has been designated as a RAPID area and this proposed swimming pool will provide a much needed facility for the local people. My Department is awaiting the submission of the contract documents for the project by the council. On receipt of this documentation the proposal will be considered further.

The grant was subject to the terms and conditions of that programme and among these was the execution of a deed of trust, which provides, inter alia, for a refund of the grant in the event of the facility not continuing to be used for the purpose for which the grant was allocated. Deeds of trust are invoked by my Department's legal advisers, the Chief State Solicitor's Office, CSSO. Payment of the grant can only proceed when the deed of trust is in place.The CSSO is in communication with the organisation in question and its solicitors with a view to finalising arrangements which are required to enable the deed of trust to be put in place.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	The Deputy will be aware that the pre-hospital emergency care council, PHECC, was established in 2000 and that its primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for ambulance services personnel in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.The council has submitted proposals to my Department regarding the creation within the ambulance service of an emergency medical technician-advanced, EMT-A, post. The proposals require regulatory changes to permit EMT-As to administer medications. These regulatory changes are being progressed by my Department.My Department will continue to pursue policy initiatives aimed at improving key aspects of the emergency medical service to ensure that those calling on the service receive timely and appropriate care.

A meeting between my Department, the board and St. John of God representatives is scheduled for Wednesday, 5 February.I am aware of the concerns regarding the provision of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to enhance further the health-related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding is in addition to the significant revenue investment amounting to €188 million which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.Despite this significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the number of people in receipt of services, including full time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this population.The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.
#TimOMalleyPD	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-party	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-dob	unknown-#TimOMalleyPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to enhance further the health-related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism.

A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.I am aware that there are persons with autism who also have a second disability such as deafness and who therefore require a specific response if their needs are to be met appropriately. Responsibility for the provision of services to people with an intellectual disability or autism is a matter in the first instance for the relevant health board. Decisions on the precise services to be developed in each region are taken by the health boards, in consultation with the regional consultative and development committees, and in line with the service priorities which have been agreed for that region. This would include services for persons with specific needs such as those outlined by the Deputy.

I also had a meeting with the group at its request. During the course of the group's work, correspondence was exchanged in response to questions raised by members of the group and other relevant issues. Neither I nor my officials have met or corresponded with members of the expert group since the presentation of its report to the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service on 11 September 2002.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	I understand that the report referred to by the Deputy is still under consideration by the board of the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, IBTS, and has not yet been formally submitted to me. Until then, I am not in a position to comment on one of its recommendations. However, I have been informed by the IBTS that the project team is nearing completion of the design brief for the new Cork centre and is expected to finalise the site option appraisal shortly afterwards. The brief will then be submitted to the board for consideration in the first instance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1044	The question of recognition of hospitals and or specific non-consultant hospital doctor posts for training purposes is a matter for the Medical Council and the training bodies in the first instance. The council and-or the training bodies liaise directly with the relevant health board or hospital in this regard.Given that decisions regarding training posts may have service implications, I established the inter-agency healthcare forum in 2001 to act as a forum where both the regulatory bodies and the service providers and other key stakeholders meet to discuss these issues to progress developments and to find resolutions to any problems which arise.As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for the provision of services rests with the individual health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. In the case of St. Michael's Hospital, Dún Laoghaire, the relevant board is the Eastern Regional Health Authority. My Department, has therefore requested the regional chief executive officer of the authority to investigate the position regarding accident and emergency services at the hospital and to reply directly to the Deputy.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	As the Deputy will be aware, emergency ambulance service staff are at the front line of medical and pre-hospital care. It is widely acknowledged that clinical intervention in the first hour or shorter in the case of cardiac arrest can have a major impact on a successful outcome where there is life threatening or indeed any serious injury. The timely intervention of an emergency medical technician, EMT, is a critical part of this emergency response. Emergency ambulance crews often have to provide services in difficult and traumatic circumstances. Not only do they have to deal with the application of emergency care to seriously ill or injured patients but often have to calm and reassure distressed relatives and friends.The increasing emphasis on the clinical aspects of the EMT's role in emergency medical care is very much in evidence in the development of emergency medical services worldwide. The extensive use of medical priority despatch and clinical audit systems are indicators of this. The ambulance service is in many ways the emergency arm of the health services.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1050	Details on the number of external defibrillators located here at present are not routinely collected and collated by my Department.Policy on the development of emergency medical services in Ireland is set out in a number of documents, including the health strategy, Quality and Fairness – A Health System for You, the Strategic Review of the Ambulance Service, 2001, and Building Healthier Hearts, the Government's cardiovascular health strategy. The approach set out in these documents follows the internationally accepted principles of the chain of survival, which provides that effective care for cardiac emergencies requires early access to emergency care, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, CPR, early defibrillation and early advanced care.The cardiovascular health strategy clearly highlights the importance of patient-centred pre-hospital care involving not only the ambulance service but general practitioners, first responders and the public at large who all have a role to play in providing the right care at the right time. In line with this approach, services are being developed to provide an appropriate level of care in the community to deal with cardiac emergencies. My Department funds a bystander CPR training programme which is organised by the Irish Heart Foundation. This programme aims to increase the availability of CPR skills in the community.Defibrillation skills now form a part of basic training for all ambulance personnel. In line with developments in technology which allow people to use defibrillators safely with less training than in the past, my Department is supporting a pilot first responder programme, which includes defibrillation skills. This project is being undertaken by the North Western Health Board. My Department has also supported initiatives to provide GPs in more remote rural areas with defibrillator and support equipment and training to allow them deal with emergencies in advance of the arrival of an ambulance. These schemes are in line with the focus of the cardiovascular strategy which seeks to put a pre-hospital care network in place based on the principles of the chain of survival. Further expansion of these initiatives will fall to be progressed in the further implementation of the cardiovascular health strategy.The Deputy will be aware that the pre-hospital emergency care council was established in 2000 and that its primary function is to develop appropriate standards in pre-hospital emergency care. It is in this context that the council is pursuing the development of professional and performance standards for the ambulance services and for ambulance services personnel in addition to the accreditation of institutions providing training for emergency medical technicians.

This research was an extension to the Asthma Insights and Reality in Europe (AIRE) survey, which was carried out in seven countries in Europe in 1999. This study has confirmed that there are some variations in asthma prevalence figures throughout the European Union confirming previous findings in the European Community respiratory health survey. Some of the likely factors, which may influence this variation, include better diagnosis, environmental factors, including smoking and workplace exposures to respiratory irritants. International studies are being carried out to investigate these possible links.

This figure is derived from HIPE (hospital in-patient enquiry) data, which gives details of activity in publicly funded acute general hospitals in the State. HIPE data is only able to record re-admissions to the same hospital, as it is not possible to trace patients from hospital to hospital. The above figure includes all in-patient re-admissions that is re-admissions for the same condition, for an unrelated condition and planned re-admissions, and excludes day cases.

The note provided details of the properties of acrylamide and gave advice on reducing exposure to acrylamide through healthy eating. The advice given was that consumers could minimise the risk to their health by maintaining a well-balanced diet and avoiding large quantities of fried foods such as chips and potato crisps. This information was also made available on the FSAI website, together with answers to a series of questions likely to be of most concern to consumers.The information was updated in June 2002 to provide an overview of the international scientific discussions, which had taken place on the issue since April 2002. These included the views of the EU Scientific Committee for Food and the results of the World Health Organisation's consultation with scientific experts on the matter. Information on acrylamide has also been provided on two occasions in the FSAI newsletter.In November 2002 the FSAI organised a seminar on acrylamide in food, attended by representatives of the Irish food industry and enforcement officers, at which international experts spoke on the matter. A press release was issued at that time. The FSAI has also commented on the safety of acrylamide in food in a number of media interviews and has provided advice directly to callers to its help line.The authority will continue to monitor scientific developments related to acrylamide in food and will provide information on these developments at regular intervals during 2003. In this regard the Public Analyst Laboratories, at the request of the FSAI, have developed methodologies for the determination of acrylamide in food and are currently surveying foods on the Irish market for acrylamide content.

Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship.Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.Persons suffering from specified conditions, including acute leukaemia, who are not already medical card holders, may obtain without charge drugs and medicines for the treatment of that condition under the long-term illness scheme. There are no plans at this time to amend the long-term illness scheme to include persons with other forms of cancer.

These include forensic and community psychiatric services. The Central Mental Hospital, Dundrum, is the national forensic service, which caters for patients which present the greatest risk.A review group on the future of the Central Mental Hospital submitted its report to the Department of Health and Children in 2002. The report includes plans to modernise, refurbish and extend the existing building and to provide a new residence on the campus. Overall capacity would increase from 90 to 120. A special project team, representative of all the main stakeholders, including the Irish Prisons Service, is now being established to progress the re-development as quickly as possible.Representatives from my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Central Mental Hospital, the Irish Prisons Service and the East Coast Area Health Board are currently formulating a service level agreement with a view to enhancing the services provided to the prisons by the Central Mental Hospital.My Department is also in discussion with a number of health boards with a view to developing regional forensic services.

The investigation included a number of human health studies to determine if the health of people living in the area was different to that of residents in surrounding counties and, if so, whether the difference could be attributed to environmental pollution. The results of the human health survey did not support a link to any form of local environmental pollution. The study did not find a significant degree of excessive ill health in the Askeaton area and it concluded that there was little basis for the concern that the problems in the area represented a threat to human health.A further study carried out by the National Cancer Registry examined cancer data relating to the Askeaton area covering the period from 1994 to 1999. The results of the examination indicates that cancer rates in the Mid-Western Health Board area from 1994 to 1999 were lower than the national average and that cancer rates in the Askeaton study areas 1 and 2 from 1994 to 1999 were lower than the Mid-Western Health Board average and conformed to national and regional patterns by cause. The data as examined by the National Cancer Registry do not support a hypothesis that the incidence of cancer in the Askeaton region is higher than would be expected based on either Mid-Western Health Board or national cancer incidence rates.

Immediate consideration was given to the request and additional information was requested on 4 November 2002. The additional information was supplied on 28 November 2002. Further consideration was given to the request and on 5 December 2002 it was declined, as it was not considered to fall within the remit of my Department.The group was informed that my Department funds counselling services for those who as children suffered abuse in a residential setting and does not fund the provision of information, as requested by the group concerned. Funding for the provision of information falls within the remit of the Department of Education and Science.

The scope of the task force's recommendations is such as to require a multi-faceted response involving educational and health care inputs. The task force's recommendations are currently being considered by both Departments.There has been a significant investment in both health related and educational supports for persons with autism in recent years. Additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated by my Department to services for persons with autism or intellectual disability in 2003 to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with autism or intellectual disability. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with autism and those with an intellectual disability.In particular €14.6 million has been invested by my Department in health related support services for children with autism or intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and out-reach support to children of schoolgoing age. The Government is committed to the ongoing development of these services as outlined in the programme for Government.

A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support to children of schoolgoing age.However, many health boards and specialist service providers have been experiencing difficulties in recruiting allied health professionals, in particular speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and psychologists. This is due primarily to the general shortage of available staff in these grades nationally.Health boards and agencies have been and are continuing to undertake intensive recruitment drives at home and abroad. My Department has asked the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority to explore other approaches which might result in the maintenance of an existing level of service provision or enhancement in line with agreed services developments for children using the resources allocated to the services. It is a matter for the ERHA and the health boards to decide on the specific approaches, which they may consider appropriate in this area.In response to my concern regarding the high level of vacancies my Department commissioned a report from Dr. Peter Bacon and Associates on current and future supply and demand conditions in the labour market for speech and language therapists, occupational therapists and physiotherapists. The study was published in July 2001. The report recommends a major expansion in the number of training places available for those professions.An interagency working group was established comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Education and Science and the Higher Education Authority (HEA). The HEA, following a formal bidding process between third level educational institutions, has allocated an additional 175 training places to respond to the training needs identified in the study. In addition the Northern Area Health Board undertook a concerted overseas recruitment drive on behalf of all health boards. Procedures are being streamlined to minimise the length of time taken to validate foreign qualifications consistent with the primary need to ensure that all therapists working in the health sector are appropriately trained and qualified.

The Comhairle review will inform considerations on the development of neurology services nationally, including the Mid-Western Health Board.

The revised design brief was recently submitted to the Department for approval and it is currently being examined.Funding of €600,000 has been approved to progress the preparation of the development control plan (DCP) which the Midland Health Board has advised is programmed for completion in May 2003. The Midland Health Board also advised that a commencement date for construction is dependent on design solutions proposed by the design team, particularly the staging of the contract works, and that the preparation of a time and cost programme for the completion of the project will be feasible on completion of the DCP.When I announced the project, the total anticipated cost was in excess of €57 million at mid-2001 prices.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	The national children's strategy, published in November 2000, contains a commitment that: "Children will have access to play, sport, recreation and cultural activities to enrich their experience of childhood."Local authorities are and always have been empowered to provide play, recreational and amenity areas. While the number of public playgrounds is low, research undertaken in 1997, when the previous Government took office, indicated that 46% of local authorities did not provide playgrounds. This figure has now been reduced to 12% at end 2002. Significant development in public play facilities has occurred since it was identified as an issue for children in the national children's strategy. Most counties' strategies for economic, social and cultural development now include a reference to play and play facilities.A recent survey of local authorities indicated that there are 167 local authority provided public playgrounds with fixed play components, one public skate park and six additional public playgrounds provided by Dúchas. As in other countries, public play infrastructure is supported and developed at a local government level. I am unaware of any published statistical comparisons on public playgrounds provision at a national level in other EU states. However, I do know that the city of Edinburgh provides 153 public playgrounds to serve a population of approximately 500,000. I am led to understand that Sweden has some 50,000 public playgrounds serving a population of almost 9 million, but this has not been confirmed.The issue of insurance for play facilities will be addressed within the context of the new play policy for the under 12s, which I will bring to the Government before Easter. Playgrounds provided by local authorities are insured through Irish Public Bodies Mutual Insurance Limited. To date, that body has not experienced a significant level of claims relating to playgrounds by comparison to claims relating to accidents occurring on paths or other public areas. However it must be kept in mind that the balance between risk and challenge is an essential element of play and needs to be viewed as such to ensure quality play environments for children.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1079	My Department is aware that the Southern Health Board (SHB) is anxious to develop a health centre at Glanmire, County Cork.All capital requirements for the health boards, including the Eastern Regional Health Authority, are funded under the national development plan (NDP). My Department is at present reviewing, from a national perspective, the NDP for each health board in light of the outturn position for 2002. This process encompasses providing for existing capital contractual commitments and where possible, the planning or construction of new projects nationally in 2003 or beyond. It is in this context that capital developments for the SHB, including the proposal in relation to a health centre at Glanmire, are being considered. My Department fully appreciates the importance of progressing this development and will continue to work closely with the SHB in relation to prioritising its overall capital needs in line with the funding resources available under the NDP.

The scheme provides for an agreed programme of care, free of charge, to an expectant mother arising out of her pregnancy and to her new born baby for six weeks after birth. In its report, the review group did not envisage a cervical smear test as part of the scheme, but noted that the Department of Health cervical screening committee was, at that time, examining all aspects of the cervical screening service. The 1996 report of the Department of Health cervical screening committee was subsequently published and currently informs policy in relation to the development of a national cervical screening programme. This report states that post-natal smears are not recommended in asymptomatic women.It is important to note, however, that while cervical smear testing is not currently provided by GPs under the scheme for medical card holders, such testing, which is found to be necessary in the context of the individual woman's medical examination and clinical needs, is available under the GMS scheme. For those women who require follow-up treatment, such service is available to all women, including medical card holders, within the public hospital system.

In this context legislation is being prepared to establish a system of statutory registration for 14 health and social care professions, including physiotherapy. Under these proposals, which have been approved by Government, a registration board will be established for each profession which will be responsible, inter alia, for establishing and maintaining a register of qualified practitioners and setting standards of education and training.Under these proposals, the title of physiotherapist will be protected, that is, only those professionals registered with the registration board for physiotherapists will be legally entitled to use the title, physiotherapist. This will represent a significant improvement on the existing legal position, where currently there is no impediment to a person in private practice describing themselves as a physiotherapist, irrespective of their qualification level. This situation does not arise in the case of those employed or working on behalf of the public health service where the title of physiotherapist refers only to those who meet the minimum qualification level for entry into the profession. This measure currently ensures quality assurance for State physiotherapists.

The person was discharged from Our Lady's Hospital, Crumlin, on 6 January 2003. The Eastern Regional Health Authority was in regular correspondence with the relevant hospital with a view to expediting the necessary surgery. The authority was awaiting the successful outcome of the discussions before so advising the Deputy.In my reply to the Deputy's parliamentary question of 27 June 2002, I advised that my Department had requested a report on the matter from the chief executive officer of the authority. The authority subsequently advised my Department of the position and in August 2002 I wrote to the Deputy advising him of the up to date position and the efforts of the authority to arrange surgery. I am also advised that the authority wrote to the Deputy in May 2001.

At my request An Comhairle undertook a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals providing such services. The report, published in February 2002, deals with staffing of accident and emergency departments at consultant level and links  reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows. An Comhairle did not specify the minimum number of patients per consultant in emergency medicine in its report. Instead it stated:Consultants in Emergency Medicine play a key clinical and managerial role in Emergency Departments. The appointment of additional Consultants should contribute to improvements in patient care and the flow of patients through the Emergency Department. However, appointing additional Consultants in Emergency Medicine, without changes in the organisation of Emergency Departments and hospital emergency care, will have little impact.The report provides valuable advice on the structures of our emergency services and the necessary linkages which will be required to eliminate the delays in emergency departments. In terms of manpower the report recommends a total of 74 consultants in emergency medicine nationally and recognises that the implementation of this recommendation will take time.I was pleased to announce a €40.63 million investment package aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector, over the winter period 2000-01. The investment package was targeted at a number of areas, including the recruitment of an additional 29 consultants in emergency medicine, of which three were for the South Eastern Health Board. To date, 17 additional consultants in emergency medicine have been appointed under the initiative and the recruitment process is continuing in respect of the additional appointments. These additional 29 consultants will see the total number of consultants in emergency medicine increase to 50.Responsibility for the provision of accident and emergency services at St. Luke's Hospital, Kilkenny and the other hospitals in the south eastern region rests with the South Eastern Health Board. The figures, for 2001, in relation to the number of attendances at accident and emergency departments at hospitals in the South Eastern Health Board, are outlined in the following table:

When an application is received in my Department it is registered in the finance unit and forwarded to the relevant services division for their assessment, evaluation and recommendation. All applications are then considered in the context of the recommendation and the overall level of funds available.The Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association has received grants from the Department of Health and Children allocation of national lottery funds towards the maintenance and expansion of its equipment bank since 1999 as follows: 1999, €12,697.38; 2000, €101,579.05; 2001, Nil; 2002, Nil.While the national lottery application submitted in 2002 was recommended for a grant by the services division, the number of applications received far exceeded the available resources and it was not possible to assist in this particular case during 2002. The organisation was informed of this on 26 November 2002 and advised that it may apply for a grant from the 2003 national lottery allocation if funding for this project was still required. My Department made an application form available to the organisation on 23 January 2003.

The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. Health boards and hospitals have been asked to identify public patients waiting longest on in-patient lists in order that they can be offered treatment under this initiative.The NTPF is initially concentrating on adults who have been waiting on in-patient lists for more than 12 months and children waiting over six months for a surgical procedure. Patients who satisfy these criteria may apply to their GP, hospital consultant or local health board liaison person to seek to have their treatment carried out under the NTPF. Alternatively, patients can telephone the NTPF's lo-call number at 1890 720 820.

The board has advised that a working group was established to examine the possibility of providing an interim solution to the provision of extended care beds for the elderly within Kilkenny city pending the development of phase two of the community hospital project at St. Luke's Hospital.The group considered the possibility of using vacated ward space at St. Canice's Hospital, Kilkenny. As the Deputy will be aware, a 24 bed unit will become available at the hospital when the elderly patients currently cared for at St. Joseph's Ward relocate to the refurbished psycho-geriatric St. Luke's-St. Gabriel's Ward at the hospital. The 24 bed ward is located on the ground floor adjacent to the refurbished elderly care wards at the hospital and has access to external garden space.The working group considers that St. Joseph's Ward would be suitable, following adequate upgrading, to be used on an interim basis for the provision of long stay beds for the care of older people from the Kilkenny area. A proposal for the upgrading of this ward has now been submitted to my Department by the board. This proposal will fall to be considered in the context of the funding available to the board under the national development plan and in the light of other priorities for development identified by the board. I would expect that, following consideration of the proposal by my Department, it will be the subject of discussions between officials of the board and my Department at which stage issues such as its priority rating will be clarified.

This funding is in addition to €262,000 which was provided to the organisation in 2002 and is for the purpose of implementing recommendations of the service audit of the sector. This is a considerable increase by comparison with the sum of €380,000, the approximate figure which the organisation spent in 2000. The additional funding which has been provided has significantly enhanced the support services which are being provided by the organisation to people with neuromuscular conditions.With regard to the position in the South Eastern Health Board, the provision of health related services in that region are entirely a matter for the board in the first instance. Organisations seeking funding for health related services in that region should contact the health board.

As the Deputy will be aware, capital funding has been made available to the Western Health Board for the purchase of a site and I understand that a potential site was made available adjacent to the parochial house in the town centre. A full option appraisal has been carried out on the site and it was felt that there were particular design constraints which made it less than ideal for the construction of a community nursing unit.I understand that, following discussions with the local clergy, additional land, increasing the site, was offered. This is currently being examined by the board's technical staff and the Valuation Office has been asked to revise its valuation in the light of the additional land offered. A further site, on the Claremorris Road, which is currently owned by Mayo County Council, has also been offered to the board, and a full appraisal and valuation has been carried out on this site.A decision will have to be made, in due course, on which site represents the best option for the development of a community nursing unit and ancillary services. As the purchase and disposal of property is a reserved function of the board, both of those site options will be presented to its property committee and, ultimately, to the board, for approval. I am sure the Deputy will agree that is imperative that the site obtained in Ballinrobe be the best possible option for the community nursing unit and ancillary services.

This includes the €6.349 million for the full year costs of the 2001 development programme and €1.269 million for the development of further services. This funding was provided in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for each health board in 2002. Under the Health (Amendment) (No 3) Act, 1996, it is the responsibility of each chief executive officer and his board to prioritise funding in order to ensure that services are provided and the allocation is not exceeded.

It is understood from the authority that there are currently 50  beds dedicated to the care of the elderly, 46 of which are long stay, the remaining four are for respite care in Peamount Hospital. All of these 50 beds are currently occupied. These facilities were introduced in response to pressures in the acute hospitals in previous years. The remaining beds in Peamount Hospital are divided up between intellectual disabilities, young chronic sick, and specialist acute beds for the management of tuberculosis and respiratory illness. The authority and the South-Western Area Health Board are working closely with Peamount Hospital on opportunities for the enhancement and development of services in line with regional needs.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1142	As is normal practice at this time of the year, my Department is reviewing its overall capital programme under the national development plan in the light of final expenditure on projects for last year and revising cashflows for the current year. This is a continuous feature of the monitoring of progress and expenditure of individual capital projects.The national development plan is a multi-annual programme which provides for enhanced infrastructural investment in the health sector. The plan commenced in 2000 and last year my Department reviewed with the health boards progress and issues arising in the first two and a half years of the plan.The Deputy may wish to note that a mid-term review of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme, which includes the health measure, under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 will be held in mid-2003. Preparatory work is at present under way in relation to this. The result of this will be published in due course as part of the overall review of the economic and social infrastructure operational programme.

All existing approved capital contractual commitments in each health board are being funded by my Department on an ongoing basis. My Department is at present examining all capital commitments in the light of the final outturn position for 2002 and revised requirements for projects in 2003 and beyond.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1144	Health impact assessment is a combination of procedures, methods and tools by which a policy, programme or project may be judged as to its potential effects on the health of a population and the distribution of those effects within the population. It can operate at local, regional, national and international level.Preliminary work has been carried out on the introduction of health impact assessment. The priorities for 2003 are the development of an appropriate methodology which uses health impact assessment tools and the provision of training for individuals and organisations as part of the capacity building process. There is added value in developing this work on an all-Ireland basis and the Institute of Public Health is facilitating capacity development for both my Department and the Department of Health and Social Services in Belfast. It is anticipated that the initial work on methodology will be completed shortly and that training will commence in the next few months.The health strategy also recommended the establishment of a population health division in my Department and each health board which would facilitate health impact assessment and promote health proofing of all government decisions. The establishment of a population health division is currently being considered in the context of the restructuring plans for my Department. Work on restructuring is being carried out in parallel with the audit of structures and functions of the health system which is currently under way.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1145	Preliminary talks on a revised contract for consultants commenced in 2001 and the parties to the negotiations have met in plenary session on seven occasions since then, under the chairmanship of Mr. Mark Connaughton SC. To date the discussions have centred on two key issues arising from the current – 1997 – contract, namely: the introduction and operation of a revised grievance and dispute procedure; and the proposal to amend Clause 4.3 (Administrative Leave) of Appendix IV of the contract (Disciplinary Procedures).In relation to the former, the parties agreed to a revised scheme in October 2002. The latter is a more complex issue, which is still some way from resolution. Once agreement is reached on this issue, it is hoped that both parties can begin talks on the substantive issues in relation to a new common contract for consultants.

Clearance by my Department for these posts was requested by the Western Health Board on 20 June 2002. The documentation was processed by my Department and forwarded to the Local Appointments Commission and the Western Health Board on 28 June 2002. The Local Appointments Commission advertised these posts along with posts for the Midland Health Board on 19 September 2002. Interviews were held on 22 January 2003. Eight candidates applied but only six candidates presented for interview. The Local Appointments Commission has advised my Department that the candidates and the health board will be notified of the results shortly.

This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €188 million, which has been made in these services since 1997 and which is built into the ongoing budget base. The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, over 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.There has also been further significant progress in relation to the transfer to more appropriate accommodation of persons currently accommodated in psychiatric hospitals and other inappropriate placements. The number of persons accommodated in psychiatric hospitals in October 2002 was 452, down from 571 in 2001 and 970 in 1996. Planning approval has been granted in respect of the new residential and day services to be built on the St. Ita's campus for residents of the St. Joseph's intellectual disability services, with building work due to commence this year. Approval has also been given to commence the planning and design work in relation to a residential and day service complex for a further 30 persons in Lusk.

The purpose of the review was to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the services provided by Gheel and the appropriateness of the staffing levels within the service in comparison with international best practice.The report puts forward a range of recommendations covering areas such as staffing levels, the board of directors, management structures and systems, service standards and users, families and primary care givers and training development.At present Gheel services are provided in the East Coast and Northern Area Health Board regions. The East Coast Area Health Board currently takes a lead role in relation to the services provided by Gheel as all funding for this service is channelled through their board. The area boards concerned have accepted the recommendations of the report.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1153	The drugs payment scheme, DPS, with a monthly threshold of £42, €53.33, replaced the drug refund scheme, DRS, and the drug cost subsidisation scheme, DCSS, in 1999. This scheme provided that families only had to meet the first €53.33 a month of spending on approved prescribed medicines. The DCSS threshold was £32, €40.63, per month per individual, and for the DRS it was £90, €114.28, per quarter for each eligible person and dependants. Under the DRS, the person paid for medicines at the pharmacy, and claimed a refund from the health board at the end of each quarter. There was no increase in the thresholds for the DRS or DCSS since 1991. The threshold for the DPS was raised from €53.33 to €65 with effect from 1 August 2002 and from €65 to €70 with effect from 1 January 2003.The DPS has provided a fairer and more user friendly system than the previous schemes, particularly through the provision of monthly medicine budgeting for families, and has produced significantly greater overall benefit for patients. It introduced full reimbursement, at point of supply, of the cost of approved drugs above the monthly threshold. In line with quality customer service principles, there was no longer any need to pay first and then reclaim this expenditure from the health board, and, unlike the DCSS, everybody was eligible for the DPS.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1154	The general medical services scheme is a treatment based scheme which provides for a range of services and the supply of drugs and medicines from an approved list, free of charge to medical card patients. These services are provided by general practitioners, community pharmacists, dentists and other health care professionals who hold contracts with the local health boards.Since acupuncture is as yet an unlicensed treatment in Ireland, it is not available under the scheme. I am not in a position to indicate what the position of the Irish Medical Organisation would be as the matter has not been discussed with it.I would add that in November 2002, the Institute of Public Administration launched a report, which I commissioned, into alternative medical practitioners. One of the recommendations of the report was the establishment of a working group to examine the whole area and advise my Department. This working group is in the process of being established.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1158	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person, regardless of nationality, who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility, category 1, that is, medical card holders, or limited eligibility, category 2, for health services. Health boards normally regard a person as "ordinarily resident" in Ireland if he or she satisfies the health board that it is his or her intention to remain in Ireland for a minimum period of one year.Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and they are entitled to a full range of services including general practitioner services, prescribed drugs and medicines, all in-patient public hospital services in public wards including consultants services, all out-patient public hospital services including consultants services, dental, ophthalmic and aural services and appliances and a maternity and infant care service.

It is envisaged that the report of the expenditure review will be launched in the near future.Arising from the issues raised in the expenditure review, the Ombudsman's report and experience gained to date from the working of the scheme a review of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations has commenced in my Department. The review is at a preliminary stage and written submissions have been invited from interested parties. In addition informal consultations with some interested parties have taken place. It is the intention to engage in a formal consultation process involving all the key stakeholders before proposals for amending the scheme can be developed. In the meantime, no changes have been made to the existing scheme.

This year, my Department and the health boards are funding 13 dentists from various health boards – including two from the Western Health Board – for specialist in orthodontics qualifications at training programmes in Ireland and at two separate universities in the United Kingdom. An additional €0.146 million has been provided to the Western Health Board for the training of these two dentists. These 13 trainees for the public orthodontic service are additional to the six dentists who commenced their training last year and one dentist whose specialist training is nearing completion. Thus, there is an aggregate of 20 dentists in specialist training for orthodontics. The creation of an auxiliary grade of orthodontic therapist is another structural measure being introduced in order to increase the number of orthodontic treatments.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1170	Arising from the health strategy – Quality and Fairness – A Health System For You, one of the key actions for dealing with public hospital waiting lists was the establishment of the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF was set up in April 2002 and referred its first patients for treatment at the end of June. A total of 1,920 patients received treatment under the national treatment purchase fund initiative in 2002.Expenditure by the NTPF in 2002, including set up costs, amounted to €6.6 million estimated, of which €5.6 million, awaiting year-end invoices, was attributed directly to patient care and approximately €1.0 million to indirect patient care and once-off costs. Private hospitals who treat patients under this initiative are paid on the basis of an agreed price per procedure which in turn is competitive having regard to what is paid to these hospitals by medical insurers.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1171	I propose to take Questions Nos. 744 and 745 together.Significant progress has been made in addressing the human resource requirements of the health service in the area of clinical psychology. In the year to end-2001 there has been an increase of over 100%, plus 30 posts to approximately 60, in the number of trainee clinical psychologists employed. The Deputy may also wish to note the significant increase, in excess of 30%, plus 91 to 380, over the past two years in the numbers of fully qualified psychologists working in the health service.My Department is currently supporting the provision, for the second year, of in excess of 30 training places in clinical psychology through the Psychological Society of Ireland's, PSI, post-graduate diploma. The report of the joint review group on psychological services, published in March 2002, refers to the swift response of my Department to the requirement for the provision of additional training places.Primary responsibility for the provision of training places to meet recruitment needs in clinical psychology, consistent with the recommendations of the joint review group rests with the health boards, especially in the context of the requirement to better integrate human resource planning with the service planning process. This is reflected, for example, in the provision of funding directly by health boards in support of training places in clinical psychology at UCD and TCD.I understand that, following a request received from my Department, the director of the health boards executive has undertaken to work with the directors of human resources in the health boards to develop an approach to facilitate the implementation of the recommendations of the joint review group. This will be undertaken in light of service imperatives, funding priorities and relevant developments such as the recommendations on investment in education and training included in the action plan for people management published in November 2002.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1172	In December 1999 the Government concluded that the arrangements in place to provide insurance and indemnity cover for health service agencies and the professional staff employed by them were no longer satisfactory. It decided that these fragmentary arrangements should be replaced by a new State-funded scheme based on the principle of "enterprise liability". In directly assuming responsibility for these liabilities the Government was concerned to ensure that the Exchequer did not assume responsibility for liabilities which properly belonged to others. Accordingly the Government decided that the new scheme would have no retrospective effect. This means that insurance companies and medical defence bodies which were paid premiums and subscriptions to cover events which had occurred before the commencement date of the new scheme remain liable for claims arising from these events.The new scheme covers the corporate liability of publicly-funded agencies providing clinical services and the activities of their professional staff. It is proposed that it will also cover the private practice of hospital consultants that takes place in public hospitals. Consultants will remain responsible for organising their own indemnity cover for any private practice which takes place elsewhere. This issue is still the subject of discussions with the organisations representing the medical profession.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1174	The determination of eligibility of applicants for medical cards is, by legislation, the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the relevant health board. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable without undue financial hardship to arrange medical and other services for themselves and their dependants. The means test applicable for medical card applicants is based on family income. In exceptional cases, where the family income of applicants exceeds the income guidelines, a medical card may be issued for one member where medical and/or other needs may so dictate.I am not aware of any change at local health board level in the methodology for dealing with such cases.

However, on the basis of international studies on the prevalance of diabetes, there may be approximately 200,000 people with this disease in Ireland. For those diabetes sufferers who require hospitalisation, data are available from the hospital in-patient inquiry, HIPE, system which records information on all hospital discharges for in-patients and day cases in publicly funded acute hospitals. The following table indicates the number of hospitalisations with a principal diagnosis  of diabetes for inpatients and day cases for each of the years 1997 to 2001.

My Department has therefore written to the chief executive officers of the health boards and the regional chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority asking for a report on the issue. This information will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as it is received.I should point out that I am committed to facilitating boards in achieving a reduction in the waiting times for cervical smear test results. In this regard, my Department has, over the last few years, allocated additional funding to provide for the establishment of new posts, purchase of new equipment and the introduction of new technology in the cervical cytology laboratories. In 2003, an extra €1.4 million has been provided to assist ongoing developments in the cervical cytology and colposcopy services.I recently approved the piloting by the phase one cervical screening programme of a proposed contingency plan to assist in overcoming capacity problems in the cervical cytology laboratories. This plan involves the contracting out of cervical smears to an external laboratory subject to compliance with the requirements set out in the 1999 document, Quality Assurance Guidelines for the Irish National Cervical Screening Programme. I am advised that arrangements for the pilot are at an advanced stage.

Further guidelines on commercial development located at a park and ride facility  were issued in July 2001. Copies of the guidelines have been made available in the Oireachtas Library.Issues relating to the current tax incentive schemes for park and ride facilities are a matter for the Minister for Finance. The park and ride tax incentives are provided for in the Finance Act 1999 and the Finance Act 2001. The qualifying period for the incentives was extended to June 2004 in the Finance Act 2002.The purpose of these tax incentives is to support the development of park and ride schemes in order to facilitate the use of public transport. A person wishing to avail of the capital allowances and reliefs available must make a formal application in writing to the relevant local authority. If the local authority is satisfied that the park and ride facility, and associated development, where relevant, conforms to the guidelines issued by my Department and also conforms with the relevant sections of the Finance Act, it may issue a certificate which will enable the developer to avail of the tax incentives. Tax incentives for private sector provision of park and ride car-parking were introduced in addition to provision being made by the public sector.In the greater Dublin area, the DTO's blueprint for the development of the region's transportation network, A Platform for Change, recognises the role of park and ride as part of an integrated approach to transport.The Government provided specific funding in 1999 and 2000 to create an additional 2,300 car-parking spaces adjacent to DART and suburban rail stations in the greater Dublin area. Planning for the Luas system also incorporates proposals to create park and ride facilities at appropriate stops.A recently completed DTO-commissioned study into the role bus-based park and ride facilities could play in the greater Dublin area concluded that only a limited role could be played by bus-based park and rides in the greater Dublin area because of the size of the city. I understand that the office of the director of traffic has been mandated to develop a pilot project. The operation of the pilot project will be monitored by the DTO to assess the potential for further projects.

Penalty points will be applied to the driving licence of those convicted of speeding offences, and to those who pay a fixed charge to the Garda in order to prevent the instigation of court proceedings.It would be premature to draw any firm conclusions as to the overall effectiveness of the system at this early stage. However, preliminary indications from the Garda Síochána in respect of November and December 2002, show that, with no reduction in enforcement efforts, there has been a significant drop in the number of detections for speeding offences. There was also a significant reduction in road deaths over that two-month period when compared with the same period in 2001, 46 in 2002; 77 in 2001.The statistical data available from this early operational period for the system suggests that the core objective of improving driver behaviour through the deployment of penalty points is being achieved.The recording of convictions for offences is a matter for the Courts Service. In addition, the compilation of data relating to payments of fixed charges where the relevant notices are issued by the Garda Síochána is a matter for that force. Both of those organisations transfer the appropriate data to the Department of the Environment and Local Government to facilitate its entry into the national driver file which is the responsibility of that Department. It is understood from the Department of the Environment and Local Government that 2,216 penalty point notices have issued as at 24 January 2003. This represents a small proportion of detections for speeding since 31 October last as persons have up to 56 days to pay a fixed charge notice and penalty points can only be applied to a licence record where a fixed charge has been paid or the offender has been convicted.

In addition, such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for directional indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. The use of fog lights is permitted only in fog or falling snow. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. The Garda is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.

The contents of his reply were communicated to the retirees' association in October 2001.In summary, the Minister does not consider that it would be appropriate to accede to the request from the association for an injection into the pension fund and that there must be continued adherence to the long-standing policy in this area, that is, that pension entitlements for employees of commercial State bodies, which includes Aer Lingus and Aer Rianta, are matters primarily for the trustees, the members of the relevant scheme and the company involved.I have been advised that neither Aer Lingus nor Aer Rianta is in a position to provide additional payments into the pension fund to meet the claim by the retirees' association. I understand that both companies have been meeting all of their liabilities towards the pension fund in accordance with the rules of the scheme.There has been no obvious solution to this matter despite detailed examination over the last number of years. Nevertheless I am asking the companies to keep the situation under review.

Steer Davies Gleave, the consultants engaged by my Department to conduct the study, drafted both documents as required under the terms of reference and are fully responsible for their content. I published the report on 14 November 2002 as it was presented to me by the consultants.

My predecessor subsequently appointed a working group to examine and make proposals for the establishment, operation and endowment of the fund. The working group has now completed its deliberations and its recommendations are currently under consideration with a view to my bringing proposals to Government in the near future.

He subsequently sought asylum in the State and was referred to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner. He was subsequently granted refugee status. There is no record either in Dublin Airport immigration, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner or my Department of the documentation to which the Deputy refers having been obtained from the person in question.

To that end and following the relocation of the division to new premises late last year a new telephone system was installed with a view to improving access to the division. Telephone callers to the division on either 01-6167700 or lo-call 1890 551 500 reach an automated message service outlining several options depending on the nature of the query and an option to speak directly with a switchboard operator.There are a number of helplines in operation which can be accessed through either of the above numbers within their respective hours of operation. These helplines and their respective hours of operation are as follows. Visa queries are dealt with on Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m. General immigration queries are dealt with daily from 9.30 a.m. to 1p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. Citizenship queries are dealt with on Tuesdays and Thursdays from 10 a.m. to 12.30 p.m.

Following publication of the European Convention on Human Rights Bill, I had a comprehensive meeting with representatives of the commission, at their request, when I was Attorney General. At that meeting we discussed the policy and background underlying the drafting of the Bill. The commission has since published its views on the matter, based on the submission it made on the Bill to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.While I am always willing to meet the commission, and I have had a meeting with members of the commission since my appointment as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it has not sought a further meeting with me on the issue of the Bill. In any event its views, as well as those of the other bodies who have made submissions to the joint committee, will, I am sure, be discussed on Committee Stage of the Bill.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that the general issue of identify fraud/theft is not a significant crime problem at present in this jurisdiction. At the same time, it is worth noting that the annual report of An Garda Síochána for 2001 indicates that there has been an increase worldwide, and in this country, in certain types of offences involving credit card fraud and account use in particular.The Garda bureau of fraud investigation has national responsibility for fraud related crime. In addition to investigating such offences, the bureau plays a proactive role in prevention and early detection. Strategies employed include: presentations to commercial organisations and financial institutions; various training programmes; publication of information and consultations with professional bodies, Government Departments and other agencies.The recent Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 provides that offences such as making gain, causing loss and obtaining services by deception are subject on conviction to terms of imprisonment up to five years. A deterrent to certain thefts by deception, of course, is the fact that the Criminal Justice Act 1994 requires that designated bodies, such as financial institutions, take reasonable measures when providing certain services to establish the identity of their customers.

Dealing numbers D2001CK014852Y and D2001CK014890G refer. I understand that, due to their complicated nature, these types of applications, which require examination of an applicant's entitlement to the property, can take some time to process. I am further informed that queries issued to the lodging solicitors on 22 January 2003 and that the applications cannot proceed further until the queries raised are dealt with. However, I assure the Deputy that the application will receive further attention on receipt of a satisfactory reply to these queries.

This represents an increase of 41 or 15% since 31 December 1997. I am further informed that the gardaí in Wexford are currently deploying uniformed members on public order patrols during the hours of darkness, particularly at weekends. Plainclothes gardaí are also deployed, which has resulted in the arrest of seven people for acts of vandalism in the town centre.The situation is being kept under review by the Garda authorities and when additional Garda personnel next become available, the needs of the division will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. I am informed that the Garda CCTV advisory committee has not to date received an application from Wexford. The local gardaí are, however, consulting with the local authority on the matter. If an application is received, it will be processed in the normal manner and the committee will make recommendations on completion of its deliberations.

The station is open to the public from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m., Monday to Saturday, inclusive. It is also open from 12 p.m. to 1 p.m. on Sunday. When not open, personal access call box and call diversion systems are in operation which are linked to the district headquarters at Cobh Garda station.I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties and that it is considered that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1233	Following a survey of prisons in 2001 by specialist engineers, a number of areas requiring removal of asbestos were identified. In February and March 2002, asbestos material was removed by professional contractors, advised by the specialist engineers, from the areas identified in Portlaoise Prison. The removal was carried out in accordance with the health and safety regulations, Department of the Environment and Local Government regulations and approved codes of practice for the removal of asbestos.The areas identified in Portlaoise Prison neither housed prisoners nor were accessible by prisoners or their visitors. Neither did the contractors employed for the removal of the material come into contact with prisoners. The areas from which the asbestos was removed were monitored and tested and all test results showed that the areas are now free of asbestos. Queries were raised by and on behalf of some families of prisoners in Portlaoise Prison regarding possible contamination from asbestos subsequent to the removal of asbestos from the prison and were dealt with by the Prison Service through a representative of a prisoner support group.

His wife entered the State on 10 July 2000 with her young son and claimed asylum on that date. Following consideration of the cases of both parents by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, they were informed on 6 April 2001 that their appeal had failed.Subsequently, the persons concerned were written to on 19 May 2001 and informed that the Minister proposed to deport the family from the State. They were given the options of making written representations to the Minister to set out any reasons as to why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, voluntarily leaving the State or consenting to the making of deportation orders. No response was received to this correspondence.

The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner considers applications for a declaration as a refugee at first instance and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal considers applications for a declaration at appeal stage. Both offices were established under the Refugee Act 1996 to make recommendations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on whether such status should be granted. Both offices are statutorily independent in their functions and it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this case.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	Kilkenny is one of 17 locations set to receive new Garda CCTV systems over the next two years subject, of course, to the availability of funds. The other locations are, in alphabetical order: Athlone, Ballyfermot, Bray, Carlow, Castlebar, Clondalkin, Clonmel, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Ennis, Finglas, Galway, Limerick, Sligo, Tallaght and Waterford.Applications for Garda CCTV systems are assessed by the advisory committee, which was established by the Garda Commissioner to evaluate CCTV applications, on the basis of Garda operational needs and include the following criteria: crime/public order statistics in the area; population and level of activity there; the recommendation of local Garda management; any special circumstances/needs that exist and the likely impact of a Garda CCTV system in the area. Co-funding is also a feature of Garda CCTV systems and this is usually addressed when it has been decided to install a Garda CCTV system in an area. All applications for Garda CCTV systems must be prepared in co-operation with the local Garda district and divisional officers and receive their support. Applications will normally have been made as a result of representations from groups forming residential, commercial and local government interests, and would be expected to contain the location and scope of the cameras required.An application for a CCTV system was received from Kilkenny, with the support of both the Kilkenny county borough and chamber of commerce, and has been approved. I am advised by the Garda authorities that planning for the installation of a CCTV system for Kilkenny is scheduled to commence later this year. There are a number of stages in the planning of new Garda CCTV systems. A tender process is initiated by the drafting of tender documents which include, inter alia, details of the evaluation criteria to be applied and the technical specifications of equipment required for the CCTV system. These documents are produced by the superintendent in charge, telecommunications project management at Garda headquarters.At this stage, the local divisional officer will be appointed chairman of a local CCTV implementation group. This group, which is kept aware of the progress of the scheme, will consist of representatives of each local group expressing an interest in the scheme, such as the chamber of commerce and the relevant local authority. Representatives of the Office of Public Works, ESB and other service providers who may be in a position to advise on or provide assistance in the implementation of the scheme are also included as well as Garda crime prevention and representative body personnel.

The practice extends to all driving courses and operates at all times throughout the year. Course participants are advised that they should continue the practice of using dipped headlights following completion of the course.I am further advised that the use of dipped headlights on all marked patrol vehicles at all times is under active consideration at this time and a decision will be taken in this matter based on the best advice available, having due regard for the safety of Garda members and other road users.

Currently the Garda Síochána use "diamond grade" yellow and blue markings on patrol vehicles and tender for vehicles on that basis. At the moment, the Garda Síochána has no plans to specify a silver and blue colour scheme in invitations to tender for marked Garda vehicles. The question of vehicle conspicuity is one that is continually under review, having regard to the safety of Garda personnel, public visibility and general law enforcement. The best advice available is used in coming to any decision regarding the choice of colouring and markings for patrol vehicles.

The intensive targeted patrolling was welcomed by the local community.The Garda mounted unit has recently seen an increase in resources with extra allocation of Garda and mounts. The deployment of the Garda mounted unit for the second quarter of 2003 is currently being considered and the Tallaght district is included in these considerations. Tallaght retailers and management of The Square shopping complex have kindly come forward to present an additional horse to the Garda mounted unit and this will be presented on 24 February 2003. The extra allocation of a horse will assist in providing additional patrols where feasible.

The investment has manifested itself through the provision of local juvenile liaison officers and in providing several Garda youth diversion projects within the M district. These projects are crime prevention initiatives and are targeted at "at risk" juveniles in the ten-18 years age bracket. While the projects themselves have a broad range of objectives, the essential aim is to divert young people from becoming involved in criminal/anti-social activity through the provision of suitable activities to facilitate personal development and encourage civic responsibility.As the Deputy may be aware, there are three Garda youth diversion projects operating in Dublin south-west at present, namely, the GRAFT project (Giving Ronanstown A Future Today), the KEY project (Killinarden Enhancing Youth) and the JAY project (Jobstown Action for Youth). My Department and the Garda Síochána are committed to continuing these initiatives.

Seventeen public order incidents there were reported to Garda between 1 November 2002 and 25 January 2003. All of these calls were responded to, and in eleven cases youths were moved on from the area under powers conferred by the Criminal Justice  (Public Order) Act 1994. In the other six incidents youths had dispersed before the arrival of Garda units.I am further informed that the area in question is regularly patrolled by both uniform and plainclothes Garda. These patrols are further augmented by Garda assigned under "Operation Encounter". In addition, I understand that the community police van patrols the area on Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights in order to curtail anti-social behaviour. The community Garda for the area has spoken to residents and discussed their concerns. Garda are continuing to monitor the area and will continue to take appropriate action where necessary.

The amount of space currently available at each location for this purpose is limited. In the Dublin metropolitan region, there is a dedicated car compound available at the Talbot complex in Santry. A car compound is provided at new divisional/district Headquarters that are being built, provided that there is sufficient physical space on the site. No discussions have taken place between the housing section in Garda headquarters and south Dublin city council in this regard.

Dealing Number D2000SM004835H refers. I am informed by the Registrar of Titles that queries issued to the lodging solicitor on 9 October 2002 and the application cannot proceed until these queries have been satisfactorily resolved.

On 27 November 2000, Council Directive 2000/78/EC was adopted establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation. The implementation of the directive will have implications for the age provision of the Employment Equality Act 1998. My Department is currently formulating legislative proposals to implement the Council directive and any implications for admission to the Garda Síochána will be considered in that context.

As part of that remit, my Department collects data in relation to the 3% target for employment of people with disabilities in the public service (excluding Civil Service data which is collected by the Equality Unit in the Department of Finance). Although the target has yet to be achieved, there has been a degree of progress over the last number of years. No differentiation is made in the collection of the statistics between people with particular types of disability. The overall statistics for the public service (other than the Civil Service) at 1 January each year are as follows:

Ireland is, however, a party to the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons. This convention allows, under certain conditions, for an Irish national to be repatriated in order to serve the remainder of a sentence imposed in another country, where that other country has also ratified the convention.Jamaica is not, however, a party to the convention. The Department of Foreign Affairs, through the good offices of the Honorary Consul of the UK in Kingston, has provided and will continue to provide all possible consular assistance to any Irish prisoners detained in Jamaica. My Department is not aware of any Irish organisations based in Jamaica which would assist such prisoners and their families.

The station is open to the public from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., Monday to Saturday, inclusive. When the station is not open, personal access call box and call diversion systems are in operation which are linked to the district headquarters at Enniscorthy Garda station. I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the extension of the current opening hours to 24 hours would necessitate the employment of Garda personnel on indoor administrative duties and it is considered that such personnel can be utilised more effectively in providing a visible Garda presence on outdoor policing duties.

The total value of cocaine seized in the area is approximately €135,000. Garda from the divisional drugs unit are aware that cocaine use has increased across the north inner city and in this regard they continue to monitor the area and give it appropriate attention through specific targeting and patrolling. The area is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain clothes Garda units augmented by divisional task force, drugs and traffic units where necessary.In addition, the Garda Síochána policing plan 2003 contains a commitment to conduct research in 2003 on the level of cocaine use in Ireland. The Garda research unit will conduct the research in consultation with the Garda national drugs unit and will bring forward policing recommendations accordingly. This commitment is in line with the objectives and key performance indicators in the national drugs strategy 2001-2008.

Additional documentation was subsequently submitted in connection with an appeal against the refusal. The application was approved on appeal on 24 January 2003. The following is  the position in respect of non-EEA nationals who are legally employed in the State and who wish to be joined here by visa required family members. The worker in question must have been in the State for a period of 12 months, with the exception of persons employed in a limited number of high skill areas where this period is reduced to three months, and have the expectation of remaining here for at least a further 12 month period before he or she can be joined here.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1271	Under section 2 of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 4 of the Children Act 1997, an unmarried father may become a guardian of his child by means of a statutory declaration made jointly with the mother. Such declarations are retained by or on behalf of the parents: there is no provision for their lodgement or registration. Accordingly, I have no information on the number of persons making declarations.Under section 6A of the Guardianship of Infants Act 1964, as inserted by section 12 of the Status of Children Act 1987, an unmarried farther may apply to the court to be appointed a guardian of his child. In determining whether an unmarried father should be so appointed, the court has to regard the welfare of the child as the first and paramount consideration. The vast majority of section 6A applications are made at District Court level. According to the annual report of the Courts Service, in 2001, 785 such applications were granted by the District Court, 37 were refused and 194 were withdrawn or struck out. The corresponding figures for 2000 were 763, 41 and 205.The balance struck in the existing legislation is a good one in that it provides that an unmarried father can become the guardian of his child by agreement with the mother or by obtaining a court order and, in making such an order, the court is required to regard the child's welfare as the first and paramount consideration. Subject to the welfare consideration, children should have the benefit of a family life which involves both parents and that it is highly desirable that unmarried fathers should, as the Deputy says, play an active role in their child's life.

It also recommended that health boards be allowed to set specific conditions for licences in their respective areas. As regards legislative reforms in this area, I have already announced a comprehensive codification of the entire liquor licensing code. This codification will draw on the valuable work of both the strategic task force on alcohol and the commission on liquor licensing and the recommendations set out in their respective reports.

In compliance with this legal obligation, the annual reports of the visiting committees are, subject to certain restrictions on the release of information of a personal nature, released to individuals who request them directly from my Department.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1277	As I previously explained to the Deputy, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.The function of visiting committees is to visit at frequent intervals the prison to which they are appointed and hear any complaints which may be made to them by any prisoner. They report to me any abuses observed or found by them in the prison and any repairs which they think may be urgently needed. The visiting committee has free access either collectively or individually to every part of its prison. In inspecting prisons, the visiting committees focus on issues such as the quality of accommodation and the catering, medical, educational and welfare services and recreational facilities.Members of committees are appointed by the Minister for a term not exceeding three years. At that point they are automatically removed from the committee and are either re-appointed for a further term or are replaced by new members. The maximum number that can be appointed for each institution is 12. Each committee elects its own chairperson.There are no specific criteria used in selecting individuals for appointment. The composition of each committee is drawn from as wide a spectrum as possible to ensure that the needs of prisoners are understood and met. This is the long standing practice used by successive Ministers in appointing members to the prisons visiting committees.Members of visiting committees receive no remuneration. Vouched expenses for travel and subsistence are paid, on the authorisation of the Prison Governor, in line with Civil Service rates.While an inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention was appointed in April last, his terms of reference do not include the hearing of individual prisoner complaints, which is an important function of the prison visiting committees.The visiting committees perform a valuable service and I take this opportunity to thank them for their efforts and hard work.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1278	Section 254 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended by section 54 of the Communications Regulation Act 2002, provides that a licence is required from the relevant local authority for the erection of overground electronic communications infrastructure along a public road.The provision of a telegraph pole, other than along a public road, would be subject to the planning code. The planning and development regulations 2001 provide that the erection of telegraph poles by a statutuory undertaker is exempted development subject to certain conditions and limitations including restrictions on the height and diameter of the poles. As the legislation has been so recently revised, I have no proposals for a further review at this stage.

Under the amendment made to the terms of the capital assistance scheme in November 2001, up to 25% of accommodation in new projects provided throughout the country by individual voluntary housing bodies with funding under the scheme may be allocated to elderly returning emigrants who satisfy eligibility criteria in relation to their present circumstances and are included in the Safe Home waiting list. Safe Home carries out a co-ordinating role liaising with relevant individual voluntary housing bodies throughout the country in relation to accommodation for eligible elderly emigrants who are included in their waiting list.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1289	All of the bogs advertised as proposed NHAs or cSACs in December 2002 are in the raised bog category, which is mainly found in the Midlands. I consider designation proposals for raised bogs to be complete and I have no plans to propose designation of further sites for this type of bog habitat.Blanket bog habitat characteristically occurs at all altitudes in the western coastal counties, from west Cork to Donegal, and on mountain ranges further east, notably in Counties Cavan, Laois, Offaly, Tipperary, Waterford and Wicklow. A substantial proportion of this particular type of bog has already been protected within candidate Special Areas of Conservation, cSACs, under the EU Habitats Directive.With the completion of proposals for designation of raised bogs, the blanket bog category is the next priority for consideration for Natural Heritage Area designations. Areas of blanket bog not protected within cSACs will be reviewed during 2003. I intend, before the end of this year, to propose those that meet appropriate scientific criteria for designation as statutory natural heritage areas. Most of the areas likely to be suitable for designation were published some years ago as proposed natural heritage areas on a non-statutory basis.

The subsequent High Court Order, December 2001, prohibited the use of 15 "unfair" terms in house building contracts and also prohibited stage payments in house building contracts, which exceed the percentages stipulated in the Irish Home Builders Association, IHBA, code of practice or which exceed "the extent and value of works carried out at the date specified for the payment in question".The IHBA code of practice stipulates that in the case of a purchaser who obtains the title to the site prior to the completion of the transaction, three distinct stage payments may be required, namely at joist level, i.e. 25%; at roof level, i.e. 25%; and at internal plastering stage, i.e. 25%, in addition to a booking deposit, 4%; contract deposit, 11%; and completion payment, 10%. Site costs are the subject of a separate contract.The IHBA code of practice may be accessed on the Construction Industry Federation website at www.cif.ie.

The original amount sought by Kerry County Council was €15,000 which was regarded by the Department's inspector as excessive and the grant allocated is considered to be adequate for the purpose.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1292	Article 18 of European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste prohibits member states from impeding the placing on the market of packaging which satisfies the provisions of the directive i.e. which is in accordance with the essential requirements in annex II of the directive as to the composition and the reusable and recoverable nature of packaging. Article 15 of the directive, however, allows member states to adopt economic measures in support of the objectives of the directive to ensure the recovery of packaging waste.On foot of the success of the plastic bag levy – which has dramatically reduced the number of disposable plastic bags provided to consumers, with a consequent positive impact on visible nuisance litter – An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to consider extending the use of levies to other areas such as non-reusable packaging. In this regard, my Department has recently received a report from Comhar – the national sustainable development partnership – which suggests that levies could be considered for problematic waste streams such as polystyrene food containers, subject to proper evaluation. I am now considering the issues raised in the Comhar report with a view to taking forward the Government commitment in this area.

The quarterly and annual bulletins for the period ended 31 December 2002 are at present being compiled and will be published in March 2003.While there are no proposals to change the schemes at this time, my Department will continue to keep the terms and conditions of the schemes under review.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1294	New Connections, the Government's action plan for the information society, outlines a number of e-government projects in the local authority area. A copy of New Connections is available in the Oireachtas Library. My Department is not directly involved in delivering these projects, which is the responsibility of the local authorities themselves. The Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, performs a key role in co-ordinating local authority efforts in e-government implementation and in providing local authorities with the systems required to deliver e-government services.My Department makes payments on behalf of the information society fund to the LGCSB in respect of e-government projects. Details of moneys paid in 2000, 2001 and 2002 follow. However, it should be noted that this does not represent the totality of investment in e-government initiatives by the local authority sector. Local authorities also fund projects in this area from other sources, including their own resources.2000

It is an offence for a person to cause or permit polluting matter to enter waters, including an aquifer. Among public authorities, responsibility for the protection of groundwater is assigned primarily to local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts. Other functions for protection of aquifers are exercisable by local authorities under legislation such as the Waste Management Acts and the Planning and Development Acts. The EPA exercises general supervision under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 in relation to the performance by local authorities of their environmental protection functions, and has responsibility for groundwater protection in the context of its own licensing, monitoring and other functions.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1299	The five year Travel ler accommodation programmes adopted by local authorities for the accommodation of Travellers, in accordance with the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act, 1998, estimated that 3,785 units of accommodation would be required to meet the accommodation needs of Travellers arising from 2000 to 2004. This included a future projection of an extra 1,684 units which local authorities estimated would arise due to potential new family formations etc. Information from the more recent assessment of housing needs published by my Department in December 2002 indicates that this additional projection will not be relevant to the period involved.The following table shows the accommodation provided in 2000 and 2001 and the estimate of the number of units of Traveller specific accommodation provided to the end of 2002. Details of the standard local authority accommodation allocated to Traveller families in 2002 are not yet available.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1300	As part of the cold weather strategy in Cork City, arrangements were put in place to provide a temporary emergency shelter for homeless persons over the Christmas period from 24 December to 31 December. This provision was in addition to the existing accommodation which is available to meet the needs of homeless persons in the Cork City area.Cork City Council liaised with the various voluntary bodies regarding the provision of the shelter and, as in previous years, this shelter was operated through voluntary effort. While financial support is available from the city council for this purpose, no application for funding for the project has yet been received by the council.While a total of 33 homeless persons used the shelter over the period, the average number on any night was 11 persons and only one person used the shelter for all eight nights.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1301	I propose to answer Questions Nos. 889 and 934 to 936, inclusive, together.Part IV of the Planning and Development Act 2000 sets out new and important powers for the protection of Ireland's architectural heritage through the planning code. Where a structure is of special architectural, historical, archaeological, artistic, cultural, scientific, social or technical interest, it may be listed by the local authority in the record of protected structures and comprehensive protections then apply to those structures. The Act however seeks to balance the rights of owners and occupiers of these structures with the overall obligation to protect and conserve the nation's heritage.While the Act does impose a duty of care on owners and occupiers of protected structures to ensure structures are not endangered, the owner or occupier of a protected structure has the right to seek a declaration from the local authority, to determine the works which may be done to a protected structure without the necessity to seek planning permission. The local authority declaration can be appealed to An Bord Pleanála. No fee is payable for a declaration.The declaration procedure is intended inter alia to ensure that the protections imposed in the Act are not unduly burdensome on owners and occupiers of protected structures who wish to do minor works which will not affect the character of the structure. It can also permit the owner or occupier to discuss proposed works with the authority to ensure that no misunderstandings can arise later.A conservation grants scheme was introduced in 1999 with the new legislation to assist owners and occupiers of protected structures to undertake necessary works to secure their conservation. The standard grant is 50% of the approved cost of works subject to a maximum of €13,000. A local authority may, at its discretion, vary this amount downwards, or in exceptional circumstances upwards, subject to a maximum allowable grant of 75% of the cost of the approved cost of works or €25,000 whichever is the lesser. A total of €2.88 million has been provided for the scheme in 2003 and allocations to local authorities will be announced shortly.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1303	The current standard for domestic effluent treatment and disposal from single dwelling houses is set out in Recommendation SR6:1991, which was drawn up by the National Standards Authority of Ireland and which was issued by the Department by way of circular letter to each planning authority on 8 January 1992.Recommendation SR6 indicates that, in general, site sizes for the proposed dwelling should be such that the septic tank effluent can be disposed of within the boundary of the site, without recourse to disposal in adjoining land, even in the event of failure of both the main and reserve percolation areas. Where a site has no mains supply, SR6 indicates that the basis for determining the site size must be the nature of the soil and subsoil and the depth to water table and-or fissure rock. Where groundwater is afforded good natural protection, for example by a thick clay-rich soil and subsoil, the recommendation is that that the site be no less than 2,000 square metres, approximately half an acre. Where the natural protection is limited, for example gravel rich soil and subsoil, the site should be no less than 3000 square metres. SR6 indicates that the overall density of septic tank systems in a locality may also need to be limited if there is likely to be a build up of contaminants, such as nitrates in the water supply. Sites with mains water supply, i.e. which do not depend on a groundwater supply within the curtilage may be slightly smaller. The minimum site size recommended for sites with a mains water supply is 1,500 square metres.The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA has published a draft manual on treatment systems for single houses in 2000 which was designed to help planning authorities, builders and others to deal with the complexities of on-site systems, including packaged systems. Instead of recommending a minimum site size, the draft EPA manual makes recommendations about matters such as separation distances from water courses and wells, site boundaries etc.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1322	Faulty alarms gave rise to 11% of the noise complaints made to Dublin City Council in 2001, the only local authority for which my Department has information. In this case noise from faulty alarms is the third lowest of all categories of complaints listed. Nevertheless, I recognise that alarms are a source of neighbourhood noise. A number of arrangements are in place to reduce the incidence of unnecessary noise from alarms and to tackle persistent incidence of such noise.In the case of Dublin, the city council issues guidelines in relation to intruder alarms which recommend that owners/occupiers of alarmed property should nominate at least two keyholders that can be contacted in the event of the activation of the alarm.The National Standards Authority of Ireland has published a voluntary standards specification (No. 199 of 1987). It operates a certification scheme to that standard which, inter alia, specifies a minimum of 15 minutes and a maximum of 30 minutes duration for the sounding of external alarms in buildings with the alarms being required to cease automatically after the maximum duration. The connection of monitored intruder alarm systems to Garda stations is contingent, inter alia, upon the use of alarm systems which are certified by NSAI and installed by certified installers, and the provision to the Garda of contact details for the keyholder and alternate keyholders.A European standard for external intruder alarms, which will replace all current national standards, will incorporate considerably stricter controls regarding minimum and maximum duration for the sounding of alarms. The new limits are 90 seconds minimum and 15 minutes maximum. This new standard will be the only one applied by the NSAI from September.The promulgation of the Irish standard, the development of the European standard, the requirements of the Garda for monitored alarms, improved equipment and the co-operation of installers certified by the NSAI have all been instrumental in ensuring that the incidence of false alarms and the failure of audible alarms to cut off have been significantly reduced.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1325	As indicated in the reply to Question No. 367 of 20 November 2001, it is not proposed to provide a subsidy from public funds for the ongoing operational costs of private sector recycling projects.In accordance with the ‘polluter pays' principle – of which producer responsibility is a fundamental element – it is right that producers should take responsibility and contribute towards the waste management costs of products which they place on the market. In support of this approach two successful producer responsibility initiatives already operate in Ireland in the areas of packaging waste and farm plastics waste, Repak in the case of packaging waste and the Irish Farm Films Producers Group in the case of farm plastics. In the case of the Repak scheme, membership fees contributed by producers are used to provide a subsidy for the collection for recycling of packaging waste from both the household and commercial sectors. In the past two years Repak paid almost €20 million in direct subsidy to waste operators for the collection of packaging waste, providing significant economic support and stimulus to the sector. Further producer responsibility initiatives are proposed for other waste streams, including end-of-life vehicles, tyres and waste electronic and electrical equipment. These initiatives, together with the increasing cost of landfilling waste, will further stimulate and improve the economics of recycling in Ireland in the years ahead.

Further progress on the scheme is a matter for the Roscommon County Council.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1330	The use of dipped headlights, daytime running lights, is not currently subject to regulation.Recently the EU Commission decided to undertake a comprehensive study into the use of daytime running lights. The general aim of the project is to assess the positive road safety effect of daytime running lights use and to investigate the possible and perceived negative effects, including such effect on vulnerable road users such as pedestrians and motorcyclists. It is intended that the results of this study should inform the future requirements of the EU in this regard.A pilot campaign by Dublin City Council to encourage the use of daytime running lights on a voluntary basis in the greater Dublin area has recently been completed. The effects of the campaign are currently being evaluated for the city council.Pending the outcome of the comprehensive EU study the Minister for Transport does not propose to take any decision in regard to the use of daytime running lights in Ireland. Consequently, I do not propose to issue any instruction to local authorities in the matter at this time.

They will enable approved voluntary housing bodies, as well as local authorities, to provide such housing more efficiently and effectively.I am confident that these changes, together with increased activity in the other schemes operated by local authorities, will ensure a continued good supply of affordable housing.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1332	Subject to compliance with the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations, 1998, as amended, sewage sludge may be used in agriculture.Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. Overall volumes of such sludge will inevitably grow as a result of the major investment in waste water treatment facilities now under way as part of the national development plan. It is desirable, and in accordance with EU requirements, that sewage sludge should be reused wherever appropriate.In this regard all relevant local authorities are required to prepare a sludge management plan in the context of waste management planning generally. These plans are intended to address the management of waste water sludge in a progressive and environmentally sustainable way.

In operating the scheme, housing authorities should have regard to local circumstances in determining maximum finance and price limits or any other conditions they believe appropriate. These issues are best determined by the housing authorities.The income limit for eligibility for the shared ownership scheme was revised to €32,000 for a single income household, with a pro rata increase for a dual income household with effect from 1 January 2002. At present there are no plans to revise this income limit. My Department will keep the terms of the scheme under review.

On the basis of advice received from the Attorney General it was not considered possible to apply this amendment with retrospective effect. Further amendments have been made in the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 to ensure that all members of a joint account would have equal rights to any free shares arising from any future demutualisation.

My Department has accepted the recommendation and expressions of interest have been sought by the relevant local authorities for the provision of such facilities at some 12 locations around the country. Subject to a satisfactory outcome to the pilot testing, the report envisages a potential role for group sewerage schemes in the collection of domestic wastewater from households outside the immediate catchment of the new treatment systems. The confirmation of such a role for group sewerage schemes and any review of the associated grants must await the results of the pilot programme.

The amended terms of the capital assistance scheme provide that up to 25% of accommodation in a project undertaken by a voluntary housing body with funding under the scheme may be made available for allocation to elderly returning emigrants who satisfy the eligibility criteria. It is a matter for an approved housing body to decide whether it will provide accommodation for returning emigrants in a project which is being undertaken by it under the scheme. Where an approved body decides to make such accommodation available for a returning emigrant, it is a matter for that body to select a suitable candidate from the Safe Home waiting list in consultation with Safe Home. The relevant local authority has clear rights of consultation in relation to the granting of tenancies in projects funded under the capital assistance scheme. Local authorities are  advised by my Department to facilitate approved voluntary housing bodies which propose to accommodate emigrants in projects being undertaken by them within the amended terms of the scheme. I have no proposals to amend the terms of the scheme in this regard.

The objective of the NDP project is to stabilise, consolidate and conserve the structures on the site. Provision for interpretation has also been included. The cost to date of the first phase of works, which established the methodology to be adopted in subsequent phases, is €356,650, including professional fees. This involved comprehensive topographical and photographic and architectural surveys of the site, removal of vegetation, and provision of access routes without damage to existing ground surface. Consolidation and repair of masonry faces uncovered in the archaeological excavation and other extant masonry was carried out by skilled craftspeople using suitable lime mortars and stone. This is an internationally accepted approach to conservation works of this nature.The second phase of the works comprises further conservation and repairs to stone walls, provision of graded access routes and site fencing. The conservation works to the walls will be quite extensive, aimed at consolidating existing structures to safeguard the castle into the future. This will be carried out in accordance with internationally accepted best practice and a feature of such works is that the resultant conservation should be unobtrusive so that the essential historical character of the castle remains. The estimated cost of this phase is €1.24 million, including consultant's fee.

The LDTFs are made up of representatives from the statutory, community and voluntary sectors and each area has developed a local action plan. The selection of projects, and the funding allocated, is based on the task force's prioritisation of the identified needs within its area and the ability of the proposed projects to meet those needs. Most of the LDTFs are currently implementing their second round plans and, to date, over €14 million has been allocated to implement these plans. As funding for the LDTFs is approved by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not open to me to re-allocate funding within these plans. Furthermore, it should be noted that these are the only moneys available under this initiative to fund such projects.As regards the SWAN project, this group has been allocated funding of €19,046 under the second round plan of the Tallaght LDTF. To date, projects under both of the task force plans for Tallaght, including mainstreamed projects, have been allocated over €4 million. In addition, just over €1.4 million has been allocated to drugs projects in the area under the premises initiative and approximately €2.8 million has been allocated to Tallaght under the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF. Funding for the YPFSF is held by the Department of Education and Science.Finally, the Deputy should note that my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, has responsibility for funding decisions made by the South-Western Area Health Board.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1357	The National Assessment Committee, NAC, of the young peoples facilities and services fund, YPFSF, which is chaired by my Department, is currently examining the services projects funded under round one of the fund. The intention would be where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed by enabling their on-going provision by statutory agencies. Qualification for continued funding will be dependant on the successful evaluation of each project – including the Carlow project. A steering group, consisting of members of the NAC and representatives from the four principal vocational education committees involved in the local drug task force areas, i.e. City of Dublin Youth Services Board, County Dublin VEC, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown VEC and the City of Cork VEC, has been established to oversee the overall evaluation process and it will make recommendations to the NAC on the projects to be mainstreamed. The steering group will be contacting each development group in the areas involved, including Carlow, in the next week or so setting out the procedures to be followed. The NAC hopes to be in a position to make recommendations to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on projects to be mainstreamed by April 2003. Each services project, has been provided with interim funding pending the outcome of the evaluation-mainstreaming process.

From the investigations carried out it appears that the estimated cost of the harbour development could be as high as €10.2 million, depending on the particular development option chosen. My Department has informed Donegal County Council that funding estimated at some €630,000 for planning work on the project could not be considered until the funding for the overall project has been secured by the council. Expenditure of the order envisaged in regard to the majority of the options identified by the feasibility study would not come within the normal parameters of my Department's scheme for strategic Gaeltacht harbours. The Deputy should also be aware that my Department has recently provided assistance for works to three strategic Gaeltacht harbours in Donegal – Baile Fuar Uisce, €1,079,500, Teileann, €802,930, and Bun Beag, €1,244,500.

The reduced allocation may, however, mean that we are not in a position to progress the expansion of the community development support programme at the same pace as we have done in previous years. The question therefore of providing funding to new groups, including those in the Limerick area will be considered in the context of existing commitments and the available resources. The Deputy should note that my Department currently supports seven projects under the community development support programmes in Limerick City and County.With regard to the Limerick Women's Network, approval was given, in principle, for inclusion in the programme pending the submission of an acceptable workplan. It is my understanding that the group is currently working with the Regional Support Agency in drawing up that workplan. Until the aforementioned workplan has been submitted to my Department, no decision can be taken in relation to the group's inclusion in the programme.

The scheme allowed students to take up part-time work useful to their community and to receive payment for this work. When the scheme was introduced unemployment levels in Ireland were among the highest in the EU and students found it difficult during the holiday period to obtain work. Since 1997 the take up has been dropping gradually, coinciding undoubtedly with the upsurge in the economy and wider availability of alternative and well paid summer jobs. Given the financial pressures on my Department and in order to focus resources available in the best possible way, it has been decided to discontinue the students summer job scheme.

A sum of €4.4 million was provided for the scheme in 2002. The purpose of the scheme is to provide funding for initiatives to improve the security and social support of vulnerable older people. Under the terms of the scheme, grant aid is available towards the once-off costs of purchase and-or installation of small-scale physical security equipment such as strengthening of doors and windows, window locks, door chains and locks and security lighting and socially-monitored alarm systems such as the pendant alarm system which is operated via the telephone and is worn around the neck or wrist.Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially-monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. As these fees are levied by private service providers, this Department has no role in setting, abolishing, waiving or reducing such fees. Any changes to the terms of the scheme for 2003, will have to be considered in light of the resources available to the scheme.

The scheme attracted 152 applications which required detailed examination and assessment which was carried out with the assistance of the White Paper's implementation and advisory group. The group, which consists of both statutory and voluntary representatives, is tasked with advising on the implementation of the recommendations in the White Paper. A number of issues arose in the course of processing the applications received under this scheme which it was considered could give rise to legal challenge. To ensure that eventual funding decisions would command full public confidence it was considered necessary to re-advertise the scheme and to seek fresh applications. My Department is making the necessary arrangements for the re-advertisement of the scheme in the coming weeks.Provision has been made in the Estimates for my Department in 2003 for more than €100 million for community affairs including €29.538 million for community and voluntary services. In relation to the scheme for federations and networks in the community and voluntary sector, funding will be available for this scheme in 2003 but at a reduced level. The reduction in 2003 reflects the tight estimate provision across Departments in response to the overall Government financial position. The Government remains fully committed to the principles and features outlined in the White Paper including the support of federations, networks, and umbrella bodies in the sector.

It is also available to carers and people with disabilities who are in receipt of certain welfare type payments. Time restrictions on the free travel scheme have been a feature of the scheme since its inception. They do not, however, apply in the case of people with learning disabilities, people attending long-term rehabilitation courses or certain work experience programmes and certain other disabled or blind people. These people  are issued with an unrestricted free travel pass which enables them to travel during the normally restricted travel times.The central issue in regard to time restrictions is that of capacity constraints and in recognition of the pressure of the transport system from commuters travelling to and from work and school in the morning and evening. There are no peak time travel restrictions on DART, suburban rail services, and on services provided by private transport operators in other parts of the country. Any general lifting of the time restrictions could cause capacity problems for transport operators. In exceptional or extenuating circumstances, however, where hospital appointments cannot be arranged out of peak travel time, my Department can issue a temporary unrestricted free travel pass. Requests for such passes can only be considered on a case by case basis and passes are only granted in very exceptional circumstances. The operation of the free travel scheme is kept under review with a view to identifying the scope for further improvements where circumstances allow.

In this regard I introduced regulations which provided for an increase in the minimum contribution from €7.62 to €12.00 per week which represents 9.6% of the current minimum social welfare weekly payment rate.Any increase in the level of the minimum rent contribution has an impact on the net income of people affected. The recent increase, however, restores the relationship which existed previously and I am satisfied that relationship is reasonable and should be maintained.

A further meeting at official level is due to be held within the next ten days. I am confident it will be possible to achieve a resolution of the dispute in the near future. The impact of the dispute cannot be fully assessed until a resolution is achieved and treatments which may have been deferred pending a settlement are carried out. Expenditure on dental benefit in 2002 amounted to €35.1 million compared to €35 million in 2001.

The cost of this campaign was €112,919 including VAT.The information campaign consisted of advertorials in the daily and Sunday newspapers. This method of advertising has, based on experience, proved effective in getting across to customers the different arrangements for the payment of increases.
Question No. 971 taken with Question No. 968.

At end December 2002 there were 635,998 free travel passes in existence for the relevant client groups.In 2002 approximately €46.2 million was spent on the scheme. The CIE group of companies received approximately €40.4 million, the private transport operators some €2.8 million and the cross-Border free travel scheme, covering certain public and private operator services, accounted for approximately €3 million. The amount paid to CIE is paid to the group of companies as a whole and is apportioned internally by CIE between the constituent companies.On average, about 1,000 replacement passes are issued per month to customers where their existing pass was lost, damaged or stolen. About 700 replacement passes have been issued in 2003 to date. My Department is conscious of the need to control and prevent abuse of the scheme. In this regard, my Department is involved in discussions with the Department of Transport and the Rail Procurement Agency, RPA, regarding the development of a more secure travel card.Transport operators are kept aware of the different types of pass on issue to the various categories of customer and advised to contact the Department in suspected cases of misuse. Customers living in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford are required to add CIE photo-identity to their free travel pass. A further control is applied in the case of an individual who reports a number of free travel passes lost, stolen or confiscated. It is departmental policy in these cases to issue the customer with a temporary pass only, which may not be further replaced until the date on the temporary pass has expired.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1379	The carer's allowance is a social assistance payment which provides income support to people who are providing certain elderly or incapacitated persons with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit.From August 1999 the full-time care and attention requirements were relaxed to introduce an element of flexibility for carers while still safeguarding the needs and interests of care recipients. Under these arrangements, which were introduced in recognition of the economic and therapeutic value of work, carers may work for up to ten hours per week.However, the carer's allowance scheme is designed for full-time carers and, accordingly, in allowing for flexibility to work, a balance needs to be struck between the needs of the care recipient and needs of the carer to maintain contact with the labour market. The present arrangement achieves this and there are no plans to change the hours condition in present circumstances.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1380	Pre-1953 contributions may be used to satisfy the qualifying conditions for the old age (contributory) and widow-widower's (contributory) pensions and orphan's (contributory) allowance. In  order to qualify for these pensions a person must, amongst other things, have a minimum number of paid social insurance contributions and achieve a minimum yearly average of contributions paid or credited on their social insurance record.There is no average contribution test for the orphan's allowance. In the case of the widow-widower's (contributory) pension, pre-1953 contributions may be used to satisfy both conditions. In the case of the old age (contributory) pension, these contributions may not be used to satisfy the average contribution test. Section 83 (2) of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 1983 sets out the manner in which the average contribution record is to be calculated for the purposes of the old age (contributory) pension.However, in line with the Government's commitment to ensuring the widest possible coverage for old age (contributory) pension, a special flat-rate pension payable at 50% of the maximum personal rate, was introduced from May 2000 for people with pre-1953 social insurance contributions who, due to the yearly average rule, failed to qualify for a pension. To qualify, a person must have paid at least 260 contributions which may comprise all pre-1953 contributions or a combination of pre and post-1953 insurance. In excess of 23,000 people have benefited from this special measure.Other social welfare contributory benefits are generally aimed at those who, for one reason or another, are absent from work. Claimants must demonstrate a recent attachment to the workforce and so qualifying conditions usually require that contributions be made in a recent tax year. In the circumstances, pre-1953 contributions would not be relevant in the context of qualification for such benefits. Any further development in relation to recognition for pre-1953 contributions would have to be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1381	The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at age 65 and the pension age for social welfare purposes, which at the time was 70. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced to 66 years of age. In the  circumstances, the retirement condition now only applies to one year.The Government is anxious to encourage older people to remain active in the labour force for as long as is possible and is committed to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. Progress in this regard will be made as soon as possible, having regard to the availability of resources and to other priorities within the Government programme.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1382	The person concerned had been in receipt of old age contributory pension since 20 December 1985 which included a qualified adult allowance in respect of his wife. The wife died on 25 July 1999 but my Department was not made aware of this at the time. Consequently, the qualified adult allowance continued in payment until March 2001 when notification of the date of death was first received.As a result of this, an overpayment of qualified adult allowance arose in respect of the period 10 September 1999, i.e. six weeks after the date of death, to 8 March 2001 and amounting to €7,747.60. The overpayment is recoverable under Section 279 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 1993. In accordance with the code of practice on the recovery of overpayments it was decided to accept weekly deductions of €6.00 from the weekly rate of old age contributory pension. These deductions commenced on the 18 October 2002. Allowing for this deduction his current weekly rate of pension is €147.70 increasing to €157.70 from 3 January 2003.

As soon as the necessary enquiries have been completed by a local officer of my Department, his old age pension entitlement will be reviewed and he will be notified of the outcome. Pending this, the person concerned continues to receive pension of €70.70 per week inclusive of living alone and fuel allowances.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Under these arrangements, and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patient either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates.There is no trace of an application for dental benefit in respect of the person concerned. In the circumstances, he may have been treated by a dentist who is not currently participating in the dental benefit scheme in which case he would not be entitled to benefit under the scheme.If he requires more information or is in need of further dental treatment, he should contact my Department on LOCALL number 1890-400-400 prior to commencing treatment.

At present 8,496 farmers are benefiting under the scheme. The average weekly payment is €139.74.In 2002, a total of 2,804 farm assist customers had their means reviewed. As a result of these reviews, 723 customers received an increase in their weekly payment and 1,104 had their rates reduced.A total of 134 appeals in relation to farm assist were received by the social welfare appeals office in the period January to December 2002. Of this number, 36 had a favourable outcome at appeal and a further 24 had their means revised favourably by a deciding officer following the lodging of the appeal. In 59 cases, the appeals officer upheld the deciding officer's decision in relation to the means assessment. Ten customers withdrew their appeal and a decision is awaited in the remaining five cases.Of the 8,496 farm assist customers currently receiving payment, a total of 535 were receiving the maximum rate of payment relative to their family size, i.e. there were no means assessed against them. This compares with 551 at the end of December 2001.

The three departmental officers assigned to the press office include one higher executive officer, one executive officer and one staff officer. During 2002, the salary costs, including employer's PRSI, of the three departmental officers totalled €122,205.89.I have appointed on a contract basis for my term of office a press adviser, Mr. Tom Reddy, since 31 July 2002.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1394	A broader objective of the 2003 social welfare package is to protect the position of the less well off in our society. Budget 2003 made provision for an increase of €6, or 5.1%, in the weekly personal rate of disability benefit, with an additional increase of €4, also 5.1%, in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowance, where payable. The Social Welfare Act 2002 brought these increases into effect from the first week in January.Overall, an additional €833 million in social welfare spending is provided for during this year, and this will bring the projected level of annual spending to over €10 billion for the first time. At a time of great economic uncertainty, this emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients and I look forward to making further progress in the years ahead on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1395	The range of employment support services administered by my Department was reviewed last year in the light of the major economic and labour market changes that have occurred since the scheme was introduced. When the back to work allowance was introduced the overall unemployment level was 15.7% and long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. By 2001 overall unemployment had fallen to 3.7% and long-term unemployment was down to 1.2%.The review also took cognisance of an independent evaluation of the scheme carried out by consultants which was published in December 2000. The report recommended, in the light of the current tight labour market situation, that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the non-financial supports be enhanced and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1396	It is not possible to provide a breakdown of the farm assist scheme claimload by Dáil constituency. A breakdown of such claims by local office is provided in Tables 1 and 2.Table 1 shows the total number of claims in payment and the number of claims in payment where the application was made in 2001 and 2002.During 2002, a total of 311 farmers had their farm assist application disallowed either because of failure to disclose means or because their means exceeded the prescribed limit. The corresponding figure for 2001 was 448. Further details of disallowances on a local basis will be made available to the Deputy as soon as possible.Table 2 shows the number of farm assist cases where no means have been assessed against the farmer and the farmer is therefore in receipt of the maximum payment appropriate to his-her circumstances.All costs that are associated with farming e.g. feed, fertiliser, contractor charges, interest on loans, fees, fencing, repairs, rent of conacre, labour hire, maintenance etc. are taken into account in accessing eligibility for the scheme. In addition, 30% of the assessing income is disregarded. There are child disregards of €253.95 per year for each of the first two children and €380.92 per year for each subsequent child. Capital is favourably assessed with the first €12,697.38 held by the farmer being disregarded.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1397	Based on a combination of his British and Irish insurance records, the person concerned qualifies for a pro-rata old age contributory pension from 5 May 2000. The rate of pension payable from 3 January 2003 is €10.50 per week. Notification of the decision issued to the person concerned. Arrears of pension due will also issue to him shortly.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1399	The records of my Department show that the person concerned has a total of 520 full rate contributions recorded for the period 1974 to 2001, 28 years. The balance of his record com prises modified rate insurance which is not reckonable for old age contributory pension purposes. This is equal to a yearly average of 19 contributions, which entitles him to a reduced rate personal pension payable at the rate of €110.50 per week. He is also in receipt of a qualified adult allowance in respect of his spouse of €73.60 per week.Under current legislation only contributions made up to the end of the last complete tax year before a person reaches pension age may be counted when eligibility for a pension is being considered. The person concerned was 66 in October 2002 and consequently only contributions made up to December 2001 are reckonable.In 2000 the Department published a review of the qualifying conditions for the old age contributory and retirement pension, phase 1. This report proposed, amongst other things, that consideration be given to changing the basis of assessment for old age contributory and retirement pensions from the current system of average contributions to one based on total contributions paid or credited. The phase 2 report, which is examining these issues further, is at an advanced stage of preparation and it is hoped to publish it as a discussion document in the coming months. Further changes in qualifying conditions for pensions will be considered in the light of the response to that report.

Following a full examination of his case the claim was disallowed on the grounds that the person concerned was not genuinely seeking work. Notification of the decision and his right to appeal issued on 24 October 2002.The person concerned appealed the deciding officer's decision to the independent social welfare appeals office. The appeals officer upheld the original decision and the person concerned was notified of the result on 10 January 2003. Supplementary welfare allowance was paid to the person concerned from 17 September 2002 to 29 January 2003.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1401	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1004 and 1005 together.Asylum seekers who arrived after 10 April 2000 are allocated a place in the direct provision system operated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform where they are provided with full board accommodation, including laundry and other services.In addition, they receive a weekly personal allowance of €19.10 per adult and €9.60 per child under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards on behalf of the Department. Exceptional needs payments are also made by the health boards where appropriate.In some circumstances an asylum seeker may vacate the direct provision system. Those who are allowed to do so and who live within the community may receive the full standard rate of supplementary welfare allowance, including rent supplement. The current maximum rate of basic supplementary allowance payable is €124.80 for a single adult, €207.60 for a couple. This also applies to asylum seekers who arrived before 10 April 2000 who are not covered by the direct provision system.A person who has been granted asylum is entitled to the same treatment under the social welfare system as an Irish citizen. Such a person also has the right to seek employment. Persons who applied for asylum before 26 July 1999 and who had completed 12 months in the asylum process were also allowed to seek employment.A small number of asylum seekers and a small number of those who have been granted asylum are in receipt of other social welfare payments such as unemployment payments, one parent family payments, pensions, disability allowance and child benefit. Details of the numbers involved in these categories are not available.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-29 00:00:00	Prelude	1402	I understand that the Deputy is referring specifically to entitlement to unemployment benefit. A principal requirement for entitlement to unemployment benefit for any claimant is that he or she must be able to demonstrate availability for full-time employment. In consideration of this condition, any factor which would place restriction on the acceptance of an offer of suitable  employment would lead to the claim being disallowed.Where a visa is not renewed following expiration, the person cannot be considered to be available for full-time employment, on the basis that he would not be in a position to take up a suitable offer of work. A person in this situation would not, in the normal course, qualify for unemployment benefit.
