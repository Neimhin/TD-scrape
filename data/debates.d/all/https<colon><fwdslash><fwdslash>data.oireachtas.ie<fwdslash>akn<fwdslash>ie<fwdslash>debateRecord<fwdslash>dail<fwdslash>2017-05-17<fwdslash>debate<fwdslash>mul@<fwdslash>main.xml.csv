#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	Melanoma is a cancer predominately of the young with potentially many lost years of life and with devastating effects on many families. Ireland is the 14th most susceptible country to melanoma in the world. We are very far behind in terms of treatments for advanced or progressive melanoma and a proper national screening programme, which we do not have. If we had one, it would avoid many of the expensive immunotherapy treatments available. The problem is that, notwithstanding the very considerable advances that have been made in treatments which can extend life for people with melanoma, particularly advanced melanoma, we are far behind as a country. The drug, nivolumab, or nivo for short, is one treatment. In the European Union, only Ireland and Portugal have not approved this drug for reimbursement.It is an extraordinary situation. All EU countries, with the exception of Ireland, France, Italy and Portugal have decided to fund the combination therapy of ipilimumab, known as ipi, and nivolumab, known as nivo. This combination therapy has proven to be truly radical and transformative in medical research. Immunotherapy is the new revolution in cancer treatment but we have not approved these particular drugs, notwithstanding the fact they are licensed by the Food and Drug Administration, FDA, the European Medicines Agency, EMA, and by our own licensing authority, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA. Historically, survival rates were very low prior to the arrival of these particular treatments but since these treatments have come on stream, the impact has been quite transformative, particularly for patients with advanced melanoma. In Ireland, there may be up to 150 patients per year with advanced melanoma, 50% of whom could be suitable for the ipi-nivo combination. The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, in the UK is normally one of the slower agencies in this area but it has been one of the quickest out of the traps in approving this particular drug combination because of the data that has emerged. The most recent and dramatic data has come from the American Association for Cancer Research at its annual meeting in Washington showing positive responses among 60% to 70% of patients. This is very exciting but we are way behind. We have not approved nivo or the combination of ipi and nivo. Professor Carole Longson, the director of health technology at NICE, has said that after one of the fastest drug appraisals carried out by NICE, these promising new immunotherapy treatments for advanced melanoma look set to significantly extend the life of people with the condition. Dr. James Larkin, a melanoma specialist at the Royal Marsden hospital, was one of the leaders in a groundbreaking clinical trial of the combination therapy and 60% of his patients responded well to it. I do not know why we are so slow in this area. I have been pointing out for more than two years that our system is not working. Since the enactment of the 2013 Act, it most certainly is not working and many patients are being left behind in respect of groundbreaking treatments that can prolong their lives and lead to significant remission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I agree with Deputy Martin that the system we have had here for many years is not up to speed in the context of major new drugs that are approved by the FDA and similar authorities. Furthermore, being a small country, we do not have the financial reach to be able to provide for all new drugs that come on stream very quickly. The case made by the Deputy about melanoma is one of many such cases. I received a letter from a major pharmaceutical company recently about a number of drugs that are produced by the company that are not used in Ireland but which are exported around the world. The recent situation in respect of Orkambi is instructive here. Orkambi is exceptionally expensive, for very good reasons. In that context, we had international collaboration looking at the whole question of the priorities attached to drugs, how they should be funded and the relevant costs that should apply. Rather than proceeding alone, as one country, this is the way to go in the future. In collaboration with a number of other countries, significant reductions were brought about in the cost of that particular drug, together with an analysis of the improvement in the quality of life that the drug would actually provide for cystic fibrosis sufferers.  The process in respect of melanoma is under way in the HSE and the relevant agencies. The point Deputy Martin makes is that we are not in a position to provide ultra-modern drugs that come on the scene which clearly bring about serious improvements in the lives of patients suffering from various ailments. I was struck by the fact that no sooner was the decision made, money provided and an agreement reached for Orkambi, another 35 to 40 new drugs were being named as coming on stream for different ailments, many of which were also very expensive. We need to look nationally at the scale of what we provide for drug purchase in respect of a range of ailments, and internationally at whether we can collaborate with other countries on the purchase of modern drugs for specialised ailments, including various forms of cancer. Perhaps that is the way to go. I am quite sure there is a measure of agreement across the House on these matters. As the Deputy is aware, we do not have an endless pit of money. I think we can improve the way we deal with the provision of drugs, thereby leaving aside the priority attached to the drugs for which we can actually provide money.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	There was a time when we were far more ahead of the curve in approving new technologies and treatments. We have fallen well behind in recent years. These approvals often get caught up in the system. This does not happen because of cost grounds initially. There is a suspicion that this might be the underlying reason, but it is never stated. There is significant evidence here. Why are Ireland and Portugal the only EU countries that do not approve nivo on its own? The combination of ipi and nivo is captivating cancer researchers around the world, particularly those involved in skin cancer research. The US Food and Drug Administration approved this combination in 2015 under an accelerated approval programme because the results showed rapid and deep regressions of patient tumours. These dramatic results captivated doctors and patients alike. People in Ireland need this treatment at the moment. Medical oncologists have told me that people in Ireland who have the resources to do so are paying €4,000 or €5,000 for this treatment. People who do not have such resources are considering whether they should sell their houses or take other steps to get access to the ipi-nivo combination. This is a real issue. Approximately 50% of the 150 people in this country who are diagnosed with advanced melanoma each year would be eligible for this treatment. This should be doable. In my view, something is not right somewhere in our system. We are way behind the curve when compared with other countries that are well advanced in approving radical breakthrough treatments for forms of cancer that were not treatable in the past.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	The advances made over the years in medicine generally and in particular ailments have been astounding. The pipeline of new drugs coming on stream has simply exploded because of the research, the innovation and the work that is going into precise and specific elements for which drugs are now produced. The Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 sets out the legal and statutory process in this regard. The HSE makes the decisions here. We are awaiting a decision in the case of the melanoma drugs mentioned by the Deputy. As he has pointed out, responsibility for such decisions has been transferred from those involved in the political process to those involved in the quality-of-life process who have the clinical excellence and so on. There has been an explosion in the number of new drugs coming through the pipeline. Now that the Orkambi case has been settled, we are awaiting the provision of finance to provide between 30 and 40 new drugs to patients with particular ailments. The Minister for Health travelled to Malta earlier this month to sign the Valletta declaration, under which Ireland and seven other countries have agreed to work together on procuring, deciding on priorities and bringing about cost reductions so that more patients will be able to access new and specific drugs. I am sure that any Minister for Health would like to be able to say that as new drugs for particular chronic ailments, including melanomas, come on stream and are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, he or she will be in a position to provide for those drugs. Even though cost reductions have been secured in the case of Orkambi for a very good cause - cystic fibrosis patients - I understand it is the most expensive drug in this country's history. The Minister and the Department are aware of this issue. I think that by bringing about international collaboration between the countries that have signed up to the Valletta declaration on joint procurement, we will bring about an improvement in this situation.

There was a history of domestic violence and alcohol abuse in the family home. He had been listed by Tusla as a high priority case and, sadly, took his own life at the age of 15 years. Despite the fact that he had been identified as a high priority case, he had not been allocated a social worker because of staff shortages. Dylan was in the care of the State after leaving the care of his mother who was struggling with a drug problem. He died just before his 17th birthday, with a high level of toxicity in his system. A recent review of the case by the national review panel found that issues with his welfare had been known about for long periods, that a succession of social workers had been involved but never for long enough to develop a relationship and that a child protection plan had been made but never implemented. Avril's family background was described as being categorised by domestic violence, criminality and changes of accommodation. She had been out of contact with the social work department for nearly two years when she died, not fully 17 years old, with her case closed. These cases, among others, were examined by the national review panel which found systemic failures by Tusla and the social services. In each instance it emphasised that no specific action or inaction by social workers had been responsible for the deaths but it found time and again failures that could be attributed to a high turnover of social workers and pressures of work which had led to firefighting. These cases underline a system that is broken and that stretches resources too thinly, including social workers who are doing their best but who are utterly overworked, exhausted and overwhelmed. Efforts to resolve the issue are falling far short. Tusla is losing 150 social workers a year. Despite efforts to recruit, the net increase in the number of the child and family social workers in 2016 was a mere 56. There are three times as many child and family social workers in the North per head of population as in the South. Best practice internationally suggests social workers should have a caseload of approximately 15, but I have come across social workers who are dealing with 26 and more and that is not to mention the unallocated cases, of which there are 5,720. Of these, there are 1,057 high priority cases. There are 1,000 Joes, 1,000 Avrils and 1,000 Dylans who are at risk as we debate the issue here. Does the Taoiseach accept that the social care system has been stretched to breaking point, that it has long been neglected and that is is a national scandal which requires urgent intervention by the Government?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	7	Because of the importance of family and care services for children, the Government set up a ministry with responsibility for children, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, held a referendum on children's rights and established the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, which is funded very substantially by the taxpayer every year. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has pointed out that there is quite a number of vulnerable children in different locations around the country who are not being left unattended and that the recruitment of the social workers required to provide individual attention is still under way. The Deputy mentioned the issue of domestic violence. Clearly, it impacts on families such as the ones he mentioned. I do not have the details of the cases he outlined but obviously they were very serious for the two people to whom he referred. Perhaps he might talk directly to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs who would advise him of the situation so far as Tusla is concerned. Obviously, it is a new agency. There are more and more pieces of information coming to light on challenges for various families and children throughout the country and social workers are under pressure to deal with all the cases with which they have to deal. Arising from the incidence of domestic violence cases, quite a number of initiatives have been taken to enable such incidents to be dealt with and, where possible, prevented but where they do happen the children involved should be catered for properly. On the two individual cases mentioned by the Deputy, of which I do not have the details, I suggest he talk directly to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.

They are not two or three cases that I have come across. They were examined by the national review panel, which was set up by the Government to provide information for Tusla, the HSE and the Health Information and Quality Authority on the failures that were happening in cases involving children.The Department and the Minister are aware of this. I have raised the matter of unallocated cases on numerous occasions with the Minister. The point made that Tusla is a new organisation does not wash any more as the agency has been there for over five years now. The current predicted net increase of approximately 62 social workers falls short of the target set for the end of last year. Recruitment efforts to try to bring in anything near the adequate numbers of social workers are falling way short. The matter is not being given adequate emphasis or priority by this Government. We have a scandalous history in this State when it comes to protecting children in the care of the State. Now we have the resources, we should deal with this. Will the Taoiseach commit to increasing the number of social workers that will be taken on and, at a minimum, doubling the number for what is currently projected for recruitment? Will he ensure no stone is left unturned with the current resources so children at very serious risk, including those who end up in very tragic circumstances, will not be left to face those challenges alone?

The Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs met representatives of HIQA this morning to discuss inspections of foster care and foster care cases. There was €37 million allocated for Tusla for 2017 and 400 new staff are being recruited.

It is not perfect by any means and there are serious improvements to be made. I will have the Minister follow up the three particular cases mentioned by the Deputy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	12	Yesterday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform formally invited public sector unions to commence talks on a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement. Having gone through two rounds of public sector pay talks, I reiterate my view that this is very late in the day. Of course, I wish the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, well in his negotiations. A fair deal that recognises the sacrifices made by public servants over recent years would be very welcome. In the course of the forthcoming talks, the public services committee of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, will head the trade union side. I welcome the fact the Garda and the Defence Forces associations have also been invited to attend. Today I focus on the broader issue of trade union recognition for both of these groups. The Taoiseach previously committed to introducing legislative change to give the Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. Unfortunately, although the commitment was given last November, we still have not even seen the heads of the Bill that would bring this about. To date, the Taoiseach has explicitly ruled out making any similar commitment on the Defence Forces, although he could make that as Minister for Defence. Since the formation of this Government a year ago, the Taoiseach is one of the Ministers who has failed to enact any legislation relating to his brief. He may not have time to see through a Bill now, given the changing political circumstances, but even signalling his support for such a change would be really important. There are approximately 13,000 members of An Garda Síochána and 10,000 active personnel in our Defence Forces. These people carry out some of the most dangerous public sector roles in this country but they have no entitlement to access even the basic industrial relations machinery of the State. We all know issues must be carefully dealt with and agreements must be made relating to the right to strike or take industrial action that would put public safety at risk. These matters are well versed and rehearsed elsewhere. Allowing gardaí and those in the Defence Forces to affiliate to ICTU would be a welcome step, as would giving them full access to the Workplace Relations Commission. Making them full partners rather than merely attendees at public sector pay talks would be even more important. At a time when morale within An Garda Síochána is terribly damaged, this would be a good time for the Taoiseach to act. Will he bring forward legislation recognising the trade union representatives of the Garda and Defence Forces?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	It is important to say to Deputy Howlin, who made several public pay agreements, that what is at stake here is an extension of the Lansdowne Road agreement because there were particular benefits gained on both sides in that agreement, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will engage on an extension of that with his officials and the trade unions starting next Monday. The resolution of the dispute last year in respect of the Garda included a commitment to the introduction of legislative change to give the Garda associations the right of access to the Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court. A commitment was given that the legislation would be put in place before the end of this year and that commitment stands and will be followed through.  On 20 December last the Government approved the preparation of the heads of a Bill to provide the associations with access to the WRC and to the Labour Court. In addition to the technical legislative change required to provide access, the Government decision noted that some very significant issues will fall to be considered, including the status of the Garda associations established under An Garda Síochána Acts and the related question of the constraints upon members of taking industrial action. Do we want a situation where members of the Garda Síochána go on strike? Providing access to the WRC and the Labour Court does not of itself imply the removal of either the prohibition on members of the Garda Síochána joining trade unions or the constraints on industrial action. To assist in the consideration of these and some ancillary issues a working group chaired by Mr. John Murphy, the recently retired Secretary General of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, has been established. The working group is considering some of the technical and practical issues that will arise and it is drawing on the experience and expertise of the relevant Departments and bodies of the group. The working group has identified several key issues that will require consideration. These include whether the associations should become full trade unions, the question of constraints on industrial action, the range of matters on which access is to be provided to the WRC and the Labour Court, what internal processes are to be put in place and be exhausted prior to issues being brought to the WRC - and that is part now of the structural work the commission announced yesterday and which it will also consider in terms of the workings of An Garda Síochána - how industrial relations should operate within the Garda Síochána and when access to the WRC and the Labour Court has been provided. The Garda associations have met with the working group so that their views are heard at an early stage in the process. The implementation of the Labour Court recommendations is ongoing and substantial progress is being made in addressing those. Day to day management of the Defence Forces is the responsibility under statutory instrument of the Minister of State at my Department, Deputy Kehoe. He is considering a range of issues in respect of the Defence Forces, their personnel, their families and facilities.

Will the working group have any interaction with the Members of this House, so that it can democratically have an input into deciding on the appropriate legislative base to be brought forward? I hear no commitment in respect of the Defence Forces. Is it the Taoiseach's view, as previously announced, that he would not countenance the recognition of the Defence Forces associations in the way that he has agreed to recognise the associations of An Garda Síochána? Is it his view that the Defence Forces associations should have access to the WRC and the Labour Court?

The Government will have to consider it, as is the case with any other report. In respect of the Defence Forces, as the Deputy knows they are the backup to the civil power. As I said, there are substantial issues that must be addressed in respect of the legislation being prepared arising from a decision to give the Garda access to the WRC and Labour Court. The Minister of State at the Department of Defence is engaging with the Defence Forces representative. Given the constraints upon us, I want us to continue to provide the Defence Forces and their personnel with the very best facilities in order that they can do their job. I am always open to discussion, but I am not giving any commitment. It is important that we recognise the value of the contribution given by our Defence Forces, which have never let the State down.

While the homemaker's scheme introduced in 1994 went a long way to increase the rights of homemakers by making it easier for them to qualify for a contributory State pension, they are still a generation of women who have been forgotten about. A group of women is in limbo and has been actively discriminated against by the introduction of the homemaker's scheme. The scheme only goes back to 1994, which precludes women who worked in the home prior to this date from benefitting from the scheme. Some women were discriminated against in the past when forced to give up their jobs in the late 1960s and early 1970s because of the marriage bar. Subsequently, other women chose to give up their jobs and remain at home to rear children or care for a sick child or relative. They are discriminated against because they are not included in the current homemaker's scheme which is only applicable from 1994. The scheme recognises women who choose to leave the workforce for a period not greater than 20 years to care for children or a sick child or relative. I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister for Social Protection to apply the same scheme retrospectively from 1970.  The women precluded from the scheme are either on reduced pensions or do not have enough contributions to qualify for a full rate, or are receiving a pension as a qualified adult which is related to their husband's pension. This is not a payment in their own right. The payment is means-tested and some women struggle with the concept of continuing to be dependent on their husbands in retirement. They feel their contribution to society is not being recognised. It is very unfair and results in a loss of dignity.  These women are being discriminated against deliberately, but in terms of their pensions it is discrimination on two grounds, namely gender and age. Can the Taoiseach tell me that the homemaker's scheme will be backdated to 1970?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	The cost of increasing pensions for those currently not eligible prior to 1994 would be about €300 million. If that money was allocated, one would probably not have any money to increase pensions as a consequence. The Minister for Social Production has examined the way in which contributory pensions are calculated. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection will be in receipt of a suite of options which will be presented for its consideration in the next couple of months. Deputy Collins read out two articles from the Constitution as it was written. There have been increased opportunities for women in the home who want to participate in the labour force due to increased employment levels and many other methods. The point the Deputy has raised is an issue. There is a cost attached to it and I suggest that he wait until all of the options presented to the Joint Committee on Social Production in the coming months for discussion by Deputies have been considered.

He referred to the huge cost increase this would represent, but that is to fail to take into account the value of the women who stayed at home during those years. I urge him to address this anomaly immediately. In 1970 and before, women chose to remain at home to raise children or care for elderly parents. We know the contribution they made to the community and I want it to be recognised. This could be done simply and without huge cost to the State by recognising the years spent out of work and granting the women concerned eligibility for a pension in retirement. This society recognises equality attempts to gender-proof legislation and avoid situations which give rise to discrimination. This is one area that must be addressed. I ask the Government to examine the matter and address it without delay.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	23	It is all about choices because one does not have the resources to do everything that might be desirable. While this is a desirable option, it would cost €300 million to go back to 1970. If that is done, there will be no capacity to increase pensions, lone-parent allowances or other measures. There is no endless pit of money, which is why all of the actuarial assessments and different options are being prepared for consideration and will be brought before the committee in a couple of months. It is a choice. If we do what the Deputy suggests, while desirable, it will implicitly suggest we will not have any money to increase pensions or a range of other allowances that would be catered to in the normal course. As such, it is important to lay out the facts before priorities are assessed and decisions made.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	25	A just and fair society is a clear objective of the programme for Government. In that regard, it is important for Ministers to tell the truth and refrain from engaging in fake news about specific issues. I refer, in particular, to the social welfare budget. Recently, a campaign on welfare cheats was launched by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, setting out the big figure of €500 million which could be gained from tackling fraud. Deputy Willie O'Dea tabled a parliamentary question, to which we received a comprehensive reply yesterday setting out, lo and behold, that only €41 million in payments was attributable to fraud. Social welfare inspectors conduct face-to-face interviews and desktop reviews through which they discern the level of fraud. In this instance, the nation has been the victim of an extraordinary degree of fake news. The subtext of the Department and the Minister sponsoring an expensive media advertising campaign to tell untruths and brand welfare recipients in general - that is the most serious issue - appears to be about creating the impression that there is welfare fraud involving hundreds of millions which the Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, is going to get because he wants to be leader. For those in receipt of social welfare payments, it is not good enough and does not speak to the just and fair society and the creation of a social economy as articulated in chapter 3 of the programme for Government. Does the Taoiseach agree that it was wrong and unfair to suggest there was a sum of €500 million when, in fact, according to the details of the Minister's own parliamentary reply, the figure is only €41 million?

The programme for Government states the Government will honour its commitment to recognise the state of Palestine. That vote was taken by the Dáil and Seanad two and a half years ago. Níl an Rialtas tar éis faic a dhéanamh i dtaobh an ábhar seo ó shin. Tá go leor Teachtaí tar éis é a ardú leis an Taoiseach, ach níl le rá aige ach go bhfuil sé á staidéar ag an Aire. In the meantime, the failure of governments, including our own, to stand up for the rights of Palestinians has led to the continued theft of Palestinian land and water, the building of illegal settlements and, in recent weeks, the commencement of a mass hunger strike by more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners. Like the Middle East peace process, the international consensus on a two-state solution has been paralysed for years. The Government has an opportunity to demonstrate international leadership. Will the Government now finally agree to recognise formally the state of Palestine?

The Deputy is engaged in a campaign throughout the country with flags for Palestine all over the place, and he is entitled to do so if he wishes, but the point is we have had a very clear view in this country for very many years that we would support a two-state solution in respect of Palestine and Israel. We also said we would be happy to recognise the state of Israel provided it could be shown clearly it was in the interests of achieving a two-state solution.

He tasked Kieran Mulvey with producing a report, which most of the stakeholders in the community believe charts a route forward that will be very beneficial. Last week, I visited the north inner city with my former Dáil colleague, Joe Costello, and we spoke to many community groups. There is growing scepticism about the ongoing commitment to this project and, in particular, about the prospect of the Taoiseach not being in the role he currently occupies. In February, the Taoiseach announced he would shortly appoint an independent executive chair to lead a number of the implementation structures, but three months later we have not had this appointment. The people I spoke to in the north inner city are very fearful. As one of them put it, if the Taoiseach disappears over the horizon so will the commitment to this really important project. When can we expect to hear the announcement of an independent chair and what other specific actions does the Taoiseach intend to take to implement the report?

Last March he said the scheme was being rolled out in Carlow and Waterford. When will it get as far as County Kerry? When I come up the road every day, I look to see if I could meet any fellow who is rolling anything in our direction, but so far I have not met anyone. I am wondering if Minister Simon could get Minister Leo to give him a hand with rolling out the scheme towards County Kerry. Perhaps the Taoiseach might also give it a push. Apparently, they are very busy dealing with other matters, but if it takes three months to roll out the scheme to Carlow and Waterford, it will take three more to cover the entire Twenty-six Counties. I ask the Taoiseach to give it a push because we need the scheme in County Kerry as much as people in Carlow, Waterford or any other part of the country.

I do not believe the Deputy when he says it will take three years to roll out the scheme to County Kerry. Any time I go there I see more than enough action on the roads and other activities.

I have raised the matter directly with him several times. I have also raised it with the Minister for Education and Skills, but the legislation has still not been progressed. It has not been recommited to Committee Stage. The Minister for Education and Skills knows that institutes of technology across the country want legislative certainty to allow them to proceed. Will either the Taoiseach or the Minister for Education and Skills who is present explain to the Dáil when exactly the matter will be resolved? We are coming under pressure from the presidents of institutes of technology across the State who want to know what is happening, when it will happen and when they can proceed.

It states the Government should be guided by two principles, namely, equality of opportunity and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities and their families. It also states: "With the peace of mind that service supports will remain available, we can empower people with disabilities to live independent lives, provide greater independence in accessing the services they choose, and place them in a stronger position to tailor supports to meet their needs". Last weekend in Sligo, service users and families of people with disabilities who required respite services had to travel from Sligo to Carrickmacross, a 320 km round trip. The Taoiseach, as a family man, will know families have enough stress and worries without having that concern. They had to travel the distance in question despite the fact that a state-of-the-art respite centre was built six years ago to offer a service in the region. I now understand it is being used for decongregation. The Minister needs to consider this very seriously.

I am not aware of the details of what he raised in respect of the new facility that was provided a number of years ago or what Deputy Michael Moynihan said about no emergency funding being available now, but I can confirm for the Deputies that the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, has certainly raised this matter generally at Cabinet meetings on a number of occasions, particularly in respect of the stress on respite facilities. He is working on it. Perhaps I will have him contact both Deputies about the particular issues they raised.

I suggest that the local authority prepare a plan or strategy for the barbican gate, if that is not done already, and that it consult both Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland. These gates are important, and they are important to tourists who have an interest in buildings and gates like the barbican gate. It is not for me to give a commitment here saying finance will be granted from a particular departmental Vote. I suggest the Deputy start with the local authority, talk to the tourism interests and also the businesses in Drogheda-----

We all know that a chronic lack of supply is pushing up rents and forcing families into homelessness.This week, however, almost 8,000 properties are advertised on Airbnb in Dublin but only 1,200 properties are available to rent on daft.ie in the city. Airbnb is a good idea, which we support, but many of us are concerned that some landlords are abusing the service. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government is currently asking the industry to self-regulate and, as we all know from our recent history, self-regulation is not the answer when it comes to property or rents. When will the Government finally legislate to close down the Airbnb loophole?

Could the Minister for Health carry out a root and branch check and an audit of the service being provided by the HSE between service providers and the end user? Currently, there is a major disconnect and people who have been approved for home care packages are not getting them. I have a number of such cases. For example, a severely disabled woman in a wheelchair has not been showered for 19 days. The service provider has changed and there has been no follow up or continuity of service. This is a major problem across the board and it is unfair on the people who have been approved for these packages and who need them to be delivered. My understanding is there is no follow up to see if the service that has been approved is being delivered, and if the end user is happy with the service and is getting the service that is paid for by the State. Will the Taoiseach or the Minister come back to me on this?

This is a matter of management and monitoring. When approval is given for a home care package, it should be followed through. Clearly, it should not be approved in the first place if it cannot be delivered. There is little point in having people under the assumption that they will get a service through a home care package if there are no resources there to meet it. The number of home care packages has improved significantly. I will have the Minister respond through management of the HSE as to what the situation is in the area the Deputy is talking about.

Land costs is a cross-government issue. I am glad the State is taking an interest in Dublin 6 and providing schools in that area, which is important for the children of the area, but I am deeply concerned by media reports of the cost of the land in Harold's Cross as €23 million. This is almost the same as the entire budget for purchasing land for the year. It represents almost a doubling of the Department's land costs.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23439	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	87	The position in respect of any purchase, and it is true of the purchase in Harold's Cross, is that it is based on an independent valuation in order that the State is getting value for money. Since the recovery in land values, we have to pay more for land for schools and, as I indicated to the Deputy yesterday at the joint committee meeting, that has increased in each of the past few years but, at the same time, we have increased the number of schools that we are building. The capital budgets have increased to put us in a position to deliver an increased number of school places year on year. The Deputy is correct that any land acquisition is expensive, particularly in city centre locations, but we still have to provide resources to educate children in those areas and, therefore, we have to pay the going price.

Reference is made to security of the public, ensuring a strong and visible police force in every community, investing in CCTV cameras in key locations, building on the success of rural and community schemes and tackling criminal gangs. There have been ten reported break-ins in my constituency of Roscommon-Galway over the past number of days and I can tell the Taoiseach about a half dozen more that people have not reported because they count them as minor. Rural Ireland is getting a raw deal on security and people are upset. Old people are worried, and I do not want to scare them, while many small businesses are being targeted as well.I want to know when the Taoiseach is going to implement what he said in the programme for Government. When are we going to have real security in rural Ireland? People are scared and we need to do something about this.

The Government has provided substantial moneys for new vehicles, motorbikes, CCTV and opportunities to improve the security for rural Ireland, by which I mean small-town Ireland as well as "rural rural Ireland". Clearly, the advantages of the text alert and communities being vigilant about these things are important. The Government seriously funded Operation Thor, which took out of operation many of the gangs that were specialist operators at breaking into houses, travelling quite a distance to do so. I am quite sure that gardaí in the Roscommon area are aware of reported break-ins or burglaries and are on to the perpetrators of these crimes. I hope the perpetrators are brought before the courts in a short time. It is a case of gardaí working with communities and availing of the facilities that are there. I find throughout vast parts of the country that the text alert through community leadership is very strong. There are occasions where suspicious movements or activities are reported and dealt with very early. It is a case of working through communities, with communities and the gardaí to best effect for protection and safety of our people.

Many will never get to see the light of day. In view of that, could the Taoiseach explain why a Private Members' Bill in the name of myself and Deputy Mary Butler has been allocated two hours tomorrow afternoon when there is a similar Bill in the name of another party, namely Sinn Féin, already at Committee Stage? I am proposing to withdraw my Bill. It is a gross waste of the House's time to discuss the same legislation twice. As I said, the other Bill has gone to Committee Stage. Perhaps the Chief Whip or somebody could explain to me how this occurred. While I have the Taoiseach's attention, there is a section in the supply and confidence agreement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael which states that all Opposition Members' Bills that have been passed at Second Stage should be sent to Committee Stage within ten weeks. Would the Taoiseach agree with me that that commitment is not being honoured?

One of the changes brought about in this particular Dáil was the right of backbench or Opposition Deputies to produce Private Members' Bills. The Ceann Comhairle wrote to me last week to have a meeting next week about this matter with the chairs of the committees, because there are 140 Bills backed up currently. On the number that have been taken by Government, whereas the intent of the Private Members' Bill might be very good, it does not make it into a Bill that is fit for purpose. The central idea might be correct, but Government and Departments have had to do extensive work in working with and amending those Private Members' Bills to make them suitable to go through the pre-legislative scrutiny and eventually to be passed here. I do not know why a second Bill is down for discussion. I assume the right was there to withdraw this, if I am correct. The Ceann Comhairle might deal with that.

There is also a commitment to excellence in animal health and disease prevention. In the context of that, there is an issue in Sligo with the regional veterinary office. I raised this issue in the House before. I was informed that there was going to be a review. My understanding is that this review has recommended the closure of the Sligo veterinary office. I want to get a commitment from the Government that that is not going to happen, because it would have a huge detrimental impact on the whole rural community of Sligo, Leitrim and the north west. If that facility closed, it would mean there would be no veterinary office anywhere north of the line between Dublin and Galway. That would be totally inappropriate. Will the Government give a commitment that it is going to keep the veterinary office open in Sligo?

Notwithstanding the political grandstanding on the issue, there have been no decisions taken on the withdrawal of a service of any form in respect of that report.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	107	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 to remove certain exemptions applying to the vacant site levy, to raise the rate applying the longer a site remains vacant, and to require the zoning and area of the site to be published on the vacant site register.I believe it is fair to say that we are living in the middle of a housing emergency. Some 7,500 people currently live in emergency accommodation. One in every three homeless persons is a child. Rents are at record levels. Home ownership is beyond the reach of many on average incomes. At the very heart of these problems is the availability and cost of land. The high cost of land in Ireland drives costs of rents, business leases, house prices and infrastructure investment. High land prices encourage speculation and land hoarding. In turn, these practices lead to excessive land vacancy, inefficient land use, dereliction and problematic sites that often invite anti-social behaviour. Yet, the political and administrative institutions of our country remain largely passive on this key issue. The Urban Regeneration and Housing Act 2015 introduced a vacant site levy but left us with several loopholes and allowed for very slow implementation. This Bill seeks to amend the 2015 Act. Its central aim is to make more land available so that more housing can be developed and so the cost of land and housing can be moderated. It has four main purposes. It seeks to apply the vacant site levy to all lands that can potentially accommodate housing within existing development standards. The current Act sets a limit of 0.05 ha or 500 sq. m, meaning the levy cannot be applied to vacant sites smaller than this. Therefore, there is no activation of these sites. They are not considered a priority. This excludes many sites that could readily accommodate residential units. Some 174 sites were excluded from the Dublin City Council vacant site register on this basis alone. The new provision would allow the levy to be applied to sites of an area that, in the opinion of the planning authority, could accommodate housing units and still meet development standards. The second provision is to ensure the rate of the levy will be increased the longer the site remains vacant. Currently, the 3% levy applies, regardless of how long a site has been vacant. However, this will not deal with landowners who are hoarding or speculating if the rate of land price inflation is high. There will be very little incentive for such landowners to sell or develop the site in question. We propose that the levy be increased by one percentage point for every full year a site remains on the register. In this way, the longer it remains vacant, the larger the levy that will apply. It will create a significant incentive for the owner to activate it.  The third provision is to remove the lower rates of levy applying to sites with outstanding loans. In the bands set down by the 2015 Act the higher the loan attached to a vacant site the lower the levy that applies. We believe this provision invites deliberate manipulation of the legislation, incentivises debt and excludes a significant number of sites from the scope of the Act. It unfairly prioritises the rights of the landowner over the public good. We, therefore, propose to repeal these provisions. The final provision is to require the zoning and area of each site to be published on the vacant site register. This will provide better information and for greater transparency and improve the usability of the register. The Government must take several measures to deal with the critical housing shortage. It should be much more active on over-the-shop premises, vacant housing, derelict sites and underused housing. The Bill is just one measure the Social Democrats proposes to deal with the crisis. We commend the Bill to the House and would be grateful to receive the support of Deputies on all sides.

I note that a future leader has suggested the same, that when he gets in, he will take charge of it also. There are about 666,000 patients on inpatient and outpatient waiting lists. There are record high waiting lists. Children are waiting for more than a year for access to elective surgery. The Cabinet committee on health which the Taoiseach has chaired for many years failed on the compulsory health insurance plan. The Taoiseach spoke about removing the HSE, but he was not in a position to do so. It was a broken promise. He got rid of the board and made a mess of governance. The crisis in the health service is quite shocking. When the Taoiseach looks back on it, does he accept that the Cabinet committee on health has failed abysmally to tackle the issues arising in the health service, particularly in providing access to treatments for many patients? He has been unlucky with the Ministers he appointed. The former Minister, former Deputy James Reilly, ended up in trouble because of the absence of blueprints behind ideas that had been floated. The former Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, now Minister for Social Protection, ran out of the Department as quickly as he could get into it and was determined to be a commentator, rather than a doer. Apparently, if one looks at the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan's WhatsApp group, it seems the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, wants to do the same. He is also in a hurry to get out. I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach indicated to me what can be pulled from the wreckage in developing a coherent reality-based health policy and how the Cabinet committee can become far more effective than it has been for the past few years.

It maintains oversight of the most significant areas of the health service. In the case of the winter initiative, it provided €40 million in additional funding for preparation for issues that would arise. A significant focus was placed on reducing the numbers of delayed discharges in acute hospitals through the funding and provision of additional home care packages, additional home help hours and additional transitional care beds. The number of delayed discharges was reduced from 638 in September 2016 to a low of 434 at the end of December 2016. It was maintained below 500 from mid-December through to the end of February. Obviously, there were staffing challenges. A significant issue last winter was the day-to-day maintenance of staffing levels and the ability to flex staffing levels to meet open surge capacity, in other words, at times when there was a spike in the numbers of patients coming through emergency departments. The figures released by the National Treatment Purchase Fund on Friday, 7 April confirmed that there were 84,838 patients on inpatient or day case procedure waiting lists; 18,000 waiting for a routine GI endoscopy procedure; and 466,000 waiting for a first outpatient appointment. In 2017 there are a range of initiatives designed to deal with the issue in a way that will ensure an improvement. These are the reports that come before the Cabinet committee to maintain political oversight of the key areas of responsibility.

I asked him what the story was about his hip. He is a man who had a knee operation a few years ago privately, but his private insurance has lapsed. He was placed on the public list last June for a hip operation and told recently to expect to undergo an operation about 18 months from now. He is in fierce pain and thinking of giving up his job because he really cannot hack it at the moment. He is one of 658,677 health service patients who are in a queue of one kind or another. They will soon be talking about the Taoiseach's legacy. I do not think there is much of one. We have the longest health service waiting lists in all of Europe by some distance. In the city of Cork, between Cork Univeristy Hospital and the Mercy Hospital, there are four times as many waiting for 12 months or more for an outpatient appointment than three years ago. What will the Taoiseach do to address the scandal of the two tier health service and the longest waiting lists in Europe? Where does the Cabinet committee fit into that process?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	118	The Cabinet committee does not deal with the detail of the running of day-to-day services, but it does have political oversight of what is happening. The net expenditure of the HSE to the end of February was €2.226 billion, which was under profile. The expenditure of acute hospitals was about €28 million above profile. We are providing more money than ever before for the health service, at €14.5 billion. I have outlined that the winter initiative was to deal with the increased numbers of cases coming through and the challenges in staffing and so on. I assume that in the case of Deputy Mick Barry's friend, because the condition of his hip is deteriorating, his doctor should be in contact with management in the hospital to say it has now deteriorated to a point where it needs urgent attention. As the Deputy knows, these things take a while to develop. If his friend's condition has worsened, the clinician might make a decision that it needs attention more urgently than thought.The Minister for Health has set out a whole range of issues with which he is dealing to improve the health situation and he will keep at that for the future.

The drive to abolish the HSE has left us in a completely invidious position. The health Vote rests with the Department of Health which is accountable for the money but the HSE is responsible for the spending of the money with no accountability. The Taoiseach has given various figures and made reference to them being on-profile or over-profile but in truth the tracking of expenditure has been extremely difficult in the last few years. In the last number of years, the HSE has been on target, more or less, until around November but some miraculous thing happens in the last few weeks of the year and the executive requires an additional €500 million, €600 million or €700 million to balance the books. That cannot be right and we need to look again at accountability and oversight in a real way. There is enormous concern in the south east about the issue of cardiac care in University Hospital Waterford. An interim solution was announced by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, namely, that a second mobile catheterisation laboratory would be provided. That was a solemn commitment made in January of this year but to date it has not happened. The south east is the only region in the country that does not have 24 hour cardiac catheterisation laboratory facilities. When will this happen? When will the interim solution of a mobile unit happen and when will the decision be made regarding a second permanent catheterisation laboratory should that be determined by the Government to be required?

Last night in my own constituency, there were 26 patients on trolleys in Cork University Hospital and 16 in the Mercy University Hospital. Even well out from winter, the numbers on trolleys remain very high despite the best efforts of health care staff and overworked nurses and doctors. This is evidence of a system that is completely and utterly dysfunctional. Whatever action the Government has taken has failed to make a significant dent in the problem. The trolley crisis is a symptom of a health system in crisis, as is the shocking rise in public waiting lists for treatment. There is now a record of well in excess of 660,000 patients on waiting lists for some kind of hospital care. The €50 million sticking plaster that the Government is spending on initiatives to cut waiting lists is having no appreciable effect. In the days, weeks or months left to him in office, will the Taoiseach establish an emergency department task force on a permanent basis to deal with the crisis at hand? Will he also agree to increase the number of hospital beds, nursing home beds, home help hours and invest in community services? The under-resourcing of the latter services ultimately leads to more people ending up in hospital when they could and should be cared for in the community.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	124	The Deputy makes a valid point about trolley numbers and the Minister for Health has made this a particular priority. Emergency department overcrowding and long patient waiting lists are of critical concern here. Last September the HSE's winter initiative was announced which provided €40 million of additional funding to deal with these matters. A range of practical measures to address emergency department overcrowding were implemented, including 90 newly-opened additional hospital beds and a reduction in delayed discharges nationally from 668 in September to 434 in December. Delayed discharges were maintained below 500 to the end of February. Aids and appliances were given to over 4,450 patients, 1,000 additional home care packages were provided and 615 additional transitional care bed approvals were also made. All these measures enabled patients to be discharged from hospital sooner. A key element of the winter initiative was for the HSE to work with hospitals to develop improvement actions and winter plans at each location. Learning from the most recent winter initiative will be important for the future. As part of the ongoing measures to relieve pressure in emergency departments, several major capital projects are under way or in the process of completion which will increase overall capacity in the hospital system. These include a new ward block and an adult mental health unit at University Hospital Galway, a new emergency department in Limerick and an extension at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda. The Department has also commenced a bed capacity review in line with the commitment in the programme for Government. That review will feed into the mid-term review of the capital programme which is under way at present. The Minister and the Department will continue to work intensively with the HSE to address the challenges and monitor the performance in the emergency departments. In Deputy Howlin's constituency in Wexford, for example, the design and construction of the new emergency department has eliminated a great deal of the pressure and stress in what was previously a very constrained and confined emergency department. A number of modular units will be put in place as extensions to existing emergency departments in some hospitals to relieve pressure. Members are aware that the population of this country is ageing. We must think in terms of 2020, 2030 and even 2040. By 2040 Ireland may have 1 million additional people and will need 0.5 million extra houses. We will also have to deal with our ageing population in the context of hospital locations, primary care centres, community homes and so forth. That is all part of a ten year capital programme in which everyone will have to be involved because Ireland's current health facilities will have to be radically different in ten years' time.

Sa daonáireamh is déanaí, bhí go leor ábhar imní ann freisin. Don chéad uair ó 1947, bhí laghdú ar líon na ndaoine le cumas acu sa Ghaolainn. Tar éis 70 bliain de fás - fás measartha, b'fhéidir - tá sé tagtha chun deiridh leis an Rialtas seo. Is dóigh liomsa go bhfuil faillí á dhéanamh ag an Rialtas maidir leis an Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Tá ocht mbliana de sin nach mór caite agus is beag dul chun cinn atá déanta. Fiú ó thaobh na Gaeltachta, agus is ábhar mór imní í sin, tá an méid daoine atá ag caint na Gaolainne go laethúil laghdaithe 11%. Mar sin, tá gá le i bhfad níos mó infheistíochta. Nuair a bhíos ar bhord Fhoras na Gaeilge mé féin, chonac go raibh laghdú ar an mbuiséad a bhí ag Foras na Gaeilge fiú nuair a bhí méaduithe in eagraíocht eile. Tá brú suntasach fós ar an mbuiséad atá ansin. Cad faoin méid sa chlár Rialtais go mbeadh Aire sinsearach le freagracht lárnach do ghnóthaí Gaolainne agus Gaeltachta? Níl mórán dul chun cinn ansin. Tá gach freagracht á chur ar an Aire sóisearach. Cad atá an Taoiseach chun déanamh chun cinntiú go bhfuil an buiséad ceart agus leordhóthaineach ag na heagraíochtaí atá freagrach as an nGaolainn a chur chun cinn agus chun cinntiú go bhfuil an Ghaolainn ag lár straitéis agus polasaithe an Rialtais?

Maidir leis an mbuiséad, beidh na díospóireachtaí ar siúl go luath i dtreo is go mbeidh buiséad curtha os comhair na Dála i mí Dheireadh Fómhair.Tá a fhios ag an Teachta freisin gur foilsíodh plean do scoileanna Gaeltachta le déanaí don chéad uair ó bunaíodh an Stát. Cuireadh fáilte mhór roimh an bplean sin. Tá na scoileanna Gaeltachta ag breathnú ar céard gur chóir dóibh a dhéanamh chun buntáistí an phlean a bhaint amach agus ar conas is féidir leo gabháil leis na coinníollacha faoin bplean. Sílim gur mhaith an rud é sin. I mí Eanáir na bliana 2014, foilsíodh trí fhógra faoi Acht na Gaeilge i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Ciarraí thiar, Cois Fharraige, agus Gaoth Dobhair, Rann na Feirste, Anagaire agus Loch an Iúir. I mí an Mheithimh 2014, foilsíodh sé fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Gaeltacht na nDéise, Ciarraí theas, An Cheathrú Rua, Ceantar na nOileán, Dún na nGall theas, agus Cloch Cheann Fhaola, Gort a' Choirce, An Fál Carrach agus Machaire Rabhartaigh. I mí Feabhra 2015, foilsíodh ceithre fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Árainn Mhór, lár-Chonamara, Múscraí, agus Dúiche Sheoigheach agus Tuar Mhic Éadaigh. I mí Mheán Fómhair 2015, foilsíodh cúig fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: tuaisceart Dhún na nGall, Oileán Thoraí, Oileáin Árann, Maigh Eo thuaidh, agus Ráth Chairn agus Baile Ghib. I mí Iúil na bliana 2016, foilsíodh cheithre fhógra i leith na limistéar seo a leanas: Oileán Chléire, Maigh Eo thiar, na Rosa agus Maigh Cuilinn. I mí na Samhna na bliana 2016, foilsíodh fógra i leith Gaeltacht an Láir i gContae Dhún na nGall. Tá sé i gceist go gcuirfear tús le hullmhúcháin na bpleananna teanga idir seo agus deireadh na bliana sa trí limistéir Ghaeltachta eile atá fágtha ag an bpointe seo. Tá súil agam go bhfeicfidh an Teachta go bhfuil próiseas cuimsitheach i gceist anseo. Aithníodh sa Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge go mbeadh cur chuige céimneach i gceist chun bearta éagsúla na straitéise a chur i gcrích. Foilsíodh na critéir phleanála teanga i mí Mheán Fómhair na bliana 2013 agus foilsíodh na treoirlínte pleanála teanga i mí Eanáir na bliana 2014. Is léir mar sin go raibh obair leanúnach ar siúl ag an Roinn Ealaíon, Oidhreachta, Gnóthaí Réigiúnacha, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta chun raon leathan gníomhachtaí faoin straitéis a chur i bhfeidhm. Más rud é go bhfuil an tréimhse de dhá bhliain nó mar sin a ceadaíodh i leith gach aon cheann de na limistéir úd chun plean a ullmhú caite nó ag teacht chun deiridh, ag brath ar an gcás tá pleananna teanga i leith na limistéir Cois Fharraige, Gaoth Dobhair agus mar sin-----

When the arts were debated here, we heard noble words and fine aspirations from Government speakers who trumpeted their commitment to the arts. What is actually happening? What has actually been discussed in delivering on Creative Ireland? It is difficult to see what might be delivered with the miserable €5 million dedicated to this initiative. What is actually happening with the commitment to community arts? We were told that every child would have an opportunity to express himself or herself creatively. What exactly is happening with the pilot scheme for self-employed artists in receipt of jobseeker's allowance? It has been talked about, but there is no sign of anything being rolled out. Artists face difficulties when they are expected to show that they have been looking for work, but the arts do not work like that. The Government recognised that some scheme was needed. Ministers spoke about establishing a pilot scheme to accommodate the needs of artists, but there is no sign of such a scheme. In the light of its verbal and rhetorical commitment to the arts, has the Government started to consider whether it will provide for a serious increase in the allocation for the arts in the forthcoming budget? I remind the House that this country is at the bottom of the league table for GDP expenditure on the arts. Has the Government discussed this? Are there plans to increase the allocation for the arts significantly in the forthcoming budget?

I want to follow up on Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett's questions about the arts. Last week my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton, asked the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs about the row between Aosdána and the Arts Council about the cnuas stipend paid to members of Aosdána. It appears that a time and motion study is to be conducted by the Department to determine the productivity levels of artists. That will be an interesting little exercise.

That was certainly the case when the arts invariably formed the centrepiece of last year's commemorative events, but it now appears that supports for artists do not feature in the Government's plans. Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett referred to the Creative Ireland document which was published by the Government last December. It includes a proposal that was included in the Labour Party's manifesto in last year's general election. I am glad that the Government has embraced this good idea which involves the establishment of a scheme to help self-employed artists. This is a parallel scheme to the farm assist scheme, but we have not learned much more about it since last December. When will we see this practical manifestation of support for artists? I have referred to the ludicrous notion that some assessment of productivity should be made.

D'éirigh an t-iarChoimisinéir Teanga as oifig agus tá Coimisinéir Teanga nua againn anois. Bheadh sé úsáideach dá mbeadh deis ag an gcoimisinéir reatha a chuid tuairimí i dtaobh roinnt ceisteanna áirithe a nochtadh. Conas a bhfuil an tAcht ag dul ar aghaidh? An bhfuil sé éifeachtach? Mar is eol don Taoiseach, táthar ag caint faoi Acht Teanga sa Tuaisceart. B'fhéidir go mbeimid in ann ár dtuairimí a roinnt leis na húdaráis ó Thuaidh de dheasca an taithí atá againn lenár reachtaíocht. D'fhéadfaimid cur síos a dhéanamh ar cé chomh éifeachtach is atá an tAcht, ar na deacrachtaí a bhaineann leis an Acht agus ar conas a bhfuil ag éirí linn maidir leis na dualgaisí atá laistigh den Acht sin. Is léir go bhfuil dul chun cinn mór le fheiceáil maidir le cúrsaí labhartha de, go háirithe ós rud é go bhfuil béim faoi leith ar an nGaeilge labhartha san ardteist. I mo thuairim, tá feabhas mór tagtha ar chumas na Gaeilge labhartha atá ag formhór na mic léinn i measc aos óg na tíre seo. The €5 million assigned to Creative Ireland which gives the impression that it is a branding exercise lacking in substance will have to be spread around thinly. Many short-term contracts are being given to artists, which means that they have a lack of security in their livelihoods.That chronic lack of security within the arts sector needs to be addressed because there is a continued reliance on low-cost short-term contracts and limited programmes. The Taoiseach might indicate whether any work is under way on the preparation of a multi-annual strategy for the arts. I agree with Deputy Howlin that the row between Aosdána and the Arts Council is regrettable. We cannot apply utilitarian economic maxims to the work of the artist, much and all as we might like to do so.

Sílim gur mhaith an tuairim atá ag an Teachta Martin ansin. As part of the 2017 budget the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs retains the majority of the €18 million current funding for 2017. That is now part of the base line for the arts division of the Department meaning that it will be available for future years also. This included a €5 million increase for the Arts Council; an 8% increase in its annual budget; a boost in funding for all the national cultural institutions; €2 million to allow for the opening of the newly restored wings of the National Gallery of Ireland, which is due to open in the next few weeks; the opening of Killarney House on foot of significant capital investment by the State - €5 million or €6 million was invested in it; an increase of €2 million for the Irish Film Board; €1 million for Culture Ireland; and funding of €5 million for the implementation of the Creative Ireland programme, which was mentioned. Aosdána is a unique initiative established by the Arts Council in 1981 to honour creative artists who made a significant contribution to the arts in Ireland. There are currently 250 members in Aosdána: seven new members came into its membership last week. The scheme is the responsibility of the Arts Council and not of the Department. It should be noted that under section 24(2) of the Arts Act 2003, the council is independent of the Minister in its funding decisions. Members of Aosdána can quality for a means tested payment known as the cnuas, to which Deputy Howlin referred, if they are resident in Ireland and are full-time practising artists. Following recent internal audits of Aosdána and a value for money policy review of the Arts Council, which was undertaken under the guidance of an expert steering committee chaired by Dr. John O'Hagan, the Arts Council is reviewing all aspects of the administration and procedures of Aosdána to ensure that the most appropriate governance and oversight arrangements are in place. In regard to any issues which arise from the review, these are a matter for the Arts Council and Aosdána. I do not like to see such rows-----

A Programme for a Partnership Government, published last May, set out an ambitious programme of work to protect our growing economy and ensure that the results of the recovery are felt by all citizens. The programme for Government annual report was published last week on 10 May and sets out the progress made on more than 300 commitments across all of Government over the past 12 months. It reflects the hard work across all Government Departments to deliver a wide range of issues over the lifetime of this Government. Prior to this, two interim progress reports on the programme were also published during the Government's first year in office. The annual report provides a comprehensive update on the progress of the commitments in its first year, which highlights very specific plans which have been put in place to address, in the short and longer term, key areas of housing, homelessness, education, rural and regional development, job creation, broadband, agriculture and climate change. The report also highlights the ambition and steps to improve services for families, children, people with disabilities and mental health problems and older people, including key reforms necessary in the health and justice sectors. Significant work has also been undertaken in advance of and following the UK's referendum on EU membership to ensure an effective whole of government approach to the Brexit negotiations that takes full account of the Government's negotiating priorities. The Government will continue to implement its programme, striking a balance between addressing urgent priorities and engaging in long-term planning so that lasting solutions are implemented to secure a strong economy and a fair society.

Policing and justice are in crisis. The health service is in crisis. Homelessness and housing are an ongoing crisis. Níl an réiteach ar an ghéarchéim i dtaobh an Ospidéal Náisiúnta Máithreachais go fóill. The Government's strategy for dealing with the challenges of Brexit, which is the greatest threat to the economies of this island in generations, is deeply flawed. I also have my own view on the confidence and supply agreement with the Government's loyal opposition. The reality is that this so-called new politics is not new. It is the same old, same old. Consequently, there is a deep paralysis in the body politic. Whether that is due to the Taoiseach deciding when or where he is going, and perhaps we will learn more of that later on, or the desire of Fianna Fáil to keep the minority Government weak and not to allow it any real successes, the result is that this Government is staggering from one crisis to another. I dealt earlier with the Government's failure to provide social supports for children at risk and with respect to the health service. I want to touch briefly on the issues of housing and homelessness. There are now 15 vacant properties for every homeless person in Cork. A total of 295 people accessed a shelter in Cork in one week in March. The incidence of homelessness is up 20% since the Minister took office. His 1 July deadline that no homeless families will be living in hotels or bed and breakfast accommodation is looming and we have yet to see any detail of how he intends to achieve that. Social housing delivery is being exaggerated and is moving at a snail's pace. Consequently, the Government's first year has been a failure. If the Taoiseach is honest with himself, he will accept that the first year of his Government has not been marked by success but by crisis, particularly in the areas of health and housing.

The Taoiseach might say to Simon and Leo that they are to keep the campaign short and deal with this housing crisis, which the Taoiseach has helped create. I want to ask a number of specific questions about the Taoiseach's programme for Government commitments. First, the very first line of the programme's chapter on housing refers to "affordable". There is no affordable scheme. There is no affordable rental scheme mentioned in the programme and no affordable housing scheme mentioned in Rebuilding Ireland. Even though these form centre pieces of Rebuilding Ireland, there is not a sign of these schemes. Second, the programme refers in great detail to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and its central role in delivering. Deputy Simon Coveney confirmed something yesterday, which every TD in this Dáil knows, that the figures are shocking and revealing. In Dublin, average rents for a two-bedroom house are now €2,600 a month whereas the HAP rent support is €1,250 a month for the same sized accommodation. In other words, average rents are more than twice what the Government is willing to give people in HAP support to find accommodation. Needless to say, they cannot find it and they end up homeless. What will the Taoiseach do to bridge that gap? Currently, it is simply a recipe for spiralling homelessness, which is shocking and obscene.

Bluntly, the Taoiseach knows and I am sure he would admit it privately that senior officials in Departments are not bringing matters to Ministers or the Cabinet, unless they are absolutely essential. This is not only because of a fear they will not get through the Oireachtas without amendments they do not want but because they are not even sure they will get them through the Cabinet. We can survive on that for a while but it cannot go on for too long. There are too many extraordinarily big issues to be addressed, including some of the social issues referenced by other Deputies, such as housing, health, etc. We must also consider the fundamental external threats to our well-being, such as Brexit and the economic policies of the US President. I will ask a question of one aspect of the Government's agenda and trumpeted in its progress report, which is the reform agenda. Despite what is in the agreement with Fianna Fáil, not a single piece of Opposition legislation has been enacted from 140 pieces of legislation. There is a pretence that all Deputies in the House can bring forward legislation and advance it. We had the difficulty with the money messages which I think has been resolved, certainly with regard to a number of Bills of which I am aware. Is there a commitment to genuinely progress proposals which are fit for purpose, are crafted well and might need minor amendment? I heard what the Taoiseach said to Deputy O'Dea earlier. Will such Bills be allowed to proceed to enactment?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	172	I will put some perspective on what has just been said. For over six months there has been a steady series of claims that the Government's objectively appalling legislative record is somehow the fault of this Dáil. That is what is presented by the Government side and Government and Fine Gael sources have been actively promoting the idea that legislation is being held back because of uncertainty about how it would be dealt with once it got to the Dáil.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	174	Public servants did not want to progress legislation because, lo and behold, it might be changed. One obvious response in finding out whether a proposal can make it through the Dáil is to undertake some consultation with people. That has not happened. One cannot blame the Dáil for the fact that legislation has not come forward. We asked yesterday about the Technological Universities Bill, which has not come near the Dáil. There have been external discussions with trade unions but it has not come near the Dáil. There is not much in it and there may be some disagreement - the word "shall" might become "may" in one section - but there is no reason for that to hang around for 12 months. The schools admissions Bill has been hanging around and a range of Bills could be dealt with if Ministers became more proactive. The bulk of the legislative programme is non-contentious but some of the commentariat have only been too willing to fall for the camouflage. The Dáil is not stopping Ministers from coming forward with legislation. They can do it if they wish and be more proactive. I do not know if the Taoiseach has sought from Ministers a list of legislation that could be published or which might be published if they knew what the reaction would be. What Bills are they holding back? There is another key matter. Today we have learned the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has apparently had no meetings with any of his EU colleagues about Brexit.

It all boils down to the trade agreement between the UK and the European Union with regard to its economic and social impact on Ireland. We can strip everything else back but the trade agreement is it. Shipping and transport is central to trade. People are now talking about new routes but 80% of our trade goes through the UK before ending up outside of it.

I can assure the Deputy that my Department is acutely aware of the commission's findings.  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department made a detailed submission to the commission setting out these very matters and this is specifically referred to by the commission in paragraph 6.13 of its report. In keeping with the Government's commitment to openness and transparency, the commission will be making all of its submissions and inputs publicly available on its website. Pending publication of same and in light of the anticipated forthcoming negotiations I am not in a position to disclose further specific details of the Department's submission.  In the context of the Defence Forces, I note that the commission in paragraph 6.29 accepts that there are challenges surrounding the recruitment and retention of personnel in specialist streams such as information and communication technology, ICT, pilots and avionic technicians. The commission also stated that while remuneration is important in this regard there are other significant factors at play such as working environment, career advancement, etc.  As recognised by the commission its findings are matters to be addressed as part of the collective bargaining process. It is Government's intention to invite all stakeholders to commence negotiations shortly and this invitation will include the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA, and the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO. 
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	It is telling that the commission report singled out the Defence Forces and highlighted what we already knew, that we have a difficulty attracting people, including skilled personnel, and retaining them. The report found some evidence of specific difficulties in recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces, particularly in recruiting doctors, marine engineers, engineers and in retaining specialists and experienced personnel in engineering, ICT, pilots, avionic technicians and air traffic controllers. We are all very aware of the shortages, particularly in the Air Corps as the next priority question based on a memorandum from the general officer commanding the Air Corps, shows. Did the Department supply that memorandum to the commission? It would have been very useful information for it to have. The submission from the Department of Defence and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform accepted that the Defence Forces are experiencing a significant exit of trained and experienced personnel due to the improving economy and the increased opportunities available to further develop their career and to achieve higher levels of salary and remuneration than that available within the service and to benefit from better overall terms and conditions. The Minister of State correctly points out that it is not just a question of pay but also career advancement, job satisfaction, being appreciated, valued and working in an environment that is fit for purpose and recognising the value of people. Those are the things that are lacking.

Anyone who has read the report will recognise that they are covered comprehensively. I agree with the Deputy this is not just about pay but there are several issues concerning retention in this document. As I stated in my first reply the Department, under my direction and in accordance with the required protocols, submitted observations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for its consideration and onward transmission to the commission, which has reported. It considered the submission by the Department, PDFORRA and RACO. The Chief of Staff of the Irish Defence Forces spoke to me about several of the concerns brought to his attention by the members which he brought to my attention and I have also spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	219	In the context of public sector pay we have to be able to compete on some level internationally. The pay and salary of serving members are important. When one in five families in the Defence Forces receives family income supplement, FIS, we know that we need to address this shortage. We all want Defence Forces that are fit for purpose. Will the Minister of State commit his Department to seeking a special incentive in this regard? This report gives the Minister of State and his Department significant leverage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in the upcoming discussions. On page 57 of the report there are tables showing the attrition rates within the defence sector. In quarter 4 of 2008 there were over 11,000 working in the defence sector but by the end of quarter 4 in 2016 that figure was down 13%, a huge decrease. While working conditions, career enhancement and development are vitally important and we can address those matters internally, the pay element is hugely important. In the upcoming negotiations it is up to the Minister of State and his Department to make the strongest case possible for increased salaries across the board.

I spoke at length yesterday at Cabinet on this and personally to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This is part two of the replacement of the Lansdowne Road agreement. It is up for the public pay talks. PDFORRA and RACO will be invited to those talks where they can put their case. I will continue to make the case heard for the Irish Defence Forces. There are 57,000 families supported through FIS, not just in the Irish Defence Forces but across a variety of other sectors. That is why the FIS was put in place, to support families who are not earning enough to support themselves. Over 9,000 people applied recently when the Defence Forces advertised to recruit enlisted personnel and cadets. There are many young, energetic men and women willing and able to join the Irish Defence Forces.

When I was informed of the situation in the Air Corps regarding its plan to suspend the standby roster for out-of-hours and weekend contingencies, I directed that a meeting be held immediately between Department officials and the military authorities. I requested them to look at options to safely maximise the availability of aircraft for those services which were not the subject of specific service level agreement targets, those provided on an ‘as available’ basis. This includes top cover and inter-hospital transfers.The key issue identified by the military authorities at the time was the loss of experienced pilots qualified to fly the relevant aircraft, that is fixed-wing CASA maritime patrol aircraft and the rotary wing AW139 helicopter, which resulted in an inability to staff the standby roster for out-of-hours and weekends. It was determined that standing down the ministerial air transport service was not a solution for the roster or for improving availability outside of normal hours for those as available services. In response, I have ensured that a range of actions have been put in train which are intended to increase relevant pilot and other specialist numbers. This will lead to improved availability of Air Corps aircraft in the medium-term. I also want to assure the Deputy and the House that in the event of a national emergency all Air Corps assets and personnel can be recalled and tasked as required.

Emergency medical services2. Garda air support3. Maritime patrols4. Ministerial air transport serviceIn concentrating on these missions it will not be possible to provide the out-of-hours standby coverage that the Air Corps has been providing with the AW139 and the CASA aircraft.We have gone over some of this ground before, given the tragedy off the Mayo coast which led to some of the information which was not shared prior to that coming into the public domain. There are major questions about this. When will the required specialist personnel become available to provide 24-hour cover? When will the Minister of State change the memo to give effect to the Air Corps providing inter-hospital emergency ambulance services, which involves organ transplants for children, or the search and rescue top cover? Has consideration been given to allowing other members of the Air Corps to fly such planes? Some are fully qualified, but are not allowed to fly because they are not officers or pilots.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	224	Let me address the Deputy's first matter first. Ministerial air transport missions are, by their nature, scheduled services where flights are pre-arranged. The standby roster did not service ministerial air transport missions. Standing down the ministerial air transport service was not a solution for the roster and would not improve the availability of services by the Air Corps. The Learjet that is most frequently used for ministerial transport is not suitable for top cover missions. It is also not a solution for roster problems faced by the Air Corps because a very small number of pilots are qualified to fly it. Therefore, using the Learjet on standby is not an option. Flying any form of aircraft is not like driving a car. People are specifically qualified and trained, and are required to have service hours, in order to qualify to fly fixed wing aircraft, ministerial air transport, CASA or rotary wing aircraft. Each pilot is required to have specific training for each aircraft. I will revert to the Deputy on the other issue raised, namely, that there are people who can fly all aircraft, because I am not aware of that.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	I did not say they could fly all aircraft. In fact, anybody who can fly a Learjet has already come through some of the training which would deal with CASA aircraft and is qualified to fly such aircraft. Once a person is qualified to fly a Learjet, he or she is taken off the roster for CASA aircraft. One of the problems is that fully qualified pilots manage to come off rosters. There are enough pilots within the Air Corps to fly CASA aircraft and provide cover, but they are rostered in a different way or are rostered for different duties. Separate to that, others who are members of the Air Corps work part-time as pilots on CASA aircraft and other planes, including Learjet. Due to the fact that their qualification is external to the Air Corps it is not recognised by it because they are not officers. There is a particular problem within the air force, common to many other air forces around the world, in that the officer class does not recognise those of a lower grade under its terms. The qualifications personnel may have achieved outside of the Air Corps are not recognised because they have not gone through the cadetship programme.

Anyone who is able to fly a Learjet would have gone through CASA training. I am not aware of the issue raised by the Deputy, but I will revert to him. This is about the safety of whatever mission is required by the Air Corps. The people involved must be highly qualified and trained and have the required amount of flying hours. Reference was made to inter-hospital transfers. I am aware that the Learjet has been used on occasion for inter-hospital transfers, depending on the availability of aircraft at a particular time. I will revert to the Deputy with further information. I do not want to put something on the record of the House of which I am unsure.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I want to know what action the Minister of State and the Department of Defence took when the general officer commanding the Air Corps outlined serious concerns regarding the extreme pressure – this is his language – personnel losses had played in operating units in the Air Corps.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	I wish to reassure the Deputy that the manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational need across the organisation at home and abroad. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain personnel numbers at or near agreed strength levels. As with other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in respect of the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise. The Air Corps has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel and these retirements are outstripping the recruitment and training of replacement personnel. The loss of experienced personnel is driven by a range of factors, including the availability of attractive job opportunities in the wider economy. The loss of experienced personnel, including a shortage of experienced pilots, has impacted on the availability of Air Corps services. There are currently restrictions also on air traffic control, ATC, services in Baldonnel. Every effort is being made to address the personnel requirements of the Air Corps. Actions are underway to return a full level of air traffic control services to the Air Corps. ATC training is taking place and options to ensure the longer-term sustainability of ATC services in Baldonnel are being identified by an ATC working group. These measures will facilitate a gradual extension of operational hours for air traffic control services in Baldonnel this year as newly qualified personnel develop their expertise, with an anticipated return to a full 24-7 service in early 2018.  Regarding pilot retention, the implementation of a range of proposals, including professional and personal development, working environment, operational deployments, career advancement and terms and conditions designed to enhance retention of serving Air Corps pilots are being advanced by a civil military working group. In addition, the potential to attract back personnel who may have left the service is also being examined. A range of other measures is also being pursued, including increased numbers of pilot cadets in training. A cadet recruitment campaign is under way. A number of personnel will complete ATC training between May and September and a further ATC course is being inducted. Promotions, including NCO vacancies in the Air Corps, will be filled from the recently launched NCO promotion competition. While these initiatives are under way, realistically it will take some time for a return to previous levels of capability in the Air Corps.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	The memo dated 30 June from Major General Cotter is damning to say the least. It is almost a year since the memo was presented to the Minister of State and his Department. Over the course of the year, the Minister of State and the Department have been aware of major deficiencies in air traffic control and air ambulance transport. All we have got back to date is the Department saying it is looking at recruiting and promoting new members. It is shocking that we have not seen any marked improvement in the level of service provided and do not have 24/7 cover for top cover missions and air ambulance transfer. Within the memo, four priority missions were identified. Remarkably, air ambulance transfer and top cover were not included in the four. I have no major difficulty with ministerial transport being a service provided by the Air Corps to Government unless it impacts directly on services to citizens which I and every other citizen view as vital, namely, air ambulance transfer and top cover for search and rescue missions. When the Minister of State was made aware of this, what action did he and the Department take immediately? Why are we not seeing results now and why are we not seeing an increase in the level of cover for those services? Why do we continue to have those four priorities in place? Why have air ambulance transfer and top cover not been included in the list of priorities as those missions which can and must be maintained?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	230	Once I had sight of that memo, I told the Department and Defence Forces personnel within the Air Corps to sit down and look at exactly what services were under pressure. We were told about ATCs and I have people training in air traffic control at this moment in time. We have the highest number of cadet pilots going through the cadetship programme at this moment in time. I have increased that in 2017. We are at capacity in cadet training in the Air Corps and it will be the same in 2018 to ensure we train the full complement of pilots we can provide. I am also looking at direct entry and re-entry. These are issues one cannot fix overnight. One cannot just pick a pilot off the shelf and put him or her flying such and such a plane or helicopter. One cannot pick an air traffic controller off the shelf. These people have to undergo specific training. I am the first to admit we have challenges. However, inter-hospital transfer and top cover are the subject of service-level agreements between the HSE and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on an availability basis only. That has always been the case within the Air Corps.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	I am glad the Minister of State touched on that because it was my next point. Does the Minister of State accept that inter-hospital transfer and search and rescue top cover are obligations the State has to its citizens? There should be no question but rather an absolute mandate for the Air Corps to provide these services. The use of the language "as available" is unacceptable and inadequate and it needs to be revised. The service should not be provided as available, but should be a mandatory obligation to citizens. Just as ministerial transport is now considered mandatory as one of the four priorities, air ambulance transfer and top cover should be mandatory. The Department of Defence must listen when it is warned about difficulties in staffing and not always be reactionary. The Department should be ahead of the curve in identifying potential risks. It should not wait until it becomes a crisis and we lose lives before it reacts. That is what the Department is doing. It is moving from crisis to crisis and reacting all the time. It is never preventing a tragedy. We need to get ahead of the game rather than to be always chasing our tails. I ask the Minister of State directly to ensure that air ambulance hospital transfer and search and rescue top cover are made priorities for the Department of Defence. They should not be provided on an as-available basis but on foot of a mandatory Air Corps obligation to provide those services to our citizens, which is what they deserve.

It goes back to the days when Fianna Fáil was in power. A service level agreement was put in place between the Department of Transport and the HSE. I stand to be corrected, but I am almost certain that it was a Fianna Fáil Government that put that service level agreement in place. I am not prepared to enter a permanent agreement with any organisation unless we have the capacity to provide the service involved. Deputy Chambers may have missed the point that the Air Corps provides an excellent air ambulance service from Athlone which was established by the Government immediately preceding this one in conjunction with the HSE and which is saving lives. I will continue to promote the message that the Air Corps is doing an outstanding job in that regard. Last week, we saw that the Air Corps was able to assist with the forest fires in Sligo and Galway. That is more assistance. We also assist An Garda Síochána in respect of its helicopter operations.

Members at the rank of sergeant or higher may stay on until they are 50 years of age. As a result, more than 100 personnel a year are, in essence, forced out, many of whom are only in their early 40s. As finding other employment at that age can be very difficult, it is vital that we look after them properly.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	236	As the Deputy will appreciate, military life places unique physical and psychological demands on individuals and it is necessary that Defence Forces personnel are physically and mentally prepared to meet the challenges of all military operations and to undertake their duties on deployment overseas.  To this end, it is vital that the age and health profile of personnel be such as to ensure that operational capability and effectiveness are not compromised in any way. The age and fitness profile of the Permanent Defence Force was an issue of serious concern during the 1990s and was the subject of severe criticism in a series of external reports, primarily those of the then Price Waterhouse consultants and the efficiency audit group. One of the key areas identified for urgent action by the audit group was the development of a manpower policy with an emphasis on lowering the age profile of Permanent Defence Force personnel. As a result, new terms and conditions were introduced for enlisted personnel enlisting after 1994. Post-January 1994, soldiers have different upper service limits or age limits depending on rank at discharge date and whether they are in a line or technician class. Their pensions and gratuities are payable immediately on discharge after relatively short periods of service and regardless of age. Their minimum qualifying service is 21 years for immediate pension and gratuity. A claim was received from PDFORRA for a further review in relation to this matter and adjudicated on in December 2015. The adjudicator made specific findings on the matter. Officials in my Department are currently analysing the issues arising in relation to the implementation of these findings and will recommend to me any necessary legislative changes in respect of the terms of service of enlisted personnel. In terms of remuneration and pension provisions going forward, the new Public Service Pay Commission published its report on 9 May 2017 and the Government intends to initiate negotiations on a successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement ahead of budget 2018. Future remuneration of Defence Forces personnel will be dealt with within this process.

As the Defence Forces has a well-established human resources structure, I presume the person appointed will be responsible for just 440 civilian staff in the Department. The new and additional post will attract a salary of between €128,000 and €149,000. How does that appointment look to a soldier who is struggling to make ends meet and sleeping in his car while his wife and children are many miles away? Low pay is the biggest factor affecting recruitment and retention in the Defence Forces. In the wide-ranging Defence Forces climate survey of 2015, pay emerged time and time again as the major bone of contention. Of those interviewed, 78% did not feel their pay was fair. The survey report concluded that the issue must be addressed because if it is not, the Defence Forces will continue to lose highly qualified and skilled members. There is a crisis of morale in our Defence Forces, as was evident in last night's "Prime Time" programme. Large numbers of members are leaving each year.There are big operational problems which have led to ridiculous situations, such as the fact a soldier in Renmore barracks in Galway cannot get a new pair of boots or other kit but must instead go to Cork. All this and poor levels of pay make for a poor working environment. The men and women who do such a wonderful job as soldiers, sailors or air crew at home and abroad while they are highly regarded for their professionalism must be treated better and properly rewarded for their loyalty.

Actually I would say the opposite. We have issues and challenges, I will accept that, but we do not have a crisis of morale. The reason I say this is when we advertised in February this year for enlisted personnel and for the cadetship of 2017 more than 9,000 people, young men and women from throughout Ireland, applied. This is for enlisted personnel, the bedrock of our organisation, or the cadets, which is a very important leadership organ of our organisation. The Deputy mentioned the recruitment of a new assistant secretary in the Department of Defence. This is something I looked for once I was appointed because of the ever-increasing workload of the senior people in the Department. As the Deputy will appreciate, we have 12 overseas missions and a huge number of other areas of responsibility in the Defence Forces organisation. This has to come back through the civil side in the Department of Defence. The Deputy specifically spoke about personnel having to travel. Of course there are challenges about personnel having to travel and I have spoken about this. I have spoken to the Chief of Staff about this and it is something he has been trying to-----

With regard to the pay and conditions, it is a scandal that in this day and age the men and women of our Defence Forces are so poorly paid that many of them must rely on social welfare top-ups such as family income supplement. It is now the only sector in the country which has no place at the table of the Workplace Relations Commission, and it is appalling their partners and families must take to protesting outside barracks, as they have done in recent months, to highlight the conditions some live under.

I am not sure whether the Deputy has had an opportunity to read the report of the Public Service Pay Commission of May 2017. I ask him to read it. If he looks at it he will see how the Defence Forces are recognised and the challenges we face as an organisation are particularly highlighted. As I stated PDFORRA and RACO have been invited to the pay talks, which are part two and a follow-on from the Public Service Pay Commission. They will be part of the negotiations and I hope they will be recognised. I have spoken to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform specifically on this issue as the Department made submissions, as did the representative organisations, to the Public Service Pay Commission. I take on board the views of the Deputy and I will consider them with regard to pay.

From my perspective, the north Atlantic is our largest area. Our sea area is ten times our land area. The north Atlantic is changing because of climate change and overfishing. We need to survey, monitor and manage the north Atlantic. We need huge marine conservation areas. To manage this and the scientific research we need to do in the north Atlantic the Naval Service should have a bigger role. I am interested to hear what are the plans of the Minister of State for the development of the Naval Service in this regard.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	243	I thank the Deputy for his question. The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Act 2006 establishes the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, SFPA, as the competent authority for securing efficient and effective enforcement of sea fisheries protection legislation and the sustainable exploitation of marine fish resources from the waters around Ireland. To this end, the SFPA has a service level agreement with the Department of Defence. This is intended to ensure efficient enforcement of sea-fisheries law at sea through the support provided by the Naval Service and the Air Corps. In accordance with this agreement, an annual control plan is agreed between the parties. This sets out the strategy for achieving sea-fisheries control targets each year. The Naval Service is also responsible for the operation of the fisheries monitoring centre, which is located at the naval base in Haulbowline and is operated by the Naval Service on a 24-7 basis.  The consequences of Brexit will depend on the manner in which, and under what circumstances, the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. It is therefore premature at this stage to anticipate in detail the implications of the UK referendum, including the impact on fishery protection requirements. However, the Deputy may be assured the Department, the Naval Service and the Air Corps are working closely with the SFPA on Brexit. We will also liaise closely with the European Fisheries Control Agency and with other member states, as appropriate. The 2015 White Paper on Defence sets out the investment priorities for the Defence Forces for the next decade. There has been significant investment in new Naval Service patrol vessels over recent years, with the commissioning of the LÉ Samuel Beckett in 2014, LÉ James Joyce in 2015 and the LÉ William Butler Yeats in 2016. A contract for an additional sister ship was placed in June 2016 at a cost of €54.3 million, bringing investment in the new ships programme to over €250 million since 2010. This fourth ship is scheduled for delivery in mid-2018. The White Paper on Defence also provides for further Naval Service vessels and the replacement of the Air Corps' two CASA 235s maritime patrol aircraft. These measures will ensure the Naval Service and the Air Corps are well positioned to meet any requirements that may emerge in the coming period, including in their fishery protection roles.

I do not know whether it is the Minister, Deputy Coveney, or which of the Minister of State's colleagues is responsible for managing the marine protection areas which we are looking to develop. I believe we are responsible for approximately 1 million sq. km of sea area, so let us take 200,000 sq. km, which is what we would need to do in my mind from a conservation approach in terms of protecting fisheries for the future, protecting smaller Irish inshore fleets rather than just all of the big international fleets scooping up all of our fish and, as I have said, assessing what is happening in the north Atlantic where there is extensive change. This is the type of vision or projection we should go towards. If we do, then there is a case for really expanding the role and purpose of the Naval Service in terms of policing. If we are to do this and tell the international community we are creating these large marine conservation areas then we have to be serious about not just policing it but also monitoring and assessing the scientific information. Obviously, we would have to work with the Marine Institute and the RV Celtic Explorer and other vessels. With regard to this sort of vision of us really turning to the Atlantic and taking seriously our responsibility for its management, backing it up with investment in the Naval Service to ensure we are doing this in a really big proper way, has the Minister of State thought about conservation areas of this scale and this level of investment in a big vision of us monitoring and protecting our waters, researching what is happening in the Atlantic and providing the Naval Service with one of the roles, in conjunction with the Marine Institute particularly, to ensure it is achievable and that we are seen internationally as taking a lead in maritime protection and conservation?

I absolutely totally agree with the Deputy. One of the issues I found when I came into the Department was that prior to the Irish Naval Service deploying to the Mediterranean and getting television, radio and media coverage, many people in Ireland did not even know we had a Naval Service or the important work it does in securing our marine. I am not sure of the massive acres of area covered that we have in the Irish Sea and the north Atlantic. The Deputy is dead right and I absolutely take his points. The Government made a commitment in 2012 to invest €250 million in the ships replacement programme. I have named the ships which have been recently commissioned. We need a Naval Service that is fit for purpose.It is more important that we protect our fisheries stock and that we have the infrastructure to be able to carry out that work.

However, I am looking for the Minister of State to join with his ministerial colleagues in setting a big ambition of very large-scale marine conservation. My understanding from talking to naval officers and others is that the current system is very hard to police. It is very hard to police certain fleets of other nations. The best case example might be New Zealand or other countries where they shut down large areas. The benefit of that is to fisheries. Another benefit is that the small inshore fleet might begin to have a viable future. Also, we could take some of the analysis that was done in Galway Bay, SmartBay, and do it as a major research project out in the Atlantic. The scale of ambition I am talking about is in terms of very big marine conservation areas that are rigorously policed and scientifically analysed. That is where the opportunity lies. I am not too sure if the four vessels we have procured, among them the LE William Butler Yeats, the LE Samuel Beckett, the LE James Joyce, are necessarily well commissioned for that sort of scientific work. It is a slightly different approach to boarding a Spanish trawler or whatever. We want to keep everything out in certain areas, make it a no-catch zone and have a Navy to serve that mission and to do the scientific research to back it up, which is the Navy we should be moving towards.

I take the Deputy's point. I understand where he is coming from and the sentiments he has expressed but a large part of his question on policy is for the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We work very closely with the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and I have to say that the new ships are of huge importance in terms of protecting our sea stocks.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 63 together. As I confirmed in my earlier reply, my Department has raised recruitment and retention issues, as part of its submission to the Public Service Pay Commission. This submission was made in accordance with the required protocols for submitting observations to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for onward transmission to the commission. In the interests of transparency all submissions made to the Public Sector Pay Commission will be published on the commission’s website. Pending publication of same and in the light of the anticipated forthcoming negotiations I am not in a position to disclose further specific details in relation to my Department’s submission. With regard to staffing, the manpower requirements of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, are monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the defence organisation, both at home and abroad. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Defence Forces, targeted recruitment takes place on a regular basis so as to maintain the personnel numbers at or near the agreed strength levels. In terms of overall strength, the Government remains committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the PDF at 9,500 personnel. In recent times, the Defence Forces have witnessed the loss of personnel, including specialist personnel, across all three services. Given the improvement in the domestic economy and increased demand for experienced specialist personnel, this has presented a significant challenge for the defence organisation. This was specifically noted in the pay commission's report. The Lansdowne Road agreement provided for increased salaries during 2016 and 2017 in a manner which benefited the lower paid. These benefits come in the form of increases in gross pay in 2016 for those earning up to €31,000 and in 2017 for all those earning up to €65,000. In addition, the Government has introduced legislation which has commenced the process to reduce the pay reduction applied under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, Acts. In regard to the pensions-related deduction, PRD, which is commonly referred to as the pension levy, the exemption threshold for payment of the levy will increase substantially during the course of the agreement from €15,000 to €28,750, which means that annual income subject to the levy below €28,750 will no longer be liable to the deduction. As mentioned earlier, future rates of remuneration will be determined as part of the anticipated negotiations in the coming weeks.

In answering another question earlier the Minister of State tried to equate the enthusiasm of applicants and raw recruits to being the morale of the entire Defence Forces. That is something he cannot do. Is he aware that from 2013, over 2,200 members of the Defence Forces have either retired or dropped out and that that figure could have been much higher but for the challenging economy outside the Defence Forces and the lack of job opportunities? Will he agree that unless action is taken, he will see an accelerated rate of Defence Forces members retiring early or dropping out? Unless the Minister of State starts to address the pay and conditions, and the retention problem, not only will he not achieve the 9,500 figure he mentioned but it will be much lower than it is at present. Is the Minister of State aware that almost 750 Defence Forces personnel are surviving on wages below the living wage of €24,500 and that the number of those dependent on the family income supplement, FIS, to provide for their families who have declared thus far has doubled in the past year to 124?

Someone told me previously that 70% of members of the Defence Forces are on family income supplement. I totally dispute that figure. I have acknowledged in the past, and I will continue to do so until we solve the problem, that there are retention issues and the reason for those is the improving economy. I want to state also that the Irish Defence Forces was the only public service organisation that had continuous recruitment from 2011. When no other organisation in the public sector was recruiting, the Irish Defence Forces continued to recruit. I referred earlier to the public pay commission report published last week, which set out clearly the challenges we face as an organisation. We are moving on to part 2 of that with public service pay and representative organisations will be very much included in that.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	Last week, 9 May, the Minister of State's colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, responding to a question from my colleague, Deputy Pat Buckley, stated that 124 people who stated they were members of the Defence Forces were in receipt of FIS. The figure for the previous year was 127, and it was 49 in 2013. I hope that is helpful to the Minister of State and that he will not have to ask for the figure. The question is already answered. The key concern is for the families of members of the Defence Force if they are living in poverty and if the members cannot carry out their duty to turn up at their barracks because they cannot afford to buy petrol for their cars or ensure that their families are looked after.That is the concern. If that continues in a changed economic environment, more personnel will be lost and the crisis within the Defence Forces will get bigger.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	257	The fact that, in this day and age, there are those in the service of the State with responsibility for protecting the State and who face the possibly putting their lives at risk are on an annual gross salary of less than €25,000 needs to be addressed. To be fair, the Defence Forces comprise one of the arms of the public sector that has taken a severe hammering over the past ten years. If we are honest about it, we will realise that the inability of the Defence Forces to go on strike and the fact that personnel are not unionised and must take and carry out orders may be taken advantage of. The Minister of State has spoken about the inaction of previous Ministers for Defence. It is irrelevant. He is the person in charge now and the person tasked with defending the Defence Forces and bringing a proposal on public sector pay to the table. We need to see a significant increase in pay, not a minuscule one or one that does not actually afford any extra purchasing power. In this day and age, the salary does not provide an adequate standard of living. We seriously need to address pay. We are always talking about the loss of experienced personnel, the officer corps, but the privates and NCOs are the ones on seriously low incomes and the ones who are mainly affected.

They come in and defend various interests, be it the nurses, teachers or gardaí. I absolutely admire them for defending various organisations and I will defend the Defence Forces absolutely, but everyone is looking for more money. Has the Deputy been around for the past five years and noted where we have come from since 2011? Since the Deputy's party's Government left office in 2011, we have improved the economy. The needs and requirements of members of the Defence Forces are highlighted in the Public Service Pay Commission document. I will absolutely fight my living best to make sure they get recognised for their work, capability and capacity and for the way in which they defend the security of the State. I will absolutely do so, and have no problem doing so, but I will also recognise the challenges we have. I am not prepared to go back into recession years, such as 2011, 2012 and 2013, before which we just threw the money at public servants. We have to work this out in a very prudent way and with prudent management of our economy. I hope that every Member of this House recognises that. I thank the Deputy for letting me know there are 224 members of the Defence Forces in receipt of family income supplement. I will not have to go looking for the information now.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	As the Minister of State is well aware, there has been much negative commentary on the inadequacy of the Air Corps at present. Can he outline for us what additional investment he will be able to make in both personnel and equipment for the Air Corps in 2017 and how he will try to halt the decline in the activities of the Air Corps and the increasing problems the Air Corps is facing?
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	With regard to the Air Corps, a key focus for me is on the recruitment of personnel and the initiation of procurement priorities identified in the White Paper on Defence. The Air Corps continues to provide a broad range of services on a daily basis in accordance with its primary security roles, including Army and Naval Service supports, maritime patrols and fishery protection and supports in aid to the civil power, such as operation of the Garda helicopters and fixed-wing fleet. In 2016, as with all other elements of the Defence Forces, the Air Corps responded to 100% of requests for aid to the civil power, comprising 1,350 separate missions, and carried out 297 separate maritime patrol missions in support of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority. In addition, the Air Corps continues to undertake a diverse range of non-security-related tasks, such as providing the emergency aeromedical support service, in addition to inter-hospital transfers and search and rescue supports, which are provided in accordance with relevant service level agreements. Its involvement in the response to the recent gorse fires further exemplifies its utility. In terms of funding, budget 2017 provided an additional €7 million in capital funding for the overall defence Vote and the updated capital provision for the years 2017 to 2021 now means that there is a capital provision of €406 million available over the current five-year period. The White Paper provides that the Air Corps Cessna fleet is to be replaced with three larger aircraft suitably equipped for intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition and reconnaissance tasks. In this regard, earlier this month my Department initiated a tender competition for these aircraft. The White Paper also provides for the replacement of the two Air Corps CASA 235 maritime patrol aircraft, with consideration to be given to their replacement with larger more capable aircraft that would enhance maritime surveillance and provide a greater degree of utility for transport and cargo-carrying tasks. In addition, last year my Department placed a contract for a Pilatus PC-9M aircraft to replace the aircraft that was written off following the tragic accident that occurred in 2009, and this aircraft is scheduled for delivery this year at a cost of €5 million plus VAT. I am satisfied that the range of measures and initiatives being taken will enhance the resources available to the Air Corps and help to ensure that the Defence Forces can continue to fulfil all roles assigned by the Government in the White Paper on defence.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	I thank the Minister of State for his reply. He stated the Air Corps was able to respond to all requests for assistance. I did not see any official denial that the Air Corps was not able to respond when the terrible accident occurred off the coast of Erris. The Minister of State might just clarify the position. With regard to the recruitment and retention of personnel, does the Minister of State intend to introduce an initiative such as the one that existed in regard to the service commitment incentive scheme that retained trained Air Corps personnel? I believe there was a bonus payment of €20,000. A distinguished former senior officer of the Army, former Brigadier General Ger Aherne, was quoted recently as saying, "The cost-benefit analysis of this approach, where the training cost of a pilot is in the region of €1.5 million, is a no-brainer." Does the Minister of State intend to introduce such a measure to try to retain Air Corps personnel when they are trained and working so as not to have the Air Corps as a training school for the private sector? It is very important that when we have highly skilled, trained personnel, we retain them.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	A service level agreement between my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport provides that the Coast Guard's search and rescue services can request the support of the Air Corps on an "as available" basis. The Irish Coast Guard, which operates under the aegis of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, has overall responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region. Availability of Air Corps support is dependent on a number of factors, including the availability of suitable aircraft and flying crews, ATC cover and weather conditions. We have challenges within the Air Corps associated with pilot retention and air traffic controller retention. There is huge demand in the commercial sector for both of these well-trained and skilled operators. I am not sure whether the Deputy has looked at the report of the Public Service Pay Commission published last week. It highlights the challenges and efficiencies within the Irish Defence Forces. It is now a matter for the public pay talks, which will start on Monday next, to achieve any sort of incentive scheme for pilots.

I understand that in the past in our country, in much poorer days, we had very sophisticated aircraft for ensuring airspace security. There are very busy air corridors through our sovereign airspace nowadays. In the plans the Minister of State has to purchase new aircraft and perhaps upgrade aircraft, is he proposing additional capacity to ensure we are able to meet our sovereign obligations in regard to our own airspace? The Minister of State's reply to my supplementary question contradicted his initial reply in regard to the capacity of the Air Corps to respond to requests for assistance.

It states the procurement process has commenced. Since we are dealing with the questions of funding and upgrading the fleet of the Air Corps, can the Minister of State outline the process involved?Can it be considered in the procurement process that these new planes be used to tackle gorse fires, as they could do so on a larger scale than helicopters which did a tremendous job in recent times? A plane, however, fitted out properly, would be able to tackle such fires on a greater scale.

A service level agreement is in place with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport which is responsible for the Irish Coast Guard service. We offer backup or top cover on an availability basis to that Department for the Irish Coast Guard and the HSE for inter-hospital transfers through another service level agreement. We have had challenges in the past 12 months in fulfilling these agreements and informed both the Department and the HSE about them. We have been totally upfront in our contacts with both organisations.

At local level, Civil Defence units are based in each local authority area under the operational control of the relevant local authority. On a day-to-day basis, these units operate under the control of a Civil Defence officer who is a full-time employee of the local authority. 
 Civil Defence operating costs in each county are co-funded by the Department of Defence and the local authority. The Department provides 70% of the funding by way of an annual grant, with the remaining 30% funded by the local authority. The provision of accommodation for local Civil Defence units is the responsibility of the relevant local authority. This is a long-standing position which was reaffirmed in the 2015 White Paper on Defence. Civil Defence units provide significant supports for their local authorities and other principal response agencies. I have witnessed at first hand their response to flooding events and I am aware that Westmeath Civil Defence was active in support of the local community during the flooding in late 2015 and early 2016.  Senior officials of the Department have met senior officials of Westmeath County Council to discuss the options available to the council in the provision of accommodation for Westmeath Civil Defence. The council declined an initial option of availing of Columb Barracks for use, including for use by Civil Defence. My Department has recently received correspondence from the council and I expect further engagement on the matter of accommodation for the Civil Defence unit to take place in the near future.

My party colleague on Westmeath County Council, Councillor Andrew Duncan, tabled a motion at a recent meeting to encourage the local authority to put a plan together for the location of a permanent facility for Westmeath Civil Defence. Unfortunately, the organisation has been treated badly by the State because it was put in a disgraceful location and volunteers were challenged every day by the surroundings in which they had to work. I appeal to the Minister of State to ensure his Department liaises strongly with the county council because a number of options are on the table and a solution is needed for volunteers who are the first responders in many incidents.

They are not fit for purpose, especially for volunteers who give freely of their time. Communications are continuing between my Department and the local authority in County Westmeath to come up with more permanent and suitable accommodation for Civil Defence members in Athlone. I have instructed senior management to communicate directly with the county council. The Deputy has brought this issue to my attention on numerous occasions, with the volunteers and Civil Defence members.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	270	I acknowledge that the Minister of State has a strong interest in Civil Defence. It is important that volunteers be respected and that we encourage them. He has visited many locations around the country, which I encourage. It is important to liaise strongly with volunteers, but it is also important to secure a permanent solution for Westmeath Civil Defence. The organisation needs to house expensive equipment in appropriate locations and train volunteers in state-of-the-art facilities. These volunteers give of their time free of charge and work to support their communities. They support events such as Darkness into Light and Crinniú na Cásca. I would be grateful if the Minister of State kept the pressure on and thank him for meeting a Civil Defence delegation at his office in Leinster House. We need to keep the issue to the fore.

Civil Defence should be properly resourced and housed in appropriate and modern facilities. They should be appropriate in the first instance and modernised as funding comes available. Such funding should always have been available. My question relates to other uses for Columb Barracks. Has consideration been given to using part of the site for homeless former veterans? The Irish United Nations Veterans Association raised this issue with me and probably the Minister of State.

As the Deputy noted, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government recently examined all vacant lands in the country for housing. My Department is dealing with that matter. I have asked the officials in the property management section to proceed with the sale of Columb Barracks. For safety reasons I do not like barracks to be left vacant. With regard to Westmeath Civil Defence, my Department resources Civil Defence adequately and fully funds specialised equipment. I encourage senior officials in Westmeath County Council to take this matter seriously. I agree with Deputy Peter Burke that the permanent facilities for the volunteer members of Westmeath Civil Defence are not adequate and need to be replaced. My officials will work closely with the local authority in that regard.

The White Paper on Defence identified, as key operational priorities, the replacement of major equipment platforms across the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service and the initiation of infrastructural development programmes. The Department is currently engaged in work on a new equipment development plan covering the next five years. At EU level, there is a range of initiatives in the area of capability development that are in place or are currently being discussed. These include Ireland’s participation in the European Defence Agency, EDA. Ireland has participated in the European Defence Agency since it was established in 2004. The primary reason for Ireland’s participation in the European Defence Agency is to support the development of Defence Forces capabilities for peacekeeping and international crisis management operations. Ireland also participates in a collaborative database which is managed by the EDA. This database provides a platform for engaging with other member states on a number of fronts, including collaborative or joint procurement. Plans are under way in the EU for the development of the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO. It is envisaged under this structure that member states would collaborate in the development and acquisition of essential capabilities for Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP, operations in the area of international crisis management. Any participation by Ireland in PESCO will be entirely voluntary, as provided in the Lisbon treaty protocols, and will be subject to the approval of Dáil Éireann in accordance with the provisions of the Defence (Amendment) Act 2006. The Co-ordinated Annual Review on Defence, CARD, initiative aims to create greater transparency among member states in sharing information on future defence policy, capability development, budgets and investment. It is expected that such transparency will support greater collaboration among member states on investment in capabilities.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
The initiative recognises that Defence policy, including defence spending, is entirely a national competence. Any information sharing will be conducted on a strictly voluntary basis. In regard to the European Defence Action Plan, EDAP, the action plan was adopted by the College of Commissioners in November 2016. The aim of the plan is to explore how EU policies and instruments can ensure that the EU’s industrial and skills base will be able to deliver the required defence capabilities in view of current and future security challenges. There are proposals in the plan to increase transparency in relation to defence procurement to make it more open and transparent. A key objective of the aforementioned EU initiatives is to increase collaboration in the development and acquisition of capabilities.

At the moment, our armoured personnel carriers are being refurbished at a total value of €55 million. We have also issued a tender for the replacement of the Cessna aircraft in the Air Corps. It is important in any investment we make in the Defence Forces that there is a provision - there is one in Europe - in regard to how we can get better value for money for the taxpayer in working and collaborating with our close EU neighbours in terms of investment in machinery or otherwise for the betterment of the Irish Defence Forces.

To respond to Deputy Durkan, when I go abroad and visit our troops, whether in the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, or in the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, we are the envy of other countries when it comes to our equipment, the level of equipment we have and the value for money we are getting for our investment. We put the replacement for the Cessna out for tender, so if a company wants to tender for the new aircraft, it is welcome to do so. We stick to our policy of neutrality when it comes to negotiating or collaborating with other countries.

Malaria is a serious disease which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa. As reported by the World Health Organization, it is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. Anti-malarial medications, including Lariam, remain in the formulary of medications prescribed by the medical corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions. This is to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risk posed by malaria. Significant precautions are taken by the Irish Defence Forces and medical officers in assessing the medical suitability of members of the Defence Forces to take any of the anti-malarial medications. It is the policy of the Irish Defence Forces that personnel are individually screened for fitness for service overseas and medical suitability. The objective is to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risk posed by malaria. The health and welfare of the Defence Forces are a priority for me. The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by the medical officers in the Defence Forces, having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces. I am advised that the policy of the Defence Forces on the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis, including the use of Lariam, is in line with United Nations and World Health Organization guidelines.

These are views that have been expressed by both current and retired members of the Defence Forces. Serious concerns have been raised for many years about the use of Lariam as an anti-malarial drug for members of the Defence Forces serving in Africa and in other areas where malaria is a problem. There have been serious indications that the drug can cause the risk of mental health problems. It is a huge issue. Last year, the British Ministry of Defence acknowledged that 1,000 ex-servicemen and women are suffering severe psychiatric and mental health problems as a result of being prescribed Lariam. Similarly, in 2013, an RTE investigation suggested there is a three to five times increased risk of suicide among Defence Forces personnel who have been prescribed the drug.

He is substantially out of step with best international practice in this regard by continuing to prescribe this dangerous and discontinued drug as the first line of defence in providing anti-malarial vaccinations and assistance. He is just teeing up the State for massive payouts and damages in the future. The case for removing Lariam is probably iron-clad at this stage. Other jurisdictions have moved in that direction, and the Minister of State is lagging behind. His response on 2 May seemed to indicate that because we have a stockpile of the drug, we might as well use it and let it run out. That is completely wrong for members of the Defence Forces. It is completely out of sync with the majority of Deputies in this House who have signed a motion to say that this drug should be discontinued.I ask the Minister of State to rethink a step that is not in keeping with the thinking of this House and best international practice.

I have listened to the views of the Deputies on a number of occasions. However, I have been informed by management of the Defence Forces organisation that Lariam is the most appropriate medication for the missions in which we participate in Mali and sub-Saharan Africa. It is the medication that fights malaria, a serious disease that killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015. The advice I have received is the best possible from the Defence Forces. I am not a medical doctor, as I have stated in the House on numerous occasions. I do not have the medical knowledge to disregard the advice I have been given.

Dr. Franz Humer is on record as saying science has advanced considerably since Lariam was introduced and that there are more effective anti-malarial drugs available with reduced side-effects. Surely the Defence Forces should be using such drugs. Lariam has been withdrawn from sale in Ireland. Its side-effects can be very severe and include anxiety, depression, paranoia and suicidal behaviour. Fifty serving and former members of the Defence Forces have lodged claims against the State, as Deputy Clare Daly mentioned. The Government is teeing itself up for further claims against the State. Legal proceedings have been served in 37 cases. Surely the game is up for Lariam.

I remind him of the hepatitis C scandals in the 1990s. In 1991 the Blood Transfusion Service Board was alerted to the fact that a batch of anti-D produced in 1977 might have been contaminated, but despite the alert, it continued to use it and the women were not given any information. The slip-ups were repeated and nothing was done. We are in danger of repeating that tragedy. It took a mother, Ms Brigid McCole, in taking a case against the State to rectify the matter. I remind the Minister of State that despite all of the digging of heels, the State ended up paying out €1 billion, including associated legal costs, in meeting 4,500 claims in the hepatitis C scandal. This is happening on his watch. Does he want to ruin the lives of Defence Forces' personnel and put them into a similar position to Ms McCole? Does he want to ruin his own reputation, just as the reputation of the present Minister with responsibility for NAMA, Deputy Michael Noonan, was affected by his treatment of Ms McCole? We must own up to our mistakes, discontinue the use of this failed drug and remove it now.

There are other drugs available. Most other armies operating in sub-Saharan Africa use doxycycline or Malarone, in particular. Has the Minister of State ever asked the Health Products Regulatory Authority to peer review the use of Lariam by military services around the world, given that it is a number of years since it was first introduced? In recent times the vast majority of military forces operating in such areas have switched from the use of Lariam because of the effects it has on their troops.

As I have indicated, it remains in the formulary of medications prescribed by the medical corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions to ensure they have effective protection against the very serious risks posed by malaria. The use of and the information on the medication is kept under ongoing review. Deputy Niamh Smyth spoke about Roche. My understanding is it pulled out of Ireland for commercial reasons and absolutely no other reason. It stated as much when it pulled out of Ireland in late 2015 or some time in 2016. Deputy Clare Daly has stated that I said there was a large stock of Lariam in the Defence Forces and that that was the only reason we were using it. We are using it because it has been prescribed by the medical corps of the Defence Forces. That is the best available advice I have been given by the Defence Forces.

#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	292	The Government is committed to maintaining the establishment of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising 7,520 Army, 886 Air Corps and 1,094 Naval Service members, as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence. On an ongoing basis the manpower requirements of the Defence Forces are monitored in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. As there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force, targeted recruitment has been and is taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. As in other areas of the public service, challenges have arisen in the recruitment and retention of personnel in particular areas of expertise. I am supportive of initiatives beyond the traditional recruitment processes to fill skill gaps in this context. Facilitating a return to service by former members of the Defence Forces is one such initiative. Former members offer the twin advantages of expertise and familiarity with the military. Previously, individual requests have been dealt with on a bespoke needs basis, given the relatively low number of such applications. The applications were at officer level. However, this initiative is not without challenge and requires careful consideration. Civilian and military officials are engaged in scoping appropriate terms and conditions for the re-employment of former officers of the Permanent Defence Force. In due course the approach will be discussed with the relevant representative organisations.
#PeterBurke	unknown-#PeterBurke-party	unknown-#PeterBurke-dob	unknown-#PeterBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	I understand there are some former members of the Defence Forces who are willing to return and contribute to removing the deficits in the Defence Forces. While the matter is being addressed in a more long-term manner by the approach being taken by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform with regard to the report of the Public Pay Commission, many members of the Defence Forces must retire early or take leave for a variety of reasons. A large volume of these members are fit and healthy and still desire to work on behalf of their country. They bring a huge wealth of experience and value to the Defence Forces. Members of the Defence Forces can serve up for to 21 years in the ranks of private and corporal, subject to meeting the demands of fitness, overseas service and medical and training criteria. Members in the rank of sergeant and higher can serve up to age of 50 years, the minimum pension age. PDFORRA has made repeated calls for this limit to be extended and it could be cost-effective for the State.

On facilitating a return of ex-service members and particularly officers to the Defence Forces, I have directed both the Secretary General of my Department and the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces to carry out a scoping exercise and return to me with some proposal that has been negotiated with the representative organisations to see a return of these personnel.

This is a hugely important issue in my town, the area around Drogheda and the whole county. The latest census of population shows that Drogheda is now the biggest town in the country outside the major cities. The difference in population between Waterford city and Drogheda is less than 7,000, yet we have no proper local council and no local control, although there has been a huge influx of new citizens into the town. We have a huge need for housing and local infrastructure. We need the confidence of the people to be expressed through local democracy. The reforms which took place are not working. Power has moved from the borough council to the county council. That is no reflection on any of the wonderful officials who work in the county council, but it is a huge reflection on the lack of accountability and local control. We need control over planning and road infrastructure. We also need to invest more in town estates in the provision of footpaths and green spaces. We need more sports centres. Every single penny collected in property tax in Drogheda and district should be spent locally. Change is needed and it is happening, but there must be local control. That is the key point.  In its wisdom, the county council recently decided to spend €12 million on new local government offices in Drogheda. That money could be much better spent on infrastructure to improve estates and sports facilities. The town is crying out for investment and support. We have no IDA Ireland and no Enterprise Ireland office and no institute of technology. This week we have been told we are losing the Millmount development centre. Small as it is, it has the capacity to provide 24 hot desks for people who want to create their own businesses. Giving Drogheda city status is long overdue. It looks like, however, that we will not have a driving test centre, as I proposed some time ago, as there is some local political opposition to the site on which I thought we could work. We also have no local employment office. Decisions are made by people who do not live and work in Drogheda. I accept that the Minister is not in the job long and did not introduce the last item of legislation. It was introduced by another Government which we both supported. It was, however, wrong and does not work. We want local control and want it now. I will speak for four minutes. The last time I spoke I was shut down because there was another Deputy who wanted to speak also. Narrow West Street in Drogheda is disintegrating and falling down. It is as if a bomb struck it. The town centre is dying because planning permission was given for out-of-town shopping centres, some of which are in the adjoining county. We need a rates base in Drogheda and to change the way things are done. A commission was set up to look at extending the borough boundaries, but the Minister had no influence on the decision. The recommendation was against increasing the capacity to govern locally. It was not a bad decision made by the Minister but a bad recommendation. Local government is not working and people are losing out. Everywhere I go they want to know what is being done and changing. Nothing is changing, apart from the population is getting bigger and demands are growing. I look forward to hearing the Minister's reply.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	300	Local government areas are specified in primary legislation. Section 12 of the Local Government Reform Act 2014 states the State is divided into local government areas known counties and cities and cities and counties. The Local Government Act 2001, as amended, provides for three cities - Cork, Dublin and Galway - and for each of them to have a city council. If an additional city council were to be established in law, it would have significant implications for the county in which the area concerned was situated, particularly with regard to the loss of functions of the relevant county council. This would, in fact, be the reverse of actions taken under the Local Government Reform Act 2014 which saw the integration of two existing city councils, Limerick and Waterford, with populations of 87,000 and 47,000, respectively, into two new stronger and better resourced city and county councils. In both cases, the description "city" continues to apply to their status as major urban centres. That status is in no way diminished by the fact that they no longer have separate local authorities. On the contrary, all of the indications are that both have progressed significantly in the past few years, not least in terms of economic activity. If Drogheda were to be considered for such a fundamental change in local government arrangements, as suggested in the Topical Issue, it would have wide-ranging implications not only for Louth County Council but also for Meath County Council. While a rigorous examination would be needed if a proposal to upgrade to city status was contemplated by the Government, it is possible to identify likely implications at a broad level, including, legal, financial, organisational and possibly electoral consequences, all of which would require careful and detailed analysis.  The town of Drogheda has recently been the subject of a local authority boundary review, as the Deputy mentioned. In June 2015 an independent statutory committee was appointed to carry out a review of local government boundaries in Athlone, Carlow, Drogheda and Waterford. In each case the committee was asked to carry out a review of the boundary between the respective local authorities and make recommendations with respect to those boundaries and any consequential matter it considered necessary in the interests of effective local government. The main rationale for undertaking the boundary reviews is that in each case there is a significant overspill of population into another county based on the population figures taken from the 2011 census. In the case of Drogheda, the town has expanded significantly into County Meath, with a population of nearly 6,000 reported as being located in County Meath in the 2011 census, which represents nearly 16% of the total population of the town and environs of 38,578. The report of the Drogheda boundary committee was submitted on 16 February 2017 and did not recommend, as the Deputy said, an extension of the boundary. I have been to Drogheda a number of times and I am more than aware of the pressures on the town and the pace at which the population is growing and the need for both local and national government to respond to that pace of growth through the provision of social, community and quality of life infrastructure. Part of it has to involve good local governance. We have looked and are continuing to look at restructuring local government in Cork, Galway, Waterford and south Kilkenny. During these processes we will learn lessons and find better ways to govern in areas that have more than one boundary.We also need to learn lessons in the context of the continued growth of Drogheda.

The fact is that Drogheda was turned down by the independent commission but that commission was absolutely wrong. Drogheda had a borough council from 1169 until its abolition in recent times. We need to get that council back and to have local control. Local debates would previously have taken place at borough council meetings, attended by local authority management and the public but that has all gone. There is no local debate now. Indeed, there is no local council, full stop and that is where the reforms were absolutely wrong. The Government should restore a council to the town of Drogheda and its environs, with real power and real accountability. Longford has a population of approximately 40,000. It has a county manager and all of the infrastructure necessary for a county council but it has a smaller population than the town of Drogheda. Leitrim has a population of only 30,000 and yet it has the infrastructure that Drogheda so badly needs. Huge decisions must be made here. There is enough work in Drogheda and its environs to keep a full-time manager busy, 24/7 and that is what the people want. The Minister has said that he is looking at a number of issues relating to other cities and towns. He called Kilkenny a city but it only has a population of about 25,000. There are 15,000 more people living in the town of Drogheda than in Kilkenny. While I appreciate it does not have its own city council, Kilkenny derives a certain amount of status from being called a city. We need to acknowledge the importance and worth of Drogheda, which is the biggest town in Ireland after Waterford. It needs a professional political base which it does not currently have. I urge the Minister to publish his report at the earliest opportunity and look forward to engaging with him on it.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	302	I acknowledge the pace of growth of Drogheda. There is a series of reasons for that growth, including its proximity to Dublin and to international connections through Dublin Airport and the fact that it has provided an affordable option for home buyers. It has also built a big economy in its own right and is a regional driver in its own right. However, I do not think the solution here is to recreate city councils, even in cities like Waterford and Limerick, where we have now created city and county councils. That said, there is merit in looking at how Drogheda as a town is managed and by whom. At the moment, a significant proportion of the population is in one county, managed by the local authority in Meath, while the rest of the town, the majority of which is in County Louth, is managed by a different local authority. In those circumstances, it is very difficult to plan strategically, in terms of business, community development, planning and zoning, commercial rates and so on, for the expansion of a town that may at some point in the future become a city when there are two local authorities involved. I have made a clear decision on the boundary issues of Waterford and Kilkenny. We are not changing county boundaries there because there are all sorts of emotions involved in a decision like that. There are flags, GAA clubs, history and so on involved and asking a Kilkenny person to become a Waterford person or Louth person to become a Meath person will not work politically. However, we need to be able to re-evaluate governance structures to ensure that towns and urban conurbations can actually be managed as single entities in the context of their expansion. That is the context in which we need to look at the future of Drogheda.

I raised this matter yesterday and what we have seen in the media so far is highly disturbing. I do not always believe everything or, indeed, anything that is published in the Irish Independent so I acquainted myself through other means with some of the background to the story. Apparently a highly decorated detective was taking a case against the State for bullying that he endured in An Garda Síochána. He alleges that he was forced to put illegal phone taps and traces on innocent people. There was no authority given to track their phones or to listen in to their conversations, in some cases for months on end. There have been numerous phone tapping scandals over the years in this State. The Taoiseach said in 2013 that he operated on the presumption that somebody was listening in to his phone calls. The Attorney General did not have the confidence to speak over the phone to a former Minister for Justice and Equality, former Deputy Alan Shatter, and had to speak to him in person. When the former Deputy Michael McDowell was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, he refused to confirm or deny that the phones of Deputies were being tapped. He finally admitted in 2003 that the phones of a number of Deputies in this House were tapped. Journalists' phones were tapped and Deputy Catherine Murphy uses burner phones on the presumption that her phone was being tapped when she was looking into the Siteserv issue. The whole thing is rotten. When did the Minister become aware of the full extent of the disclosures from this officer?

It is as if this is a big revelation, that nobody knew this was going on and that it is a big surprise. This is not a surprise. Our legislation, passed by Members in this House as recently as 2009 and 2011, allows for lawful surveillance of citizens. I have no doubt the Minister will say that there are perfectly legitimate reasons for that, including counteracting terrorism, serious crime and so forth. We are told that there are safeguards in place to ensure that the privacy and human rights of citizens are protected but myself and Deputy Wallace have pointed out in this House, particularly during the last Dáil but also in this one, on numerous occasions that the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1993, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 and the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 are not fit for purpose because they do not balance the rights in that regard. The Minister will say the Defences Forces, An Garda Síochána, the Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Justice and Equality can seek to have peoples' phones tapped and to have their records looked at but that there is oversight, that a judge has to look at that at the end of the day. However, as we have pointed out, the judge who compiles that report goes in on one day, asks to see one or two requests out of thousands and then says that he or she was given everything asked for. That is not proper oversight and scrutiny. A review was initiated last year when the media suddenly woke up to this issue when the phone records of some members of the media were being requested by GSOC. Those people were involved in criminality and GSOC was investigating criminal behaviour on the part of gardaí. That is when the media got interested. When are we going to review the 1993 and the 2009 Acts, which are open to wholesale abuse?

In one case, according to the allegation, a sitting Deputy had his or her phone tapped by An Garda Síochána, possibly as a result of pressure from a Minister. Certainly, the whistleblower believes it was a political move by a Minister at the time. The garda was subsequently transferred which certainly suggests that there was something seriously amiss and that the correct procedures for getting these taps were not being followed.Deputy Clare Daly has alluded to the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, which allows for bugging. The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 allows the police to break into one's house to install cameras and to come back after three months to take those cameras out. One might not know they were ever in one's house. There have been extraordinary allegations that all this is being done without proper procedure and oversight, and possibly for political reasons. The Taoiseach is supposed to get an annual report on complaints, but we have been told that no such records can be found, which is unacceptable. Will the Tánaiste get these reports? If there are any irregularities, will she hand the names over to the Director of Public Prosecutions? Can she say how times phone and mail surveillance has been authorised by her and other justice Ministers under her Government? How many of these cases of surveillance were political?

We need to find out whether it is true. If it is true, we must find out who the people involved are. I take Deputy Clare Daly's point that this should not just be about the political system. We have this example. I was interested to listen to what the Taoiseach said yesterday when this matter was raised in the Dáil. My reading of what he said was that having seen the report of the review of the period in question, he does not think there is any evidence of anything. Is that the limit of the investigation we are doing? Given that a whistleblower has raised concerns about an incident involving his removal or change of position, is it not possible for the Minister for Justice and Equality to take targeted measures to find out whether this case is real? If it transpires that it is real, we need to get the details and ascertain how they can be shared. It is important for a variety of reasons that this should be done. I share the concerns expressed by Deputies Ó Snodaigh, Clare Daly and Boyd Barrett about the widespread use of surveillance by the Irish authorities and by the authorities in the UK, the US and elsewhere. Examples of such activity can be seen around the world at present. It is important for those of us in the political system to appreciate that if there is any sense that an office on the Government side is being used to put surveillance on the other side, that is hugely damaging to trust in the political system. It is very important for us to find out who it is. Until we do that, a whiff of suspicion and rumour will surround anyone who might possibly be involved, even though he or she might be completely innocent. We need to get to the bottom of this to clear everyone's name. We need to uncover whether this is true, who exactly was involved and what the consequences will be for the individuals in question.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	308	This is the 13th time we have raised this issue in this Chamber. We have not been getting a whole lot of satisfaction. In January 2016, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, announced a review of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2011 regarding information on journalists only. We pointed out that the review should be all-encompassing and should include the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, as well as the 2011 Act, because all three Acts give State agencies the power to abuse the privacy of Irish citizens and not just journalists. The Tánaiste has said that the former Chief Justice, John L. Murray, has completed the report of this review. According to the Tánaiste, this report has been on her desk since 27 April last. When does she intend to publish the report? It seems that following the settlement of a High Court case involving a retired detective, the Garda brought the matter to the attention of the designated judge. Will the Minister tell us how soon after the High Court settlement this matter was referred to the judge? We met a garda who works in this area not so long ago. This individual, who was present when the designated judge came around in three separate years, told us that the manner in which this duty was carried out was a joke. The judge was given a cup of tea, asked to be given a look at this one and that one and said "have a good day, good luck". The system does not stand up to any scrutiny. It leaves a lot to be desired. It beggars belief that the Tánaiste is refusing to revisit it. We need to do things differently. The same assessment in England runs to 99 pages each year. Ours is just a rubber-stamping job.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	309	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to address this matter. While it has been alleged in recent reports that there have been abuses in the interception of communications, it would be quite wrong to suggest it has been established that there has been widespread abuse of the interception system. Of course any abuse would be completely unacceptable. The reports do not specify the timeframe for these allegations, but I understand, in so far as it can be established, that they relate to the early 2000s. Plainly, it would be a matter of concern if there were any abuses of the system for intercepting communications. The notorious improper interception of journalists phones in the early 1980s led to the current legislation, which contains strong safeguards to ensure the system of interceptions is operated properly. As Deputies are aware, the interception of phones is governed by the Interception of Postal Packets and Telecommunications Messages (Regulation) Act 1993, which sets out clearly and in detail the arrangements for giving effect to an interception. It is important to use the short time available to me to give the House a full understanding of the multilayered checks and balances in the system. A Minister for Justice and Equality cannot initiate a warrant and can only act on applications made to him or her. A Minister for Justice and Equality does not and would not have any access to the content of any interception that may be made. The 1993 Act provides that only the Minister for Justice and Equality may grant authorisations to intercept communications; that this may be done only on the basis of a reasoned application from the Garda Commissioner, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces or the chairperson of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission; that this may be done only for the purposes of the investigation of serious crime and in the interests of the security of the State; and that this may be done only when a number of strict tests, as set out in detail in sections 4 and 5 of the 1993 Act, are satisfied. The conditions that apply to "serious crime" are that an investigation is being carried out into a serious crime or to prevent a serious crime, and that investigations not involving interception have not produced and are unlikely to produce the necessary information or evidence and that interception is likely to do so, and that the importance of obtaining the information justifies the interception notwithstanding the interference with privacy. The conditions that apply to protecting "the security of the State" are that investigations are being carried out based on a reasonable belief that activities which are going on endanger the State's security, and that investigations not involving interception have not produced and are not likely to produce the necessary information or evidence and that interception is likely to do so, and that the importance of obtaining the information justifies the interception notwithstanding the interference with privacy. As a further check, all applications must be considered by a senior officer of the Department before being submitted to the Minister to ensure the conditions set out in the Act are satisfied. All applications from the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces must also be recommended by the Minister for Defence before submission. The designated serving judge of the High Court who independently oversees these matters must report to the Taoiseach at least once a year on the operation of the Act. Over the years, these reports, which are laid before the Oireachtas, have confirmed that the Garda and Army authorities have been in compliance with the Act. There has been some adverse reflection on the work of the designated judges. I must say this is utterly ill-founded. One should not underestimate for a moment the importance of the constitutional independence of the designated judges or, indeed, the considerable experience and abilities of the individuals who have carried out that role with distinction. The designated judge has full powers of access to all relevant people and documents. There is a corresponding obligation in law on all relevant people to co-operate. The current designated judge is Ms Justice Marie Baker. She is aware of the matters in question as they were raised with her by the Garda authorities. It is a matter for her to decide what action she will take in respect of these issues.

I put it to her that widespread abuse is lawful under our present system of surveillance. Despite the protestations about checks, restrictions and oversight, the reality is that our laws allow for wholesale covert surveillance without proper scrutiny and oversight. Sections 7 and 8 of the 2009 Act specifically allow for tracking devices to be placed on citizens' cars without going to any judicial authority for approval. It allows for a senior officer above the rank of superintendent to basically certify themselves to carry out covert surveillance on citizens. The reports the Judiciary do at the end of the day have no numbers, no reasons are given and there is no proper oversight. They are carried out in a day and a half. That is not fair. We need to have a radical overhaul of all of the legislation in this regard.

During her tenure or the tenure of Ministers for Justice and Equality in this Government, how many phone and mail surveillance operations were authorised and how many of those were political in nature as opposed criminal? Will she comment on the report from the designated judge for 2016 on all the surveillance operations under both Acts and indicate if they were for political or criminal purposes?

It is important that we do so, otherwise anything is possible in terms of who may be involved or what the real implications might be.

That is no reflection on the judge. This is the system and it leaves a lot to be desired. There is zero detail in it. How can the Minister have confidence in the designated judge system after the March 2014 audit by the Data Protection Commissioner discovered that gardaí were systemically rubber-stamping requests for telephone data after the fact, a practice that is in clear breach of the Communications (Retention of Data) Act 2010 and something which the designated judge has obviously seriously failed to detect? Dr. T. J. McIntyre from Digital Rights Ireland has pointed out that the Irish oversight system is out of line with international practice. He said that in almost all EU member states there are parliamentary committees which can oversee surveillance by security agencies. Ireland is one of only four EU member states which does not make its security agency accountable to Parliament, instead on security matters the Garda Commissioner answers only to the justice Minister who also has the decision to tap phones in the first place.

I have been advised that in May 2008, in the context of illegal action for personal injuries, certain allegations were brought to the attention of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform about abuses in the system. These certain matters and questions related to the early 2000s. These matters were brought to the attention of the then designated judge who examined them and concluded that there had been no breaches of the Act. Obviously, the Act has been overseen, as I said, and the designated judges have satisfied themselves that it is being operated in accordance with strict legal requirements. If there is evidence of anything else, that is investigated at any one particular point. I also understand that following the settlement of a legal case earlier this year, An Garda Síochána contacted the designated judge to bring matters which arose in those legal proceedings to her attention, so the designated judge is aware of these matters and it is a matter for her to decide what, if any, action on her part might be necessary regarding this matters. To answer Deputy Ryan's question, the appropriate person to look into it is the designated judge who, as I have said, has full and independent powers in this regard. If one reads the Act, it is very clear that the functions of a designated judge are prescribed by law and I cannot seek to interfere with the exercise of these powers in any way. The House can be satisfied, however, that a constitutionally independent person is in place with full legal powers to address these matters. The important issue is not the length of the reports but the substance of the process. Allegations have been made in reports that the phone of a political activist was intercepted at a time in the past. It is never the practice to comment publicly on the use of these powers in any particular case. There are restrictions in the law on the disclosure of the existence of particular interceptions. In respect of allegations made in reports, they have not been very detailed but it would appear, as I have said, they relate to matters alleged to have arisen in the early 2000s. Of course, many in this House will recall that at that time there were people who described themselves as political activists who were at the same time engaged in activities in support of unlawful organisations.

I wish to pay tribute to the staff on the ground, the Air Corps, the Army, the Garda, the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the staff of Coillte and muintir na háite iad fein. However, when I raised the matter last week, I got a five-page response from one of the Minister of State's colleagues and the only reference to Galway in it was that "we are aware that the fires are burning". The extent of the fire was extraordinary. I understand the Minister of State visited the area this week and witnessed the aftermath of the fire where the green cover has been turned to brown and black. The Cloosh Valley has the largest forest in Ireland, as the Minister of State is aware, which covers 4,000 ha. Almost a quarter of it has been destroyed as well as 2,000 ha of bogland. When the fire raged, it raged on three fronts and one of them extended across 8 km.It affected wildlife, the forest itself and bogland, and it constituted a major threat to family life. In that context, although it was not the responsibility of the Minister of State, there was an indication that the Government was either not aware of or not taking seriously what was going on in Galway on that extensive area of land and the destruction of the forest. First, there was the threat to human life, and second, there was the absolute damage to wildlife and trees. There is the cost of that and losing mature timber, as well as what it will cost to replace all this. From listening to a contribution from the citizen science project on the radio, it seems the pollution levels were on a par with those in Beijing. The only difference is that it will not last, whereas Beijing, unfortunately, has an ongoing problem. The pollution was equal to that in Beijing, where people wear masks. I thank the Minister of State for visiting the area this week but I expected somebody to go down sooner. A warning has been issued to the area, which is welcome, as nobody should be lighting fires, particularly illegal fires. However, there is a bigger problem and questions must be asked about how this got out of control. What risk assessments have been done by Coillte, as within the biggest forest in the country we have the biggest wind farm? The feeling on the ground - I am reporting what was said - was that some of the effort went to preserving that rather than controlling the fire elsewhere. In the past ten years there have been very few prosecutions in this area. If my figures are correct, there were nine prosecutions over ten years. The Minister of State will deal with the issue of the prosecutions but I am asking a more general question. When will the Minister get a report on what caused the fire and what has been learned from it? No matter what we do, we will always have people who light fires when they should not. There must be an emergency plan in place and proper risk assessment. When will that report come before us, telling us the damage, replacement plans and timescales? Most of all, it must inform us how we can prevent this happening in future. That is the most important lesson to be learned from this.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	342	I thank Deputy Connolly for raising this very serious issue. As she mentioned, I visited Cloosh Valley in County Galway on Monday and saw for myself the utter devastation caused by the wildfire that raged there until Thursday, 11 May 2017, when it was finally brought under control. As I commented during my visit, fire poses a serious risk to life, homes, and property. Forestry and wildlife habitats are also destroyed. I understand that while a wildfire risk can quickly develop following dry weather patterns in all areas where flammable vegetation such as grasses, gorse and heather are present, especially in proximity to forests and other assets, most fires may have been started deliberately. To set a fire at this time of the year is not only illegal but also totally irresponsible. As we are all aware, the burning of vegetation is controlled by the Wildlife Acts. It is an offence under section 40 of the Wildlife Act 1976 to burn from 1 March to 31 August in any year any vegetation growing on any land not then cultivated. Individuals who are found to burn vegetation within that prohibited period are liable to prosecution by An Garda Síochána or by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. My Department has no role in this regard. Forest fires have a wide range of impacts. With Cloosh Valley, I understand approximately 1,500 ha of forestry was destroyed and a similar area of bogland was destroyed on the perimeter, which is where the fire spread from. This is huge loss and the estimates come to approximately €4 million. To put this in context, the level of new planting annually for which grants have been paid over the last couple of year is in the region of 6,500 ha, so losing 1,500 ha in one foul sweep like this gives an indication of how massive was this incident. With respect to cost, there is the loss of the value of the timber crop itself and the reconstitution costs. There were also the immediate costs involved in fire suppression as incurred by Coillte and the other agencies and bodies, such as the Galway fire service and the Air Corps, which were involved in monitoring and fighting the fires. In a time of budgetary control, such outbreaks put a heavy strain on all these bodies. Coillte, for example, has estimated the costs to be in the millions of euro. Other costs, which are difficult to quantify, include the disruption to normal fire service operation and the diversion of emergency services resources away from other life-saving operations. I have focused on the impact on my immediate area of responsibility, namely forestry, but should advise that another impact is the risk to payments under the basic payment scheme, as I advised in my statement yesterday. Officials in my Department are currently analysing a wide range of satellite imagery to identify land burnt illegally during the specified closed season for burning. Historic satellite imagery is also being examined as part of this process. Agricultural and eligible forestry land identified as burnt illegally as part of this investigation will be deemed ineligible for payment under the 2017 basic payment and other area-based schemes. I want to stress in this regard that my Department will not tolerate incidents of illegal burning of land and will take all necessary actions to ensure compliance with the conditions of the various EU-funded area-based schemes, including reducing payments and penalties where applicable. Another issue is the threat to health. The Health Service Executive issued a public statement last week about the recent gorse fires, advising that people should limit the amount of time spent outdoors in areas affected by any smoke or ash. I understand that smoke inhalation can have adverse effects, especially on vulnerable groups.

This is not the first year it has happened and it has been ongoing for years. I welcome that the Department is taking satellite images, examining the damage and will take prosecutions if it can, that has simply not worked to date. A red alert was issued by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine before the fires broke out. When that was issued, what did Coillte do and what emergency plan went into place to prevent the damage? It had been anticipated. I welcome what Coillte has done on the ground but I am talking on a general level. If a red alert is issued relating to fires, what actions would be taken by Coillte and what risk assessment had been carried out, given its experience over the years? This is the biggest forest in the country and we know a small group of people burn illegally. We do not know if that was the cause of the fire. The risk of damage is too much. I have not gone into the effect on bird life and diversity as the immediate concern was human life and houses. This should not have happened. When will we get a report as to what was lacking in the risk assessment or health and safety statement, or all the other elements that would be relevant to a forest of this size with the biggest wind farm? Why was this not anticipated? These are my questions, in addition to those concerned with prosecutions. They were always going to be a side issue in comparison with the overall plan.

There were over 100 people there, including Coillte staff, the Army, Air Corps and some private helicopters who were experts in their actions. I visited a point where there was a new infrastructural road built by the wind company. As it was a crown fire, it jumped that road but those 62 km of new road infrastructure allowed emergency services to get in. I looked at the map before I visited the site. The suspicion is the fire originated at a point some distance to the south east of the plantation.The fire would have travelled pretty fast through what is bogland and a special area of conservation, SAC. The problem for contingency planning is that one would need to look at the perimeter, notwithstanding all the precautions that have to be taken on site and see how that vegetation can be controlled and managed. The National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS, can give derogations for controlled burning, which is an essential part of vegetation management so that material can be edible. There was a noticeable lack of livestock and sheep on that ground. I would not pretend to be the expert but it needs to consider how it will control that buffer zone and the vegetation so that it never gets to the point of being so tall, dry and highly calorific because that will burn. I have seen people in the Wicklow Gap, maybe hillwalkers or others, who through recklessness throw away a cigarette butt in the dry time when the wind is in the right direction. As the Deputy said, everything coincided perfectly, the change in wind direction and the drop in temperature assisted greatly in reducing the threat last Wednesday.

As the Minister of State knows, in June 2016 we used our Private Members' slot to put the focus on motor insurance and proposed changes which we felt would make a real difference to the spiralling premiums people have had to endure. The Government responded and the following month set up the working group which reported in January 2017, around the same time as the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach reported, with 33 recommendations from the Government's working group and over 70 action points. I welcome the work that is being done, but more can and needs to be done. There needs to be greater ambition in the Government's approach and there has to be swifter implementation of the key recommendations, in particular those around the establishment of a national claims database, which is not due for another year or so. The work of the personal injuries commission needs to be accelerated, and the central issue there is benchmarking the level of awards in Ireland vis-à-vis awards in other jurisdictions.  We need legislation on the motor insurance compensation framework so that if another Setanta Insurance collapse occurs there is clarity on who foots the bill in such a scenario. That is a priority. We need to have the report on the role of legal fees in the resolution of insurance claims brought forward earlier than the anticipated date of the second quarter of 2018. The issue of uninsured drivers is, unfortunately, playing an increasing role in society and is, of course, a menace which has to be condemned in all respects. The database of uninsured drivers which is technically possible, in terms of the different datasets that are available through the national fleet database, the databases of different insurance companies and so on is not due until the end of 2018. I welcome the CSO data that shows some stability in the market. It does not match the reports I have received from constituents who are still receiving renewal notices in the post advising of increases of 20%, 30%, 40% and, in some cases, even more. There is discrimination against certain categories of drivers. Drivers with older vehicles which have up-to-date and valid NCT certificates are being asked to pay exorbitant renewal premiums. God help older or younger drivers, emigrants returning to Ireland or anyone with an open claim, in terms of what quote they will be given. Taxi drivers are being driven out of business by virtue of the quotes they are getting, if they are lucky enough to get one at all. We know from the declined cases agreement with Insurance Ireland that the number of people who simply cannot get a quote has multiplied elevenfold in the past four years. Almost 2,000 cases have been brought before it. A central issue is the need for greater certainty around the level of awards. Insurance companies are settling out of court and outside of the Injuries Board process out of fear of what an award will be if they go through the court process. That fear is driven by experience. There is a need for greater certainty and consistency in regard to the level of awards. Companies are simply not taking the risk. Many dubious claims are being settled and people are being paid "go away" money, to put it mildly. That is the reality of what is happening and it is because we have a dysfunctional market which is simply not meeting the needs of consumers. On the question of business insurance, the CSO is not capturing that data so we have no firm evidence of the level of premium renewals that are being issued to businesses. The key issue is employer liability and public liability. Any business that has a significant level of public footfall, businesses in the service industry, pubs, hotels and restaurants are being hammered with significant insurance increases. The Minister of State and I were interviewed earlier today, and I quoted figures I received from the Restaurants Association of Ireland. Many restaurants which have had no claims in recent years are facing a doubling of their insurance policies. It is not good enough and it cannot go on. Many people in business are now making the decision not to renew their insurance at all and are taking the crazy risk of having no insurance cover in place in respect of public liability or employer liability for their businesses. Many of these people are not in limited liability companies, therefore they will be on the hook in the event of a claim which could potentially go all the way. There is a significant degree of commonality between the issues on the motor insurance and employer and public liability sides which affect businesses. Insurance companies on the business side are becoming increasingly selective. The terms of policies are being changed. The levels of excess in policies are increasing significantly. The levels of exclusions now being specified within policies is also being expanded. They are vital issues. The cost of insurance working group, phase two, is now dealing with business insurance. We are calling for an acceleration of the implementation of the recommendations on the motor insurance side. They are generally good. On the business side, we need the report to be published and the CSO to capture the data so that we know where we stand. We need to start tackling the underlying causes of these increases. The issue of insurance has now become a major economic issue in our country, as well as being a devastating issue for many families who will end up off the road.

A year on, people are still facing, as he outlined, exactly the same challenges in respect of paying motor insurance. Fianna Fáil produced a 12-point plan at the time in response to the 60% or 70% increases consumers and motorists had experienced since 2013 and 2014. Most of the recommendations in the 12-point plan have been fleshed out in a 186-page document produced by the working group. Like my colleague, I commend most of the recommendations but I am concerned about their acceleration and speed. As Deputy Michael McGrath said, the virus of spiralling motor insurance costs has now spread to businesses, something which is more than anecdotal. When I knocked on doors in Tallaght in my constituency, I heard multiple examples of rising insurance costs in one afternoon, in particular from taxi drivers to whom Deputy Michael McGrath referred. I spoke to two couples who were taxi drivers and whose insurance increased by €1,800 in two years, which is colossal. What comfort can we and the Minister of State offer those motorists? I heard the Minister of State speak on radio earlier, and he referred to the time it would take for things to bed in. Motorists need comfort. I spoke to a constituent whose premium increased from €500 to €2,500. Politicians of all political hues receive queries about insurance each week, which are not confined to geography, gender or age. There seems to be a particular attack on older people. Returning emigrants simply cannot get motor insurance. As Deputy Michael McGrath said, older cars that have passed the NCT cannot be insured. The Minister of State will agree that there has to be some connection between an NCT certificate and car insurance, otherwise what is the point of getting an NCT certificate? Any tax cuts people have received and appreciated in the past three years have been wiped out by one car insurance premium.

When there was a halt in motor insurance cost rises in the past week or so, the claim was made that the strategy dealing with the spiralling cost of insurance was working, but it is on the back of increases of 34% or 35% in a 12-month period. Businesses, in particular those with a major footfall in retail units, restaurants and nightclubs, are telling me that they simply cannot get insurance. Is it correct that in respect of some categories of licensed premises, a number of underwriters have left the market which has now been reduced to one or two providers? If so, it is a damning indictment of the entire insurance industry and the fact that conditions were created which allowed them to leave the market and businesses completely exposed in making decisions to go without insurance. In respect of other policies, people are having to fork out the first €10,000 of any claim. This is not sustainable. I ask the Minister to address the issue of underwriters leaving the market and to explain how the Government permitted circumstances to develop where those providers left. The cost of motor insurance and, in particular, the cost of insurance for businesses are having a crippling effect and will have a knock-on effect on employment in the sectors mentioned.

There has been a complete lack of urgency on the part of the Minister in dealing with it. I have a couple of examples to set out. The first involves a 33 year old man who is the model citizen as far as this city is concerned. He lived in an apartment for four years. As he had no need for a car, he went around on a bike. He was given a promotion and has now acquired a car, only to be charged €2,300 for insurance. He pays more per month for insurance than he does for his car.  The second example involves an emigrant returning from the Continent, which is to say the kind of person the Government is trying to attract as a result of Brexit. Notwithstanding the fact that they have a perfect driving record, the person concerned is being charged just under €3,000 for car insurance. It is crucifying us, in particular younger drivers. Older customers are not even being given quotes. If a person is over 75 years of age and trying to get an insurance quote in this market, he or she will be loaded beyond belief, if he or she will even be given a quote. As Deputy Michael Moynihan said, businesses in the service industry, in particular, are being refused cover because of a lack of competition in the market, all because of a cosy consensus which does not allow out-of-court settlements to be revealed. Settlements are being made without any record or note being taken of their scope and the impact they are having on insurance costs. Urgency is required because the issue is affecting our competitiveness and impacting on requests and demands for improved pay and conditions. It will impact on the Government's ability to attract businesses as a result of Brexit. Unless there is urgency, we will be back here in a year's time with the problem having got worse. We need action now. We need the Minister to demonstrate that the gravity of the problem is understood and that the nettle will be grasped.

This is not a new issue. Fianna Fáil has long called for the Government to act on it. In 2014 motor insurance costs were increasing at an annual rate of 11.6%, while in 2015, they rose by 30.8%. In the 12 months to December 2016, they increased by 12.2%. It is extremely frustrating that it took until January 2017 for the Government to respond to an issue which affects every household in the country. In simple terms, this and the previous Government have done nothing. They kicked the can down the road for three years and delayed matters further by establishing working groups and commissioning reports. In the meantime, small taxi operators and haulage companies have been forced out of business. Insurance costs are proving to be a major concern for all businesses throughout the country, whether it be motor, public liability or employer's liability insurance. Many SMEs have experienced business insurance cost increases of between 6% and 15%, while in some cases the increases have been much more. In addition, insurance companies are using insurance excess figures and exclusions to protect themselves at the expense of their customers. The Central Bank should be pressurised to take a more hands-on role to regulate the insurance sector to ensure there will be greater transparency. It is totally unfair that motorists have been left in the dark about the rise in premiums and are expected to put up and shut up as insurance companies act like cartels. We must bring forward deadlines for certain major action points in the reports such as for the establishment of a national claims information database. The Government released a quarter one update last week on progress on the report on the rising costs of motor insurance. Despite being three years into this issue, three of the ten items to be completed in quarter one have yet to be implemented. It is simply not good enough. This is scandalous. A young member of my own family who is 18 years of age was covered under his mother's insurance policy last year as a named driver for approximately €800. They paid for his lessons, after 11 of which he got his driving licence. When he went back to take out insurance as a named driver, the insurer asked for €4,500 from him. It is impossible. It has gone out of all proportion and is up to the Government to do something about it.

I raised it with the Minister of State as a Topical Issue a couple of weeks ago. Despite the CSO figures at the time, the Minister of State told me that the trend was that insurance premiums were becoming static, which was to be welcomed. While I provided examples, the Minister of State said they were anecdotal, but that is not completely true. Notwithstanding what the CSO figures indicated, it is not what we are all experiencing day in and day out. With only limited time available to me, I cannot go into all of the examples. However, the reality is that an acceleration of implementation of the recommendations made in the report is needed. Despite what the CSO stated and what the Minister of State said here, it is not reflecting positively for consumers, whether private individuals or businesses, particularly in the haulage sector. This is a real problem which is causing many to drive without insurance or, in some cases, go out of business. That is unacceptable. There are inconsistencies such as incidents where insurance companies are not quoting for cars with valid NCT certificates. There is a massive problem and, despite what has been said, insurance premiums are increasing by more than 30%. A lady contacted my office on Monday having received a quote for renewal of €850. Owing to personal circumstances, she did not get to renew it until three days after the renewal date, at which point the same company stated it was a new insurance policy which would cost €3,000. That is absolutely crazy. While I accept that the Minister of State is acting in good faith when he tells us things are starting to improve, the fact is that they are not. All Deputies could bring forward multiple examples, not from the last three months but from the past few days and weeks which demonstrate that things are not improving. Implementation of the report must be accelerated to help private individuals and businesses as a matter of urgency in order that they can continue to exist. The people concerned are already stretched and this is a step too far, as I told the Minister of State a few weeks ago in the Chamber. It is time for action. Inaction is not good enough and has significant consequences.
#LisaChambers	unknown-#LisaChambers-party	unknown-#LisaChambers-dob	unknown-#LisaChambers-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	351	I commend the work of my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, on this issue and welcome the opportunity to speak. Motor insurance is mandatory for every citizen who wants to drive. As such, there is an obligation on the State to ensure it is accessible and fairly priced. That is not the case. I pay more for my insurance today after ten years of driving than I did when I started. There is something wrong with that. The cost is crippling and means that many young people cannot afford to get on the road. As someone from a rural constituency, I know that having a car is a necessity for many, in particular to get to work and school. At a time when we are trying to get people to return from abroad, the cost of insurance they are being quoted is astronomical. One is talking about a sum of more than €2,000.  I turn to the cost to business. A man in my constituency with a tree surgery business has a fleet of three vans. Last year his insurance costs actually doubled and this year the insurance companies will not provide him with a quote. Things are not improving; they are getting worse.As has been said, we could be here all day talking about this. The reality on the ground is people cannot afford the costs as they currently stand and we need to address this matter urgently.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	352	Irish small businesses are facing an insurance cost crisis with the potential for devastating consequences. The National Competitiveness Council has highlighted that insurance costs are one of the issues of greatest concern to businesses in the country. Many businesses, in particular small and medium enterprises, are experiencing massive increases in the order of 40% and higher in their premiums for motor, public liability and employer liability cover. This type of cost escalation is not sustainable for businesses, homeowners or individuals. If the current situation continues it will become impossible to do business in Ireland from a domestic and foreign direct investment perspective. The significant cost increase has been borne by small businesses, resulting in job losses and non-expansion by companies. In the SME sector, which employs 920,000 people, many businesses, in particular retailers, are waiting for the Government to deal with costs, which continue to rise and show no sign of moderation. High costs make Ireland less attractive to foreign markets and this impacts on exporting sectors and drives consumers to look at other markets for cheaper goods. The Government must also set out a clear timeline and parameters for phase 2 of the cost of insurance working group, which will look at business insurance. It needs to be prioritised by the Government as lost competitiveness is a massive risk to Irish businesses. It is past time we stopped talking about our out of control insurance costs and do something about them.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	353	I welcome the opportunity to take part in this debate. Dramatically rising insurance costs over recent years have affected almost everybody in this country, whether it be for car insurance, home insurance or business insurance. Last August I spoke on this very topic and raised the very many concerns I had about rising insurance premiums. CSO figures released at that time showed that general insurance costs had risen by more than 47% since 2011 and insurance costs in the motor sector had risen by more than 51% in the same period. I know from my constituency work that people have suffered even greater rises and it must be said this has been for no obvious reason. In fact, I had one particular case where a person in Dundalk, who owns and drives a 2001 Polo with a 1 litre engine, was quoted almost €5,000 for insurance, with a reduced quote of €3,000 if a driving monitor box was installed. It should be noted this person had a full driving license and a no claims bonus. I had other cases where renewal premiums of more than €1,000 were being quoted when in previous years insurance renewal premiums of approximately €500 were the norm. We in County Louth have been particularly hard hit as we are deemed to be in a high risk category for location purposes. I very much welcomed the establishment of a task force, led by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, which was tasked with reporting on the cost of motor insurance in Ireland. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, on his report. The group has published a very detailed report highlighting a large number of actions to be undertaken over the next 24 months. Recently the Minister of State published his first progress report and highlighted that seven of the planned actions had taken place while the remaining three have been partially completed and are due to be fully completed in the very near future. I know many on the opposite side of the House will attempt to play political games with this issue and, indeed, the motion is a prime example of this. I ask Members opposite to look at the bigger picture. The Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, was tasked with the job of finding out why insurance costs are rising, what can be done to halt the rise and to put in place measures to ensure we do not see a sudden increase in insurance costs in the future. Putting aside all political views, everybody can agree that while we are at a very early stage of the implementation of the actions highlighted in the report we are already seeing some real results. As I said earlier, insurance costs had risen between 47% and 51% in the period from January 2011 to 2016. Recently released CSO figures show insurance costs have not risen month on month in 2017. This is progress and should be treated as such. Let us not forget the objective of the working group was to identify and examine the causes of the rising cost of insurance and recommend short, medium and long-term measures to be taken to address the issue of rising insurance costs. Although we are only a short period of time into the implementation of the measures included in the report, we are already seeing some very worthwhile benefits. I commend the Minister of State, Deputy Murphy, on his work to date on the rising cost of insurance and his initial success in stalling increasing insurance costs. The cost of insurance is a major expense, not only for businesses but also for private individuals as they insure their cars and homes. We must ensure we have a fully functioning insurance sector where premiums are at a level that is affordable and sustainable. I look forward to the publication of the next progress report, which I firmly believe will provide further proof that real results will come as a result of the many actions recommended by the action group for rising insurance.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	354	I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann on behalf of the Government on this very important motion. The matters raised are very important. I commend, compliment and thank the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, for his work on this matter. While the Government does not dispute that the increase in the cost of insurance has had a negative impact on consumers and businesses, it disagrees with the thrust of the motion that the Government has done nothing to try to address the underlying causes of the problem. Consequently, the Government will be opposing the motion and will set out in response what has been done to date to tackle this issue. In relation to tackling the cost of insurance, the first point to note is the establishment of the cost of insurance working group by the Minister for Finance in July of last year and the subsequent work of this group, including its motor insurance report. In carrying out its task, I remind the House about the collaborative approach which the working group has adopted through its regular engagement and co-operation with the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach on the cost of insurance project. In this regard, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has made several appearances before the committee and has been held accountable. He has listened very closely to the views of the committee and its Chairman, Deputy John McGuinness. While there are some differences in emphasis between the respective reports, there are far more similarities than differences. There is also a recognition in both reports that there is no single policy or legislative silver bullet to stem or reverse premium price rises immediately. This suggests there is an appreciation by the committee report that it will take a certain amount of time to transform the current insurance premium landscape. This is the reality. The cost of insurance working group produced its first quarterly report on the progress of the implementation of the action plan at the start of this month. This report provides a comprehensive update on progress to date and reasons where delays exist. The Government remains committed to continue to drive implementation in a timely manner in line with the prescribed deadlines in order to stabilise this important sub-sector of the domestic economy. It should also be noted that the timeframes chosen for various recommendations and actions were considered very carefully by the cost of insurance working group. Great care was taken to strike a balance between the urgency of implementing change as soon as possible and the realisation that where significant initiatives are being undertaken time is required to ensure the necessary consultation is carried out before decisions are made as to how to take such projects forward. A good example of this is the establishment of the personal injuries commission. This body lies at the heart of this current review process. However, before it can come to any conclusions about what changes are needed as to how injuries are assessed and how they are graded, it first needs to carry out, among other things, a comprehensive data gathering exercise to assess systems for handling personal injuries claims elsewhere. This takes time and this is why we have given it until quarter four of 2017 to submit its first report. The motion makes a number of valid points, and I accept this, with regard to the rising cost of business insurance. However, it is incorrect to say the Government is not doing anything to address this issue. Deputies will be aware the cost of insurance working group commenced the second phase of its work in January to look at public and employers' liability insurance in parallel with implementing the motor insurance recommendations. The working group is building on the work done in the motor phase to determine how it can be applied in the employer liability and public liability insurance claims areas. The working group is also considering the impact of the cost of insurance on the competitiveness of particular business sectors, the impact of health and safety issues on the cost of insurance and other market issues.Extensive consultations with a range of stakeholders have been held. Further consultations are also planned and submissions have been invited from interested parties. With regard to specific points raised around the timeframe for this work, the intention is to publish an addendum to the motor report, covering employers liability, EL, and public liability, PL. While a final report may not be ready until September, this does not mean that work on EL and PL reforms will only commence then. It is hoped that there will be clarity around the potential new measures in July. As soon as there is certainty about the planned direction of travel, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, will publish accordingly and will appear before the Oireachtas committee to explain the underlying thinking. The latest data from the Central Statistics Office indicates that motor insurance inflation in 2017 has remained flat month-on-month. There was 0% change from December 2016 to April 2017. As of April 2017, motor insurance was 6.1% below its recent peak in July 2016. If this trend continues, the Government is hopeful that it might be signalling the start of a stabilisation of pricing in the market. For the reasons outlined, the Government does not accept the assertions made in the motion and must oppose it as it gives no recognition to the significant level of work done to date by the cost of insurance working group on addressing the cost of insurance issue.

There is an advertisement that appears regularly on people's social media. It is from Insurance Confidential and is an Insurance Ireland creation. The advertisement is supposed to show us how fraud is the reason all of us have been paying so much more for car insurance in the past few years. Every so often the advertisement pops up on social media and users can comment underneath it. It is hilarious, and it is interesting to read the comments. Most of them use very unparliamentary language. If I was to repeat some of it I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would have a lot to say about my language here but the general consensus is that nobody is buying the line from the insurance industry spin or its distraction campaigns. One states, "My insurance premium is higher because of greedy insurance companies" and "childish advertisement" is one comment that sums up most of the others. As the motion before the House states, and I commend Deputy Michael McGrath for bringing it forward, it has been three years since we have seen an explosion in motor insurance premiums, yet this week I have heard of young and middle aged drivers who are receiving quotes for hundreds of euro on top of their existing high premiums. Many people do not have the option and cannot find better value when they shop around so it is a case of pay up or get off the road. The Facebook users know the score, and we all know the score. The insurers are still getting away with it just as they have done for the past few years. The Government's report has some very good ideas but they need to be implemented as soon as possible. It has other ideas that are simply feeding the straw men that have been set up by the insurers. I repeat what has been obvious to me and to my party for a long time. All the legal fees, the fraud and the excuses dreamt up by insurers do not come close to explaining the massive increases we have seen, and are still seeing in some cases, in motor insurance premiums. The insurers invested poorly and their business model, which delivered so much profit for so long, has failed them and consumers are now paying the price. No amount of Government initiatives can change that but transparency is the key to at least removing the excuses, and lack of transparency favours the insurers and only adds to the suspicion of cartelism. I welcome the focus in the motion on tackling the use of so-called failure to disclose by consumers as an excuse by insurers to prevent payouts. My Consumer Insurance Contracts Bill, which has passed Second Stage in this House and is awaiting Committee Stage, proposes changes to the law so that this type of behaviour will be much more difficult to get away with. The onus in that legislation would be put on the insurers to ask the relevant questions instead of on the consumer to know the information that will be held against him or her eventually. The Bill contains many other measures that are needed to level the playing field so that the consumer, be that the small business or the individual, can stand up to the insurers. It is part of the overall solution package. The motion put forward by Deputy McGrath is correct to look at the cost of business insurance in the same way we have looked at the issue of motor insurance. Many of the same issues apply and as far as I am concerned, the same root cause is to be found. The more public fuss there is about car insurance the more the insurers are likely to spread their increases across other areas. That is what we are seeing in terms of recent trends. Health and home insurance will not be immune either. When I asked the committee on finance to look at this issue I hoped that swift intervention would have shamed the insurers into delivering fair prices. We are seeing some movement in that regard but we are also seeing that they have hunkered down and are trying to brazen out the storm, and in some ways the Government has facilitated them and even met them half way in some of their claims. I support this motion. Pressure needs to be kept on the Government to meet its own timetable at least, which is very poor, and I made that point in the debate on the Government's report. Motor insurance and business insurance keep the economy moving. When the system that implements them is failing it has huge implications. The answer must be a greater role for the State in this issue when the private sector is so clearly failing to deliver a functioning market.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	357	I welcome the opportunity to speak in the debate on this Private Members' motion. This is an issue that is affecting citizens across this State. Insurance companies would have us believe that fraudsters, excessive court settlements and the costs associated with the legal profession are the reasons behind the huge increases in motor insurance. Basically, they want to blame their customers but if we scratch the surface we can see that far from being solely the fault of others, it was the investment policies of many of these insurance companies faring far worse than expected, during a time of low interest rates, that resulted in worse than expected returns. To make up for that, they are the heaping extra costs onto drivers, many of whom have clean driving records and never had a claim in their lives. That is unacceptable. We have seen a huge drop in the number of people holding learner permits in the past decade. Part of the reason for that is because many young people see no point in learning to drive as the costs are so high. This week I was contacted by a constituent who had returned here having been away for a year only to find that the cost of her insurance had gone through the roof, so to speak. She had nine years of driving experience, five on a full license, and she had never been in a collision or accident, yet her insurance cost has quadrupled to over €3,000. She said that this was "extortion at its finest", and it is hard not to agree with her. We need urgent action on this issue. The Government must stop dragging its feet. It needs to complete the action points in the Report of the Cost of Motor Insurance, which was supposed to have been done two months ago, and it needs to ensure that the Central Bank enforces proper legislation on the industry.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	358	Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht an deis labhairt ar an topaic fíorthábachtach seo inniu. Every Deputy in this House knows that the cost of insurance, especially motor insurance, has been a major issue of public concern for some time. Deputies across the House have been constantly saying that. There is huge public anger about this issue. The insurance companies have not taken any responsibility and have made every attempt to deflect from their duty to address this issue. The failing business model employed by insurance companies is the real reason for the increases and customers have become the easy targets to recover the losses from imprudent investments. I commend my party colleague, Deputy Pearse Doherty, for all his hard work in highlighting this important issue. It was on foot of his suggestion that the committee on finance engaged with relevant stakeholders and produced a report. The report of the finance committee lays out clearly many measures that would help create greater transparency and would potentially reduce prices. Furthermore, the Government’s own report on the issue makes 70 separate recommendations in this area. Another issue relating to motor insurance is the refusal of insurance companies to insure cars that they deem to be old. These would be cars with 1995 and 1996 registrations owned by elderly people who have an NCT certificate.These people are facing the absolute refusal of companies to insure their cars. This needs to be investigated because it is not good enough. It is clearly showing again that our insurance companies are trying to take advantage of people. It is discrimination against people who cannot afford newer cars.  The Government has shown a lack of urgency in addressing all of these issues. We need action now. We are not going to sit back and allow this to continue. The Government must commit to the full implementation of the report on the cost of motor insurance without any further delay or excuses. We need to ensure that appropriate oversight of the sector is established and maintained in order to protect consumers. I am happy to say my party will be supporting this motion and I urge all Deputies in the House to do the same.

Most of the focus at the time was on the economic viability of Bus Éireann. One of the pieces of information that came to my attention at the time was that the director of Bus Éireann stated the cost of insurance claims within the company had risen from €1.5 million in 2014 to €7 million in 2016. We were told this was one of the reasons there was downward pressure on workers' pay and entitlements. I wondered at that time how insurance increases could be the cause of downward pressures on workers' wages. Surely shocking increases in the cost of insurance would be reasons for the downward pressures on insurance costs. Bus Éireann either became extremely negligent, or had accidents it could not deal with, or the insurance industry was responsible for developing an unfair situation. Conas gur féidir an méadú atá tagtha ar chostais árachais a úsáid mar leithscéal don bhrú anuas ar thuarastail oibrithe? An é go raibh Bus Éireann ag éirí níos neamartaí ar a chuid dualgais nó an bhfuil an tionscail árachais mí-chothrom? Over the past few months, I have been inundated by communications from many families and businesses. The latter either have major difficulties functioning as businesses or they are having their transportation ability curtailed in a massive way. This is happening because of the cost of insurance. A typical small business in Navan, County Meath, employs 15 people and has been open for about nine years. Its insurance cost was roughly €7,000 for approximately eight years. Last year, it went up to €14,000. The business never had a claim. The reason it gives is that it feels there are not enough competitors in the market. It has a choice of only two separate companies from which to procure its insurance. Another business in Meath opened four years ago. It had an insurance cost of about €2,500 per year. This has increased to about €8,500. The business has had two claims made against it. It obviously believes these claims are unfair, etc., but it is not for me to say whether they are. It is important, however, to note that a claim or two can actually push a business over the tipping point in terms of functionality. Another business in Meath, which has just won a competition for the best business of its class in the whole State, has told me its insurance has jumped from €8,000 to €12,000. Therefore, there are many businesses that have come through eight or nine years of really difficult trading experiences that are just at the very edge of functionality. Now they are being hit with massive costs. A couple of months ago, I organised a public meeting in Meath on insurance. We were inundated with people at the meeting. An individual told me his insurance cost increased from €450 per year to €900 per year for absolutely no reason. Another individual told us they had to pay €2,600 for car insurance. A young woman driver who attended the meeting was quoted €6,500 for car insurance. A key point I took from the meeting concerned the issue of older cars. It became very clear that a number of participants stated they had cars that were over 15 years old. The cars were fully functional, safe, in perfect working order and with an NCT certificate. That they cannot be insured has the effect of saying to two elements of our demographic that they will not be able to drive. Young people and people on low incomes are the people likely to be driving these cars.  The structure of the insurance industry is broken. The Government is responsible for the development of the conditions for industries to function in. One of the key problems with the Government is that it does not seem to be tackling the dysfunction within the insurance industry. There are serious ramifications. Ireland is currently suffering massive increases in inflation in a number of specific areas. There was a report a couple of days ago stating Dublin is now in the top ten cities in the world with regard to construction costs. We are seeing an erosion of the competitiveness of the country. For the past few years, every time the issue of competitiveness came to a head the Government focused on workers' wages, conditions and entitlements but did not seem to feel the same need to focus on insurance.  The gamut of products and services we consume as a people is being affected by insurance costs in this country. Day by day, younger people and poorer people, including those on lower incomes, are being prevented from functioning in the economy itself. It is really important that the Government consider this.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	16233	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	360	We welcome the motion. We will be supporting it. I believe the Minister of State to be genuine in his attempts to deal with this issue. If we had one criticism, it would be that some of the deadlines should be sooner rather than in quarters three and four of this year. I wish to speak briefly to some of the issues inherent in the update of 3 May, as presented by the Minister of State. Recommendation No. 6 relates to ensuring greater consistency of treatment for returning immigrants. When the Minister of State is responding, I would be very grateful if he could let us know whether there is scope within the recommendation to ensure such a protocol is achieved, perhaps by the end of quarter two or three, because it is such a vital issue. I do not need to rehearse in the House the issues that affect returning immigrants but if the protocol could be designed in a way to ensure it may be implemented with greater haste, it would provide a lot of confidence for people who are returning from abroad. On recommendation No. 7, on the subjection of the declined cases agreement to ongoing review to ensure transparency, we welcome the progress. I seek clarification on the exact position at present. Bearing in mind the review, the Minister of State will correct me if I am wrong on Insurance Ireland's updating of its website. My understanding from the report of 3 May is that Insurance Ireland has actually updated the website. Again, I want clarification on that. On recommendation No. 8 of the Minister of State's report, dated 3 May, there is to be a protocol for policyholders to be notified of claims made against them before settlement date. I seek a real-time clarification from the Minister of State on that. That was a matter of some discussion today in the media. The Minister of State and Deputy Michael McGrath referred specifically to it. I was listening to the discussion in passing. What is the position on that?There is a school of thought that such a recommendation should be much stronger and that defendants should be given an opportunity to mount a defence instead of an insurer deciding that it is uneconomic to defend and going to a default payment mechanism. I acknowledge Deputy Michael McGrath on that point because he raised it on the Sean O'Rourke show earlier today. We all want to ensure the cost of motoring will be reduced for every motorist, regardless of his or her demographics and the age of the vehicle. I was a member of the finance committee that reported on this issue and one of the major issues was related to older vehicles. If an older vehicle passes the NCT, the owner should not be discriminated against because of its age. That does not make an ounce of sense as the NCT is subject to the law of the land. I have serious difficulties with the issue of transparency because we were told all along that the reason for the stark increase in the cost of premia was the provisioning that was necessary on the part of insurance companies to cover losses. There is nothing in the reports about this, but I have a great difficulty with the amount provided for. People will accept an increase in their premia, but they cannot sustain the increases they have had to sustain in the past 12 months. The insurance industry is telling us a corrective mechanism is in place whereby premia have been reduced by 40% in some instances. A component has to be pure and utter profit. There is no transparency on that profit making. Another issue I have is that Insurance Ireland seemed to speak for the industry at the committee hearings. It is not about personalities, but I found it difficult to understand why one person with one voice seemed to represent the entire industry. Will the Minister of State outline whether the working group has heard from voices other than Insurance Ireland? In other words, have the chief executive officers of insurance companies dealt directly with him? What has been the nature of the engagement between them? Consumers would not necessarily recognise Insurance Ireland as the sole voice of the sector. It would be useful for us to have some insight from the Minister of State into what his engagement was with them. It would be even better if he named the individual companies. I doubt that he will, but I make the request respectfully. We support the motion. I recognise the work the Minister of State is doing, but I would like him to ensure the goals to be attained within certain quarters are fast-tracked, particularly in the case of returning emigrants. Perhaps he might have something to say about that. It would be useful and send a signal. I would also like him to comment on the issues affecting older drivers, drivers of older vehicles and public service vehicles and the distinction between taxis and so on and SMEs that have fleets but which find their insurance costs have gone through the roof. He should ensure a level playing field in respect of transparency on the difference between the provisioning and the corrective measures he has said are being introduced and the profits generated. People want to feel that they are not being screwed. I do not know if the word "screwed" is unparliamentary language, but I am speaking in the vernacular. It is unfair that consumers find themselves in this position at this time. I have no doubt that I will receive a letter if the word is deemed to be unparliamentary. I read the list of prohibited words lately and the term "corner-boy" was proscribed. Perhaps that is now anachronistic, but it was appropriate at a certain time.

Huge numbers of citizens are being ripped off by insurance companies. I primarily want to address the cost of motor insurance, but I will comment on the cost of health insurance initially. It is the biggest scam ever. I would never take out private health insurance on principle because in the area of health it is obscene and unacceptable that we have a two-tier system under which people receive premium health care if they pay and second-class health care if they do not. It is worse than that because many of the inadequacies in the public health system result precisely from the existence of a private health tier and private health insurance leeching off the public system, a little like fee-paying schools. They receive the benefits of public funding and support, while generating a premium above it to support a two-tier system. I understand many people take out private health insurance out of fear of the public system, but the problem is that is a self-fulfilling prophecy. By taking it out, they reinforce the system. I do not blame those who do it out of fear, but, ironically, are they better off with private health insurance? It is a serious question as to whether they are because when it comes to the most serious illnesses, they end up having to go back into the public system. The private health insurance industry is a parasite on the public health system and resources and finance that should go into providing a quality universal health system for all. The Government parties often talk, as a way of absolving themselves of the crisis in the public system, about the fact that Ireland spends one of the highest proportions of GDP on health services, but they always fail to say a huge portion of that figure, approximately €3 billion, is paid to the private system. When it is taken out, one realises why there is a crisis in the public health system. We mirror the United States in that sense. A total of 40% of expenditure on health services in the United States basically represents profiteering by the private health insurance industry and other private health service providers. We should get rid of private health insurance by having a national health system. It is one extortionate cost imposed on huge numbers of people that could be removed. I do not disagree with anything in the motion and there is not much with which I disagree in the reports of the Minister of State and the Oireachtas joint committee which made some good recommendations. However, none of them will address the problem, which is that motor insurance providers are profiteering from the fact that it is a mandatory legal requirement to have motor insurance if one drives. They have a captive audience.Many people do not have a choice about driving. A car is necessary for many people in rural areas where public transport is woefully inadequate. One has to have insurance, otherwise one is breaking the law. For elderly people, people with mobility problems and people who earn their living through driving - the most obvious are taxi drivers but there are other jobs that require a car - one is captive in that one has to drive and the law requires one to have insurance, but the State does not provide a minimum level of not-for-profit insurance. Therefore, one is prey for the private motor insurance companies which profiteer from the fact that they have a captive market. The transparency measures do not go far enough. The emphasis put by the Government in the prelude to these reports was all about fraudulent claims, overstating the extent of those fraudulent claims, legal costs, which are a factor but do not explain the dramatic increases in recent years, and giving more information to the consumer about the breakdown of premiums or increases and all the rest of that. They do not get to the fundamental problem, and I do not think any of these measures will get to the fundamental problem, that the private insurance companies with a captive market can always find ways to ratchet up premiums to make money. Private insurance companies are entirely tied up with a market. The biggest reason for the big increases was that their investments went bad. They lost much money on the markets and then decided to recoup that money by screwing the premium holders and people seeking insurance. That was the major reason for these dramatic increases, and nothing is going to stop, including the measures proposed in the Fianna Fáil motion, in the Government's recommendations or for that matter by the all-party Oireachtas committee. Given that it is a legal mandatory requirement, there has to be the provision of some sort of basic motor insurance which is affordable for everybody on a not-for-profit basis. If people want premium insurance after that, they can go to the private market. This is a legal requirement. If it is a legal requirement, the State has to make it affordable for those who need it. Taxi drivers are literally being put out of business by these guys. If one has the slightest prang - of course, one is going to have small prangs if one is driving all the time for a living - one is gone. Premiums are already massively high and people who have never had accidents are getting premiums of €17,000 and €20,000, which are ridiculous figures. That is not sustainable for taxi drivers. Of course, over the course of driving for a living, one is going to have some little accident, which is not even one's fault. It could be a small thing, but that is it - one is out of a job. There has to be a particular control or the provision of a special category of insurance premiums and policies to allow taxi drivers to function, or for that matter other people who have to drive for a living. Something has to be done about the issue of discrimination against the elderly, against young people and against rural dwellers. I also believe young nurses and other health care workers are getting punitive premiums, and I believe journalists also get punitive premiums for some reason just because they are journalists. I do not quite fully understand that. That discrimination should not be allowed. I asked the Minister of State about this and he said that is just the way insurance works. He said companies look at categories of drivers and this is going to influence the premiums. That is not fair. If one happens to be in one of those categories, but has a perfectly good record, or has a car that passed the NCT, but happens to be older, one is penalised. That penalises the young or less well-off but it is just not fair. None of the Minister of State's measures is doing anything to deal with that unfairness and discrimination.

He acknowledged the volatility in the market and then said that co-operation and commitment between all parties can deliver fairer premiums for consumers without unnecessary delay. I welcome the report of the working group and the recommendations, actions and timeline, but we are not seeing any action on it. What we are seeing is life becoming very difficult for motorists, in particular in Dublin. The increase in the insurance costs is just another factor in that. I want to look at particular groups, which Deputy Boyd Barrett mentioned. Taxi drivers use their cars to make a living. I have numerous constituents who are taxi drivers and they tell me they cannot afford to work. Their taxis are off the road because of the huge increase in insurance. These are taxi drivers who have completed all the tests. They are adhering to very stringent standards, including the NCT and public service yearly checks. They are dealing with increasing anti-social behaviour on the part of some customers. They are providing a service and are being crippled by the rise. I have seen increases of insurance up to over €10,000. For pensioners, some insurers make the cost of insurance so high for them that they are forced to give up their cars. These pensioners use their cars for mobility, for their independence and for leisure activities and their children depend on them to bring their grandchildren to various activities. Now they are not able to drive because of the increase, which will increase their isolation and dependence. I have one constituent, aged 70, with 20 years no claim bonus, who faced a 70% increase. This will mean she has to rely on her neighbours to do the chores she could have done herself. We also have families who rely on their cars and who are being crippled by these insurance costs. I also mention these foreign-registered companies that go into liquidation, the policyholders being left in difficult situations and the industry footing the bill. It is really the customers having to pay the exorbitant increases, so I do not understand this collective liability. There is a need for a central EU database to ensure common standards. People are turning to companies based outside Ireland and I think there could be disastrous consequences. It is their right to make this choice, but I think they need to know the risks involved. We are also aware of the discrepancy between what the insurance industry is saying and the legal profession we are paying, but in the middle is the customer who is paying the price. I am aware of a very disturbing situation relating to house insurance for a person with a disability. There are extremely aggressive policies from the insurer, backed by a US vulture fund investor that has taken over the insurance. I hope the debate will lead to some action because that will speak louder than words.

We could probably all use our time citing cases which have heard about in our constituency offices in regard to the costs of insurance for people who have no choice but to have cars and small businesses which have no choice but to have insurance. I want to cite one case of a young man in Donegal who has to have a car for work and was quoted €6,000 for car insurance. He would be working for a year just to insure his car. Those are the kinds of increases people are facing throughout the country. It is over three years since this crisis was flagged. The action which has been taken is quite disappointing when one sees the time taken to get the reports of the insurance working group. The myths the insurance companies have been putting out must be dispelled. We hear the narratives that fraud, legal costs, the costs of claims and so on are causing the increase in the cost of insurance policies. The most interesting sentence in the report on the costs of motor insurance is that the working group did not find that legal costs were a major contributory factor in the recent increases in premiums. The working group set up to look at it has shot out of the water the reasons put by the insurance industry about costs.I believe it is true that the reason the costs have gone up is that insurance companies' returns on investments have gone down over the last couple of years. That is why. It is because of the business model of the insurance companies. That is what has lumped the cost on. Yet, the Government buys into the narrative that fraud, legal costs and everything else is lumping it on. It is worth noting that Zurich Insurance made $2.9 billion in profits in 2015. Allianz made €10.5 billion in profits in 2016. These are extremely profitable companies that are gouging their own customers because they know they will get away with it. That is the bottom line. They know they can do it. As was mentioned earlier, due to the fact that it is a legal requirement to have at least third-party insurance in this country if one wants to drive, there is an onus on the State to ensure that people can achieve that minimum standard. If that means the State should establish its own insurance company to provide that, we should be doing that and it should have been done already. We should not have to say that it should be done. The only way to put manners on the insurance companies is to provide insurance for people. The companies will then change their tune.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	366	I support the motion. I generally support the tenor of the debate this evening. For three years now, we know that premiums have gone up very high by more than 50%. We know that more people are being forced into driving without insurance because they cannot afford the insurance as it is so high. I want to take the opportunity to deal with some of the issues that have been raised already about car insurance. I was recently contacted by a constituent. Like many stories we have heard, my constituent has seen an almost 400% increase in the cost of basic third-party fire and theft insurance in two years. In 2015, he was able to get insurance for €400. In 2016, it went up to almost €700. This year, he was quoted €1,472. He tried ringing around. He got one quote for more than €2,000 but most refused to even offer him a quote. Was this person some sort of dangerous maniac? Has he been guilty of drink-driving or dangerous driving? He has not. Does he have penalty points? No. Does he have a full licence? Yes, since 1974. Does he have a medical condition that makes it unsafe for him to drive? No. Is the car roadworthy? Yes, it passed the NCT. Therefore, what was the problem? He was over 65. There was no other reason. I note that a recommendation of the report states that the insurance companies must advise and tell somebody why he or she is being refused. However, that is no use if one cannot get insurance anywhere else. It good to have a bit of transparency, but it is not going to make the fundamental difference. Insurance companies are penalising older drivers. It is a major issue for Age Action. Older people have taken up this issue themselves and are pushing for it. The companies are also penalising young drivers. USI has come out with many instances of its members facing huge premiums. A young woman called into my office whose car was 13 or 14 years old. She obviously needed the car. She was travelling around with an old car. If one is on a low wage, one is not going to be going out spending big money on big cars. One is using the car to get around. She was quoted nearly €2,500. It is just unbelievable. As has been said, car insurance is mandatory. If a person has a full licence with no convictions, no penalty points and a roadworthy car that has passed the NCT, he or she should be entitled to affordable insurance. This situation is forcing people off the road, or even worse, to drive without insurance. The Government must act. As has been said by Deputies Pringle, Boyd Barrett and O'Sullivan, there must be a neutral not-for-profit company that would provide affordable basic insurance to people like those constituents who are facing those basic third-party insurance costs. That has to be the case. If we do not do that, nothing is going to change because, as has been said, the insurance companies know that they have a captive audience, they know that people cannot go anywhere else and they know that people have to drive.

Young drivers cannot get realistic quotes that they can afford to pay. I am of the belief that one should always give young people a chance at least until they blot their copybook. They are entitled to be treated fairly until that happens. They should at least get a chance and be allowed to start off. Young people need their cars, especially where we come from. There is no mode of transport in rural places other than a car and one needs to have a car of one's own. Many of these youngsters now cannot go to work because they cannot afford insurance. Likewise, old drivers are being penalised. Their quotes are being doubled. That is not fair and it makes no sense. Quotes for taxis and hackneys have gone up. The cost of their yearly premiums has gone up. I know of two cases in which the quote rose to €14,000. They could not come up with that kind of money and it forced them off the road. I will give one example in each case. I know of a haulier who paid €70,000 last year. This year, he is being quoted €250,000. That is the truth. Youngsters of 21 years of age are being asked to pay €4,000 and €5,000. They cannot afford that. Returning to old people, I know of one man who never had a crash in his life. His insurance went up from €340 to €780. He has actually paid it. I know another man who was a bit luckier. His quote went a way up as well from around €300 to more than €700. He went along and told his son about it. His son had a lot of vehicles and could not believe the figure his father was being quoted. The son went along to the insurance company or broker and asked how his father was being charged so much. The response was, "Oh, is he your father?". This is a fact. The son said that it was his father and the company said to leave it with them. They came back after a few hours and said that his premium would be the same next year. That tells me that something is going on and that insurance companies are not being honest. There is a huge increase in claims and the value of claims. There are companies out there especially putting claims together for solicitors. Claimants cannot lose because the legal profession operates on the basis of "no foal, no fee". They cannot lose. Why is it that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board is only dealing with 20% of the claims? For a serious case of whiplash in England, the maximum payout a claimant can get is £7,600. For a very minor one here, a claimant will get €18,400. For a serious one, a claimant will get €77,000. A girl got €76,000 for her finger being caught in a door. The solicitor got €47,000 of that. I will not say where it was, but another solicitor boasted that he got €80,000 for such a claim and said that if others have similar cases, he can get that money for them too. A fella who slipped on a wet floor when he was actually pushed, for some reason or other - I cannot understand it - got €750,000. I have said it before that the fraud squad or some special investigation unit should be put into action to follow these things up because this is what is causing much of the increases, or at least this is what we are being told is the cause of the increase in quotes and premiums for the young, the old and the business people I mentioned. If we go back about 14 years, we had the same scenario in this country. People could not afford insurance because it had become very expensive at that time. I know that because my oldest two lads were coming on the scene at the time and I could not insure them on their own. I had to insure them on an old jeep I had and put them on my insurance. That is a fact. We do not have enough competition in the insurance market at present. I will say categorically that while Seán Quinn was operating we could pay for insurance. Sadly, he has been taken out of it. People could get insurance and when he was there, they could pay for it. He was taken out but he would have paid his way back. The bankers who broke the country were let off and they got away with it. Deputy Boyd Barrett brought the issue of health insurance to my attention and I agree with him. How is it if a person is in hospital for two or three days, he or she is liable to pay about €75 a night for his or her stay yet if he or she has VHI the hospital will take a fee of €800 or €850 from VHI for the same stay? Why is that happening? It is the HSE that is doing it. It is driving up the cost of private health cover. That should be investigated. It is happening everywhere. Regardless of what hospital it is, it is happening and it is unfair because, at the end of the day, it is the public that has to pay for it. We are raising all these issues in respect of the cost of insurance with the Minister of State, and I have done so since I came here. Something needs to be done. The Government should have a role to play when someone has been refused insurance or when someone is given an exorbitant quote he or she cannot pay. The Government or some independent body should have the power to ask why that is the case because it is totally unfair. It is the most common thing we are asked at our clinics and especially when we meet youngsters. They are trying to get going and want to get out in the world but they are being prevented from doing that. There must be more competition in the market and the Government must investigate further to ensure companies are acting fairly because I do not believe they are at present.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	368	We are all in a unique position because we interact with the public all the time. One of the issues on people's minds is the cost of living. One of the major concerns is the cost of insurance and motor insurance is a significant factor in that context. The high cost of living has undermined the ability of many families to make ends meet. Motor insurance becomes one of those out-of-the-ordinary costs and unexpected, big increases can really cripple a family's monthly budget. The average cost of insurance has risen by over 60% since 2012. Such an increase is proof positive the system is dysfunctional. We have all heard stories. Most Deputies or their family members will have had experience of premiums rising dramatically since last year despite the fact there may have been no change in circumstances. Just this week I had contact from a constituent who after 40 years of driving claim-free had cause to make a claim on his policy in 2016. This resulted in him having his premium increased by €455 for the next year, bringing it to €894. He shopped around for a few weeks and tried to see if he could get a better quote. While he was doing that his insurance company withdrew the quotation of €894 and is now seeking €2,770. The man is 40 years driving with no claims and is facing a premium not far off €3,000. It will obviously not be just one year; it will be an issue that will go on for several years. It is absolutely outrageous. While it is true things have calmed down in terms of increases in motor insurance over the last number of months, the fact remains the insurance regime is flawed and requires a new way of doing business. We are almost an outlier in terms of international standards for some injury awards. A broken arm in the UK tends to attract an average settlement of £5,000 whereas here, the average award for the same injury is €16,000. It is legitimate to ask why there is a discrepancy. The £5,000 might be too low but is there a good reason for the discrepancy? There is an urgent need to provide far better settlement guidance for judges and for the Personal Injuries Assessment Board when it comes to making decisions on injury settlements. Where there are injuries that merit awards or very high awards, it is imperative those awards are in keeping with the seriousness of the injury, the rehabilitation required and the loss of earnings and potential earnings. It is important there is transparency in how it is calculated. It is possible to reduce legal costs associated with personal injuries claims by improving the methods of non-litigation settlement and thereby further reducing costs. Once the legal profession is involved in the court system, it becomes a very big element of any settlement. Small and medium businesses in this country face significant bureaucratic pressures and ever-increasing costs associated with trying to run a business. Motor and business insurance are chief among them. It simply does not make economic sense to cripple businesses with exorbitant insurance costs which could potentially price them out of business and reduce the number of people who are contributing.  Of the ten action points specified in the Government's report on the cost of motor insurance, which came after the crisis in the industry had pretty much exploded, three have still not been completed. Many data are collected and we should have a mechanism for monitoring the situation and not allowing it to get to the point of a crisis. In the past number of years, we have had a number of debates in the House on this issue when it escalates to the point of being routinely on the airwaves.  I will make a comment that is slightly off track on the issue of health insurance and the regime in place at the moment. When anybody is admitted to hospital through accident and emergency, he or she is, by definition, vulnerable. People are not admitted willy-nilly into accident and emergency. A woman contacted me who ended up having a serious increase in her blood pressure, to the point where the consultant had to be called, because of the pressure put on her to fill out a form to say she was a private patient because she had health insurance when, in fact, she went in through accident and emergency as a consequence of ill-health. The kind of pressure being put on people is absolutely outrageous. They did not take account that it presented a problem for that woman that evening and they came back again the next morning.They even wrote to her after she got out of hospital. However, she was very determined that she was not going to fill in the form and was told not to do so by her insurance company. The pressure that is being put on people who are in a very vulnerable position is outrageous. When patients are in a vulnerable position and are dependent on people to treat them, the last thing they want is to be having a row. That needs to be sorted out in the context of the overall issue of insurance.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	Since I became a Member of this House in February 2016 I have been very impressed with my party colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, who has put an extraordinary amount of effort into raising the issue of increasing insurance costs. I also want to acknowledge the sincerity of the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, in trying to deal with this issue. The Government must take urgent action now to tackle exorbitant motor insurance costs as the situation is reaching crisis levels and leaving businesses, families and motorists struggling to make ends meet. I have had many calls to my constituency office from people who are angry and frustrated, having been hit by 30% to 50% increases in motor and other insurance costs. Many families are struggling to keep their heads above water. They are paying mortgages, meeting exorbitant child care costs and paying other bills while trying to put food on the table. The increases in insurance costs are putting extra pressure on already struggling families. This is an issue of particular concern in rural areas like my own constituency of Roscommon-Galway, where we have a very poor public transport system and so many people rely on their cars. They need their cars to bring their children to school, to get to work and to do whatever work they have to do around the place. A car is vital in rural Ireland. I was contacted recently by a constituent whose car insurance had increased by 30% from €560 in 2015 to over €800 in 2017. This is a person with absolutely no claims, whose car is about ten years old and is valued at €2,000. As he pointed out, he got €5 back per week in his salary with the budgetary cuts to the USC but he is now faced with rising car insurance costs as well as the crippling cost of family health insurance. He has no fear of anyone coming in through his front door to rob him when they can just do it through the letter box and that is what is happening. Many businesses, particularly SMEs, are also experiencing massive increases, in the order of 40% and higher, in their motor, public liability and employer liability insurance premiums.  I know of a 19 year old girl with a full licence who has never been involved in a crash but the first insurance quotation she got was for €6,000. Her car is only worth €2,800. The driver of a wheelchair accessible taxi was quoted €12,000. A hotel in my constituency paid €20,000 in insurance last year. It made one small claim and now its insurance premium has increased to €50,000. We all know about the problems with health insurance and other areas of insurance too. We need to address this issue.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	370	I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling this motion and for pursuing this matter relentlessly in this Dáil. The cost of insurance is causing a very real crisis across our country. The rapid, unjustifiable and unsustainable increases in insurance costs are undermining our national competitiveness, crippling businesses and hurting families. This is leading to widespread anger and anxiety in my own county of Wexford. However, it is not just the increase in the principal that is causing distress. Increases in excesses and the denial of claims for minor non-disclosures or for slight delays in notifying insurance companies of potential claims are all adding to distress. Furthermore, we have seen significant increases in the number of drivers being refused car insurance three times. In County Wexford, I have dealt with a number of instances where elderly women have been refused insurance for no reason other than their age, which is blatant discrimination. All these issues have been ongoing for some time now. The increases in insurance premiums reflect a combination of Government imposed costs, poor regulation, mismanagement by insurance companies and legislative failure. I do not get any sense of urgency from the Government to tackle this issue and we are not seeing any relief on the ground. I am conscious of the requirement for parliamentary language so I will say that people rightly feel as if they are attached to another object by an inclined plane wrapped helically around an axis. The high cost of motor insurance is preventing people from going back to work as the insurance is often significantly higher than the price of a car. Returning emigrants are being discriminated against with high insurance premiums. Taxi and hackney drivers are going out of business due to the unaffordability of insurance and this in turn limits the ability of elderly people and people with disabilities to get around. Some people are completely dependent on taxi and hackney services for mobility.  We have also seen significant increases being imposed on road hauliers. Motor insurance is mandatory; it is a legal requirement and is not avoidable. It acts as a flat charge in that it takes no account of ability to pay and as such, it affects the struggling classes more, including older people, young workers and families. High insurance costs have a disproportionate effect on such people. Spiralling business and motor insurance costs are undermining businesses. In particular, increases in public and employer liability insurance are having a very negative effect on businesses in the services sector like hotels and restaurants. I urge the Minister of State to start taking action on this matter.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	371	I want to focus on the costs to businesses in an already difficult environment, particularly businesses in towns in rural and regional Ireland. Businesses in our towns are already under huge pressure on a number of fronts because society has changed. In particular, how we shop has changed, as have our demographics and our use of technology. People now purchase more goods online, they commute longer distances and often pick up their groceries on the way home. People engage in commercial activities in very different ways now so town centres and once thriving traditional market towns are struggling. Businesses in town centres also have to contend with the difficulties caused by planning decisions which have led to the development of out-of-town centres and satellite centres. This drives people out of the town centres and away from traditional businesses. The issue of commercial rates has been well debated in this House recently. In my county of Kildare we witnessed a huge commercial rate re-evaluation in recent months at the most inappropriate time, just as the country is coming out of recession and into some form of putative recovery. Businesses are being kicked again, just when they were beginning to get back on their feet, by rates increases of between 300% and 400%. In many cases, these increases are not linked in any way to an ability to pay, turnover or profitability. Coupled with that, retail theft remains a huge issue. The issues of crime, vagrancy and the lack of gardaí as well as old-fashioned daylight robbery are unfortunately features of my constituency of Kildare North, where we have the lowest number of gardaí per head of population. Businesses are being hit again and again and have almost become resigned to it at this stage, having been held up time and again. Brexit and the uncertainty that it brings has also been mentioned in this debate. All these issues underscore why insurance costs are so pivotal in keeping the door open for many traditional, bricks and mortar, small businesses on the main streets of our towns. These factors in combination mean that their competitiveness is taking a hammering. They are trying to trade in the face of online and other forms of competition and are finding it increasingly difficult to keep the door open.  I urge the Minister of State to take on board the detailed motion tabled by my colleague, Deputy Michael McGrath, which contains some excellent points. This issue needs urgent attention. I heard the Minister of State on "Morning Ireland" dealing with some of these issues and gamely trying to avoid dealing with other issues, which he succeeded in doing. It is a very important motion which I commend to the House.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	372	In tabling this motion, Fianna Fáil wishes to highlight the crippling costs of insurance for home owners, individuals and businesses. Motor insurance costs are putting immense pressure on households and businesses and for many SMEs, insurance costs have risen by 15% or more. Motor insurance premiums are still on the rise despite assurances from the Government that people would see premiums start to fall as we progress through 2017. While there are early signs of stability in the market, many worried motorists are still contacting me. I was contacted by a taxi driver from Tramore who was setting up a new business, providing the first wheelchair accessible taxi in the lovely seaside town of Tramore, County Waterford. He got an insurance quote for €10,500, which almost put him out of business. This man got up and set up a business but his insurance costs amount to €200 per week, before he pays back any of his car loan or puts a drop of diesel into his vehicle. The cost of insurance is having a huge effect on small businesses. I would also like to point out that insurance costs are causing enormous difficulties for young people and I say that on the basis of personal experience. My 24 year old son had a budget for a car and insurance of €5,000. Unfortunately, as insurance cost €2,000, his car had to cost €3,000.If the insurance policy had cost €1,000, he would have been able to buy a car for €4,000. The budget was there, but the cost of insurance determined the type of car he could buy. That is exactly what we are listening to day in and day out. Insurance companies do not want to insure younger or older drivers or taxi drivers. They certainly do not to insure anyone with an older car. That is making it very difficult. An open market is needed to ensure fairness for all. We have constantly highlighted the need for action by the Government at policy and legislative levels. The Minister of State urgently needs to review the action points which should have been completed by now. I ask him to do this. I compliment my colleague on bringing this issue to the fore. We are living with it day in and day out. As I said, one appreciates the scale of the problem when one meets someone who tried to open a small business and insurance costs almost caused him or her to fail before he or she even started.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	373	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. I thank Deputy Michael McGrath for tabling the motion and thereby giving Deputies the opportunity to highlight the examples being raised with them by their constituents every day. I thank the Deputies who helped us to gather information when we were putting together our report in the second half of last year. The Government will oppose the motion not because we do not understand the genuine concerns of constituents but because the motion suggests nothing is being done. That is unfair, given the amount of work that has been happening across many Departments for quite some time. As an elected representative, I receive emails just like every other Deputy. Ever since I took on this role, I have been receiving emails from all over the country. We know that something needs to be done in this regard and that is exactly what we are trying to do. Deputy Frank O'Rourke spoke about the data received from the CSO. We discussed this issue recently in the Dáil Chamber. The statistics are relevant and we have to pay attention to them. In the past five months we have seen no increase in motor insurance premiums. In the past year we have seen a decrease, but that is not to suggest people are not still experiencing increases in their insurance premiums. We know that they are. Equally, I am not suggesting there is a direct correlation between the publication of the report earlier this year and the reforms under way as a result and the stabilisation in the insurance market. As a result of the work done in the past 12 months by Deputies Michael McGrath, Pearse Doherty and Sean Sherlock and their party colleagues - by all Members of this House, together with the Government - to draw attention to this issue, to find out exactly why this had come to pass and to set out a roadmap for the reforms to be introduced and as a result of the clarity being driven by that work, there is an understanding among the public at large, within the industry and among the vested interests in this area that change needs to happen. It is clear from the reforms we are seeing that welcome change is happening. I accept Deputy Michael McGrath's point that we do not have the data we need for employer's liability and public liability insurance. That is something we need to fix. Co-operation is very important in dealing with this issue which, as we all know, is complex. It is recognised in the Oireachtas committee's report and ours that there is no single silver bullet that will fix the problem. We know that it cannot be solved overnight. However, there is a comprehensive suite of reforms that can be actioned. It is important to emphasise that we cannot give false hope to our constituents when they contact us by saying we are going to fix it immediately. That would not be a responsible approach to this complex issue. As Deputy Danny Healy-Rae pointed out, we need competition in the market. We need a stable, properly functioning and competitive market if we are to drive down prices and ensure people in areas of business where they cannot get cover will be able to get it in the future. It is important to bear that in mind as we work to address this issue. While the clarity and sense of purpose we have shown in working together have been helpful, we risk undermining them if we are not careful in how we work together into the future as we implement these reforms. I dispute Deputy Dara Calleary's suggestion there has been a lack of urgency on the part of the Government. Last year, when we set up the working group and began working on our reforms, we had subgroups meeting every week across the Government to look at the different areas that needed to be reformed. When people were dissatisfied because our report was not due until December, we made a commitment to bring forward emerging recommendations by the end of October to help to inform the Oireachtas committee's report. We met that commitment. When we committed to quarterly reporting beginning later this year, the Taoiseach and the Oireachtas committee asked us to bring it forward and we did. Prior to that, we produced an interim report before our quarterly report in order that when I appeared before the Oireachtas committee, as I did on a number of occasions, it had as much information as I had. This facilitated a proper and constructive debate on these matters and enabled the committee to hold me to account in line with my role as the Minister of State with responsibility for this area. We have brought transparency to the process in the way we have built the report. We have set out clear timelines. We have said which party will be responsible for implementing the various elements and actions mentioned in the report. Where there are delays - I will come to them - we have signalled them. Rather than saying "we will do this in a year" and then apologising a year later when it was not achieved and saying "we will do it soon", we have said quarter by quarter what steps will be taken. We have put in place a traffic light reporting system to enable people to see in advance where delays might happen and allow us to work on fixing them. I ask the Deputies who have claimed that work is not being done to look at the detail in the first quarterly report which states what is happening on each of the 33 recommendations. The report we published in January set out 71 actions, 40 of which are to be completed this year. That means that most of the recommendations will be acted on this year. Ten actions were due for completion in the first quarterly report, but there have been delays in three areas. We are working to address these delays, one of which will be fixed imminently, while work to fix the other two is ongoing. We hope to address them before the end of the second quarter. The Personal Injuries Commission which has been mentioned by a number of Deputies as one of the most important areas in the first quarterly report is already up and running and doing good and important work. Good progress is being made with the national claims information database, another key element of our efforts to have transparency on what exactly is happening in the claims and insurance market. We can take comfort from it.  I have been asked to speed up our work in areas such as the uninsured database. We have to be very careful in that regard. The last time an effort was made to implement an uninsured database, it failed because it is not easy to get the right data into the right system and make them easily accessible to An Garda Síochána. While we see the urgency in doing this, we have to proceed with caution to make sure we get it right and do not make a mistake that will ultimately make the system fatally flawed. If we cause this proposal to be put back on the shelf, we might end up three years down the line with nothing to show for our endeavours. It has been suggested we have moved too slowly in the past year. I have spoken about the urgency I have attached to incremental reporting on the work we have been doing. It is important to recognise that we produced our report a few weeks after the Oireachtas committee had produced its report. We had to do an added piece of work - we had to include an action plan with timelines to identify the responsible actors and get buy-in from them. That is the responsibility of the Government. We have done that. I remind those who have said this should be done more quickly that we have prepared a detailed report which runs to over 100 pages and that we have done serious work on the timelines. We recognise that work needs to be done in a number of areas at the same time. I ask Deputies not to say we should do this more quickly. As we have laid out in our report, we have had to resolve detailed issues in addressing the national claims information database. How could we have done it more quickly? I remind the House that other work needs to be done by the actors involved, including the Central Bank, across their various priority areas. It is important that we make constructive contributions when we are talking about doing things more quickly. Those who want things to be done more quickly are proposing in the motion before the House that more burdens be added to our work in new areas. We have to recognise that significant resources are being invested across government to get this work done. We began our work on employer's and public liability insurance which is incredibly important at the start of this year. It is important to recognise that a number of the reforms in the motor insurance area, such as those relating to the claims awards being made in the courts, are already being worked on by the Personal Injuries Commission and will feed into the reforms on employer's and public liability insurance. I have been consulting stakeholders in this area, including hoteliers. Deputy Tom Neville and others have brought detailed concrete information from their constituencies to help us to gain a proper understanding of this area. We have consulted hoteliers, IBEC, ISME, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland and the Health and Safety Authority. We have also received submissions from the IFA. We are, therefore, aware of the complicated issues in this area. I am worried about the increases in the excess figure being taken on by individual businesses. I am very worried about the trend towards self-insurance. I know that some businesses are withdrawing from particular parts of their activities. For example, a hotel might take out a disco from its offering because it cannot afford the insurance. This undermines the total offering of such businesses. We have received great information from businesses on what they believe is happening in respect of fraudulent claims and are trying to get harder data. As we seek proper solutions in this area, we are going to encounter some serious constitutional issues in areas such as the Statute of Limitations and the burden of proof that has to be put on a business if it is to be possible for it to successfully defend a claim against it. If a claim is made at the very end of the Statute of Limitations period of two years, a business might not have the necessary CCTV footage to hand, or it might not be able to contact its former employees who dealt with the issue at the time. We have to try to address these issues, but it will not be easy. It would not be responsible for me to say we will be able to get on top of the employer's and public liability aspects of this issue in the morning. Constitutional issues require serious consultation across the House in conjunction with the Attorney General. We are potentially looking at trying to get difficult legislation through the House. We need to make sure businesses can avail of more competition in the market. We know that people are moving out of particular areas in a way that is fundamentally undermining the operation of their businesses into the future. The practice of insurance companies using non-disclosure where it would have no bearing on a decision by an insurer to price cover at a particular level is raised in the motion. I agree that it is unacceptable for it to be used as the sole purpose for avoiding payment. Deputy Pearse Doherty has proposed some very constructive legislation in this area. We want to work on it, but it is a resource issue. We need to get to it at the right time in the committee in order that we can deal with it in an effective manner and see it through. Regarding the timelines within which we hope to report on the next phase of employer's and public liability insurance cost reforms, I want to provide as much clarity as I can, but we are reviewing what we hope to do. The intention at the beginning of the year was to have an addendum to the motor insurance report because so many issues crossed from the area of motor insurance into employer's and public liability insurance. I have had an addendum published to the existing report, but increasingly as we work on the issue of employer's and public liability insurance, we see further areas in the motor insurance sector on which we want to update data. It might be the case that in September this year we will bring forward a more comprehensive report with new parts on employer's and public liability insurance. Because I anticipate some significant legal and constitutional issues in the near term, I hope in July to give a very clear indication of the direction I would like to take and go to the Oireachtas committee to get its support in order that we can go about addressing these issues as quickly as we can. Deputy Lisa Chambers has spoken about the fact that her motor insurance premium is more expensive now than when she started to drive ten years ago. We must recognise that in the early 2000s premiums were unsustainably low. It was a failure of the business model at the time and we are now dealing with its correction. We need to move away from these super cycles in which insurance cover is priced too low and then too high. That is part of the work we are doing. Good work has already been done in that regard when we consider the solvency II related legislation. I will shortly be appearing before the Oireachtas committee when I would like to go into more detail on the issues raised in the quarterly report and return to some of the questions raised in this debate.

Action needs to be taken to address them to take the financial pressure off households. We have seen car insurance premiums rise for no apparent reason. People who own a car that is more than ten years old have struggled to have it insured. Returning emigrants who may have driven in Australia or Britain where motorists drive on the same side of the road as we do have also seen a dramatic increase in their motor insurance premiums. There is a complete lack of competition in the insurance market in seeking cover for vans and motorbikes. Elderly drivers are being pushed out of the motor insurance market purely because of their age. They are almost being forced to stop driving which would have a dramatic impact on an older person's life. The number of people who have been declined insurance cover has increased dramatically from 178 in 2012 to 1,914 last year. This morning I spoke to a constituent in Cork who had moved house across his estate and was parking his car on the opposite side of the same green and who had seen his motor insurance premium increase from €900 to €1,200.  Last summer Fianna Fáil brought forward a similar motion with constructive proposals to address spiralling insurance costs. It was six months before the working group came forward with many of the same proposals. Clear targets were set, with 40 to be met this year. However, the quarter one report shows that three of the ten action points have not been finalised. That does not show a lack of urgency but that the Government was coming late to addressing the issue and that it has fallen behind. It needs to show more urgency to drive forward on the issue to which it is coming late. Businesses are also falling behind, but I will leave it to my colleagues to address that aspect. The Government needs to show greater urgency and support for families by driving down insurance costs.

I listened to the Minister of State intently. In part, the motion was brought forward to enable us as an Opposition party to do our duty by holding the Government to account as the insurance business affects people's lives. The cost of insurance impacts on households, individuals and businesses and is crippling people. As Deputy Eugene Murphy said, it is impacting on people who are going out to work and those living in rural Ireland. When Deputy Michael McGrath tabled the motion last week, I put it up on Facebook. It is one of the few political motions I have posted and it received traction it Australia among emigrants who were thinking of returning home. They have received insurance quotes of approximately €5,800. There are skill shortages across the country and they have skills we need. We are targeting them, but they are focusing on what would it cost them to re-establish themselves here and the cost of insurance is a factor.  The Minister of State spoke about meeting those involved in the sector. A few months ago I spoke about a business located on the banks of the River Shannon. It involves a pub and a restaurant. Last year it received an insurance quote of €7,500. Because it had made a small claim, it was unable to get a quote elsewhere. There are only three providers in the market who will provide this insurance cover, as the Minister of State is well aware. The premium increased from €7,500 to €50,000 which following long discussions the business had reduced to €15,500.  It is not acceptable for the Minister of State to reject the motion merely because we are holding the Government to account. Three out of ten action points have not yet been completed. It is our role as an Opposition party to hold the Government to account. We told the people that we would be a voice for them and I was hoping we could all continue to work together.

My colleagues, led by Deputy Michael McGrath, have clearly highlighted the crippling effect of rising home, motor and business insurance costs, together with the undermining of our competitiveness. I wish to refer specifically to the undue pressure placed on community groups and the voluntary officer boards associated with them. Most Deputies have had some involvement with voluntary and community organisations throughout Ireland and will know first-hand about the issues to which I will refer. I was glad when the case taken by a hillwalker in County Wicklow against the Office of Public Works was thrown out of court. There are increasing worries and concerns about the litigious nature of society which is affecting football clubs, Tidy Town groups, scout and guide groups, just to mention a few, all of which have been impacted on by the extortionate and exorbitant hike in insurance costs. People fear that the risks for organisations are too great and, as a consequence, are becoming concerned about the level of their personal exposure. The Public Participatory Network, PPN, which represents the community and voluntary sector in each local authority area, is seriously concerned about the exposure of voluntary organisations because of the risk involved in terms of personal liability, particularly in properties such as community halls, on playing pitches and in various other places. I highlight the fact that many of these excellent voluntary organisations are picking up the slack for many Departments. Tidy Town groups are a case in point. In these instances the cost of public liability insurance should be covered by public bodies where works are agreed to with local authorities to enhance the environment and properties generally in the charge of local authorities. Insurance costs have become so prohibitive for community employment and other public schemes that the employers, namely, community employment and Pobal management committees which are voluntary are finding themselves with depleted and, in many instances, no surplus funds to manage valuable projects.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	378	I compliment Deputy Michael McGrath on bringing forward the motion. To be fair to him, he has championed this issue for many years both inside and outside the House. The contributions highlight the seriousness of the issue and the geographical spread of the Deputies raising the issue shows that it is not isolated to one particular pocket of the country. I acknowledge that the Government established a working group late last year to examine the issue, but it was late in coming to the game and acknowledging the problem in the insurance market. As a party, we published recommendations early last year and the main difference between our recommendations and those of the working group is that ours were made approximately 12 months earlier. Listening to the concluding remarks of the Minister of State and to him on Radio 1 earlier, he seemed somewhat content that the figures of the Central Statistics Office, CSO, showed that renewal premiums were static. That is not good enough.It is welcome that premiums are static but it comes on the back of an increase of 11% in 2014, of over 30% in 2015 and 12% in 2016. The progress report for the first quarter of this year indicates that three of the ten items have yet to be fully implemented. The Minister of State indicated the working group involving owners of small public vehicles has yet to meet and I understand the taxi federation has not been invited to such a meeting. It is critical those people are invited to that meeting. The Minister of State has heard many examples from my colleagues and I could add to them. There is a lady with 20 years of claims-free driving who has seen her insurance go from €400 to approximately €800. I know a man who drives a van as the second family vehicle. The family is into sports such as triathlons, and it has bikes and surfboards. He cannot get insurance for the van because it is not being operated commercially. We have seen insurance for companies increase by a huge amount over the past number of months and years. The recommendations are there and the Minister of State has said he wants us to acknowledge that he has established this group. He will not acknowledge that he is not affording this the priority it deserves. The Minister of State asks what can we do faster. We know the minority Government in this Dáil means there is a lack of legislation going through this Oireachtas over the past year. Why not prioritise the legislation that will give effect to proposals in this report. The Minister of State argues we cannot give false hope to constituents, and we should not do so, but we should say to them that while we cannot decrease premiums this year, we will accelerate the recommendations in the report and the legislative proposals arising from it to ensure that next year, they will not be crippled by the high cost of insurance. The Minister of State has sat on his hands for too long. I ask him to accept this Private Members' motion in the spirit in which we put it forward.

The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report on the Government’s compliance with the European Union’s Environmental Impact Assessment Directives and the Aarhus Convention.".Without in any way disparaging the good junior Minister, it is a shame the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is not here this evening. This is a Bill of major significance, as I know the Minister of State, Deputy English, and his officials know. At its heart is putting into effect one of the central recommendations of the Mahon tribunal into planning and zoning corruption. I would have thought, given the significance of the final reading of the Bill tonight, we should have had the principal Minister in front of us, given some of the issues we will raise. Amendments Nos. 1 and 85 are essentially related to the same matter, which I have referred to at length on Second and Committee Stages. I have a very real concern that parts of this legislation and the other amendment we made to the principal Act in last December's planning and development Bill are not in line with either the Aarhus Convention or the 2014 environmental impact assessment directive. My understanding is yesterday was the deadline for the transposition of the 2014 directive and we have missed the deadline as we have not transposed the directive. If the Minister of State has new information on that, I would be happy to hear it. I also understand the Department is considering transposing the directive by way of regulations. One of the problems with that is whereas it might mean this will not be delayed further than it has already, we will have less opportunity to scrutinise the regulations as they would only be laid before the House rather than passed as primary legislation. Given the importance of the directive and the length of time - three years - we have been waiting for it to be transposed, it is a real shame. I know the Minister of State will not support amendment No. 1, which is really an opportunity to say that notwithstanding the fact the officials and the Minister believe the Bill is in compliance with the directives and convention, we would like further scrutiny. The purpose of the amendment is to oblige the Minister to lay before the House a report at a set date to outline compliance. Amendment No. 85 is very clearly an attempt to insert into the environmental impact assessment, EIA, screening process a much more rigorous requirement for public scrutiny at the pre-screening stage rather than once an EIA has been required. My clear view is this is required under Article 6.4 of the Aarhus Convention and I will press amendment No. 85. I will put up my hand and admit amendment No. 78 is not very well drafted and I will not press it today. The purpose of putting it on the table is to raise an issue of concern. I will ask the Minister and his officials to go away, whether it is in the context of this legislation or subsequent regulations, and examine the concern. Specifically, this relates to unauthorised developments, particularly in areas where an EIA or an appropriate assessment, AA, is required, and in cases where the EIA or AA was not secured at the outset, retention planning permission could not be applied for. In principle, that is the correct approach, particularly to ensure that people who have deliberately and wilfully breached EIA or AA requirements are not able to get a second chance. There are some anomalies in the system and I have met officials to outline some of those. I hope I will hear from the Minister of State a commitment arising from recognition of the issue, and that whatever is the most appropriate way can be followed in a particular timescale. That could be through regulation or primary legislation as I am open to all of that. Amendment No. 82 deals with the relationship between the EIA screening process and planning permission extensions. I am trying to achieve two goals. The first is to give the planning authorities the opportunity to refuse an application for extension. I am also seeking to ensure that if the material, developmental and environmental circumstances differ between an original planning permission and an extension, an EIA could be required at that time. It makes no sense to give somebody planning permission without an EIA and then automatically assume, ten years on, for example, there are no changes in the environment that may require an EIA in the view of the planning authority.In this sense it is to give the planning authority the options which are not available in the current legislation. Amendments Nos. 1 and 85 relate to the Aarhus Convention and the transposition of EIA Directive 2014/52/EU, while amendment No. 78 relates to the planning anomalies in the retention of unauthorised developments in respect of EIA or AA requirements. Amendment No. 82 involves a requirement to consider in a more rounded way the need for EIAs where planning permission extensions are being secured.

This issue has been drawn to my attention in recent weeks by environmental groups, specifically the Woodland League. I know that others are also very concerned about it. I had a discussion with some of the departmental officials before we came into the House about the number of cases pending against Ireland for breaches of the EIA directives and there seemed to be some debate about how many there were. I read an article recently in which it was suggested there were 15, including five at what was called the second phase. That may or may not be true and I see the officials shaking their heads. We will come back to that issue. I do not have the command of the detail that others outside this House might have, but the point made to me about the landslide at Derrybrien, where a mountain collapsed after a windfarm had been built there, was that a case had been brought against Ireland because the developers and the planning authorities had failed to ensure proper compliance with the EIA directives. Subsequently, there were court cases, but the ruling was that we had failed to comply. Afterwards, as I understand it, a new concept was brought forward - substitute consent - to give retrospective permission, as in a retention order, for developments that were illegal and that did not fully comply with the EIA directives. In the case of Derrybrien I have legal letters which suggest that, even with the substitute consent required afterwards, the EIA directives were not fully complied with, particularly in respect of public consultation. At the heart of the original problem was the failure to comply with the requirement for public consultation and an EIA. The same was true of the substitute consent, which in itself is dodgy because it involves the retention of something that should never have happened. In this case it led to an environmental disaster. The new concept retrospectively legitimises stuff that was illegal and breached the EIA directives. In the case of Derrybrien, even the processes involved in seeking substitute consent were not complied with in murky circumstances. I do not have time to go into all of the details on this point, but it merits proper debate and I will submit parliamentary questions about it. The State and semi-State companies are planning major infrastructural developments such as contentious wind farms and other renewable energy projects, but we have not fully transposed the EIA directives into domestic legislation. We have dodgy concepts such as substitute consent to try to cover our tracks and allow these developments to go ahead without full compliance. Do not get me wrong - I am very much in favour of renewable energy projects, but big wind farms are very contentious. There are real issues about whether communities are being consulted and about the environmental impacts which were disastrous in the case of Derrybrien. This area needs to be seriously scrutinised. Apart from anything else, we could be subject to major fines, but these are controversial issues in terms of the impact on communities, engaging in proper public consultation and a proper assessment of the potential damage to the environment. There are big questions about the way we do things and suggestions that where the State or semi-State companies are doing things, there is a nod and a wink culture to get stuff through and ride roughshod over local communities and best practice that seeks to ensure the environment is not damaged.  For all of these reasons, the amendment is terribly important. We need a detailed report on the issue and a very detailed discussion and debate in this House which should be well flagged to give environmental groups and those with knowledge an opportunity to feed into the debate before it happens.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	386	It is welcome that amendment No. 85 specifies what form the consultation should take. There is a lot of box-ticking and I have spoken repeatedly about the Aarhus Convention and the right to be consulted, but it is a two-way process. Unless it is specified, it will not happen in that way. The very fact that an EIA would be required would indicate that there was a significant environmental issue at stake. I have never seen a planning application with an associated EIA which argued against the development. I have often questioned the independence of many EIAs which I have seen where it is possible to pick holes. That merits consideration on another day. In respect of amendment No. 82, if an EIA is required for a housing development, who makes the decision if it includes over 100 houses? Will it be the local authority or An Bord Pleanála when the new rules come into play?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	387	I, too, express my disappointment that the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, is not present. One could be forgiven for suspecting that the leadership contest is more important than this Bill. It could be a very important one, if things were done right. Clearly, the Minister is eager to avoid trips and falls between now and 2 June. I have a lot of respect for him, but he has made a dog's dinner of dealing with the housing crisis. Things are worse now than they were a year ago. There have been very few improvements anywhere along the line. Homes are not going up but prices are. The Government is partially responsible for this and the Minister holds a certain responsibility if he is to allow the Department to behave in the manner it is behaving. Cairn Homes and Hines Ireland control over half of the sites in the Dublin area. They have a vested interest in not building and it makes sense for them not to build. They will build bugger all in the next year or year and a half. They will build when prices have increased further. The decisions the Minister has taken are driving up prices and amount to a subsidy for developers. Builders are interested in building. It is not that there is no one to build; rather, developers have a vested interest in not building now, especially those who have sites. They are land bankers. Every time the price of housing goes up by 10%, the value of the sites on which developers are sitting goes up by a minimum of 30%. The Government can do the maths, but I can give it a breakdown of the figures. Developers would be off their heads to build because of the way the system is operating.  The Government will have to cop onto itself and start building houses. I am not asking local authority members to go out with picks and shovels and start building, but local authorities could employ builders who are not looking for a profit margin of €15,000 per unit. Some would be very happy if they cleared €5,000 on every house they built, but a developer is a different animal. The Government appears to think things will never happen unless the big boys are involved, but they do not want to build now because a climate has been created in which it does not make sense for them to build. The State has an incredible amount of land on which to build. Members of the housing committee asked Mr. Dick Brady why local authorities did not have CPO land on which to build in order to get things going. He said there was no reason in the wide earthly world to use CPOs because the State had loads of land. He told us that there was planning permission for over 20,000 units and that there was permission for multiples of that figure in zoned areas. We are now considering giving land to developers in order to encourage them to build on it. Hines Ireland and Cairn Homes alone control over half of the sites in Dublin. Why will the Government not start building social and affordable housing? I do not understand its rationale. It is neoliberal thinking. The Government seems to be bogged down in the notion that only the private sector can deliver housing. It is a case of organising builders. It is not true to say they are not available. I know loads of builders who would love to build but cannot access finance or sites. The Government could employ them to build housing units to get things moving. It is a failed policy. To whom is the Government listening? Is it listening to the lobbyists such as Cairn Homes, Hines Ireland and the CIF? It should listen to the geography department in Maynooth which makes a rational case for how the Government should operate, but that is not what it is doing. The English, as they now know, have made incredible mistakes in this area. They are not addressing them properly, but we can learn from them. However, we are not doing so. I understand why the Minister is not in the House. He was a very impressive Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and did an excellent job. He is a very capable man, one for whom I have a lot of respect, but he is not doing a good job in housing provision. For some reason or other, whether it be ideological or that he is listening to the wrong people, he is going in the wrong direction. At this stage, I can only assume that things will get worse before they get better, unless the Government chooses to take a different path. This is not rocket science. We have many problems in how we supply housing in Ireland, be it private, social, affordable or rental. We are snowed under, but the problems can be fixed. While nothing can be fixed overnight, we could start, but we are not doing that and I do not understand why.

I have nothing against the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, but on Committee Stage we had a very good and quite lengthy discussion with the Minister. It would have been useful to have had a continuation of it because some of the Government's amendments are in response to amendments tabled on Committee Stage and the Bill is complex. Even if we had to shut down at 9 p.m. for the news or whatever else, it would have been better for us to have managed the debate in that way. The ordering of business in the House is not easy and we are where we are. I support Deputy Eoin Ó Broin's amendments which would appropriately strengthen the environmental assessment process and engagement with the public, with particular reference to the Aarhus Convention in his first amendment in terms of how we are implementing it in quite an extensive revision of the 2001 Act. It is right and appropriate to include in the Bill a six-month check. The later amendments are correct in proposing to strengthen the powers of environmental impact assessment systems, consult people and provide information in a more upfront and transparent way, which is at the heart of the Aarhus Convention process. As I understand them, we will be able to support amendments Nos. 83 and 84 which seek to ensure the Government would retain fees from a developer in making an application in appropriate circumstances and to provide for more public information on an application in the screening process when it has to be decided whether an environmental impact assessment is allowed. I am interested in hearing the response of the Minister on the intent of these two amendments. It seems that they are reasonable and progressive. I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister to amendments Nos. 1, 82 and 85 which are worthy of support.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	389	It is regrettable that the Minister is not here. I have been a public representative in various guises for 20 years and, like every other Member, I have never had to deal with such a crisis in housing provision in the State. It is a fact that rather than getting nearer to the solutions, the issues are getting harder. Whether it is people in work who cannot afford rent or to buy or whether they are people who would normally be covered by our social housing provision, there is nothing there for them. For years now, we have had desperate people coming to us and the answer has been that there is nothing there for them. It is a consequence of Government policy, which we do not say lightly. The proof is in the reality. The policies which are being put forward now are not only not addressing the problem, but they are actually adding to it and making it worse. We need a new direction. The Bill before us was supposed to implement the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal which was established on foot of serious enough problems as it was with planning corruption. In fact, it does not address any of those things and, in that sense, is a missed opportunity. We now have a new form of colonialism in Ireland with the country having been sold to vulture funds. The citizens are like modern day slaves who cannot get any security of tenure. It is really regrettable. Like Deputy Wallace said, I understand fully why the Minister is not here. Deputy Coveney's leadership quest will probably not be served well by being associated with this debacle, which is not all his fault or anything like it, being a consequence of Government policy. It is an issue with which we are not dealing appropriately. As to the amendments in the grouping, I record my support in particular for amendments Nos. 82 and 85 in the name of Deputy Ó Broin. I recognise the good work done by the Irish Environmental Network and other community and voluntary organisations which have been to the forefront in demanding accountability in planning and the implementation of our obligations under the Aarhus Convention and addressing democracy in environmental issues. That is what these provisions do, in particular amendment No. 85 which deals with public participation in screening decisions for EIAs and compliance with the Aarhus Convention. This is very important and should be specified in the Bill, in particular given the late transposition of the EIA directive yesterday, but also because one will get better outcomes in planning if one negotiates and consults early on. Quite apart from the fact that it is a legislative requirement, one will have much more robust decision-making if one engages with people at an early stage. It is very worrying that we have not enacted provisions which could be proven in court to be obligations under the Aarhus Convention. Last week, we saw in a reply to Deputy Eamon Ryan on the new runway at Dublin Airport that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said he was not going to have any formal public consultation on the transposition of the new EU regulation in the context of noise at the airport. However, that is a requirement under the Aarhus Convention. As such, it is entirely appropriate that it is reinforced here. As such, I support amendment No. 85 as well as amendment No. 82, which is a proposal to rescreen for EIA and AA before any extension of duration. They are very important amendments from a democratic perspective and would lead to much more robust planning.

However, the Minister is doing an excellent job and I do not agree with the views expressed opposite in that regard. As Deputy Daly said, housing is the biggest issue facing us every day as Deputies. I have people coming to me every day. Nowadays, children are eight years old before they have any hope of getting their own homes. I agree absolutely that families have had very difficult times in moving from place to place with no choice of home available and having to pay exorbitant rents. Some are not subject to rent control while others are, and it is a huge and appalling vista that has been visited on this country as a result of its economic collapse. However, the Government is dealing with it. In particular, I praise the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister of State, Deputy English, for all of the work they are doing at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government. I travel a fair bit and the fact is that construction of houses is starting everywhere one goes in the country. There is a huge increase in the number of new starts. While it takes time to build a home, there is a very significant commitment in respect, in particular, of the provision of social housing by 2020. That is at the heart of the disadvantage people are suffering. I refer to one of the points Deputy Wallace made with which I do not agree. While I accept that there are builders who are hoarders and exploiting the economic situation for their own advantage, there are other excellent builders who are ready to go. In Drogheda where I live, a commencement notice was served in respect of 1,500 houses which are due to start very shortly.

My point is that there are builders who are committed to building and they face planning difficulties. It is right and proper in my view that the Government and the Department facilitate transparent success in planning permissions that may have been given some years ago but which may not yet have been taken up where builders are genuinely ready to go. That is a huge problem. Thousands of houses are being held up around the country on foot of planning technicalities. It is not that permission was not given in the first place, but that the permissions have run out before the funding to finish the houses has become available. That is why the legislation is very important. I thank the Acting Chairman for listening to me so kindly. Other Members made the point that we must build houses, but there are over 160,000 empty homes in this country. In Dublin alone, there are over 31,000 empty homes. Keys are not being turned in front doors and bedrooms are not being slept in because there are no families in those houses. While it is not a provision in this particular Bill, part of the process must be a tax on empty homes which are not principal private residences to bring them into commission for families. That is what is happening in other jurisdictions and it is what needs to happen here. I support the ministerial amendments.

I support Deputy Ó Broin's amendments, in particular those on the Aarhus Convention. I refer in particular to his amendment seeking to provide for a report on compliance with the convention. One of the problems with planning in Ireland is that the public are not generally aware of their rights to information and to comment. Only a small sector of the population takes an interest in these matters. One of the main functions of the planning regulator is going to be an educational one. There is a need to ensure that the legislation complies with the Aarhus Convention. We have had other amending legislation on planning in the lifetime of the Dáil. I support the amendments proposed by Deputy Ó Broin.

It is very clear the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is committed to the Bill and has been for a long time. There has been much debate in the House at various Stages and there was a lengthy discussion on it on Committee Stage. There has been lots of feedback and sharing of data and information with our officials and a lot of toing and froing. Nobody can complain they have not had proper access and discussion on the Bill. There is a full commitment by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Department to get this right. There has been ample consultation. There are some issues with the Bill which we are still prepared to take another look at in the Seanad. It is not over yet. It would be wrong of people to try a different spirit. There was a really good attempt to work together on the Bill, and that has happened. I would rather if people did not say just because the Minister is missing for an hour or two that there is some inference in it. He hopes to join the discussion at some stage. It is just one of those days when the diary takes over. He will be in at some stage, all going well. It is not that he wants to dodge the issues. He is very front and centre when it comes to planning and housing. Other Ministers might be happy to dodge or hide-----

Trying to say he is not here so he will not be associated with it is a bit silly because he is very much associated with it and very much on the record and very public about all issues when it comes to planning and housing. Sometimes it would be better if he was not, but he very clearly is, so do not try to say he is dodging any issues. That would be the wrong approach and Deputies know it is not true because it is not something he does, and we will leave it at that. Amendments Nos. 1, 78 and 82 to 85, inclusive, which generally relate to environmental impact assessments have been grouped together for discussion. There is an issue with amendment No. 81, which we will deal with later. I will address the Opposition amendments in this grouping and then the Government amendments. Amendment No. 1 proposes to introduce a requirement that within six months following the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas regarding the Government's compliance with the environmental impact assessment directive and the Aarhus Convention. While on the face of it this amendment may seem to have merit, we must oppose it on a number of grounds. The Aarhus Convention does not have direct application in Ireland. Rather, it is implemented at EU level by a number of EU directives, namely, EU Directive 2003/35/EC on public participation and access to justice in certain environmental matters, and EU Directive 2011/92/EU on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment, commonly referred to as the EIA directive. Directive 2014152/EU, the 2014 EIA directive, amends the 2011 directive. Therefore, it is not appropriate to include a direct reference to the Aarhus Convention in primary legislation. These EU directives have been transposed into Irish legislation and are fully reflected not only in the planning code, but also in other relevant non-planning related legislative codes, which fall under the responsibility of other Ministers and Departments. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for one Minister to report on matters that are within the remit of a number of other Ministers. We oppose the amendment as I believe it is unnecessary to provide for it in primary legislation. Like all ministerial office holders, those at the Department are answerable to both Houses of the Oireachtas for policy and legislative matters that come under our remit. There are existing processes in place to facilitate this and we see no need to provide for it in primary legislation. Amendment No. 78 proposes to amend section 34 of the principal Act by the insertion of a new subsection 12AA to introduce an EIA screening mechanism in the consideration of an application for retention permission. Section 34 of the Act provides for the making of an application to a planning authority for permission for development consent, and that permission may be granted with or without conditions or may be refused as it contains other related provisions. While section 34 already provides that an application may be made to a planning authority for permission to retain an unauthorised development, it does place a particular restriction on a planning authority when considering such an application. In this regard, section 34(12) states that if the application for permission for the development was made before it was commenced, and where the application would have required an EIA, a determination as to whether an EIA was required, or an appropriate assessment, then the authority must refuse to consider the application. Where the authority refuses to consider an application in these circumstances, it is then open to the applicant to pursue the matter under the existing procedures for substitute consent under Part XA of the principal Act, in which case an application must be made to An Bord Pleanála seeking leave to apply for substitute consent in the first instance. Conversely, if the authority decides with regard to a particular application for retention permission that an EIA, a determination as to whether an EIA was required, or an appropriate assessment would not have been required if the application had been made prior to commencement, then it may consider the application for retention of unauthorised development. As the planning code already provides a robust mechanism for considering an application for retention permission, either under section 34 or Part XA as may be appropriate, we consider the amendment proposed is not necessary. I understand the background to what Sinn Féin has proposed and we will look at this again with regard to what the Deputy said earlier. I know he has been in discussion with the officials. We will look at it and go through it, and we can deal with it in the Seanad. We are open to examining the substitute consent provisions under exceptional circumstances. I know what the Deputy is trying to bring forward, and if he is happy enough to do so we will deal with it in the Seanad. He has indicated he probably is and that is fair enough. Amendment No. 82, also tabled by Deputy Ó Broin, proposes a number of amendments to the extension of the duration of planning permission under section 42 of the Planning Act 2000. These were also discussed on Committee Stage last month. During the passage of the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016 just before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, proposed a number of amendments to section 42 provisions, which were approved by the Oireachtas at that time. Notably, one of the amendments inserted a new provision that any developments that require an EIA or appropriate assessment at the time of the original permission will not qualify for an extension of duration to the planning permission. This will apply on developments where substantial work has been completed and developments where work has not commenced. The condition is necessary to avoid an extension of time being granted for developments where, for whatever reason, an EIA or appropriate assessment was required at the time the original permission. However, the first three elements of amendment No. 82 propose to go further than this, and have the collective effect of requiring that an application for either first or second extension of the permission may be granted only where the planning authority undertakes an EIA or appropriate assessment screening and determines that neither such assessment is required. We consider this goes beyond what is required in these circumstances and what was approved by the Oireachtas only a few months ago. The last element of amendment No. 82 proposes to delete section 42(8) as inserted by the 2016 Act. This subsection provides that the duration of a planning permission for a strategic housing development may be extended only where substantial works have been carried out during the period of the original permission.

The purpose of the provision is aimed at incentivising developers who obtain planning permission for strategic housing developments through the new bespoke streamlined procedures to commence work on the developments concerned sooner rather than later and well before the permission expires rather than sit and hoard their sites. Therefore, we must also oppose the amendment. Deputy Ó Broin's amendment No. 85 proposes to amend section 176A of the Act of 2000 as inserted by the 2016 Act. The purpose of the amendment is to include mandatory public participation in the EIA screening process to be carried out by planning authorities and the board under the new EIA screening provisions introduced in 2016 Act. We oppose the amendment because public participation for screening purposes is not a requirement of the EIA directive, either the 2011 version of the directive or the 2014 amending directive, and there is already provision for public participation in processing substantive applications for development consent. Instead, the EIA directive, in its 2011 and 2014 versions, require a screening determination shall be made available to the public, and this is already provided for in section 176B(5) and 176C(9). As I will outline shortly, Government amendment No. 84 firms up the provisions in section 176C(9). In this connection, I do not see the point of having separate public participation processes for intermediary stages of the planning process that proceed the substantial planning application and an environmental assessment process. Therefore, I oppose the amendment. Government amendments Nos. 83 and 84 arise from Committee Stage amendments proposed by Deputy Ó Broin. During the discussion the Minister, Deputy Coveney, accepted the principle of the Deputy's amendments and indicated he would consider the legal and drafting aspects and would table amendments on Report Stage. Amendment No. 83 amends section 176A of the 2000 Act, as inserted by the 2016 Act, and makes provisions for screening for environmental impact assessment on application to a planning authority. Section 176A sets out the detail and documentation to be included in such a screening application and further material for inclusion in an application may also be restricted. It also provides that a planning authority may reject an application if it is incomplete in any material way or in such case it provides the planning authority will return the application and the fee detailing the reason for its rejection.As it will be absolutely clear to an applicant what is required in an EIA screening application, there is no reason the applicant should be refunded the application fee if relevant material is omitted from the application. The onus is on the applicant to ensure that he or she submits an application that complies with the requirements of the Act and the regulations. This amendment proposes to remove the requirement of the planning authority to return the fee in a case where it rejects an application that is incomplete in any material way and will incentivise the submission of properly completed screening applications by concerned individuals. I hope the House will accept that because I believe it is common sense. In short, amendment No. 84 relates to new section 176C of the 2000 Act inserted by the 2016 Act, which makes provision for a review or a referral of screening for environmental impact assessment for determination by the board. Subsections (8), (9) and (10) outline the notification provisions which apply to the determination by the board in this regard. Amendment No. 84 as now proposed clarifies that when the board makes a determination on an EIA screening referral, the board must publish it along with the main reasons and considerations for the determination on its website, supplemented by a notice advising that the determination may be subject to judicial review. The amendment further requires the board to maintain a record of its determinations and make them available on its website while also making them available for purchase and inspection during office hours, contrary to the current discretionary provisions. Deputy Murphy asked who makes the decision. It is the relevant planning authority so if it is more than 100 houses it would be An Bord Pleanála when the legislation kicks in. That is in regard to the EIS requirement as opposed to that of the EIA. Some other questions were raised. Deputy Wallace is of the opinion that the Minister is going about this the wrong way and that not enough is being done. I do not believe he is going about it the wrong way. As a Department we are making the right decisions. I agree with him that we would like to be able to do more and, accordingly, as we can access funding we will do more but it takes time to ramp up the system and all the trends around commencement notices, planning permissions, the number of sites that are opened and activity on them indicate that things are improving. As I said, we wish they could improve overnight but the Deputy was in the game of construction and he understands how it works. We cannot turn it on overnight, despite all the interventions we try to make, but we will activate sites, make lands available and try to access more funds. We are doing all that. We are trying to speed up the planning permission process. The Deputy makes the point about using our land to build houses. There is a commitment of over €5.5 billion of taxpayers' money to build houses and as more money becomes available we will try to do that, and we will work with the Deputy on that. This House agrees that, at a minimum, €5.5 billion is the correct amount. More might be done by future Governments when they can get access to the money. At the first opportunity we were able to access more funding the Minister, Deputy Coveney, made the business case through the action plan for housing, which built on the work of the housing committee, and secured the extra billions required to make this happen. The money is available and we are ramping up the projects. With regard to the land, last week we heard of the mapping idea and that the State owns 5,000 acres of land, and probably more because there are some sites we cannot fully trace but we will find them eventually. We are saying those sites are available for the reasons the Deputy outlined not just for the big builders he referred to, but for anybody who wants to engage with a local authority to see how to activate those lands. We recognise that we cannot provide the funds today for the local authorities to build all those 50,000 houses on that 5,000 acres, and it could be more than 50,000 houses. That is a reasonable medium density approach. We are saying that the land is available. We have asked local authorities to make that land available to people who want to build a small number of houses, who would consider using affordable houses, build to rent and all the mixed tenure approaches. That is what we are asking local authorities to do. They are the ones that generally own these lands, and about 750 of these sites. The other 50 belong to the State and the Housing Agency. About 30 sites belong to other State players but we are saying that this land can be used to build houses. The Deputy spoke about creating competition. That creates competition, and it sends out a message to people who want to hoard other private sites that public sites can be used to build houses. That is what we intend to do, and we will drive that forward. I think the Deputy would agree with that concept and the idea is to make it happen as quickly as we possibly can. We need to be able to find all the sites so that the Deputy and anybody else can decide on the sites they want to build on. I understand not everyone agrees with that concept, and that is fair enough, but we believe it is a good approach to try to activate these lands and get them built on much quicker, and that is what we will try to do.

I am very surprised that the 2014 EIA directive is now fully transposed. I would be happy to have any additional information the Minister can give us about that because it had not been fully transposed when we met on Committee Stage. Have statutory instruments or regulations been introduced? What has been the mechanism for its transposition or was that a mistake in the Minister's opening remarks?

On the Aarhus Convention, and it is the one point I will make, we are a signatory to it so it does have relevance to this legislation. Article 6.4 of the Aarhus Convention makes it very clear that each party shall provide for early public participation when all options are open so if the Minister excludes public participation from the very opening stage of the EIA screening, he will not be compliant with Article 6.4 of the Aarhus Convention. I suspect that is the real reason the Minister is not willing to consider amendment No. 1. We are not compliant with it. We are a signatory to this treaty and we are simply not living up to it. With regard to amendment No. 85, my real concern is that if the Minister does not consider amendment No. 85 or some version of it he will be in contravention of the EIA directive 2014 when it comes to the transposition of that and on those grounds I will be pressing both amendments Nos. 1 and 85.

First, the right to be consulted is meaningless unless the Minister sets out how that consultation will happen. It has been my experience that it is very much a box ticking exercise and it is regrettable that this is not being expanded. Second, with regard to the extension of duration, it appears as if there will be no re-screening of an environmental impact assessment and that there can be changes in standards. If that is the standard we are setting out, we are excluding any changes in standards that might happen in the period between the planning permission being granted and an extension of duration. That is not good practice.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	424	On that first key issue about our interaction with the Aarhus Convention, if I heard the Minister correctly, we do not bring it into our own legislation; it is in effect a European jurisdiction. I question that. There is a number of other instances where I will be looking to bring European Union directives into our legislation directly but as a convention which we have signed up to, I thought it would have legal effect. On Committee Stage we said we could not refer within legislation to a plan which does not have legislative form. I accept that point and we have withdrawn our amendments in that regard. The second reason the Minister seemed to give was that because it was the responsibility of a number of Ministries to implement it, it would be inappropriate for the Minister to take on overriding responsibility for the management of the implementation of the Aarhus Convention. At its centre it is about public engagement in planning and therefore I thought it was right that this Bill, and this Minister, would have the responsibility of putting an agreed legislative check on our implementation of that convention. I am surprised by the argument that because it is an international convention it is beyond our legislative remit, if I am interpreting the Minister's earlier comments. I would prefer if the Minister would accept the amendment because I think it is appropriate.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	429	Too often, we have a lot of loose legislation stating the Minister "may" do this or that. Not often enough do we state a Minister "shall" do this or that. Unless we make firm decisions and put them in legislation, we will, too often, not see the right thing done. This is because those making decisions will have too much wriggle room to do what we would prefer they did not do. To address the Minister of State's point on funding, am I to understand he is struggling with funding and that there is not as much available as he would like? On the point he made about allowing State land to be used to be built upon by builders, I agree 100% with getting builders to build on State land. What I do not agree with is getting developers to do it who will make a developer's profit on top of everything else. The Minister of State might answer my question on funding. I did not realise the position and do not quite understand it. I acknowledge there are challenges. Is there a challenge in getting funding as quickly as the Government would like?

It is because the Government essentially wants the flexibility to ram through big infrastructural projects without having them properly screened. I would like clarity from the officials because they said there are not 15 cases. A document by environmental consultants in Waterford states:There are currently 15 cases being taken against Ireland. Of these 5 could be considered to be at Stage Two. These are;- Failure to regulate septic tanks [...].- Failure to ensure that Environmental Impact Assessments are carried out on various agriculture and fish farming projects.- Failure to implement the Birds Directive with respect to the designation of SPAs [...].- Failure to implement the Habitats Directive.- Failure to require EIAs for particular projects and the facilitation of Planning Retentions which are seen as undermining the effectiveness of the EIA Directive. I am sure that, in making the latter point, the consultants are referring to the famous substitute consent. I have to hand a letter from the Director-General for Energy of the European Commission, Dominique Ristori. It is dated 2015 so perhaps there is an update on it. It states our national renewable energy action plan is not compliant with the Aarhus Convention, according to the Aarhus Convention Compliance Committee. This relates to many of these big infrastructural renewable energy projects. We saw what happened in Derrybrien. There was supposed to be legislative change to do something about that. The question is whether there was, but the signs are there was not. Interestingly, in the case we had in Dún Laoghaire, An Bord Pleanála allowed a development in Dún Laoghaire Harbour and when we engaged in a judicial review against that decision, it pulled out of the case. It withdrew the case. Even An Bord Pleanála was failing in its full application of the environmental impact assessment. When faced with a judicial review, it had to pull out. That tells one a lot.

We are compliant with it. Our job is to respond to the directives and implement them. That is what we do. As a planning authority, the Department reckons we do not need this amendment. We are implementing the directives; that is our job. The Deputy will keep arguing that we are not implementing them. This will continue to arise. I have listened to the argument for years. We are confident we are in line with the directives connected to the Aarhus Convention. That is our job as a planning Department. We will continue to do that. I acknowledge Deputy Ó Broin wants to press his amendment. That is grand; the Deputy should go ahead and we will continue with the debate afterwards. We are confident, however, that we are compliant. With regard to the funding, the issue is revamping a system, including for social housing provision. It was locked down and closed down before the recession kicked in. Decisions were made at that time to reduce the capacity of local authorities to build social housing. We are putting that capacity back into the system. We are reinstating the capacity, including by increasing the number of personnel and making a very clear direction to local authorities that they should get back in the business of leading the charge for the provision of social housing. What we are saying about our commitment is that we will see the 47,000 houses. The lands we put up last week could accommodate at least 50,000 houses and probably many more. If one had a chance, one would squeeze a few more onto some of the sites. Therefore, there is great potential. We are saying the capacity in the system is not such as to realise it straight away. For this reason, I am asking that we make the sites available, for two reasons. First, we believe it is right to have mixed tenure. The Deputy would agree with that. We do not believe there should be social housing alone on the sites. Rather, there should be mixed tenure across the board. The Department believes in that very strongly and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, believes in it very strongly with a view to developing communities that are sustainable and function quite well. That is what we are trying to do. This is a common approach around the world and one we should do better here. We have not done it for years. With regard to funding, the funding would not be in place tomorrow to build 50,000 houses on the lands. We will set out our funding over the next three or four years. We are tying to use the State-owned lands in a clever way not to make millions for any developer, but in a proper, managed way that gives value to the taxpayer and delivers a more affordable house to people of all abilities to pay. That is what we will use the lands for, and it makes sense. It is not that there is a shortage of funding tomorrow. To use all the land and get all the houses built, we believe it is best to involve all the people who want to come in with us in joint ventures or through a leasing or licensing arrangement.

accordance with those sections in relation to a matter contained in the plan which is referred to in a notice under subsection (3).(b) If a part of a plan proposed to be replaced under section 12, 13 or 20 contains a matter that corresponds to any matter contained in that plan which is referred to in a notice under subsection (3), that part shall not, save where subsection (17) applies, cease to have effect in respect of that matter.(7) No later than 2 weeks after receipt of the notice issued by the Planning Regulator under subsection (3), the manager of the planning authority shall publish notice of the draft direction in at least one newspaper circulating in the area of the development plan or local area plan, as the case may be, which shall state—(a) the reasons for the draft direction,(b) that a copy of the draft direction may be inspected at such place or places as are specified in the notice during such period as may be so stated (being a period of not more than 2

considers appropriate directions issued under subsection (16).”.”. I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In section 1.14 of the Mahon tribunal findings, it states:with regard to enforcement, the Tribunal is concerned that recent changes in the planning system have resulted in an over-centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister for the Environment which is not subject to sufficient checks and balances. Consequently, the Tribunal is recommending that the Minister for the Environment's ability to give directions to Regional Authorities and Local Planning Authorities should be entrusted to a Planning Regulator.Furthermore, section 1.15 states:While the Planning Regulator should assume some of the Minister for the Environment's existing role in relation to enforcement, the Tribunal considers that his or her role should not be confined to this. In particular, the Tribunal is recommending that the Regulator should also be entrusted with the power to investigate possible systemic problems in the planning system, including those raising corruption risks, with the aim of making recommendations to address those problems.The Department's regulatory impact analysis also states:The Final Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Matters and Payments (also known as the Mahon Tribunal), which was published in March 2012, recommended the establishment of an Independent Planning Regulator, who could assume certain planning oversight functions of the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Governments and who could also be charged with carrying out investigations into systematic problems in the planning system together with conducting research, education and training. This recommendation was accepted in principle. The regulatory impact analysis goes on to point to the fact that the Mahon tribunal's findings in this regard were in all likelihood influenced by section 31 of the principal Act when it states:The small number of instances in which a Minister has invoked the powers of direction available under Section 31 of the 2000 Act to direct a planning authority in respect of forward plans, including the majority of those arising under one Minister, is likely to have informed the Tribunal in making this recommendation.The Bill leaves all this power in place. Even to pretend that this legislation addresses or implements the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal is an insult to that body of work and to our intelligence. The provisions in Schedule 1 do not transfer these powers away from the Minister, so amendments Nos. 2 and 3 here address this deficiency in the Bill. These amendments must be incorporated in the Bill in order for the main Mahon tribunal recommendation on planning to be addressed. The majority of our following amendments refer back to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 as if they have been incorporated into the Bill. If they are not accepted, then in essence all the legislation allows for is the establishment of an advisory body, not a regulator. The regulator in reality will still be the Minister, which is the situation that the Mahon tribunal condemned with regard to planning enforcement and regulation. Amendment No. 16, coupled with the next four proposed by Deputy Eamon Ryan, with which we very much agree, will also be essential if we are to uphold the spirit of the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. In section 1.09, the tribunal states that both the National Development Plan and the National Spatial Strategy:play a key role in the planning system. However, neither has a statutory basis and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government (the "Minister for the Environment") enjoys considerable discretion in determining their scope and content. The Tribunal recommends that both of those instruments be placed on a statutory footing. The relevant statutes should specify the procedure for adopting and/or reviewing those instruments and make provision for public consultation when carrying out those procedures. In addition, the Oireachtas should approve the adoption of both the NDP and NSS.It is noted that the NDP and to a lesser extent the NSS are not in play any more and that the national planning framework, NPF, is more relevant now, but it is clear that in order to avoid political interference and potential corruption, the planning regulator's role should be to ensure that local and regional authorities are in line with these more descriptive plans and objectives, such as the NPF.As Deputy Ryan proposes, it should also be in line with the national transition objective established in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act, the water framework directive, EU directives on air quality and the floods directive. The provision "Policies and objectives for the time being of the Government" and the other provisions allowed for in section 31S(1)(a) and (b) will allow for the kind of short-termism, short-sightedness and political expediency that led to the disastrous, unco-ordinated and reckless planning that we have seen for the past 25 years. The role of the planning regulator should be to make sure that our planning authorities are making decisions and carrying out their functions in line with term objectives, environmental legislation and agreed national and regional plans that have already had their political input inserted into them. In the way the legislation stands, apart from the fact that the regulator will have no teeth, the regulations will ensure that planning authorities must stay in line or change with the wind based on whatever is politically or economically expedient. As the Mahon tribunal has shown, these two latter categories have little to do with the public interest. Like most of our amendments, amendments Nos. 22 to 26, inclusive, and amendment No. 33 serve to remove political interference and ensure that the office of the regulator is truly independent, is actually a regulator and is not just a powerless advisory body making recommendations that the Minister may or may not do anything about depending on what he or she feels like. Amendments Nos. 34 to 36, inclusive, are all to do with ensuring that this legislation sets up a regulator and not an adviser. They seek to end the situation that the Mahon tribunal condemned, namely, the provision in section 31 of the principal Act by which special powers of veto and enforcement lie in the hands of the Minister of the day. The amendments also attempt to curtail the interference of the Minister of the day. Section 31AO(2)(e) basically allows the Minister to direct the regulator in accordance with whatever it pleases. The office must endeavour to ensure that in its function of compiling submissions, observations, recommendations or reports regarding notices from planning authorities of a proposal seeking to make, amend or revoke a local area plan, it addresses, "such other matter as a Minister may prescribe under section 262 or otherwise prescribe". Section 262(2) states, "regulations under this Act may contain such incidental supplemental and consequential provisions as appear to the Minister to be necessary or expedient".

If they were not grouped, we would be getting seven minutes on each of them. It is really hard to put all of them together and deal with them in any way comprehensively. The Bill is being put in place because we are supposed to be implementing the recommendations of the Mahon tribunal. As Deputy Wallace said, instead of addressing one of Judge Mahon's key concerns, which was the over-centralisation of power in the hands of the Minister, what this Bill is doing is not only not checking that power, but actually intensifying the concentration of power in the Minister's hands. As Deputy Wallace said, the judge advocated for the establishment of an independent planning regulator. This Bill outlines a regulator that has its hands bound and that has not been given all of the necessary powers to play a truly independent role. Of particular concern is the fact, as identified in the regulatory impact assessment published by the Department in regard to the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2015, that the wide powers given to the Minister under the 2000 Act have not been curtailed. The tribunal, let us remember, recommended that those powers held by the Minister around regional planning guidelines, development plans and presumably local area plans should transfer in full to a new independent planning regulator. This Bill does not do that. That is what this group of amendments seeks to do in one way or another in order to give the planning regulator the teeth to be able to do the job that Judge Mahon felt that the regulator should do to avoid the catastrophic consequences of the bad planning that took place in the past. We had our first national spatial strategy in 2002. It was a great idea in theory. However, due to its flexibility and weakness and due to the 2002 planning Act brought in shortly afterwards, it became a cog in what was afterwards called the growth machine, by which sustainable planning was thrown out the door in return for massive rezonings and massive building at all costs without any adequate oversight. The legacy of that is the ghost estates, the people living in crumbling housing developments miles from public transport services who are reliant on cars, traffic in urban areas and all the rest of the consequences that we are now dealing with. Given the weakness and flexibility of the national spatial strategy, which actually became subordinate to political and economic interests, the proposed sections 31S(1)(a) and (b) of the principal Act are of very serious concern to us. That is why we have tabled amendment No. 16. Those paragraphs bind the office of the planning regulator in performing its functions to have regard to the policies and objectives, "for the time being of the Government", which means the political whim of Government. In actual fact, what it should be taking account of is exactly the list of things that Deputy Ryan listed in his amendment, which would make far more appropriate issues for the regulator to have regard to, such as reducing carbon emissions, improving air quality, EU floods directives and so on. That is what the regulator should be obliged to deal with rather than the political pet projects of the day. In the provisions in section 31AM around the local development plans, which we are amending in our amendments Nos. 33 to 36, inclusive, what the Government is doing is giving the regulator the power to shake its head. Big deal. The regulator will be able to tut tut and say that it is not really sure about this or that. The Minister would simply be able to respond by saying, "Are you not? Tough. What are you going to do about it? It is my call at the end of the day." On Committee Stage, the Minister said that just because there is a regulator does not mean that we are going to end corruption and that it would be better to have a Minister in charge who is at least accountable to the people at the end of the day. He said he was open to looking at this. I do not think anybody is naive enough to think that just because it is a planning regulator and not a politician that it immediately removes any sort of threat or influence of corruption. That would be utterly ridiculous. However, an independent body armed with teeth has been proven to be a far better measure of that than any other alternative. That is what we are trying to do in this set of amendments. The sorry mess of the 2000s that we are now in was down to growth at any cost and down to certain elements of society enriching themselves at any cost. The political powers that be did not only not stop them, but actually put fuel on the fire because of the inordinate influence of that sector of society on the economy. In that sense, a Minister would be more susceptible than an independent regulator. What we are trying to do is put somebody in place who would challenge the political ideology of neoliberalism, which is really about growth at all costs and to hell with the consequence. Those are precisely the types of policies that have resulted in homelessness, spiralling house prices, the driving up of rents and so on. As we have not got the checks in this legislation, what should be a progressive Bill is not really fit for purpose. On Second Stage, the Minister talked about Rebuilding Ireland and the fundamental legislative reforms that are necessary. Over the past year or so, there has been an obsessive insistence on removing imaginary roadblocks in the planning process to speed up development. That is the name of the game. However, that is actually not the problem. At the time Rebuilding Ireland was published, permission was in place for 27,000 shovel-ready homes in Dublin alone. Just 4,809 of those units, or 18%, actually went under construction. According to the audit carried out by the Department in 2010, there was a total of more than 3,300 ha of undeveloped residentially-zoned land within the four Dublin local authorities.At conservative levels, it is enough to build well over 100,000 houses. Zoned land is not the problem. They are probably shovel-ready, but they are not being built. They are there, and many of them have planning approval, but they are not being built. We do not need fast-track planning. It is not a necessity. We need to unlock some of those things by the measures precisely outlined by Deputy Wallace earlier.

In some sense, these amendments go to the very heart of this legislation and the debates and disagreements Members have had on Second Stage and Report Stage. One thing that has frustrated me since the introduction of this legislation is notwithstanding the very considerable work by the officials and the Minister and notwithstanding the disagreement I and those of us on the committee have had, almost nobody else knows about it. Here we have legislation that is attempting to put in place an institution of huge importance. It is not just the view of the people here; it is the view of the Mahon tribunal and of those of us who followed it. For a whole set of reasons such as the technical nature of the Bill and the political events taking place outside on any given day, there is no real public awareness or scrutiny of what this Bill is about to do. I said on Second Stage that we wanted to support this Bill. We will not oppose it, weak and all as it is. I would much prefer to be here supporting the kind of Bill Deputies Wallace and Clare Daly are trying to introduce. When we had this argument on Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, made a very revealing remark. Since he is not present, it would be good to hear some of his words here. I will quote him so at least he can be on the record, albeit quoted by me. After we had this discussion on precisely the issue Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace have outlined, he stated:What appears to be under discussion here is who will be the appropriate body or person to make the intervention to correct a wrong. Should it be the Minister or the independent regulator? It is absolutely the fundamental issue in the discussion we are having. The answer to the question should not rest with me or other Deputies in the Chamber; it should rest with the Mahon tribunal's recommendations. It is why the tribunal was set up. It is why it pored over all of the information it did. Its recommendations are clear in terms of where it falls on the Minister's choice between the Minister and the independent regulator. As for its key phrases, Deputies Wallace and Daly quoted the full section of the report and I will give the example of the planning corruption in Quarryvale in my constituency. To this day, communities are still living with the negative consequences of bad and corrupt decisions at central and local government. The tribunal's recommendations stated there was an over-centralisation of power with the Minister, there were not adequate checks and balances and the ability to give directions to regional authorities and local planning authorities should be entrusted to the regulator. The answer to the question posed by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is very simple. The Mahon tribunal wanted it not with the Minister or Department, but with an independent planning regulator with teeth. What frustrates me most about these debates is that legislation is about to be enacted - assuming Fianna Fáil votes with the Government on these amendments and mine that are attempting to achieve the same effect - and we will have a regulator that is not independent, has no powers and continues to allow the decisions to be made by the Minister rather than by the independent regulator. What does this amount to? It is an absolute betrayal of both the spirit and intention of the Mahon tribunal recommendations. There is simply no way one can say it is anything other than the very opposite of what the Mahon tribunal recommended.  I did not come here to make a Second Stage speech but it is such a fundamental part of what this debate is about that it has to be named as clearly as possible. I urge the Government to reconsider its decision to continue the over-centralisation of power with the Minister and to reconsider its decision not to introduce the checks and balances the Mahon tribunal made. If the Government will not accept the amendment proposed by Deputies Daly and Wallace or my amendments in the grouping after next, will it come back when the Bill is before the Seanad with something that is true to the Mahon tribunal? Otherwise the passing of this legislation will be an absolute waste of everybody's time in terms of this core recommendation. It is not what the officials have slaved over the legislation for. It is not what we have spent hours on either in committee or in here on Second Stage and Report Stage. On this one issue, the Government needs to rethink its unwillingness to implement the Mahon tribunal faithfully. On that basis, I fully support the recommendations.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	441	I will pick up on the last point on the Mahon tribunal. One of the central issues is a powerful, independent planning regulator. Many of the criticisms of tribunals were on the basis that they cost a fortune and there is never a consequence. Not only is there not a consequence for people who are found to be corrupt in many cases, but there is an inability to learn lessons. We will repeat exactly the mistakes that were made in the past. When I see a Bill called a planning and development Bill, the word "development" screams off the page to me because it is primarily about development. I was trying to get my head around the coherence of this legislation and the legislation that was passed just before Christmas when there was public attention on it. It was very inadequate because the planning aspects of it were very much tied in with the rent pressure zone aspects of the legislation. It redistributed power away from individual members of the public to An Bord Pleanála in the case of housing developments of more than 100 houses, which will prove to be a disaster. In terms of planning legislation, the coherence of this comes from a particular philosophy, which is to make it as easy as possible to get houses up as quickly as possible anywhere. Right through the crazy years where tens of thousands of houses were built every year, the planning laws were not an impediment to building houses. Is that the problem? It is not the problem. We are introducing legislation - the legislation before Christmas and this Bill - that has positive things but is inadequate to address the core issue. We are introducing legislation based on a philosophy that is not about planning but about development. Why do we not just call it that? There is incoherence in respect of a number of issues. If we take, for example, county or city development plans or local area plans, on foot of the legislation that was passed before Christmas, An Bord Pleanála is not required to issue decisions that are consistent with those plans. One starts wondering what is the point is going through that process. It was never required to be consistent. I have seen it in my area. The number of houses that are proposed in the context of the regional planning guidelines is out of sequence with the prediction of the need based on the CSO's prediction of population growth. It is predicted there will be about 70,000 extra people accommodated in Kildare by 2023. There are a whole lot of proposals for the phasing of development. That phasing of development is knitted into local area plans. If An Bord Pleanála does not have to be consistent in decision-making on local area plans, one starts to question what the point is. One issue I want to highlight is the strategic nature of what is being talked about. We have had a consistent difficulty in this country with short-termism and not taking the long view.That is why this is so important. That inconsistency is not just around planning legislation, however. It is seeking to be consistent with the transportation strategies of the National Transport Authority, NTA, but there is a political counterbalance to that in that it requires funding. In terms of the Dublin Transport Authority, very large projects were scenario tested but were not delivered and still have not been delivered. These projects were supposed to facilitate development and their non-delivery is part of the reason for the current traffic chaos and congestion. We cannot have that level of growth without the public transport infrastructure that makes it sustainable. In terms of the consultation element, amendment No. 2 makes reference to a report which "summarises the views of any person who made submissions or observations to the planning authority". It strikes me, having looked at a number of reports written by the CEOs of local authorities in recent months, that they are very dismissive of public submissions but they pay a great deal of attention to bodies that are notified under the Act. That is something that will require the kind of planning regulator that would look at that and take a view beyond the local authority. As others have said, there is so much in this grouping of amendments that it is absolutely impossible to give the individual amendments the attention they deserve.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	442	I appreciate the chance, during the discussion on these amendments, to consider the real heart of this Bill and where it has come from, namely, the Mahon tribunal, as Deputy Wallace pointed out. That tribunal was not without its flaws. It is interesting to note, many years later, that many of the findings against individuals had to be withdrawn because the process itself was flawed. That should be a lesson for us in terms of tribunals and inquiries and how we do our work. However, the central argument in the recommendations about the need for independent planning regulations still stands true. We discussed the very interesting question on Committee Stage as to whether, in the end, it should be the political or administrative arm that has final control. That is a really fine line equation because in the Mahon tribunal process, while some people may have been wrongly accused, others got away lightly. I refer to both officials and politicians who were found to be corrupt but who could not be pursued because of the flaws in the process. Prior to and during the Celtic tiger period, Mr. Frank McDonald often said that the definition of sustainable development in Ireland was development that had to be sustained. I have seen officials pushing inappropriate development as much as anyone else. There is no lock-down guarantee that if we hand it over to officialdom that we will necessarily get a better outcome. On the other hand, we have seen various Ministers for the Environment over time who would not necessarily hold views akin to my own. I will not go back through the list of characters. In a later amendment I pick up on the actions of the last Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, who introduced highly inappropriate planning regulatory changes relating to apartment sizes, building energy efficiency standards, north facing aspects and so on. The former Minister provides an example of political control that did not lead to good planning. It is a very fine line and a very interesting and worthy issue for consideration. The core point made by Deputy Wallace with regard to the Mahon tribunal recommendations is that we need to get away from our overly centralised system. We also need to provide really strong direction at local and regional level for certain imperatives around real sustainability, air quality, flood protection, carbon reduction and reducing transport times to be a part of our planning system. It is very important that some of the other recommendations of the Mahon tribunal which have not been implemented to date are actually implemented if the approach in this Bill is to work. The regional structures we have at the moment, for example, are totally inappropriate. The Mahon report correctly recommends directly elected regional representation which we do not have here. In fact, we have a completely bizarre non-strategic regional structure. We are trying to adapt a planning regulatory system onto a regional system that is cuckoo, that goes from Louth to Louisburgh on one side and Bray to Ballybunnion on the other. Deputy O'Dowd also made the very good point that our planning structures around local government are completely mad. The absence of a town council for Drogheda is just one example of this. There are innumerable other districts which do not have district councils. We cannot transfer the responsibility back out or have a planning regulator regulating a system which does not have the proper planning structures in place, starting with things like a town council in Drogheda town. We still have a planning system that is completely dominated by managers. In this debate about whether it should be political or managerial control in the end, I am nervous about an unelected regional authority system where the managers hold all of the sway. In the context of city and other councils of which I have experience, where the managers had complete control, I am slightly nervous about handing over yet more power to an official system in this equation. In terms of dealing with corruption, we have done some good work; it is not all bad. We have introduced changes to the rules on political donations and lobbying, for example. More controls have been put into the system. During my time in government, we introduced an 80% tax to deal with the profits on zoned land, which was one of the core reasons for the corruption that became widespread in our planning system but the last Government got rid of it, arguing that there was no money coming in from it but that was at the height of the recession. The tax was there for when we started to lift again, which is where we are now. Such a tax might be one of the ways to get those large multinational companies to which Deputy Wallace referred to stop hoarding land for profit speculation. It could have an incentive effect. Had we, as the IMF recommended, also been quicker to introduce our vacant site levy, we might not have this stalled housing system. Answering the question as to whether the regulatory system should be ministerial or administrative also requires us to consider the other elements in the planning process that must be put in place. If we are to get the national planning framework right then we must, as Deputy Wallace argued, bring power out of Dublin and down into communities. However, for that to work, the national planning framework has to throw responsibility to the regions, cities and towns and get them to come back with their own planning and development ideas, rather than the process being top down. We need district councils and five or six proper regional authorities for that to work and real powers for local, democratically elected officials. In those circumstances, I would absolutely favour a regulatory management system but I am nervous about giving over powers to councils where the managers are still in charge, particularly when we have not really learned the lessons of the property bubble and the lack of truly sustainable development. We need this legislation but we also need a hell of a lot more, particularly around our democratic structures at local and regional level.

We are getting to the heart of how our society is run, what planning is, how we get around planning and how we account for democratic control or input. Deputy Ó Broin said that this debate is not getting enough publicity or coverage and that is one of the key problems with planning generally. Notwithstanding the fact that county development plans, for example, are publicised in local newspapers, it is very hard to get a debate going. When we invite people to come along to council meetings to discuss development plans, for example, only a very small number will turn up. One of the difficulties with planning is that it is only when things become controversial and difficult that the public gets involved and often, at that stage, it is too late.Councils and councillors proactively do their job of saying what the plans are and what they are going to be - this is certainly true in County Louth - but it is very hard to motivate people to get involved until they find out that their own conditions in their own areas will be affected. The status of the decisions made by An Bord Pleanála is an issue that has not yet been addressed in this debate. We went through a planning process in counties Louth and Meath when it was proposed to develop an incinerator in an area that was zoned for agriculture. We thought it was definite that the incinerator could not go ahead at the location because it was not zoned for industry. The company went ahead with the planning application anyway. When the matter went to An Bord Pleanála, approximately 30 consultants from Indaver wore nicer and brighter ties than one another. The planning inspector's recommendation that permission should be refused was overturned by An Bord Pleanála, against the wishes of local people, including councillors, and even though the planning adviser had stayed in the local area for two weeks. Government policy was cited by An Bord Pleanála as its reason for throwing local planning out the window. Deputy Eamon Ryan's point is well made in that context. It is wrong that in many cases, Government policy dictates above and beyond local public interest. It should not be the case that Government policy should be able to determine that something should go ahead regardless of the planning process. That is what happened in the case I have mentioned. We are continuing to face the consequences. I would like to mention the national spatial strategy as an example of what people have been saying about the transparency of the decision-making process. When I was looking at what happened in County Louth when the spatial strategy came out, I submitted a freedom of information request and got some information from the system of the time. I learned that spatial strategy was decided at the whim of the Government of the day. I was not able to see the minute, but I got the agenda under the freedom of information regime of the time. This revealed that the Fianna Fáil Government of the time had a debate on the merits of Drogheda and Dundalk in the context of the spatial strategy. This supports the point that there is no transparency in this respect. Nobody knew this was happening until it was done. Needless to say, the Minister of the day who was living in Dundalk got his zoning and Drogheda did not get it. This had significant consequences for the development of both towns. Notwithstanding all of that, Drogheda is now the biggest town in Ireland. It is even bigger than Dundalk. Drogheda continues to have major infrastructure problems. Reference has been made to planning corruption. Some years ago, a listed building in Drogheda was protected by all the laws of the land. We had gone to the High Court to ensure it could not be demolished without planning permission. One holiday weekend, some very kind developers knocked the damn thing down. They did not care less that it was a listed building. We had to fight them in the courts. Thankfully, we won. It was a long battle. We had to go before six or seven High Court judges before we won our case. If one goes to Drogheda today, one will see that Drogheda Grammar School has been rebuilt with hand-made brick on the actual footprint of the previous building. It is a question of what planning protection means. Listed buildings meant nothing at the time if builders wanted to run a coach and four through them. I believe the actions of the county council at the time were absolutely disgraceful. The local authority refused to act by standing by its own plan. This issue has been hugely controversial in the past. The planning corruption that was exposed by the tribunals shocked and sickened everybody. While I accept that this legislation is much better than what was in place previously, more transparency and accountability are needed. The plans should dovetail into one another. The leeway that is available to the Minister should be transparently restricted. In other words, the Minister should not be able to interfere in an unaccountable way. I do not think it is the intention of the legislation that he or she should be able to do so. I suggest that this Bill would be better if any interest declared by the Minister were to be made public, transparent and subject to debate in the House. This planning and development legislation, for all its flaws, is good because it is about making our country a better place and ensuring planning decisions are made in a more accountable and transparent manner. I have no difficulty whatsoever in facilitating development and construction because such activity creates jobs, creates communities, adds value to society and allows us to plan for the future. There is nothing at all wrong with that. Development is not a dirty word and nor should it be.

I do not propose to accept these amendments because I do not think it is appropriate to remove functions from the Minister or to transfer certain functions from the Minister to the OPR. The planning regulator will be fully independent of the Department. It will be fully responsible for the independent assessment of all local area plans, development plans and regional spatial and economic strategies. It will also be responsible for ensuring their compliance with relevant national or regional policies, or both. In its oversight role, where the OPR finds that local authority plans or regional spatial and economic strategies are not consistent with relevant regional or national policies, it will recommend the use of ministerial powers of direction under section 31 of the Act to change those plans. Such OPR recommendations to the Minister must be published. If the Minister agrees with the OPR, the recommendation will be followed. If the Minister does not agree with the OPR and decides not to issue a direction, he or she will have to give reasons in writing for this decision and lay those reasons before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This approach was selected after careful consideration to ensure there is full public scrutiny and democratic accountability over the significant power to overturn the decisions of local councils on the forward planning and zoning of their areas. It ensures the Minister will maintain the authority to issue directions, while also providing that where he or she decides not to follow the OPR recommendations, he or she must have clear reasons for doing so and such reasons will be published and subject to scrutiny and debate in this House. I believe the Bill as drafted strikes the appropriate balance between the independence of the OPR in its evaluation and assessment role and the maintenance of democratic oversight with the Minister and the Oireachtas, which is an important tenet of this Bill. As the Deputy has said, the existence of the planning regulator's office will not mean we will get all the right decisions. We hope we will get such decisions, just as we hope we will get the trust of the public, but it is important nevertheless to provide for parliamentary accountability. That is what we are here for. It is why Deputies and Ministers are in place. We should not always try to eliminate the role of public representatives. There is no doubt that this role was abused in the past by certain people in public office, but scrutiny has changed a lot over recent years. That is what we are here for. It is right that this Dáil is much more relevant and its scrutiny and decision-making carries much more weight. I do not see why Opposition Deputies who might be in government at some stage do not want to be able to do the jobs they will have to do as Ministers. Are they looking for excuses not to be able to do their future jobs? Is that what this is really about? I think Ministers need to be able to stand up and do their jobs when they come in here. I remind those Deputies who do not agree with the establishment of the OPR that we have established a similar body in the case of the Irish Fiscal Council. Such bodies work very well all over Europe. They highlight issues and disagree with Ministers. The Minister, Deputy Noonan, does not always agree with the Irish Fiscal Council. In such circumstances, he has to come in here and debate the issues at stake.

The Deputy might not like it, but that is what happens. It happens all over Europe and people accept it. As a country, we need to have evidence-based debates. Ministers still have to do their jobs. I would prefer not to shy away from that. The amendments before the House are recommending the removal of ministerial decision-making powers. That is wrong, and that is the view of the Department also I am not accepting these amendments for the reasons I have given. I do not consider that it is appropriate to remove section 31S (1)(a) and (b), as proposed in amendment No. 16. When the OPR is performing its functions, it is important for it to have regard to the policies and objectives of the Government, State authorities, planning authorities or other public bodies that have functions which may have a bearing on proper planning. This includes having regard to ministerial guidelines, policy directives and directions issued under Chapter IV of Part II of the Act. The office must have regard to the public interest and issues of importance to the State. Therefore, I do not accept this amendment. Equally, I do not propose to accept amendments Nos. 22 to 27, inclusive, in the names of Deputies Wallace and Daly. I do not consider it is appropriate to remove the Minister from his important role in monitoring the performance of the OPR, as proposed in amendments Nos. 22 to 26, inclusive. Section 31U, as drafted, deals with the monitoring and performance of the OPR and allows the OPR to conduct reviews of its organisation and the systems and procedures it uses in the performance of its functions. While the OPR is fully independent in its functions, it is still important for the Minister to have a statutory role in monitoring its performance. I believe the Bill as drafted strikes an appropriate balance between having an independent planning watchdog and maintaining democratic control and accountability over planning authorities. On amendment No. 27, we believe it is important and prudent to make statutory provision for the Minister and the regulator to consult each other on matters relating to the functions of the OPR. The absence of such provision would be a serious omission in the Bill. It would reduce the interaction between the OPR and the Minister on the functions of the OPR. Therefore, I do not propose to accept these amendments.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	450	On the point Deputy Eamon Ryan made about county managers, I agree that many of them have left a lot to be desired. Does the Deputy not think that many of the county managers we have seen in our lifetime were political appointees? More often than not, we can tell which party supported the managers in different counties. We cannot do it all of the time but we can do it most of the time. There is probably a different way of looking at matters. The Minister of State made the argument that we, as politicians and elected representatives, should be allowed to make the final decision but, from the six years I have been a Member of this House, I have been struck by the fact that political interference causes more problems that it solves. We are here to legislate but we should be able to put independent individuals into these positions, not people who are political appointees. There is a major factor in the context of those who pick the people that will do the job. I understand that and it is a difficult one to get right. If we can find independent people of quality to do the work, that is the way forward. A perfect example of this is the Policing Authority. It is a puppet of the Government. It is not independent. It has been irrelevant since Christmas. There has been one crisis after another in the Garda Síochána but the authority is not allowed hold the Garda Commissioner to account. Only the Minister for Justice and Equality can do that. The Policing Authority is another body we have created that the politicians of the day can handle. They can control it. They are still only too happy to control An Garda Síochána. They do not want to give up the politicisation of policing and the Government does not want to give up the politicisation of how we do planning and how we regulate matters relating to it.

There is no point in creating the planning regulator's office if it cannot effectively regulate. If we take that route, it will just be an expensive waste of time. The Garda issue is a good comparison because we have created the illusion of reform at some considerable cost but reform has not been delivered. It is interesting that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said on Committee Stage that this was not an absolute position for him. I would have said there was an expectation that the Government might have taken on board some of these points at this stage because it is pretty fundamental. It is very regrettable that the Minister has not chosen to do that. Deputy Catherine Murphy was quite correct in pointing to the legislation that was passed prior to Christmas which, in essence, gave us the gift of allowing big planning applications of 100 units or more or applications for student accommodation of 200 units or more to go directly to An Bord Pleanála.

The point put forward is that the planning system is at the root of our housing supply policy. That is not the case. As we pointed out, we have zoned land and planning approvals but we still have a chronic lack of housing. The reason for this is blindingly obvious, namely, that the developers who own that land are sitting on it to increase its value. Fast-track planning, of which this legislation is a part, will not overcome that. It is an awful pity the Minister of State did not take on board what was said on Committee Stage, namely, that it was not an absolute position and the request that he might consider it again.

One could come down on either side of the argument in that regard. In this instance, I am coming down on the side of the Minister of State. Ultimately, we are elected to represent the people and we should take responsibility. We cannot constantly say that politicians are so bad that they cannot take responsibility for decisions, but they must do so on the basis of objective evidence. There is a huge amount of objective evidence that I presume the office of the planning regulator will be required to make public and it is already there in the hierarchy of plans. When I was Minister of State with responsibility for planning, I issued a number of directives to local authorities in respect of instances where local government councillors were proposing to turn around their own area and county plans in order, for example, to build on flood plains or to construct big developments around the edges of urban areas to the neglect of the core. I issued those directives because, on the basis of objective proper planning, the development proposals to which I refer were wrong. Politicians can make incorrect decisions and so can administrators. That is precisely what led to the establishment of the Mahon tribunal: brown envelopes were being handed out; there was a total lack of transparency; councillors and planners, in conjunction with developers, were making decisions for their own benefit; and the system was corrupt. What we need is a system which ensures that responsibility is taken on the basis of objective facts and which facilitates the correct decisions being made. Ultimately, it is right that a Minister has to respond to the elected representatives in this House. If the Minister is doing something different from what the office of the planning regulator says should be done, he or she will be obliged to answer for that publicly. The establishment of the Health Service Executive, HSE, was a terrible mistake. We often complain that we cannot hold certain bodies to account. We are elected representatives and it is about time we took responsibility on that basis. One of the problems with the political system in Ireland is that we are loath to take responsibility. Sometimes we have to make decisions that are not popular locally. One of the problems with planning in the past was that local politicians had too much power, were not obliged to explain their actions and were able to make decisions behind closed doors. Transparency is a big factor and Deputy O'Dowd referred to that. If matters are out in the open, people can decide. In this case, however, it is a question of balance and it is correct that the Minister is the ultimate person who will be answerable. It would be very unusual if a Minister were to decide to go against what is proposed by the office of the planning regulator. If, however, he or she does that, he or she will be accountable for doing so. He or she will have to account for his or her actions in the public, open and democratic forum of the Houses of the Oireachtas to which we are elected to represent the people. It is about time we grew up in regard to planning.

This means that recommendation 1.14 from the Mahon tribunal report is not being supported by the Government. That proposition is being rejected. At least we know that and it makes matters clear. I am amazed at the degree to which the Minister of State is confused about the functions of a planning regulator. Nobody is suggesting that the Government of the day or the legislators in the Oireachtas should cede any responsibility for our functions to a regulator. Our job is to legislate. The Government's job is to direct policy and the job of local authorities and other public service providers is to deliver services. That is what we are here for. An independent regulator comes into play when somebody does something wrong, be it a Minister, officials in local or central government, or local authority councillors, and its job is to investigate and make an intervention to correct the wrongdoing. Therefore, the regulator must be separate from legislators and service providers. I respectfully disagree with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan. There is no value in having a regulator unless it has independent power to intervene and correct breaches of legislation or policy. This does not mean we would transfer any responsibility for policy or legislation to the regulator. The regulator's job is to investigate and to correct, where necessary. Part of the problem - we will come to this when we deal with my later amendments, but it is relevant to the amendments currently under discussion - is what happens if, potentially, the Minister or senior Government officials are involved? The Minister of State is right in saying there has been a huge change in culture from the bad days of the 1980s and 1990s. However, that is not a reason to fail to ensure that we have in place, as recommended by the Mahon report, the best possible checks and balances.The better the checks and balances, the better the protection for good civil servants and politicians. The Minister of State speaks about balance but there is none; one either has the power to intervene with the regulator, which is required according to the Mahon report, or the power remains within the political system, which failed in the past and may well fail in future. The Minister of State has this all wrong. Not unlike with the Policing Authority, we will return to this at a future date when, just as with that body, this proposed body will prove to be ineffective.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	461	With regard to objective evidence and where the balance is struck between the Minister or the regulator, there is the supposition that it will be the same Minister all the time but there could be a great variety of different attitudes if the ministerial route is taken, as opposed to a regulator, which would create a consistency. That is absolutely required. The whole point in planning is to have a degree of normality or, to put it another way, the avoidance of chaos. Currently, there are a number of local area plans in my constituency, with one in Leixlip and one in Celbridge, for example. There is much proposed phasing of development for a very large amount of housing. For example, there are 3,000 houses proposed for Leixlip, which already has 4,500 houses. It took decades for them to be put in place. In Celbridge, there are approximately 6,000 houses and there is a proposal to put in another 3,500 up to 2023. Everybody knows it is mad and not deliverable. A Deputy spoke about people paying attention to planning legislation but they are certainly paying attention in my area because they absolutely know what they will get. They will get housing estate after housing estate, but nothing else. Essentially, the phased developments to make it happen without total chaos would not go hand in hand with that. There must be consistency not just in having a planning regulator with teeth but where a regulator can deal with matters such as the infrastructural requirements to facilitate development. That is still very much in political hands and there is a mismatch as a result.

It is not what is being proposed. The point is to have some sort of genuinely independent checks and balances on that. The Minister and the Government cannot act as the ultimate watchdog of themselves so we need a fully independent regulator that will ensure we are fully compliant. Earlier we heard how some of us, at least, believe we are not compliant with the environmental impact assessment directive and have flagrantly failed to engage in genuinely sustainable development in every sense of that word, so we need somebody who will independently oversee these matters and adjudicate on them if people are not doing what they should be, playing by the rules or failing to vindicate legislation or environmental directives, etc. I have a question for Deputies Daly and Wallace, and Deputy Wallace alluded to it. Who regulates the regulator and who would appoint the regulator? It is a problem as we have the phenomenon of regulators who are not really regulators but rather rubber-stampers. We must deal with that issue as well and a number of aspects must be addressed. The Public Appointments Service must be examined as to whom are its personnel accountable when it comes to important public appointments? They seem to me like a group of insiders and very much the permanent government, selecting its own people. I am sure most of the public do not really know who is in the Public Appointments Service, never mind the top level appointments committee and all that stuff. That process should be examined as it must be much more open and transparent. We need to establish a much greater role for the stakeholder groups of civil society, communities and environmental groups so as to give them real power to oversee planning and legislation. This links to the debate about EIA directives and the failure to properly take into account public participation, as they are supposed to, in planning decisions. There is more work to be done in developing a greater civil society and stakeholder oversight of planning and all sorts of aspects of government and regulation. In this debate, I favour the amendments tabled by Deputies Wallace and Daly, as there is more weight behind the argument they make than what the Government is saying. It is not really addressing the issues brought up in the Mahon report and the need to check the abuse of political power in the planning process. We probably need to go beyond even what is in the amendments in terms of deciding how we appoint regulators and ensure they are genuinely independent rather than other types of political appointees who are not really accountable to civil society and stakeholder groups but who end up being rubber-stampers for whatever Government happens to appoint them.

Once a person has been in government, perhaps he or she is part of the establishment and in a sense such people may not question that bodies are trying to do the best thing and want to take on responsibility. It is also true in that there is a permanent government, which is part of this debate because we are talking about creating more permanent government, in a sense. That is why one would stand up for the political system. I was interested in Deputy Ó Broin's comments on this really interesting question. If this just related to an agency looking at policing improprieties, the Deputy's case would be very good in that it should be completely independent. My understanding of what is proposed is that it goes beyond that, researching a range of what is sustainable development, as well as education matters and policy-oriented aspects. This may swing the argument and indicate that in the end it should be a political call, and this is why one might give the Minister the final say. Nevertheless, as Deputy Jan O'Sullivan notes, there should be the valuable check that if a Minister goes against the regulator, the matter should be debated here. The process must be absolutely transparent. If some previous Ministers had such a check, they might not have gotten away with some of the colourful and corrupt practices in which they engaged.

Members come in here not just to comment or raise issues, and they do a great job of raising many issues, but politicians have to also make decisions. That is what democracy is about. There are many commentators in the media every day of the week but politicians go into a council chamber or come into this House to make decisions. I do not believe we should give every decision away to some other body that is not accountable to this House, even though this House is elected. The Deputy is making a mistake. We strongly believe that. I have come through the planning process, like most of the Deputies here, since I started in politics over 20 years ago and it has changed immensely. It is very transparent in every decision that is made. I would trust more of our politicians' ability to make decisions. More effort is made to educate politicians about planning matters but a local authority cannot make a decision about a zoning or planning matter without proper scrutiny and without explaining to all who want to watch or listen why the decision is being made. The county manager is there. Reports have to be answered for. Planners are involved. It is not the way it was when I started in politics, when it was wrong. My first vote on a development plan was "No", against everybody else. Nobody even cared or asked about it because it was not scrutinised. That has changed and there is proper scrutiny, which is right. We are saying here that the Minister cannot make decisions without scrutiny and has to explain to this House why he or she is not taking the advice of the regulator. That is the way it should be. We will not be accepting the amendment. I am sorry about that but that is the very strong view in our Department.

#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	478	I move amendment No. 4:In page 6, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:“ ‘Strategic Transport Plan’ is a transport plan drafted by a transport authority;‘transport authority’ means either the National Transport Authority or Transport Infrastructure Ireland as defined in the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 and the Public Transport Regulation Act 2009 as amended.”.The amendments in the grouping all relate to transport and transport strategy. We have to go back to the rationale of the Mahon tribunal report and its recommendation to establish a planning regulator to achieve a greater level of integration between land use planning, such as local authority zoning decisions, and strategic transport planning. It is disappointing that the new office of the planning regulator is not being given any role in the oversight of the development or implementation of plans by the NTA or the TII. I am aware that the TII and the NTA are statutorily bound to have regard to higher level master plans such as the national planning framework, what was the national spatial plan, or regional planning guidelines.Very often, however, there is a lack of coherence or even disagreement, whether perceived or real, between local authorities' development plans and regional transport strategies developed by the NTA and TII. This time last year, the new transport strategy for the greater Dublin area was launched. It gave a specific example of how local authorities and representatives in my county of Wicklow, along with those in Kildare and Meath, voiced concerns the NTA was setting rules on spatial planning without due consideration to the regional and county plans. It seems from the Government's proposal that the role of the office of the planning regulator, OPR, will be to ensure there is coherence and agreement between county development plans, local area plans and regional transport plans developed by the NTA and TII. However, it should also be recognised that bodies such as the NTA or TII, despite having statutory obligations to comply with the national spatial strategy or the regional planning guidelines, may not always make decisions that are consistent with regional planning guidelines. In addition, there should not be an assumption that it is local authority plans that are inconsistent with regional plans or national plans. Our proposal is to give the new office of the planning regulator the role of arbitrator between local authorities and bodies such as the NTA or TII when disagreements arise over draft plans. If a local authority is of the belief that specific decisions by the NTA or TII run contrary to its development plan, such complaints could be given an airing by the OPR and not simply just cast aside.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	479	We cannot have land use planning without transportation planning along with it. They have to be consistent with each other. Going back to the Dublin transportation initiative, for example, it was an exercise in land use and transportation planning. The problem was that we did not get delivery on the transport side. What we got was the other developments without the transport aspect. Essentially, if we do not have both happening together what we will then have is a model that is entirely unsustainable. There must be symmetry. Some of this comes with funding. For example, the DART underground is critical not just for Dublin, but for the surrounding counties because it has a much bigger footprint. If it is not funded and some additional development is added, then a bad situation will be made worse. This is what is happening at present. I had a look at the figures in the 20 year horizon to 2016 from when the plan was reported in 1996. I looked at the census population and the percentage increases. Essentially, Dublin city grew by 13%, Dún Laoghaire by 13%, south Dublin by 22%, Fingal by 43%, Meath by 44%, Kildare by 39% and Wicklow by 28%. What we are creating is a perfect doughnut. We are generating transport activity on the periphery to clog up the middle. If we do not have not only transport planning, but also transport delivery while we are developing, we will have chaos. We are seeing this being reinforced on the periphery of Dublin at present with the regional planning guidelines, which I think are out of sequence with, for example, the CSO's population prediction. Whether or not it is the right mechanism to have the regulator as an arbitrator, I absolutely agree there does need to be a connection between both. Otherwise we will continue to have this mismatch and we will continue to have chaos. That chaos costs money because it brings additional new demands for widening roads and new roads when, in fact, in this particular instance the response should be rail based.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-05-17 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	480	I wish to reinforce the point in support of the amendment. The key argument is we must put land use, transport and housing together. I want to draw from personal experience, going back to the formulation of transport plans for Dublin as far back as the late 1990s, when A Platform for Change was the transport plan which developed. It was based on very good planning work and there was an underlying use of modelling to assess likely demographic shifts and look at changing work patterns. It had a range of different demographic projections of what would change. That provided a bottom-up granular and really detailed plan as to where people were likely to live and move. It assessed the transport options on the back of this, and certain criteria were set such as that everyone should be within ten minutes walk of a public transport high-quality corridor. Out of it came a recommendation plan for transport in this city. I remember distinctly, as I was a member of the transport advisory committee of Dublin Transport Office at the time, that there was a clear recommendation from the planners and people involved that whatever we did we should built the metro and the DART interconnector first and then the electrified rail system out to west Dublin and elsewhere, and if we did not do that the planning approach would not work. The exact opposite happened. We widened the M50 first and continued to build the national motorway network, which all reached the M50, and that is about to clog. It is a classic example of where, to my mind, we will have really deep consequences now in terms of a lack of connection. This is not just with regard to Dublin. The big planning problem we face is there are big doughnuts of development outside all our main cities. We have a statistical map showing those commuting long distances of more than 30 km a day. We see huge rings around Galway, Limerick, Cork and Dublin, a hollowing out of cities in terms of population decline in Cork, large areas of Dublin city centre and Galway, and massive development of out of town and very far distant rural housing connected to urban centres. We have the huge expense of providing public services, and the huge expense in daily life spent commuting is something we have to reverse and address. Unfortunately, nothing has changed. We have IBEC coming out in its submission to the national planning framework with the most insane road-based system we could possibly imagine. This is IBEC, and it is a cuckoo plan with more than 15,000 km of new motorway and dual carriageway. We have the city of Galway, which is probably the worst example, where everyone lives on one side of the city and works on the other side. I remember at the time, when all of the ring roads and roundabouts were being built back in the early 1990s, a very smart engineer said to me those roundabouts would not work and that the transport system was mad, and so it has proven to be. What are we doing? We are still building more ring roads and more out of town sprawl systems. I commend the amendment in the sense that it brings to our attention the need to put the planning and transport planning frameworks together. This goes back to the policy debate we had earlier. While we have to give cities and regions great freedom to work out what their development model will be, one of the criteria we should set for a planning regulator and all our local authorities is that whatever else happens we have to stop the ever lengthening of our average daily commute because it is costing us dearly. It is one of the metrics to which we have to return. It is not just about bringing life back to Dublin, but about bringing life back to the centre of villages, towns and other cities throughout the country. If we do not start doing this, we will have an incredibly expensive health system because how do we service people in distant locations, and we will have an incredibly inefficient economy. In every system we look at, the form of the planning we have been pursuing over the past 30 or 40 years, whereby 40% of our houses are one-off houses in the country, is just incredibly expensive in the end. We have to start living closer together because it is so much easier and cheaper to provide public services. I am not against one-off housing, but it is a rational assessment of how we provide the services people need in an efficient way.We cannot continue with the sprawl. That has to change, and it has to be the first central direction to any planning regulator. The metric in terms of success is whether we are reducing that need for transport because for too long we have allowed it to expand without any thought to the costs involved.

I support the amendments. They are eminently sensible. If I am not mistaken, when we dealt with a similar Bill before Christmas, similar issues were raised. The explanation from the Minister at the time as to why he was not willing to accept them did not seem to be credible, so I would be interested to hear the outline of the Minister of State, Deputy English, today. I will make two points to emphasise what Deputy Ryan has said. The Clonburris strategic development zone is in my constituency. One of the big problems with it, both in its previous incarnation and the big challenges today, is the integration of residential, planning, amenities and transport. Having this included in the functions of the planning regulator creates another opportunity for greater levels of interaction between those different key elements of our planning system. I can see no reason not to include it. If the Minister is not supporting it, I am interested to hear the reason, although I hope he will support it. At a very local level I hear residents complaining all the time about how planning developments get to go ahead without adequate road infrastructure. I know that is not specifically what this is dealing with, but it is the same set of issues, and on that basis I am more than happy to support it.

I will address amendments Nos. 4, 6, 7, 15 and 56. Despite the spirit of the conversation and the support of everyone here, we cannot accept the amendments as they have been put forward, but I would agree with all the arguments that have been made and the logic behind them. The amendments proposed by Deputies Cowen and Casey regarding the oversight and assessment of strategic transport plans by the Office of the Planning Regulator, OPR, are extensive and cannot be accepted as they are currently drafted, particularly as they encroach on areas within the remit of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. There are also a number of technical drafting issues within the amendments proposed. We do agree that there might be a role for the OPR in respect of strategic transport plans. The Deputies referenced counties like my own, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare. I see that traffic first-hand. I am in it every morning and evening and I know what it is like. Representing the town of Navan, which is one of the few Dublin growth centres that does not have any rail connection, I can see how transport is a major issue that should be linked to planning as best as we can possibly do so. Those transport plans have obvious links to overall planning objectives, so in that regard there may be scope to give some additional function to the Office of the Planning Regulator to review strategic transport plans, as proposed in the amendment, although not perhaps as extensive a role as contended in the Opposition amendments. That is something we can examine. I think we agree on some sort of a role. That outlined in the amendment is quite extensive. We might have to debate that further, but there is general support in the Chamber for looking at that. On Committee Stage, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, committed to teasing out these amendments to see if some agreement could be reached, but more time is required to draft that, to consult other Ministers and to try to come up with appropriately worded amendments that it is hoped we can all agree to as best we can because I understand what the Deputies are trying to do. We will try to help with that if we can. In accordance with standard practice, I ask the Deputies to withdraw these amendments for now on the basis that we will consider the issue, including examining the legal and drafting aspects of the proposed amendments, but also to discuss this further with the Minister's colleague, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, with a view to bringing forward appropriately worded amendments when the Bill is taken in the Seanad if agreement can be reached. We are making some progress but we need a little more time to try to come up with something to which we can all agree.

I am glad he agreed with the comments made here tonight. We are all aware that strategic transport needs to be integrated into land use planning. While we are willing to accept his proposal that we would withdraw the amendment on the basis that it will be examined, can I ask if the Minister is proposing that the drafting of the amendments would be done when the Bill is taken in the Seanad?
