          <p eId="para_11">This meeting has been convened with the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, and the Minister of State with responsibility for sport and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Jack Chambers, to discuss key priorities and legislation insofar as they relate to the remit of this committee, noting that matters relating to programme C - the Irish language and the Gaeltacht - now fall under the remit of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community. I welcome the Minister and Minister of State and their officials to the meeting. As the Minister and Minister of State are present, it is not expected that officials will speak in this public session. I wish to advise that the opening statements and any other documents that have been submitted to the committee may be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I remind members of the constitutional requirement that members must be physically present within the confines of Leinster House in order to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. Those attending in the committee room are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19 and to kindly note that face masks are encouraged in crowded settings on campus. Members who may be joining the meeting via Microsoft Teams are asked to identify themselves when contributing for the benefit of Debates Office staff preparing the Official Report, to mute their microphones when not contributing to reduce background noise and feedback and to use the button to raise their hands to contribute. I remind all those joining today's meeting to ensure their mobile phones are in silent mode or switched. I invite the Minister to make her opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_13">Go raibh míle maith agat a Chathaoirligh. Tá an-áthas orm fáiltiú ar ais roimh an gcoiste chun tosaíochtaí straitéiseacha na Roinne a phlé. The Minister of State and I are delighted to have the opportunity to speak to the committee on strategic priorities for tourism, culture, arts, sport and media. The Joint Committee on the Irish Language, Gaeltacht and the Irish-speaking Community will address Gaeltacht priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_14"> Last November when my Department's sectors were among those most seriously affected by the Covid-19 crisis, I spoke to the committee about my priorities and the vital importance of these sectors to Irish society, our individual and community well-being and our national economy. I am very pleased we are now in a position to enjoy the safe and successful reopening of our society. With it, our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead. I am also delighted to see audiences back at arts, culture and event venues and I welcome the full return of fans to our sports grounds. Notwithstanding this, I am aware that there are factors casting a shadow over the recovery, not least the devastating war in Ukraine as well as rising inflation in our economy and internationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> A key priority has been to continue supports for these critical sectors, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, so that they can stabilise and generate economic activity as we move further along the road to recovery. I draw the committee’s attention to a number of important developments in relation to these sectors. This year, for tourism, I have allocated an increase of €67.6 million, or 31%, on the comparable 2021 allocation. The increased funding will facilitate a further €50 million provision to assist vulnerable tourism businesses to survive until inbound tourism recovers. There is a €35 million increase in the tourism marketing fund in 2022 to support marketing strategy and restore inbound tourism to Ireland. Further to the economic recovery plan published last year, the Government decided to extend the VAT rate reduction to the end of February 2023. This extension covers the same goods and services as the original measure, including restaurant supplies, tourist accommodation, cinemas, theatres and museums.</p>
          <p eId="para_16"> I was pleased to announce details of a €50 million suite of measures to support the live performance sector in 2022. This included a further strand of the live performance supports scheme as well as the €15 million live performance restart grant scheme, which opened for applications in March. The Arts Council provides the vital investment needed to protect artists' livelihoods, support arts organisations, develop audiences and nurture young people’s engagement with and appreciation of the arts. Maintaining the record €130 million allocation for 2022 allows the Arts Council to fund events and festivals in across Ireland while nurturing excellence. From the earliest days of the pandemic, the dramatic realisation of the true intrinsic value of the arts provides an imperative for maintaining funding to the arts. With regard to my Department's capital programme, the programme for Government makes strong commitments for continued capital investment in our national cultural, sporting, language and tourism infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Ireland's tourism sector is of significant value to the economy and benefits regional development. Recruitment continues to be a significant challenge for the tourism sector with up to two thirds of businesses reporting reduced capacity due to staff shortages. The Department and Fáilte Ireland are continuing to collaborate with industry and other Departments to ensure there is a co-ordinated approach to addressing labour and skills shortages.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">I am continuing to liaise with the recovery oversight group in respect of the tourism recovery plan and issues affecting the sector. Work is also ongoing on the development of a national tourism policy that will set out the path over the coming years and ensure that sustainability is at the heart of recovery in the sector. This policy will be underpinned by a programme of capital investment which includes investment in activity-based tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> There has been much recent discussion about the costs and availability of key components of the tourism sector, such as hotels and car rental. While I recognise that businesses in the sector are grappling with increased input costs and that increased demand leads to an increase in prices, it is essential that all businesses in the sector are mindful of the need for Ireland to maintain its value-for-money proposition as a tourism destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> Evidence of excessive charges and prices for tourists, both domestic and overseas, has the potential to cause reputational damage for Ireland. Furthermore, any negative impact could derail the positive recovery in that sector. We must work together to ensure that our céad míle fáilte and good value continues. The tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> With the climate emergency as our backdrop, the future we imagine is one that will bring tourists and tourism businesses on a journey towards a sustainable model that embeds and protects our environment, local communities, natural heritage and beauty. Last year, the arts and culture recovery task force submitted its report, Life Worth Living, which outlined ten recommendations to support the recovery of these sectors. We have made significant progress on implementing the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> I was especially pleased to announce €25 million in budget 2022 for the pilot basic income guarantee scheme as part of budget 2022, as part of the three-year pilot’s investment of €105 million. Applications closed on the 12 May with close to 9,000 applications received. Under this scheme 2,000 artists and creative arts workers will be provided with €325 per week for three years. I hope this scheme can bring new life and support to the arts and culture sector and that it will provide an important legacy for our artists.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> In February, Government also agreed in principle that the Creative Ireland programme will continue for a further five years to encompass the period 2023 to 2027 and will focus on the following pillars: creative youth; creative communities; creative industries; creative health and well-being and creative climate action and sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> The report of the night-time economy task force was published in 2021 and contained a number of practical recommendations to help support and sustain the night-time economy, with some pilot measures to support new developments in this area. A robust implementation structure has been agreed to ensure that the recommendations are implemented, which has the flexibility to react to new ideas and developments as work progresses.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> In tandem with these developments, we continue to commemorate in a meaningful and respectful way, the events that shaped the foundation of the state, as part of the decade of centenaries programme. The all-party committee, which I established to contribute to the commemorations programme, is working proactively with me as we come to the closing years of the centenary commemorations, with a number of significant events scheduled over the coming years.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> It is a priority of my Department to address the future of broadcasting and media in this country and safeguard the availability of quality, informed and trusted sources of news and content. Some examples from budget 2022 to support this sector include the additional €4.2 million funding I secured for TG4 for 2022, which was the largest ever annual increase in TG4 funding, and the €5.5 million allocated for the establishment of the coimisiún na meán.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> I was glad also to be in a position to provide increased funding to the sound and vision scheme which will be allocated this year, to support the production of high quality television and radio content, including a special round to address climate action and climate change. With regard to the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill, I also thank the committee for the publication of a comprehensive pre-legislative scrutiny report with regard to the general scheme of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> The 33 recommendations contained in the report raise a wide range of important issues and highlight the scale and complexity of the matters to be addressed in the Bill. To address one of the key recommendations of the report, I established an expert group to examine the possibility of providing for an individual complaints mechanism in the Bill. I have now received the report of the group and am considering its recommendations. It is a priority to ensure swift progress of the Bill through the legislative process, with a view to having it enacted as soon as possible. While this is subject to the scheduling of each stage of the legislative process in each House of the Oireachtas, I will urge all Members to work closely with me to expedite its passage, especially against the backdrop of infringement proceedings which are being taken against Ireland in respect of the transposition of the audiovisual media services directive. The enactment of the legislation, without delay, is critical to avoiding significant penalties.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> In parallel with the passage of the legislation, my Department is working with the Public Appointments Service with a view to shortly commencing an executive search for the key roles in coimisiún na meán including that of online safety commissioner. The establishment of an coimisiún will provide the regulatory and developmental framework to allow me to implement many of the recommendations in the report of the Future of Media Commission, which will be brought to Government shortly. I am sure committee members will agree that all of these measures are critical. I look forward to ongoing cross-party engagement on this important agenda, where I envisage we will require a rolling suite of legislation to address the effective regulation of this hugely important and influential sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> Tourism, culture, arts, our language, sport and media are fundamental to our society, identity, well-being and our democracy. As Minister, I will continue to advocate strongly for these sectors as we emerge from a very difficult period. I am happy to take any questions members may have. Is cúis mhór áthais dom deis a fháil labhairt leis an gcoiste inniu.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackChambers" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Taoiseach" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Deputy Jack Chambers)<recordedTime time="2022-06-01T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">As the committee members will be aware, another committee is dealing with the Gaeltacht element of my responsibilities and I will limit my comments today to matters relating to sport. Our key priorities in sport are to support the sector’s continued recovery from the impact of Covid-19, to continue investment in vital infrastructure and to contribute to building a healthier and more active society by increasing sports participation across all sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> Consequently, we have set a target of 60% of the population participating in sport and physical activity by 2027. The last two years have shown us how important sport and physical activity are for our physical health and mental well-being. As we emerge from the pandemic, the Department continues to prioritise engagement with the sport sector and our significant allocation under budget 2022 will support a strong and vibrant sports sector and provide opportunities for everyone to engage in sport and physical activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> We have started work on a number of actions which will be of real benefit to sport and we will be working on delivering others in 2023. First, I wish to embed the sport-for-all ethos across all strands of the sports sector, whether at national governing body level or grassroots level. The sports action plan includes 43 distinct actions and initiatives aimed at increasing participation levels across the board. The emphasis is heavily oriented towards increasing inclusion, diversity and equality in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> We have a record €12 million budget from the Dormant Accounts Fund, for investment in 2022, with which we can focus increased efforts to ensure that all persons have the opportunity to partake equally in sport and physical activity. I specifically wish to develop a funding line under the Dormant </p>
          <p eId="para_35">Accounts Fund that will allow clubs and other organisations to apply directly for sport-for-all funding that will be targeted at increasing participation.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The commitment to diversity, inclusion and equality within the sport action plan is also underpinned by a commitment to increasing female representation on the boards of sporting organisations to a minimum of 40% by 2023. It is intended to give clarity to sporting organisations on the implications of non-compliance with this measure later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Second, we will be working on other priorities, such as building on the 2022 winter initiative, in order develop a strong programme of events for this winter and beyond, as well as the development of a national swimming strategy and a national database of sport and recreation amenities to provide people with key information on sport and recreational facilities in their localities.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Sport Ireland has published its new long-term high-performance strategy until 2032 which covers the next three Olympic and Paralympic cycles and will support and enhance Ireland’s position internationally. We have provided an increased allocation of €96.2 million in current funding for Sport Ireland in 2022; up 5% on last year. This will enable it to continue to support the sector through its various funding programmes. These initiatives support the fulfilment of the Government's high-performance policy, grant funding for sporting organisations and equality in grant funding for female and male players.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> In recent years, Ireland has won bids to host the Ryder Cup in Limerick in 2027, games in the UEFA Euro 2020 finals, the women’s Rugby World Cup 2017 and is the preferred bidder to jointly host the T20 men’s Cricket World Cup 2030. We will also host the prestigious US college football matches in Dublin for five years from 2022 and, it is hoped, beyond that. We have engaged with the UK Government and have decided to support the FAI’s submission of an expression of interest for a co-hosting bid for Euro 2028. Officials from my Department will examine the feasibility of supporting a bid before a final decision is made by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> We are currently developing a major-sports-events policy and the public consultation phase of this process has just concluded. Major sports events have the potential to deliver many benefits for sport, society and the economy. The final policy and strategy, which will be published later this year, will seek to maximise those benefits for Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">On capital investment in sports projects, the latest round of the sports capital and equipment programme closed for applications last year. A record 3,106 applications were received, seeking over €200 million in funding. The equipment-only projects were assessed first and grants with a total value of €16.6 million were announced in 2021. The remaining capital applications were then assessed and 1,865 individual grant offers, with a total value of over €143.8 million, were announced in February 2022. This represented the highest level of allocation ever made under the programme. Unsuccessful applicants were able to appeal the Department's decision and 146 appeals were received by the deadline of 4 April. Some €6 million was kept in reserve for successful appeals and the outcome of that process was just announced yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_42"> Resources have been provided in 2022 to continue to progress the projects allocated funding last year under the new large scale sport infrastructure fund, LSSIF. The priority in the short term is to advance all of the successful projects with a view to awarding new grants to projects that missed out under the first set of allocations. On completion, the scope for awarding any additional grants, adjusting the level of existing grants, and the timing of any new call for proposals will be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I wish to reaffirm the Government’s commitment to developing the Sport Ireland campus at Blanchardstown. The 2022 allocation of €9.6 million will allow Sport Ireland to complete ongoing projects and progress the planning and design on the national velodrome and badminton centre. A new campus master plan has been drafted that will provide the framework for the long-term development of facilities at the campus over the next 15 to 20 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> I thank all members for their time and attention and both of us are happy to take questions on any policy issues.</p>

          <from>Deputy Imelda Munster<recordedTime time="2022-06-01T13:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_46">The Minister and Minister of State are welcome. In the Minister's opening statement, she stated, "our tourism sector looks forward to a busy summer season ahead" and indeed it does. You can already see an abundance of tourists throughout the city but for how long will that last, given the price gouging that is going on in hotels and the extortionate room rates people are being charged? People are beyond furious about this. During the pandemic, when hoteliers had asked the public to support them by holidaying at home, people did support them. Now you have a situation where things are opening up again and are getting busy and the great rip-off begins.</p>
          <p eId="para_47"> For example, I checked on Monday morning, when a room in a Dublin hotel was priced at €320 for the night, no breakfast. I received correspondence yesterday from a family who, because they were concerned about missing their flight, sought to book a room overnight in order that they could depart early for the airport. The family of two parents and four children were quoted a price of €816 for one night in Dublin city with no breakfast.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> Another hotel on a Saturday night in June quoted a Dublin price of €393, where the price in Belfast it was €193. The cheapest price I could see for two nights in July was €600, again with no breakfast. Another hotel quoted the same two nights at two euro short of €1,300 but the good news is that there was breakfast included with that. </p>
          <p eId="para_49"> These are extortionate prices about which people are completely furious. </p>
          <p eId="para_50"> This is going to cause significant reputational damage to Ireland as a destination without a shadow of a doubt. When the word gets out to overseas visitors that this is a rip-off, that people are paying way above any other hotel rates right across Europe, that Ireland is starting to rip off people again, this will cause long-term damage. </p>
          <p eId="para_51"> I was going to say it stinks of pure greed but it is pure greed. When one goes on to any site to look for hotel prices right across any other major European city, they offer fair prices and value for money. In Ireland, particularly in the cities and in the larger areas, they are literally engaging in extortionate pricing. It is not fair on other hotels in quieter areas of the country which are not engaging in price gouging and are trying to do their best to encourage tourism. When word gets out among overseas visitors, that reputation will be given to us unless a stop is put to it. </p>
          <p eId="para_52"> We must also consider domestic tourism, as people are not going to forget these prices. People will remember all the supports the industry was given during the pandemic. People supported these hotels, stayed and holidayed at home. At the time, people had said some of the prices were very expensive in comparison to other times but they were absolutely nothing to the price gouging and the brazen rip-off that is going on now. In her opening statement, the Minister stated, "We must work together to ensure that our céad míle fáilte and good value continues [and that the] tourism recovery must be sustained and sustainable." What plans does the Minister have to ensure that this price gouging stops? What is the Minister's assessment of the wisdom of extending the VAT reduction, given that demand is not the problem? Would she be reluctant to extend this reduction further given this phenomenon or what measures does she plan to take to call out the hotels on these prices because we have to sustain our tourism in the long term? Once a place gets a reputation of extortionate prices, people will just stop coming.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">I thank the Deputy, who has raised a significant, highly topical and current issue. As the committee is aware, there are significant cost inflation pressures for businesses, including tourism, at present but nonetheless, as the Deputy has said, Ireland has well-known attractions, many of which are in the Deputy’s own constituency. I think of the beautiful Carlingford which I go to myself and other places which again and again bring visitors back. It is very important that businesses consider both their pricing levels and the added value and extras that they offer to help keep that reputation and that overall good-value proposition and competitiveness. It is important that we attract back customers time and again and that their experience is one where they want to return.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> On the hotel pricing issue, the 2022 rebound in the Irish tourism sector is very strong and stronger than expectations. It could actually reach two thirds of the 2019 levels. This has been helped by that stronger than anticipated recovery in air connectivity, as the 2022 peak summer access will be back to 90% of 2019 levels. </p>
          <p eId="para_55"> April occupancy levels in Dublin hotels reached over 83% and the expectation is that the equivalent figure for May will be 90% or more. Dublin is currently seeing at least 10% higher occupancy than cities such as London, Rome or Amsterdam. No one thought that would happen so soon. There is strong customer demand on the ground with a great deal of deferred travel, which is the key part here. There is also the wedding activity, which is putting a real squeeze on available accommodation. Other key domestic factors are also back in play now as we, thankfully, see the resumption of large concerts and matches.</p>
          <p eId="para_56"> We are seeing increasing numbers of those anecdotal reports of excessively high prices in the hotel sector and the Deputy has given examples there in this regard. Whether these reports are reflective of the general market or of the prices that are being sought online for remaining rooms is somewhat moot because, as the Deputy has noted, such reports can have a really negative impact on our reputation as a visitor destination.</p>
          <p eId="para_57"> As I have said, I am very aware that businesses, including tourism businesses, are facing significant cost pressures due to inflation and other economic factors and the hotel-----</p>

          <p eId="para_58">My apologies for interrupting the Minister but she is saying that businesses are facing additional pressures. I acknowledge there are cost rises and inflation but while other businesses across Europe are also facing these pressures, the rip-off is here.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">I am just saying that the hotel sector faces a range of challenges, in common with the wider economy, such as the sizeable increase in the cost of key inputs and the difficulty in recruiting and retaining key skills. These challenges are not unique to Ireland. They are shared by many countries around the world. It is very important that Ireland retains its reputation as a value-for-money destination. That reputation cannot be threatened. Value is not just about the price you pay; it is about what you get for the price too.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">Would the Minister publicly call out price gouging and state that the prices being offered at the moment are not fair and do not provide value for money? We cannot compare them with prices across Europe. Would she send the message out that should this type of thing continue, it will cause long-term reputational damage to this country and that she will reconsider the wisdom of extending the VAT reduction if the benefit is not being passed to the consumer? The problem is not demand; the problem here is pure and utter greed.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">There are two parts to that. There is ongoing engagement with the officials. The hospitality and tourism forum that the Tánaiste and I co-chair will be meeting again. That is a good forum to address the issues. There has been engagement already, but my officials will be meeting with the Irish Hotels Federation and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation tomorrow to consider how value for money can be maintained and how to restrain excessive pricing and ensure that visitors continue to feel that this is a place they want to return in the context of obtaining value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The reduced VAT rate applies to a wide range of businesses that need to be considered in addition to the hospitality sector, which are trying to rebuild. They have had a stressful two years. They include catering, restaurant supply companies, cinemas, caterers and museums. The Deputy knows the type of businesses that are on the list. Nonetheless, no potential options should be off the table, as far as I am concerned, when it comes to the protection of the value-for-money perception relating to Irish tourism. That is a critical priority in the years ahead. I think that addresses Deputy Munster's question.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials for all their work. It should be acknowledged that they have continued to secure record investment in tourism, sport and arts, which says something about the priorities. In particular, I thank the Minister and her officials for 20 hours of Committee Stage debate on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_65"> I will start with a very specific question to the Minister of State on the Irish Athletic Boxing Association, IABA. Does he now believe it is appropriate that there should be an independent investigation into the association? We have seen another high-performance director leave, an election take place in which votes were not counted and members being expelled in a move that was subsequently found to be <i>ultra vires</i>. There is clearly something wrong. The Minister of State has indicated that he will consider withholding funding, but the concern, as expressed by Kellie Harrington yesterday, is that this may impact directly on the boxers. Nobody wants to see that happen, but there is clearly something rotten at the heart of the IABA. It is my view that there should be a complete independent investigation. I would be grateful to know the opinion of the Minister of State.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jack Chambers<recordedTime time="2022-06-01T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_66">I thank the Senator for his comments. As he is aware, there has been an independent review of IABA with very strong recommendations. If he reads the review and recommendations fully, it sets out many difficulties, the dysfunction, the governance concerns and the issues that arise in terms of the connection with the grassroots and between the core organisation and the board. That is why we have been very clear that we want IABA as an organisation to fully adopt at its extraordinary general meeting in June all of the recommendations that have been proposed.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> To be clear, there has been an independent review, which has produced very clear and frank recommendations, which underpin best practice around governance and other aspects of how to run a sporting organisation. We want to see them fully implemented and for the board to embrace all of the recommendations. We want an implementation plan that is decided within a minimum of three months and then monthly meetings overseen by Sport Ireland around the implementation. If that does not happen, there will be very severe financial consequences. We will look at protecting athletes like Kellie Harrington and others. We have seen great success in the European championships and in the world championships in the past week or two. We want to ensure our high-performance athletes and grassroots are protected, but there will be immediate challenges for IABA as an organisation if it does not implement the recommendations. We are not standing over ongoing cyclical dysfunction, zero women on the board and multiple other challenges. We have had the resignation of Bernard Dunne recently and previously that of Billy Walsh. It is important that there is full implementation of the recommendations.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I welcome that. Just like the Minister of State, I am concerned by the level of dysfunction, and I do not have confidence in the current board. It is important that the grassroots and athletes are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_69"> I will ask the Minister a couple of questions. One of the issues she mentioned is that we would be seeing the imminent publication of the commission on the future of media's report. We have been anticipating that for a while. The Minister might indicate when that might happen. She also stated that the recruitment process for coimisiún na meán will begin shortly. Is there an indication as to when we might see that happen and when the members and, in particular, the online safety commissioner will be in place?</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> I echo the concerns around tourism and the VAT rate. There is one area where I think we have been successful in tourism. Tourism Ireland has been active in promoting regional development, especially through the regional co-operative marketing fund. Specifically speaking to what is happening at Rosslare Europort in the context of attracting international visitors, through the investment we are now seeing, Irish Ferries, Brittany Ferries and Stena are all promoting Rosslare and Ireland. Will there be an extension of that marketing fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_71"> In terms of addressing some of the accommodation issues, I know there has been discussion around legislation with regard to the registration of short-term accommodation and letting. It is crucial that we get this right because short-term letting does fill an important role in the holiday market as well. I realise what we are trying to achieve on the housing side, but are there specific proposals with regard to legislation in this area and when might we see them?</p>

          <p eId="para_77"> The programme of work regarding coimisiún na meán is now under way to secure the recruitment of key staff with the relevant skills and expertise needed to lead an coimisiún and to carry out the groundwork for the commencement of its regulatory functions. That includes managing the transition of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, staff and functions to an coimisiún while at the same time ensuring the continuity of existing broadcasting regulations. I touched on the matter a little bit last night in the Seanad. The recruitment of the senior staff who will lead and manage an coimisiún is a priority. Work is under way with my officials and officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Public Appointments Service to secure the recruitment of those staff. I may have indicated this last night in the Seanad. That includes the executive chairperson and an online safety commissioner. The recruitment will be done through open, transparent and effective public competitions.</p>

This will involve a Government decision in the early part of next year. We are working with various nations on putting the bid together. We are working through various aspects such as stadia, matches, capital operational costs and all aspects of the bid. A full team in the major events unit of the Department is working on this. They are fully engaged with it. In recent months I have had a meeting with British Ministers, including the Minister with responsibility for sport.</p>

Early projections for this year are that the full allocation will be drawn down and a number of the projects have progressed.

We are engaging on large-scale projects. We are doing a review. We are looking at future calls. Dalymount Park will play a key role. The reason we are funding it in the design stream is because projects such as this are able to continue to a further stream.

She has brought forward a charter to deal with abuse of officials in sport. We had a very good discussion and departmental officials were also present. Something she asked for was that terms of admission would be linked with State funding from the capital sports grant, whereby all of the 1,900 clubs that were awarded €150 million by the Department in February and are in receipt of State funding would have a sign affixed to their grounds stating the terms of admission, including that abuse of referees would not be tolerated and that such abuse would lead to rejection.

Having contributed significantly to the report, the committee has envisaged that we will be able to discuss it. What will happen now is that the Cabinet will come forward with its own proposals.

          <p eId="para_117">I also thank the Minister for her support for the tourism industry. My colleagues mentioned the extension of the VAT rate and the high prices being paid in that context, particularly in the hotel end of things. This has not occurred in the restaurant sector. Several other countries in the EU have a split VAT rate. If this price gouging continues, perhaps we may seriously need to consider looking at the VAT rate, and perhaps splitting it and allowing the restaurant industry to continue with a reduced VAT rate. I say that because the same type of gouging is not happening in the restaurant industry. It only seems to be happening in the hotel industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_118"> Turning to sport, I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, for finding that extra money for the sports capital grants programme. It has been welcomed by all the clubs throughout the country, including mine. What is the possibility of the large-scale infrastructure fund, which was mentioned before, opening for applications? It was referred to in the Minister of State’s opening statement. We must examine where there are infrastructure deficiencies concerning various sports. I refer to identifying in the context of funding. I am going to be parochial and say that several counties in the midlands, including mine, do not have proper athletics tracks. A city the size of Galway, which has roughly 250,000 people, has only one hockey pitch. When this large-scale funding scheme opens, the funding must be targeted to where there are deficiencies. It should not be a case of putting large amounts of money into one or two or three projects. This is an aspect we must explore. Therefore, what is the likelihood of this type of funding scheme opening?</p>

          <p eId="para_119">We are concluding a review of this initiative, which is looking at, to return to Senator Cassells's question, the types of funding gaps in those projects we have already funded. I refer to certain projects that missed out. There is also the aspect of broader demand. We will engage with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform regarding the possibility of an additional budget line in this context. Some €100 million was made available. Equally, the previous Government, and the then Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Griffin, allocated €86 million at that time. We are, however, cognisant that there is a necessity in the context of existing projects and the level of ambition across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> I also share the Senator’s point about ensuring we intervene where facilities are needed. We must move beyond single-sport facilities. We must embed a municipal concept in sport and particularly where we invest on a bigger scale. This will require sporting organisations to look beyond their own specific interests and to work together for the broader community. That type of approach works much better across Europe and also gives better delivery for the State. There is also the matter of how we can better integrate our education system with sporting and community facilities. Any future iteration of the large-scale funding programme will mandate sporting organisations to come together to undertake larger projects in regions or communities. This is what investment of this type should be targeted at, rather than for single and specific projects, as we have seen happen over many years. This municipal concept must be at the core of any future budget line in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">I concur with the Minister of State’s comments. Senator Malcolm Byrne mentioned the IABA and I also have my concerns in this regard. To be quite honest, there must be wholesale change at the top of that organisation. An independent review was commissioned at short notice because this committee was seeking to look at the governance of the IABA. The review was undertaken by the same person who carried out the previous review and yet the recommendations do not refer to the senior management in the organisation. This is where the problem seems to be, and I say this having spoken to representatives of the clubs and to volunteers on the ground. I do not have faith in the organisation. I will be honest about this. The situation must be re-examined. Having talked to the people on the ground and in the clubs, they are not happy with the recommendations that have come from the report I referred to. Therefore, this issue must be looked at again. A significant number of people, some 30 volunteers, were suspended. Those were people who had devoted thousands of hours to this sport throughout their lives. Those suspensions were appealed and those appeals were upheld, but the people concerned have had to fund the cost of those appeals that vindicated them. I do not think this is acceptable in any sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_122">Looking at the issues identified by the review, those aspects it points to include culture, the leaking of confidential information at the board, public distancing from board decisions, internal conflict, lack of clarity regarding roles and responsibilities, lack of active participation in the working of board subcommittees and significant issues regarding governance structures. There is also the absence of women on the board, which is a problem, and we must deal with it. The review also highlighted issues such as the independence of the board, the disconnect between the board and the grassroots, issues around oversight and control, the lack of diversity more generally and a range of other issues. If the IABA fully embraces all the recommendations, it will go from being an organisation that is clearly dysfunctional when it comes to governance to one that can demonstrate best practice in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_123"> What we should not have, and what we cannot have, is people in the IABA, at whatever level, undermining clear recommendations. People with obligations in that sport need to front up and to fully implement the recommendations. What I will not stand for is anyone in the IABA undermining clear recommendations. I want full follow-through on them. I am not going to entertain a campaign that seeks to undermine recommendations. The recommendations here could apply to many other sports and some of those sports have implemented similar recommendations already. What is it that the IABA does not like about having women, independence and diversity on its board? What does the organisation not like about changing the culture and behaviour of its board or about building a better connection between its board and the grassroots? Therefore, if people within boxing think we are going to allow a kind of a campaign to undermine the current recommendations, we will not entertain any such campaign. In the context of IABA, we will protect athletes and the grassroots, but we will have reform. I am clear that the recommendations, when broken down and analysed, identify clear problems that we need to resolve. This is my bottom line on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_125">I welcome the Minister and her officials to the committee and I commend her on for the €25 million basic income pilot, which would be a game changer in the arts. There are concerns in the community about what some call a de facto exclusion of artists with disabilities insofar as the scheme may put someone at risk of having their other supports cut. Can the Minister make some assurances on that? If not, can the scheme be made exempt to disability allowance, the blind pension, the medical card and so on in order that people will not risk their supports being cut?</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> I welcome the Minister’s comments on the night-time economy task force. It is good to see that a robust implementation structure has been agreed. Importantly, the flexibility is there to react to new ideas. That is positive. I commend the Minister on that. I have been struck by the struggles people are facing, as well as the streams of people who we see walking out of town late at night trying to flag down taxis. We have lost over 2,000 taxis from the industry since 2019. My colleague, Deputy O’Rourke, had a briefing in the audiovisual room at Leinster House yesterday, which called for the ten-year rule to be looked at. In speaking to the Minister as an environmentalist, I note that when walking out the main arteries of town, you see streams of people who are unable to flag taxis and often, there is only one person in those cabs. This is not a good use of resources. The report of the night-time economy task forces called for an increase and extension of eight new routes to be in operation for 24 hours in Dublin. There are currently three such Dublin Bus routes. We need to see policy change if we want people to change their habits and to view the bus as an option late at night. This is obviously the area of the Minister’s colleague, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan. It is a key recommendation in the night-time economy task force. I would welcome the Minister’s comment on the unavailability of taxis late at night. People will not go into the city centre if there is no way to get home. </p>
          <p eId="para_127"> I will add my voice to another issue because if we do not say it, it will not happen. The report of the Future of Media Commission must be published. We are getting fobbed off time and again by the Government and it has to be published. The Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill must now go through the Dáil without Deputies having access to that report, as has been the case for Senators as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_128"> My final request to the Minister is to consider in her budget allocations a ring-fenced allocation to RTÉ for the development of the RTÉ Player. </p>

          <p eId="para_131">I will take the question on the Future of Media Commission first, because I have already addressed it. It is our intention to publish that shortly. We are having final meetings about it with the Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_132"> As for the basic income for artists scheme, it is the case that I have no statutory function in social welfare means tests. That is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. The participation of artists with disabilities is a matter that I take very seriously. I have sought to ensure that all artists, including those who have a disability, can apply to participate in the pilot. Helplines were established for them so that they could see if they would be impacted. We are encouraging everyone to apply. A key research question that will arise from this entire basic income scheme process will be around the impact that such a payment could have on artists with disabilities. To that end, I was determined since the outset of the basic income for artists scheme that artists with disabilities would be in a position to participate. We therefore worked closely with the Department of Social Protection to enable their earnings to be treated as earnings from self-employment and to be taken into account in respect of the earnings disregards that apply to many social welfare payments. That means that the basic income for the arts will be treated like any other income that a person in receipt of social welfare payments earns from employment. Not all disabled artists are on social welfare supports, but for those who are dependent on income supports, the issue to which we have referred relates primarily to the manner in which social welfare schemes assess income from other sources.</p>
          <p eId="para_133"> Again, eligibility for social welfare is a matter for the Minister for Social Protection. However, this is all shining a necessary light on this. This will be a key piece that will arise from this research pilot scheme. We have done everything possible to encourage them, as far as we could within the constraints of not being the Minister for Social Protection, in terms of trying to get the basic income for the arts over the line. Of the approximately 9,000 applications that we received, 6.9% of those are from people with a disability. They will therefore be represented on the scheme. They definitely will have a chance to feed into and to be part of the research. I am sure that like other artists, some will be on the control group as well. I have done what I can within the constraints of the scheme and given the fact that I am not the Minister for Social Protection but Minister with responsibility for arts. </p>
          <p eId="para_134"> In relation to the night-time economy, I acknowledge what the Senator is saying about taxis and how it is not sustainable to have one person in a taxi. On the issue of the eight proposed bus routes, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is very supportive of any developments there and in the night-time economy sector. His Department, as well as the various transport agencies, are on the implementation group. I agree fully with the Senator. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is determined to get that done too, from a sustainability point of view. </p>
          <p eId="para_135"> RTÉ is not funded by the Exchequer, but by licence fee receipts. Therefore, that is a matter for RTÉ to decide on. A portion of the funds from the recent sale of land by RTÉ have been ring-fenced for digital. I think that may include the RTÉ Player. It will also go towards the paying down of debt. I think I have addressed all of the Senator’s questions. </p>

It is an access issue, as well. If you are watching Netflix on a poor broadband connection, the Netflix app will adapt to that. This is an access issue for people across the country, who do not have access to good broadband. You need a pretty good broadband connection to run the RTÉ Player at times. I thank the Minister.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I welcome the Minister and Minister of the State to the committee. I will quickly go through my questions. Sports clubs are being crippled by ever-increasing insurance costs or by unsuitable insurance that will not cover small but still significant injuries. For example, a number of insurance companies will only cover accidents such as the loss of an eye or a limb, or those that result in a person being in a wheelchair. Another example of this is in the circus and street arts sector. They cannot secure affordable or suitable insurance at all. Is the Department doing anything on this issue to help to lower insurance costs for local clubs and organisations?</p>

          <p eId="para_140">I thank Deputy Mythen. We have a recommendation in the sport action plan. I am trying to find it here so I can give it to him. It is very much focused on insurance and it is working with the Federation of Irish Sport. I know that Mary O’Connor was before the committee. It is also working with Sport Ireland. We engage with the sports sector and then present that information. There is an insurance working group within the Government that is chaired by the Tánaiste and the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, that has specific responsibility for insurance reform. In the sport action plan we have tried to reflect some of the local concerns the Deputy has outlined and to ensure that they are central ideas or issues that need to be addressed in a sporting context.</p>
          <p eId="para_141">There is an action plan on insurance reform as well. We can submit the specific action. The sport action plan is a long document but it references the issues around insurance relating to sport and we can send that on to the Deputy.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I will continue in the line of Deputy Munster's questioning. We know that disproportionate prices are being charged but is there any oversight, research or monitoring by Fáilte Ireland or the Department, to consider the reduction in VAT? Is there any evidence that any part of this reduction was passed on to the consumer or holidaymaker?</p>

          <p eId="para_143">We are engaging with it all of the time. There is a meeting scheduled for tomorrow between our officials, Fáilte Ireland, the Irish Hotels Federation, IHF, and the Irish Tourism Industry Confederation, ITIC. Although the VAT reduction applies to a wide range of businesses, no potential options should be off the table when it comes to protecting our reputation as a value for money tourism destination. That is a critical priority for the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> The demand right now is slightly related to a deferral of many travel plans. It cannot be taken for granted that as we go into the shoulder season and into next year everything will be as it was this year. A lot of people postponed holidays who did not see their families and all of that is coming to a head as we approach summer 2022. We need to be cautious and my officials will be communicating that in the meeting tomorrow.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">The basic income pilot for artists will not be means tested because it is not a social protection support. Instead it is a payment in recognition of the time spent in creative practice. We are trialling the basic income pilot and one of the key characteristics of it is that it is not means tested. It will be randomised but it will be proofed to make sure there is proper geographical representation and diversity of arts, population, gender and all of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_147">I refer to the recent serious allegations of match fixing in the League of Ireland.

          <p eId="para_148">On the question on insurance, action 4.5 of the sport action plan details six-monthly ministerial presentations to the Cabinet sub-committee on insurance reform. Match fixing and corruption are a threat to all sports at all levels and they undermine public confidence in the fairness of sport. We are a sport loving nation and we have an inherent understanding of the need for fairness, honesty and good sportsmanship at all levels in our sporting codes. Not only that but as An Garda Síochána points out, match fixing can allow organised crime to infiltrate sport in order to use it to make illicit gains or launder the proceeds of crime. On the specific question the Deputy asked, there is a live investigation which began in 2019. In this case the FAI and UEFA reported their suspicions to the Garda around some League of Ireland matches and I commend the FAI on its zero tolerance approach to such behaviour. It is vital that all sports remain vigilant of any suspicious activity which could bring their sports into disrepute. There is an ongoing investigation so I cannot comment beyond that.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">I thank the Minister, the Minister of State and the officials for coming in. It is much appreciated. I want to ask the Minster about the ongoing shambles in Dublin Airport. I know it is not directly under her remit but what is under her remit is the reputational damage to Irish tourism that arises from this. Is there a strategy to try to deal with that reputational damage? We know the debacle has been broadcast by international news agencies. Is there a way to try to restore confidence to people who are considering holidaying in Ireland that they will not be spending half of their holiday in the airport trying to get out of here again? What has been going on there is awful. Is there a plan to try to fix some of the damage?</p>

          <p eId="para_150">As the Deputy knows, the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, has statutory responsibility to operate and manage Dublin Airport, including all the operations associated with security screening. I welcome the fact that as we speak the chief executive is up before the Committee on Transport and Communications and a lot of those issues might be teased out there. Dublin Airport is a regulated entity and the Commission for Aviation Regulation is an independent regulator for charges at the airport. It also sets out a comprehensive range of quality standard targets, including on security times, to ensure a high quality service for passengers at the airport. The passenger experience at Dublin Airport is falling so far short of the service that our citizens, tourists or visitors should expect at our largest State airport. The Government recognises the undue stress that these unacceptable delays are having on passengers.</p>
          <p eId="para_151"> As the Deputy knows, ministerial level meetings have been held since the security delay issues first emerged at the end of March and I know that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Naughton, met the authority earlier this week. They have requested that the DAA report back within 24 hours on solutions that can be put in place as we approach a bank holiday weekend, which is a pinch factor. Up until last weekend queue times had improved on those experienced by passengers at the end of March, with over 90% of passengers getting through security in less than 45 minutes but what we saw last weekend is not acceptable. As the Deputy said, it has a real risk of doing severe reputational damage to our tourism. I have written to the chief executive of the DAA to express my concern and I hope that the recent engagement with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, will see immediate solutions put in place because we need that to happen. I am waiting to welcome with open arms the assurances of the smooth operation of Dublin Airport because that is key, as the Deputy has said. What people are seeing on social media and in our newspapers risks doing huge reputational damage to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I thank the Minister and it is important that is communicated as well. The other thing I wanted to ask about is regional tourism and the Minister might look at this again. We have the Dublin to Kerry route and the Dublin to Donegal route but if one flies into Dublin and wants to hop on the Dublin to Kerry or the Dublin to Donegal flight one has to go back out through security and start into the chaotic process again. Similarly, if one is flying from Kerry to Dublin and is going to take an ongoing flight one has to go out again and come back in, which is bonkers and makes no sense whatsoever. I was on to Kerry Airport about this on Monday to see if it could do something bilaterally with the DAA and I was also on to the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, about it. The experience for tourists trying to get to Kerry or Donegal or trying to go home could surely be helped by squaring that circle and it should not be impossible to fix that one. It is a matter that the Minister could perhaps look at with her tourism hat to see if she can encourage the DAA to do the right thing there.</p>

          <p eId="para_154">These passengers have already gone through security in Kerry Airport and I can assure the Minister that a flea would not get past the security there. They are good and thorough and have been well-funded with some good equipment.</p>
          <p eId="para_155"> Car rental is another massive challenge facing Irish tourism and I raised it in the Dáil last week. It is a factor that is particularly detrimental to rural tourism more than it would be to short city breaks. Awful prices are being charged. I went on a few of the car hire websites last week and we are talking Monopoly money, which is not acceptable. I accept the principle of supply and demand but just because a price can be charged does not mean it should be charged. That is an area that needs to be addressed. We are spending a fortune marketing the Wild Atlantic Way abroad, for example, yet when people come here they cannot afford to rent vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">One thing I tried to progress when I was in the Department, and I came up against brick walls, was the concept of a hop-on, hop-off Wild Atlantic Way bus service. It is a linear route, so it would not be very difficult logistically. It would be a very doable project from a sustainability perspective, a tourist experience point of view as well as from the perspective of local engagement and local benefit. It would be something that would greatly benefit both the communities and the visitors. Certainly, in the context of the situation where people cannot rent cars at present, it would be a very sought-after service. I cannot see how it cannot be done. It is very possible to do it with a few daily services running each way. Is this something on which the Minister could throw her shoulder to the wheel, if she will pardon the pun, and try to get the bus moving? It would be a massive addition to the Wild Atlantic Way. That is one matter I ask the Minister to bear in mind.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I have questions on two other matters. The Carlingford cove initiative is in the programme for Government. When I was in the Department I believed it was an important one to progress. There is a vast offering along the eastern seaboard, perhaps more so from a walking and cycling point of view than as a driving route. There are all the peninsulas on the west coast, but that is not the case on the east coast so it probably lends itself better to walking and cycling. Is there any progress on that in respect of Fáilte Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_158"> Another initiative was the concept of the invitation follow-up to The Gathering. Is there any progress on that? It is something that would be, perhaps, useful and timely considering the rebuilding process we are in after Covid-19.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">With the indulgence of the Chair, I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers. With regard to the situation with the Liverpool fans at Saturday night's match in Paris, how many Irish Liverpool fans were in Paris for the UEFA Champions League final as well? The fans, some of them children, were treated disgracefully by the French authorities and the commentary afterwards rubbed salt in the wounds. Obviously, UEFA has a stake in all of this as well. Clearly, the venue appeared to be quite unsuitable and the organising, or lack thereof, appeared to fall well short of what one would expect for a major European final. Would the Minister of State consider conveying to UEFA his concern that there is nothing to stop this from happening, for example, to travelling Irish fans for an Irish international game in the future, if that is the poor level of organisation at UEFA events? Would he consider expressing his concern? As I said, many Irish lads were caught up in the hassle, through no fault of theirs, on Saturday night. They appear to have been treated disgracefully. It is not acceptable and we should express our concern about it. Cities like Paris that have been awarded big tournaments such as this should not get them again if they have mishandled them and dealt with them badly, as Paris clearly did on Saturday night.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">We all are very concerned about what we saw and the total disorganisation beforehand, with fans arriving with tickets and being excluded and then being blamed for just trying to get into a match. We have seen that broadly reflected. It was terrible that fans were being blamed. I am absolutely concerned. Certainly in the Irish context, we have good event planning. From a security perspective, the authorities there did not plan this well, and blaming everyone else is not the solution to that. Other authorities have reflected their concern and I share that. From an Irish perspective, I am confident that if we ever host a match, and I believe we have the UEFA Europa League final in 2024, we will make sure that everything is in place to provide an excellent fan experience so there would be none of these scenes in a Dublin context.</p>

One big obstacle to that happening is the Safeguarding 1 course, the child protection course. Every volunteer has to do it. It is a requirement if one wishes to work with children under 18 years of age or vulnerable adults. I have done some research. When I looked it up last night I found there are no courses available anywhere in the country. It seems to be a complete mess. Different sports partnerships put it on different platforms if one wishes to access it. It is very difficult to find out and there is no uniformity with the application process.</p>
          <p eId="para_168"> The FAI, the GAA and the IRFU run their own courses, which is good for them, but smaller sports organisations such as Hockey Ireland, cricket, basketball and other sports have to get their volunteers to do the course, but there is no centralised platform. Smaller sports are not in a position to run it. This means clubs are going to lose volunteers and participants. I ask the Minister of State to intervene in this to ensure there is a centralised platform that it is easily accessible and understandable and that there is a good healthy supply of courses, so there is no queue for the course. Will he undertake to have a centralised mechanism that would allow volunteers to do it?</p>

          <p eId="para_169">I thank Deputy Andrews and I will reflect what he has outlined to Sport Ireland. As he stated, safeguarding is a fundamental pillar and a basic minimum when it comes to anyone's participation in sport and we must ensure volunteers have received that training and also that we have the statutory protection in place in terms of Garda vetting. I will reflect that to Sport Ireland and also the Deputy's proposal for a centralised platform. We are providing unprecedented funding to Sport Ireland and to the local sports partnerships to roll out courses fully. There might be an issue of pent-up demand post Covid-19, but I take the Deputy's point and I will refer it back. We are anxious to ensure that we fully embrace all the volunteers who want to be involved in sport.</p>

          <p eId="para_171"> I also have a question about clubs that received the sports capital grant. Different clubs received different grants over the last few years, but due to Covid-19 they were unable to progress projects. Now, with inflation many clubs are finding they either cannot finish a project or cannot start a project.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">The €150 million we provided is probably the most unprecedented level of funding in the history of sports capital. In fact, the funding ask against what was allocated is as close to what the ask was historically as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">We have had massive engagement with the sports capital unit in respect of drawdown. It is getting a significant amount of contact about clubs that want to draw down capital and get it mobilised and utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> In terms of historic grant allocation, there were smaller percentages in previous rounds. We have a huge level of ambition across the sporting system for a new round for new applicants who have new ambition to go beyond and might be able to put in a pitch to improve their existing facilities. We have to look at that as well in that context. If the Deputy looks at the most recent round, he will see that it actually mitigates some of the issues that he referenced because it is very close to their actual asks. It is not 20% of what they sought, rather, many of them got up to 100% of what they asked for. Therefore, the funding gap will be less than perhaps it was in historic rounds.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">I hear the Minister of State. There is an issue, however. Clubs have contacted me. There is an issue regarding inflation in that they cannot finish their projects. I would ask that he take on that. As he said, the capital grants people in the Department are looking at that. However, many projects will be under strain because of the inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_178"> The Minister of State mentioned in his report that he intends to give clarity to sporting organisations on the implications of non-compliance with gender balance.

They will be very clear, transparent and have a significant impact on their core funding. We will publish that later in the year.

To deprive him of his input would not be fair to him, as an elected representative. There may be people like him in other sports who want to play a role. We need to have good structures around governance that underpin best practice, that have independence, good sub-committees and that are based on a broad range of recommendations. It is important not to kind of categorise or exclude elected representatives from participating within the amateur side of sport. It would not be fair. It is about the underpinning structure of a board within sport and what the level of best practice is. It is about looking at the structures that are in place. There will be some democratic input into sporting organisations in terms of people coming through a sport who may happen to be elected representatives simultaneously. Would the Deputy remove any elected representative from any board anywhere?</p>

          <p eId="para_194">I have a couple of very quick observations. First, I sincerely congratulate the Minister on getting the basic income for the pilot relating to artists. This scheme is truly groundbreaking and will set our country apart in terms of how we value art and those who create it. I echo the concerns, which the Minister addressed comprehensively, about how the basic income for the arts, BIA, payment might impact on people with disabilities who are in the arts sector. I know there is an ongoing engagement happening between the Minister and the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys. I ask that would continue during the pilot . At the conclusion of the pilot, we will have a scheme that works very well for everybody who wants to participate in the creation of art in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_195"> Second, I thank the Minister for her extraordinary work during the pandemic in putting the live performance support scheme in place and for the significant collaboration that happened with local authorities and with practitioners in the industry. Those same practitioners are finding their way back to work, albeit very slowly in some cases. They are asking for us, as legislators, to consider looking at the reduction of the VAT that applies to many people in that industry. I know there is an ongoing engagement with the Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance, Deputies Michael McGrath and Donohoe, with a view towards having that looked at under our national tax strategy. I would ask the Minister if she could perhaps make her feelings known as well. Again, we are getting very conflicting information from various quarters as to whether this is possible or not from an EU VAT legislation perspective. However, if it is, I ask the same sort of supports that have been extended to those in the hospitality industry also be extended to those in the arts industry, especially our musicians, entertainers and technicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_196"> On tourism, there is one point I want to make. I make this point whenever I have the opportunity. I refer to the much maligned Airbnb. We need to look at how this platform and those similar to it can impact on the supply of housing in locations that have a very significant challenge around supply. I live in a small, rural community in east Galway. I live in what Fáilte Ireland beautifully coined as the Hidden Heartlands, which I think is wonderful. For us in that small community, Airbnb has been truly a game changer in terms of how we market ourselves to the world, for families who are willing to welcome travellers from all over the world into our small, rural, east Galway community and how we market the very interesting activities that one can partake of in those communities. That is replicated across the whole of the Hidden Heartlands in that there is a challenge around hotel rooms in many parts of it. Airbnb and other platforms like it have given those less-visited locations an opportunity to market themselves to the world. On foot of that, we need to be careful in how we move forward in regulating Airbnb and other industries or platforms like it. We do not throw the baby out with the bathwater and deny an opportunity for particularly rural and remote locations to have people visiting them.</p>
          <p eId="para_197"> I live beside a very successful forest walk that was developed by our local community in conjunction with Coillte. With the advent of Airbnb, certainly before the pandemic, I, for the first time, met people visiting there from Germany, Scotland, Italy and France.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">They were all staying in local Airbnbs, an opportunity they did not have prior to the advent of that platform. That is something of which we need to be mindful.</p>
          <p eId="para_199"> I thank the Minister for the additional funding for the extraordinary work of TG4. I acknowledge the quality of the content emanating from that station and the work it does to connect with Irish communities worldwide. The TG4 player is used extensively abroad by people who are trying to learn the language and also by people who are anxious to have a deeper understanding of Irish culture, the Irish people and our beautiful island. TG4 is doing valuable work in throwing open a window to the world on what it means to be Irish and to live on this beautiful island. I thank the Minister for her support for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_200"> Turning to the Minister of State, Deputy Chambers, I congratulate him on his work on seeking to ensure increased and more diverse participation in sport. That was very much reflected in the sport capital grants awarded earlier in the year and by those clubs and entities that are ambitious in increasing particularly women’s participation in sport being very well funded and supported. The Minister of State may not have specific information on the development of our velodrome project. We are anxious to see it get under way. New Zealand, which is similar in size to Ireland, has two national indoor velodromes which is beginning to produce very positive results in terms of New Zealand's participation in the sport of cycling from the grassroots up and success at international cycling competitions with wins and medals awarded. It is beginning to have an impact. Something similar could happen in Ireland as soon as we get our national velodrome under way.</p>

          <p eId="para_201">Regarding the basic income for artists pilot, I thank the Acting Chairman for his support for that. I share his enthusiasm for the widest possible participation in it. I also agree with his comments on TG4. I was very happy to increase its funding significantly in the past two years.</p>
          <p eId="para_202"> On the VAT on live performances, currently, artists and live entertainment event workers benefit from a favoured VAT regime but for shows or events where food and drink are not served, VAT is not charged. A lower VAT rate is already applied to tickets for cinemas, theatres, some musical performances, museums and galleries' exhibitions. I understand one of the issues raised by some representative industries is that musicians and performers charge 23% on the fees they charge. There is push on the sector to reduce this amount. I hear their point of view on this and I will make sure I raise it with my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, for consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"> Regarding short-term lettings, peer-to-peer platforms like Airbnb are an important part of the tourism accommodation mix but we need a range and choice. At the end of the day Housing for All identified short-term lettings as a housing constraint in urban areas especially. Therefore, getting the balance right is key and there will also be stakeholder engagement along with the way.</p>

          <p eId="para_204">I thank the Acting Chairman for his remarks on the sports capital grants and on diversity and inclusion. I take his point on the velodrome project. It has been spoken about for many years. The velodrome and badminton centre project is a priority for us. It is a key project referenced in the national development plan. We have a draft master plan we are progressing. There is funding this year to advance its planning and design and it is something we want to progress properly. That is why it is signalled and specified in the national development plan. I accept that within the broader cycling community it has been spoken about for many years but we are anxious to progress it. I have spoken to Sport Ireland in recent weeks about the need to advance this project. We are all on the one page in trying to do that. It is a major project. We will not only have a velodrome in the centre but it will have major potential for multi-use in sport and in what it can do for other indoor sports. It will have major potential on the sports campus.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">We will begin the second session. It has been convened with the Minister, Deputy Martin, to discuss a safe and respectful working environment in the arts. On behalf of the committee, I thank her and her officials for engaging with the committee on this important topic and for the measures introduced by her Department in response to the Speak Up: A call for Change Report commissioned by the Irish theatre Institute as part of its Speak Up initiative. This will be our third public engagement on the topic, having received significant evidence from a range of key representative groups and agencies to date. The format of the meeting is such that I will invite the Minister to make her opening statement, which will be followed by questions form members of the committee. As the Minister is probably aware, the committee may publish the opening statement on its website following the meeting.</p>

I will not permit a member to attend where he or she is not adhering to this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to attend from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. I invite the Minister, Deputy Martin, to make her opening statement.</p>

          <p eId="para_208">Tá an ceart ag gach bean agus ag gach fear go gcaithfear leo le dínit agus le meas. Tá timpeallacht tuillte ag gach oibrí, ina gcaitear leo le dínit agus le meas agus nach ndéantar leithcheal orthu, is cuma faoin gcomhlacht ina n-oibríonn siad nó lena bhfuil siad ar conradh. Creidim go n-aontódh sibh go léir leis sin. Every woman and every man has the right to be treated with dignity and respect. All workers, regardless of the company they work for or who they are contracted to, deserve an environment where they are treated with dignity and respect and are not subjected to discrimination. I believe all the members would agree with that. Ensuring a safe and respectful working environment for everyone working in the arts and in the creative industries is one of the most important issues I have engaged with as Minister. Every person has the right to dignity in the workplace. Damaging behaviours such as bullying, harassment and victimisation will not be tolerated across this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_209"> Over the past number of years, report after report points to unacceptable behaviours in the arts and creative sector right across the spectrum from inappropriate language and insults to sexual assault and violence.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">The fact that similar behaviours have emerged in other sectors is cold comfort and I believe it is my responsibility, as Minister with responsibility for culture and the arts, to take action to ensure that such behaviours in the creative sectors are consigned to history.</p>
          <p eId="para_211"> In this important area of work, my Department has partnered with the Irish Theatre Institute, ITI. I am providing funding to the ITI which to date has amounted to €400,000. The ITI has been working in this area since 2017 to undertake extensive research and analysis, assist in the drafting of that, which will respond directly to the key issues, and work with my Department to implement those policies in an effective way that will, I hope, make a real and lasting difference to anyone working in this sector. Last year, the ITI undertook a landmark survey of the arts and culture sector, the results of which led to the launch of the Speak Up: A Call for Change report in November, with five important recommendations. Each of the five recommendations has a range of actions, all of which have been progressed by my Department, in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with agencies, Screen Ireland and the Arts Council. The recommendations include short-term actions, practical initiatives and the longer term challenge of changing mindsets, behaviours and culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_212"> Overall, in working through these recommendations and associated actions, I consider that there must be a fundamental change at a systemic level, which requires a change across society. In helping to achieve this, a comprehensive awareness campaign is under way in combination with practical initiatives, such as bystander training, to effectively tackle sexual and gender-based negative behaviours on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_213"> For the past year and a half, I have funded Minding Creative Minds to provide a range of counselling and advisory services to the creative sector, free of charge. Some €530,000 has been allocated to date for this very valuable service and I will continue to fund this into the future. The Minding Creative Minds service is a 24-7 confidential mental health and well-being support programme for the Irish creative community and is delivered by Spectrum Life. Over the past six months, my officials have been working closely with Minding Creative Minds to expand its existing services and to incorporate some of the recommendations contained in the report, namely, offering specialised support for victims. Minding Creative Minds is in the process of road-testing these additional services to ensure that practices are up to the necessary standard. I expect this work will be completed shortly and that I will be in a position to make announcements soon. It is very important, in such a sensitive area, that the services are adequately tested before they are rolled out to the public as each and every case may represent a traumatised individual. Appropriate consideration for the victims of these damaging behaviours is vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_214"> Resourcing availability of information is another key focus of the work under way and the Irish Theatre Institute has been working on developing a new website which will incorporate elements of all five recommendations, and will have relevant resources and information available, including sectoral codes of behaviour, policy documents and other toolkits for artists and arts organisations. It will also have an online register whereby organisations can formally sign up to the code of behaviour and publicly declare their commitment to its implementation. This should help to build awareness and transparency across the sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_215"> Screen Ireland is collaborating with the Arts Council to develop bystander intervention training, which should be ready to roll out next month. Screen Ireland is also developing a suite of dedicated online training tools for arts organisations, artists and arts workers. These include self-led training, free of charge, in bullying and harassment and in unconscious bias. There will be additional bespoke elements for particular areas, for example, intimacy co-ordination for stage and screen. It is intended that these will be self-led. It is planned that the basic self-led modules, such as bullying and harassment, will ultimately become compulsory for workers in all organisations receiving grant funding from the Arts Council and Screen Ireland. The Arts Council and Screen Ireland are also introducing a new condition of funding for all recipients of grant funding whereby they must confirm that they have taken all necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour on behalf of a board member or staff members.</p>
          <p eId="para_216"> In the meantime, I continue to engage with stakeholders and all interested groups, as do officials in my Department. I have had many meetings that have been helpful to me and, in particular, I recall Fair Plé telling me that I was the first Minister to engage with it. Most recently, I had a very constructive meeting with members of Safe Arts of Ireland, some of whom gave evidence to this committee. I assured them that I would continue work to implement Speak Up: A Call for Change and would keep them updated in the coming weeks and months.</p>
          <p eId="para_217"> I am pleased that the committee has taken a strong interest in this issue and am happy to take questions from members. Tá dul chun cinn maith déanta again. Tús maith leath na hoibre ach tá bóthar fada le siubhal againn fós. Tá súil agam go mbeidh muid ag taisteal le chéile. We have made good progress but we still have a long road to travel. I hope we will do this together.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">I thank the Minister. Having read the opening statement, we can see the Minister has comprehensively addressed the issues. I welcome the level of interest she has shown in this issue, which has been of concern to the committee. The fact that she met with Fair Plé and the other groups is very positive. We have had quite a number of witnesses before the committee who have expressed concern and, obviously, some of them have been particularly brave in coming forward to express their point of view. It is essential, whatever the environment in the arts, in music and in the other areas under the Minister's remit, that everybody feels the environment is safe. Although the education system is not entirely the Minister's brief, a lot of work is being done in that area. Is there any more that can be done within that space?</p>

          <p eId="para_221">In any context, we have to ensure there is safety in the workplace. For example, great work is being done in Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, where education and tuition are being provided in traditional Irish music and Comhaltas is the main body doing that. I look forward to the return of the Fleadh in Mullingar. Following the launch, Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann, which is directly funded by my Department, welcomed the Speak Up: A Call for Change initiative as a timely report and Comhaltas stated its mission as being all-embracing and inclusive of everyone, regardless of race, religion or ability. Comhaltas has its Cothromaíocht: Respect, Equality, Opportunity programme, which details statistically its status in regard to gender balance throughout the organisation. It outlines the delivery of a range of training and mentoring supports, which are vital, as well as resources designed to advance a positive and lasting culture of respect and dignity throughout Comhaltas, which really is an education setting. I welcome that. Comhaltas updated me on that as recently as 13 May. It reported that it had delivered a wide range of training, including modules on a positive working environment and on its gender mainstreaming strategy, as well as reviewing and upgrading its websites and social media platforms.</p>

          <p eId="para_224">It is important that there should be a place where people can go to register their complaints anonymously and have a sense that they are being taken seriously. This is an initiative that Safe Arts of Ireland talked about and it referred to similar facilities being available in some of our third level institutions, as I know from my engagement with it, and UCD in particular must be noted in this regard. Safe Arts of Ireland has asked for a new independent body to which complaints can be made by non-contracted workers, contracted workers and artists. My Department has been working on this for some months now in partnership with the ITI and in collaboration with Minding Creative Minds.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">Progress is being made, and I am hopeful I will be in a position to make an announcement on that issue in the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_226"> As for the matter of investigation of allegations of assault, sexual assault and rape, An Garda Síochána is the civil authority in the State for policing and investigation, and that should not change. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has reported that every Garda division in the country now has a divisional protective services unit with specially trained officers available when victims of domestic or sexual violence present to the Garda. As for a place where people can go to register complaints anonymously, I have a sense that that is being taken seriously. It is being progressed in my Department.</p>

They must have in place appropriate policies dealing with workplace bullying and harassment. In line with the Arts Council equality, human rights and diversity policy, and in compliance with the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2015, they must avoid any form of discriminatory practice and have regard for the need to promote equal opportunities in the area of work. In the event of any board member or member of staff having behaved illegally, wrongfully or inappropriately or in breach of relevant policies and procedures in respect of any person, or in the event of the grant recipient becoming aware of any allegation or complaint that any board member or member of staff has behaved in such a manner, the grant recipient must take all necessary actions in respect of such board member or member of staff to ensure absolutely the safety and protection of such persons and members of the public.

          <p eId="para_232">I will have to come back to the Deputy on those exact details. As for the progress that has been made, I hope, by way of progress next month, to be able to launch a range of actions. What I can tell the Deputy about the website is that it will incorporate a code of behaviour, which I think I referred to in an earlier contribution, that organisations in the sector will be asked to adopt voluntarily. The code will include the following broad key principles: zero tolerance of the seven damaging behaviours, along with policies and procedures to maintain the code; published procedures for accepting complaints of damaging behaviour from individuals while protecting them from reprisal or retaliation; timely investigation and resolution of complaints of damaging behaviour; and awareness-raising of unacceptable behaviour in the workplace and roll-out of training using free training resources, ultimately to all workers in the organisation. In due course it will be expected that all organisations that receive or hope to receive funding from the State will adopt the code of behaviours. That is one element of the website that I can share with Deputy Munster. The dedicated website will also incorporate a dignity-at-work toolkit containing comprehensive information on supports and resources for all arts workers.</p>

          <p eId="para_234">The main step is that continued funding would require grantees to self-certify that they have not had an allegation of bullying, harassment or sexual harassment upheld against them for which a current disciplinary warning or sanction is in place. As Minister, I assure the committee that it is my firm policy intention that organisations that are not found to be providing a safe working environment for artists and arts workers will risk disallowing themselves from future funding streams. Damaging behaviour is simply unacceptable. While I fully expect organisations across the sector to embrace this agenda and to respond proactively to the matters raised in the survey, I wish to be crystal clear that where that is not the case, funding is at risk - full stop.</p>

I have made it crystal clear that I am very committed to this. As I said, I am making it crystal clear that funding is at risk unless this is adhered to. The vast majority of funding of the arts sector, as Deputy Munster will know, is disbursed by the Arts Council and Screen Ireland, agencies that are independent in their funding decisions. Both agencies have already been very clear in their approach to dignity at work and expectations that dignity at work policies are required for continued funding. They have known from their very first engagements with me early on that I am absolutely committed to this. The Irish Theatre Institute and my Department will continue to work with both agencies on this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_245">I thank the Minister and her officials for staying with us to discuss this. I commend the Irish Theatre Institute, the Arts Council and the Department for helping to bring this report together and Jane Daly and Siobhán Burke, who worked on the report. When they were before the committee they said that just after this report was launched, another was launched by, I think, the Law Society. As the Minister says, this is an issue across the entirety of our society and all its sectors, but that is cold comfort. No one wants to talk down any industry, but when there are problems we need to acknowledge and to address them.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">I have engaged with people over the years, like the women in FairPlé and the #misefosta women who came out online as well, who have led the way in getting this committee to address the issue and progress the conversation with the Department. I want to commend all of those people and express my solidarity with them. There has been a lack of research in the arts and culture for years and we have been relying on outdated data. It is important we continue to develop data and this is just one example of that. Is there any plan to keep an eye on all of the art forms in terms of research and data? This was obviously an Irish Theatre Institute report and it mentions everything from traditional arts to theatre. Are there plans in terms of research across all the different art forms?</p>
          <p eId="para_247"> The second question relates to the talk about funding conditionality. The agencies have various requirements. Can I be confident that the Department has the same requirements as the agencies do? The Arts Council seems to set a very high bar. It allocates funding to the tune of €130 million thanks to the Department's increased allocations. Screen Ireland allocates €36 million. The Department allocates a significant amount of money to organisations. Can I be assured the same rigorous application process for moneys takes place by way of the Department's funding channels as it does in the Arts Council or Screen Ireland, for example? Does the Minister have any numbers in terms of people who have engaged with Minding Creative Minds for counselling and advisory services? How many people have used that service?</p>

          <p eId="para_248">I thank all members who have commended the work of our Department but the people who deserve credit here are the women who have spoken up so bravely. It was striking. The bravery was remarkable during my engagement with them and I commend them. Things are changing because they spoke up and engaged with us. I mention also the survey done by the Irish Theatre Institute. I want to take a moment to praise these women and commend them on their bravery. I have heard their voices as they bravely told their stories of discrimination and sexual harassment and that is why we are absolutely committed to it. It is a priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_249"> Senator Warfield asked whether we were as rigid as the Arts Council. It is worked into our service level agreement so that absolutely is the case. I do not have the numbers here for those who accessed Minding Creative Minds services but we can come back to him on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_250"> On further surveys, the speak up survey was really the first of its kind. It was made possible because it was funded in its entirety by the Department and carried out by the Department's partners. Since the publication of the report in November, it has been my intention that further surveys will be carried out in line with recommendation five of the report. I will provide funding accordingly. We are already discussing the next round of research.</p>
          <p eId="para_251"> One of the issues will be the marketing of the survey. My officials will be proactive in seeking the assistance of resource organisations such as the national campaign for the arts, in encouraging as many people in the arts and creative sectors to complete the survey.</p>
          <p eId="para_252"> I see the potential in the basic income for the arts pilot as a research project. It might throw up some interesting data on this because it will give artists the independence to say "No". That might come out of the research. They might say they were not comfortable working in a particular area. We can then delve deeper into that. There is potential in the basic income that might reach out to more people in the sector. I think they were all the issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_254">Congratulations to you, Minister, and to your colleagues and to the women, as you pointed out so powerfully, who have been part of this endeavour. We have arrived at a point where we have a roadmap ahead of us to ensure a safe space and safe participation for women in all aspects of our musical and theatre tradition. As the Minister pointed out in her contribution, not alone are there going to be very significant impositions placed on the bodies that represent the sector but there is also going to be a very comprehensive set of resources and tool kits available. It is exceptionally important that, as a condition of funding, organisations in receipt of grant funding must confirm that they have taken all the necessary actions over complaints of poor behaviour. We also need to provide some of these organisations that do not have the in-house expertise to be able to develop good practice within their organisations to access resources online or wherever else that allows them to do exactly that. I stress again that this is an equally important part of the endeavour. Well done on providing that. That brings us to the conclusion of this session.</p>
