It is proposed this agreed proposal be noted.  However, it is also proposed it be forwarded for their information to the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Joint Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.No. 3 on the agenda is justice and home affairs measures.  I refer to item No. 117513/09 COPEN 247 + COR 1.  Given that concerns have been raised about the legal basis of this proposal, its possible implications for domestic legislation and that Oireachtas approval may be required if the Government decides to opt in to the proposal, it is proposed it warrants further scrutiny.  To this end, it is proposed it be forwarded to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights for detailed scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.
