Although she was born in Kilkenny, Vicky was a Limerick woman and a tremendous advocate for women's health. Her honourable request was that action be taken immediately on cervical checks. We are all obliged to do so as parliamentarians. Last month, University Hospital Limerick asked members of the public not to attend the emergency department unless absolutely necessary. Nobody would attend the emergency department in Limerick unless it was absolutely necessary because people could end up staying there for 30 to 60 hours before being seen. Last month, University Hospital Limerick was under huge pressure. We are now in the winter months and the number of people being treated on trolleys at University Hospital Limerick remains high. By autumn, we had already seen the total number of people treated on trolleys exceed the number in the entirety of 2021. Halfway through November, 767 people have been treated on trolleys. As I am sure the Minister of State is aware, Covid-19 and seasonal flu presentations will put additional pressure on staff at UHL. Record numbers are being treated on trolleys, and high numbers are presenting to the emergency department. None of this is new to the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, or to previous Ministers. I have outlined this situation to them for seven years, since I was elected, but it seems to get worse rather than better each month. One would have thought the HIQA report, following its visit to the emergency department of UHL on 15 March, would have spurred the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, into reacting. He is well aware that in three of four categories in which it was measured, the hospital was found to be non-compliant. Despite this damning report, the issues continue. The emergency department continues to see high numbers of presentations. The University Limerick Hospitals Group advised that, in 2021, there were 76,473 presentations, and projects that the number will increase by 4% by the end of 2022. This is a huge stress on the functioning of the hospital. Of those 76,473 presentations in 2021, 8,720 waited for more than 12 hours to be treated. Not only is that a significant inconvenience for these people, it is also unsafe. It is worth reminding the Dáil, as I have said on numerous occasions, that the Royal College of Emergency Medicine in the UK notes there is, on average, one excess death per every 67 patients waiting in an emergency department for eight to 12 hours. The vast majority of staff, including porters, kitchen staff, ambulance paramedics, doctors and consultants do an exceptional job in this impossible situation. However, staff cannot continue to work this way. Patients need to have more dignity when, unfortunately, they need assistance at a hospital. I am concerned that if the situation continues, we will have avoidable deaths and accidents. I have been contacted almost daily, as I am sure have other public representatives in the mid-west, by patients and their families about the treatment of their loved ones at the hospital. We have all had reports of dementia patients being able to leave the hospital and go missing. We have had feedback from others that they simply cannot get a response from the hospital when they try to call for updates on their loved ones. The hospital is short by at least 68 non-consultant doctors, as the Minister confirmed to me in a parliamentary question, and by at least 200 beds, as the report states. Filling in these gaps would only bring the hospital on par a with hospitals of a similar size in the State. The Deloitte report went further and found that an additional 302 inpatient beds and 63 daycare beds are needed by 2026. It also outlined the demand for additional staff in the emergency department, with 83% of beds allocated to those who presented through the emergency department. A new 96-bed unit is under construction but it will only offer 48 additional beds, with half of the stock replacing old beds. Will the Minister of State outline what contingency plans are in place for the coming months so that seasonal presentations can be managed and staff have the opportunity to work in decent conditions? Will the Minister of State confirm if the Minister has planned for it all?

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, so I will keep to the script. I recognise the long-standing interest of the Deputy in the development of healthcare at University Hospital Limerick and the entire mid-west. We are all familiar with the difficulties faced by UHL. It was in consideration of those difficulties that the Minister visited the hospital in February this year. Following that visit, he requested a HSE expert team to review the day-to-day functioning of the emergency department in UHL. The HSE's performance management and improvement unit, PMIU, led an intensive engagement with the hospital group and mid-west community healthcare organisation, CHO, throughout the summer in response to the Minister's concerns and the findings of the HIQA report published in June this year. The PMIU worked with UHL to support and oversee the implementation of rapid improvements in services in the region. These measures include a renewed focus on hospital avoidance, patient flow and discharge planning, and regular and frequent assessment of patients with long stays in hospital. In addition to the review requested by the Minister, UHL commissioned Deloitte to review and advise on unscheduled care and patient flow in the hospital. This review was published in September. Its key recommendations include the opening and staffing of the acute medical assessment unit on a 24-7 basis and the recruitment of an additional 20 non-consultant hospital doctors, four emergency medicine consultants and dedicated paediatric nursing staff. They also include a review of health and social care professional staffing levels, an additional 202 acute beds and 63 day beds by 2036, and improved access to primary care through additional places for GP training schemes and expansion of GP access to diagnostics. In addition to this work, the Minister launched the 2022 waiting list action plan, as the first year of a multi-annual approach to reducing waiting lists and waiting times. The €350 million funding allocated to the HSE and the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, this year has been primarily focused on providing additional public and private activity to reduce waiting lists, but also to lay the foundations of important multi-annual reforms that will deliver sustained reductions in waiting lists. This work will continue in 2023, with €443 million allocated to tackle waiting lists, including €123 million in funding for delivery of the HSE waiting list action plan, €150 million for the NTPF to procure additional capacity, and €90 million for additional short-term measures to address acute scheduled care waiting list backlogs.There has been significant investment in infrastructure in UHL in recent times. Work has commenced on a new four-storey, 96 single bed acute inpatient ward block. In 2021, a new 60-bed modular ward block opened. This follows the completion of two separate rapid-build projects constructed in response to the Covid-19 emergency, which provided an additional 38 inpatient beds on site at UHL. I would like to assure the Deputies that the work underway to address capacity issues at UHL will make a significant difference to patient experience at UHL. The Department of Health continues to work closely with the HSE to ensure UHL is fully supported and that the necessary improvements are actioned in a timely manner.

The reality is there has been a catastrophic failure of the hospital. The situation cannot continue in the current manner. Yesterday I spoke to a woman whose husband is in UHL. After days in the emergency department, ED, he was sent to the ward. The sheets on the bed he was given were filthy. His young son who visited him later left the room because he could not stand the smell. This is simply outrageous. We deserve much better than this. Under the current management, crisis has become normal. The perpetual crisis at the hospital demonstrates that the management team is not up to the task. A new approach and a new team are needed. Patients deserve much better than they are getting. Simple things do not work in the hospital. People do not have blankets when waiting in the emergency department. They are cold and hungry. The toilets quite often are not cleaned properly. These are simple things that can be fixed. Pandemic bonuses were announced in January and still thousands of workers remain without them. These are people who took the risks in our hospitals when the rest of us were able to shelter at home. I would like to mention one positive note. That is the introduction at the hospital of the pathfinder programme. It is a welcome addition which it is to be hoped will deflect some of the elderly patients away from the ED without compromising their care. This should lead to improvements in waiting times at the emergency department while removing the possibility of infection for those elderly citizens who otherwise would have to sit in the ED waiting room. However, as is always the case in this hospital, it is too little too late when it comes to action and health. The recent report I referred to earlier commissioned by the UHL group requires a proper Government response. It has detailed what we already knew, namely, that we have an overcrowding and capacity issue at UHL. It is time for the Minister for Health to step up and address the capacity in a much better way than he has been doing up to this. Staffing and management issues at the hospital need to be addressed as well. An additional 48 beds will not solve the problem. We need a minimum of 202 beds. There is no tackling the crisis at UHL unless we get to grips with this, the people of Limerick and the mid-west will continue to suffer in the emergency department due to Government inaction and a failure to act and invest with the proper money, resources and staffing we need.

Significant efforts are being made to ensure the issues, such as overcrowding in the emergency department and delays for elective care at UHL, are being addressed as a matter of priority. As I noted, following the Minister, Deputy Donnelly's, intervention earlier this year, the performance management improvement unit of the HSE immediately engaged with the hospital group and the CEO under the HSE performance accountability framework. This is to provide the intensive support needed to ensure the necessary improvements in services for the region are achieved. These measures include a renewed focus on hospital avoidance, patient flow and discharge planning, and regular and frequent assessment of patients with long stays in hospital. This work, along with the broader efforts and the considerable funding made available through the waiting list action plan, will provide significant assistance in addressing capacity issues at UHL and across the hospital group. The Government is fully aware of the impact overcrowding and hospital capacity issues have on patients and their families in the mid-west. I assure the House that intensive efforts are under way to address the difficulties currently facing UHL, and those efforts will proceed as long as required. The Department of Health will continue to work with the HSE to ensure support for the improvement of services for all patients attending the hospital.
#HollyCairns	unknown-#HollyCairns-party	unknown-#HollyCairns-dob	unknown-#HollyCairns-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	5	A group of young adults in Beara, west Cork, need a bus to access training and day services in Bantry, which is more than an hour's drive for some of them. These are incredibly important facilities that not only offer education but also give them social, emotional, and employment opportunities. This issue initially arose during the summer when the need became apparent. However, it became clear that Local Link in the area did not have the resources to provide this service. Two groups very generously recognised the need and enabled a temporary solution. The St. Vincent de Paul and Beara West Family Resource Centre stepped in where the State had failed. The young people themselves are making weekly contributions from their disability allowance. Besides the fact it should not fall to local civil society organisations to pay, it is a temporary fix that is only in place until Christmas. Now the young people, their families and colleagues are deeply worried about what will happen in the new year, which is only weeks away. In the words of the people themselves who are now using the service, "We are now at crisis point." It is clear that funding must be provided by the Government. In a letter I received from one of the young people she explained that:The uncertainty associated with my future is causing me and my family great stress, anxiety, and sadness. We are overwhelmed and unsure of where to go next.At the end of the letter she stressed:I am very concerned about what will happen in January, I do not know how I will be able to continue in education without support. This group's case highlights the need for an integrated approach to disability. It is not only about the services but also about being able to access them. This problem is even more pronounced in rural Ireland, as the Minister of State will be aware. Bantry has incredible facilities, with the National Learning Network, RehabCare and CoAction offering a fantastic range of training courses and day services. However, people have to travel a considerable distance to get to them, especially people living on the Beara and Sheep's Head peninsulas. In this case the local community and organisations have gone above and beyond. While this is welcome, it is a public service that should be provided by the State. Especially jarring is that these young people who are living on fixed incomes through disability and related payments have to pay towards the bus themselves. People in similar situations in larger towns and cities can avail of free public transport, so this now becomes a matter of inequality. The existing public transport routes do not offer the buses at suitable times every weekday, meaning that a bespoke service is the only option. These young people have a right to access education and support, which includes transport. We have examined these issues at the Committee on Disability Matters. In fact, when the National Learning Network from Bantry appeared at the committee, the importance of transport arose. The network representatives highlighted how they regularly have to fight for transport and work with public bodies and private companies to come up with solutions. There is no good in having a service if people cannot access it. This is about joined-up thinking. Cork Local Link has been working with the stakeholders and public representatives in trying to solve this, but ultimately it comes down to resources. There needs to be funding for this service. Will the Minister of State personally look into this, please?
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	6	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. I am told by the HSE that a number of young persons with a disability attend both the RT programme and day services in the Beara area. An arrangement has been in place for a number of years between RehabCare and Local Link for these service users living in this area to be collected in the morning, brought to their service and brought home in the evening. This is because the geographic location is rural and there was no existing transport service in place via the National Transport Authority, NTA, at the time. Unfortunately, the HSE has said it is not aware of any difficulties with this existing transport arrangement for these service users accessing RehabCare services. As a result, officials in the Department of Health made contact with the Department of Transport on the issue. In an update provided through the NTA rural transport programme, the TFI Local Link Cork office confirmed that the service in question is a long-standing one and is a HSE co-funded service. However, TFI Local Link Cork says it is not aware of any issues with this service. For example, no passengers are being left behind. It confirmed that nothing has changed recently and no changes are being proposed to the service by TFI Local Link. However, I know from local media reports and the fact the Deputy is raising the matter this morning that there clearly is some form of issue, which I hope we can address in some way here. It is important for me to note that it is disappointing for me to tell the House this morning that different agencies are seemingly oblivious to the potential issue when a quick Google search shows Beara West Family Resource Centre has flagged the issues with Local Link in Bantry, while parents have also approached Local Link in the area. There has clearly been a breakdown in communication somewhere along the line, which it is to be hoped we can resolve.I am grateful for the additional information set out by the Deputy. To be honest, my script has changed four times in the past 24 hours because we have been trying to get input from the various agencies. We sorted it out this morning on Google. We had to go to Google to actually see what is happening in Beara. I will take this up because I do not think people in their various offices realise the impact on young people with additional needs who are trying to get to their day services or rehabilitative training. The importance of this training is that it is their next step into paid employment. If we do not have the links in place, how can we expect to support families or young people with additional needs? The whole idea of the school leaver programme is to ensure we scaffold people to know exactly where the services are, how they can get to them and how those services can be depended upon, as opposed to having people in offices telling me yesterday and today they are not aware of any issues.

She mentioned that people in west Beara have approached Local Link. I assure the Minister of State that I have also met with Local Link on this issue. It is doing everything it can to try to find additional funding support. At present, it simply does not have the funds to provide an additional service. It already runs free services for which it fundraises, including transport to addiction services in west Cork. I assure the Minister of State that Local Link is doing its level best. It just needs more funding to be able to provide this service. The young people concerned currently have a temporary service. It is a matter of saving it and its positive impact. In essence, the solution is ready and in place. It just needs the Government funding. I pay tribute to the young people and their families who have campaigned tirelessly on this issue, in addition to the local St. Vincent de Paul community and Beara West Family Resource Centre. They should all be acknowledged. The rural community has shown what is possible. It is now time for the Government to support it. The integration of services is crucial. As the Minister of State mentioned, we have some of the highest rates of unemployment among disabled people in the EU and high levels of social exclusion and poverty. We need to do everything we can to support dynamic young people like these. Some of those who attend the National Learning Network in Bantry have an incredible success rate. Last year, 92% of the students there progressed to either part- or full-time employment or further education and training. That is an incredible figure, rivalling the universities in Cork. Enabling their access to this facility is not only about their rights; it is potentially life-changing. This situation also underlines the need for improved public transport more generally on the Beara Peninsula. I do not know if the Minister of State knows this, but the Connecting Ireland plan would see Castletownbere being classified as a local route rather than a regional one, which would downgrade the entire connectivity of the Beara Peninsula, when we all know there are no public services there that people could access. This case provides clear evidence of the need for that to change. With dependable daily transport, these young people and others could access training, employment, day services, social outlets and so on. As the new year approaches, we need a solution to this matter. Given the emotion surrounding it, the sooner clarity can be provided, the better. I again thank the Minister of State for her response.

I ask her to bear with me as we get to the bottom of it. It is very clear from Google that the family resource centre raised in excess of €10,000 to keep the bus on the road. I will talk to the Minister for Transport over the coming days and engage with the NTA. It is also important to realise that, within disability services, I pay out more than €54 million a year to support transport. There is surely a way the Department of Transport and the Department of Health can work together to ensure that where there are more local areas, everybody who can attend services gets on the bus. On paid employment, as the Deputy said, that education piece from transitional school leaving to the National Learning Network, the rehabilitative training programmes and on into paid employment are the opportunities we are talking about. They should not just be opportunities but a right for everybody, regardless of their geographic location, to be able to attend. I will come back to the Deputy.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18242	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	9	It has come to my attention in recent days that it is the intention of the Courts Service to move sittings of District Court No. 20 in Mallow, County Cork, and centralise those services in Cork city. I wish to express my grave concern at such a move, given that the District Court in Mallow serves a large geographical area that extends as far as the County Kerry border and north to County Limerick. If it is the case that the Courts Service's intention is to move District Court sittings to Cork city, it will have a massive impact on the administration of justice in the region I represent. I say that because Mallow hosts sittings in respect of criminal and civil proceedings on the first, second, third and fourth Tuesday of each month. It also hosts juvenile and family cases on the first Wednesday of each month and childcare and HSE proceedings on the second Wednesday of each month. I am given to understand the sittings will move to Washington Street in Cork city. I am also given to understand that the Courts Service administration will be retained in Mallow. I am deeply worried that it is now Courts Service policy to centralise more and more District Court sittings. This is happening without any proper scrutiny of that policy. We are very limited in what we can do to scrutinise that. The only opportunity Deputies have to do so is to raise it as a Topical Issue matter because we are told the Courts Service is independent, as it should be. We acknowledge that and there is no question about it. There are issues, however, relating to the administration of justice. I am particularly concerned about the family courts and the seeking of specific orders. For instance, if a woman, and it is largely women, comes before the court to seek protection regarding a domestic or gender-based violence issue, that service will not be available at the most local level within the District Court. That person will now be forced to go to Cork city and may not be in a position to do so. I am genuinely worried - this happened in Youghal and is now happening in Mallow - that there is no scrutiny of what the Courts Service is doing. I ask the Minister of State to use his good offices to intervene with the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, if at all possible. The Minister has put particular emphasis on combating gender-based violence and has acknowledged the "stark", to use her word, domestic violence figures that exist in this country. If we remove the ability of people to get access to the courts at the most local level through District Court sittings and force them to travel further to seek justice and to interface with the administration of justice, that is a poor showing on the part of the Courts Service. I ask the Government at least to intervene to ensure the District Court sittings at Mallow will continue to be hosted there.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	10	I convey the apologies of my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, who regrets she cannot attend for this matter due to a prior commitment. On behalf of the Minister, I thank Deputy Sherlock for raising this important matter and for giving me the opportunity to provide clarity on the issues he raised. As the Deputy will be aware, management of the courts, operational matters and logistical functions are the responsibility of the Judiciary and the Courts Service, which are independent in exercising their functions under the Courts Service Act 1998, given the separation of powers in the Constitution. The Minister has no role in the exercise of Courts Service functions. All that being said, it is the Minister's understanding that the Office of Public Works, OPW, commissioned a report in late April 2021 to identify remedial works required at Mallow Courthouse. The project involves addressing and rectifying water ingress issues throughout the building in Mallow.Defective elements include pitched and flat roofs, windows and parts of the exterior walls. The refurbishment will also include fire safety upgrades in line with modern building standards. The works in Mallow are due to take approximately six months and the cost is likely to be about €1.2 million. The refurbishment works to Mallow courthouse will ensure the future of courts and court services in Mallow and surrounding areas. During the refurbishment period, the Courts Service in Mallow is opening a public office and counter at the courthouse in Fermoy town. This building has holding cells, consultation rooms, courtrooms and an office. It is planned that all sittings of the District Court will be held in Fermoy for the duration of the refurbishment works. All Circuit Court sittings will move to Anglesea Street courthouse in Cork city for the project's duration. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, has been informed by the Courts Service that no staff will be in Mallow courthouse as the extent of the refurbishments will necessitate vacant possession for the builders. All counter queries and phone calls will be directed to Fermoy court office for the duration of the project. In the case of domestic violence applications, these will be dealt with by telephone initially and applicants can bring supporting information with them directly to the next scheduled court sitting. Mallow courthouse plays a vital role in the local community and its refurbishment is to be welcomed. The Courts Service has embarked on a multi-year programme of modernisation to enhance the delivery of services to the people. This programme is focused on designing court services around the user, leveraging digital technology to streamline services and processes, and ultimately delivering a courts system which is more accessible to all. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is committed to driving the modernisation and Digital First agenda across the entire justice sector and particularly welcomes the commitment set out by the Courts Service in its corporate strategic plan 2021-2023 to maximise the use of digital technologies to provide an improved and user-centred service. In April of this year, the courts modernisation programme approved an additional investment of €3.1 million for a three-year programme to provide 54 more video technology-enabled courtrooms, in addition to 104 already in operation. Further additional funding of €2.5 million has been provided for the modernisation programme in budget 2023 to build on significant investment in the sector. I hope that clarifies the issue for the Deputy.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18242	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	11	I thank the Minister of State. I have received some comfort from his response in regard to the remedial works that are to be carried out. However, it was my firm contention, and perhaps I should have made this clearer, that it is about the loss of court sittings in Mallow. I contend it would have been very easy to provide alternative accommodation within the town of Mallow itself and not to have to send people further to Fermoy and Cork in respect of Circuit Court sittings. For instance, the Courts Service could have engaged with the local GAA club, which has ample facilities to be able to make provision for court sittings. It is the loss of a service to a town. Although I acknowledge it is on a temporary basis, the fear is that once services get consolidated to another court, they do not return, and we have Youghal as an example. The Minister of State has given us some assurances but, whether the Courts Service listens to these debates or not, it is vital there is some sort of confirmation directly from the Courts Service that it is its intention, absolutely and utterly, to ensure our services will be returned to Mallow post the completion of remedial works. I still need to interpret the words of the Minister of State in respect of the domestic violence provisions. I reiterate that it is about ensuring that where there is a Government policy specifically spearheaded by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in regard to combating gender-based violence, and with the Minister herself acknowledging the stark figures in regard to domestic violence, we do not put in place impediments for women in particular where there is a necessity to ensure the services are within their own town or as near as possible. I seek assurances those services will be returned.

It is obviously a concern to the Deputy and to any community if there is a fear of a loss of services. I am confident, given the initial reply supplied to me by the Department of Justice, that there is a clear intention to restore the existing level of service to Mallow once the refurbishment works have been carried out. I know Mallow quite well, although the Deputy knows it better than I do. Suffice it to say it is a significant population centre and it is a centre which should have the full services of the Courts Service available to the public and citizens of Mallow and surrounding areas that rely on Mallow for that kind of service. The Deputy is right when he says the administration of justice, first, has to be timely but, second, has to be accessible. Unfortunately, many people who have to access the courts are vulnerable and one of the challenges they experience when having to access any service is travel and availability. Therefore, it is incumbent on the State and the Courts Service to retain the services. It would be proper for the Department of Justice to have the Courts Service confirm to the Deputy in writing that the full level of service which is now available will be returning post the refurbishment period.

I gcontae an Aire Stáit, tá bealach ann idir Átha Cliath agus Luimneach, agus tá bealaí eile idir Corcaigh, Port Láirge agus Béal Feirste. Tá bearna mhór ann faoi láthair san iarthuaisceart, idir Doire agus Átha Cliath. Sin an fáth gur ardaigh mé an cheist seo faoi na rudaí tábhachtacha seo. The Minister of State is welcome. I am delighted he is here because I know that, as he represents Limerick, he will know the value and importance of connectivity. The things that motorists travelling from Limerick to Dublin will take for granted would be not to have cows on the road or tractors holding up traffic for 10 km or 20 km, which is the case in the north west. I appreciate the Minister of State being here. I ask him to use his influence in his position on two specific points, one being the A5. First, I acknowledge the commitment of the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste in regard to the shared island initiative, and there is reference to the A5 within the shared island programme. The Minister of State might update us on the public inquiry, which I believe is due to be held in January 2023, and it is hoped progress can be made after that. I also want to raise the issue of the trans-European transport network, TEN-T, bypassing Stranorlar and Ballybofey - the twin towns, the connectivity between Lifford and Letterkenny, and the Bunnagee link road. We have been waiting a long time for this companion link with the A5, for want of a different expression. It is important and it has to be delivered. These points have been highlighted, emphasised and re-emphasised for a long time. We can offer a serious counterbalance to Dublin and become a serious net contributor to the overall economy. A new motorway through the north west will provide modern electric charging stations, assisting in the reduction of carbon emissions. We have to try to ensure both of these projects are brought along in tandem. I know there is a strong, dedicated team working between Donegal County Council and that the national roads design office, NRDO, is also working on a business case. The Minister of State might have an update on that and, if not, he might provide that at a later stage. We have a new university in the north west. The Minister of State knows what has happened in Limerick over the past 20 to 30 years through having that university and having a strong presence of multinational companies and research and development.We are looking to the likes of Cork, Limerick and Galway to see how we can build on that.  Connectivity is key. When directors from major companies come to Donegal, they have to travel on a road that is not up to scratch. That is not right in terms of positive conversations. We now have a lot of remote working and an emphasis on healthcare. In my next contribution, I will raise the issue of tourism, which I know is close to the Minister of State's heart. I ask for an update on the A5 today, if possible. When will the public inquiry happen in the North? I want to acknowledge the team of workers in the Department for Infrastructure in the North, which is very focused on trying to bring the A5 to fruition. How can we advance the business case that dedicated team is working on? Will we move the two projects in tandem? They are really important for the north west and would be a massive game changer.

Once funding arrangements have been put in place with Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts, and in line with the national development plan, NDP, the planning, design, improvement and upgrading of individual national roads is a matter for TII, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. TII ultimately delivers the national roads programme in line with Project Ireland 2040 and the national planning framework, NPF. In the new NDP, launched in October 2021, approximately €5.1 billion was earmarked for new national roads projects to 2030. This funding will enable improved regional accessibility across the country, as well as compact growth, which are key national strategic outcomes. The funding will provide for the development of numerous national road projects, including the completion of projects that are already at construction stage and those close to it, as well as the development of a number of others. Exchequer funding under the new NDP will also facilitate continued protection and renewal of our national roads infrastructure, including motorways, in line with Government policy. The trans-European transport network, TEN-T, is a selection of strategic transport corridors throughout the EU that have been identified to play a key role in the mobility of goods and passengers through the EU. Three sections of the road network in Donegal have been prioritised for improvement and together they form the Donegal TEN-T priority route improvement project. The N15-N13 Ballybofey to Stranorlar bypass section consists of 9.5 km of mainline and 5.2 km of linking roads. Ballybofey and Stranorlar are connected via a multi-span arch bridge carrying the N15 over the River Finn. The N56-N13 Letterkenny to Manorcunningham section applies to the N56 and two legacy sections of the N13 south through the townland of Lurgybrack, serving the Atlantic corridor, and east towards Manorcunningham, serving the main route to Derry, Belfast and Dublin via Northern Ireland. It consists of 6.3 km of mainline and 2.3 km of link roads. The N14 Manorcunningham to Lifford section project begins at the junction between the N13 and N14. The majority of the project is on the N14 which connects Donegal and Letterkenny to Northern Ireland, Belfast and Dublin, through the Border crossing at Lifford in Donegal and Strabane in Tyrone. A peer review of the design and environmental assessment for all sections was held in September 2022. The project business case is expected to be ready for submission to the Department for approval at gate 1 of the public spending code in quarter 1 of 2023. The planning and implementation of the A5 upgrade project is the responsibility of the authorities in Northern Ireland. As is the case in all such capital projects, the A5 upgrade scheme is subject to a planning assessment and approval process in Northern Ireland. Since 2012 there have been a number of legal challenges, which have led to unavoidable delays to the implementation of the proposed scheme.  In 2017, the Department for Infrastructure decided to proceed with the A5 scheme. However, the decision was challenged and the decision to proceed was quashed by the High Court in November 2018 when the Department announced it would no longer defend the case. Following the conclusion of the legal action, the Department for Infrastructure updated environmental assessments for the project and undertook further public consultations. Despite the delays which have taken place, the public inquiry will be reopened in January 2023.

I wish to acknowledge the preparation of the officials in TII and the Department of Transport because they provided important information. The questions I raised were answered and I am grateful for that. It is important that the public start to believe this can happen because given all of the delays and false dawns regarding the A5, people have stopped believing in the project. It is important to send out a positive signal, and I thank the Minister of State for doing that today. I thank the officials and, most important, the dedicated team in Donegal County Council which has worked hard on this for a long time. It is good to hear that a business case for submission under gate 1 of the public spending code will be made in quarter 1, which is just around the corner in 2023. This information is in the public domain, but it is good to hear in the Dáil that the public inquiry into the reopening of the A5 will happen in January 2023. I thank the Minister of State for providing that information. I said I would mention tourism because it is the lifeblood of my county and requires connectivity. The Irish Hotels Federation, IFH, has a lobbying day today in Buswells Hotel and will raise issues around the criteria for energy cost supports, insurance and the 9% VAT rate. It is an area close to the Minister of State's heart and any support he can give to the lobby session today would be welcome.  I met Aisling Arnold, of Arnolds Hotel, this morning. Dunfanaghy has a small population, yet this one hotel employs 100 people. That gives us an idea of the significance and importance of tourism to many small towns and villages in our county. Aisling was very keen to point out that the business supports available during Covid kept that small independent businesses open. However, a number of challenges are coming down the track. Arnolds Hotel is celebrating 100 years in business this year and will hold celebrations in January. Having such a legacy of tourism in the county is important and it is important that we hold onto it. Anything the Minister of State can do on energy cost criteria supports, VAT rate, insurance and road connectivity in order to keep small independent businesses alive would be welcome.

Under this agreement, the Government is committed to providing funding of £75 million towards the cost of the A5 upgrade scheme once the statutory planning process in Northern Ireland has been concluded. The Government is committed to delivering on its funding commitment to the A5 project, which is also included in the New Decade, New Approach document of 2020. Allowing for the time required for the conclusion of the public inquiry and all new decisions to be implemented, together with the possibility of a further legal challenge, the timeframe for the delivery of the A5 project is still uncertain. However, provision of £25 million is being made by the Department of Transport in 2023 to fund the scheme, should this be required. Regarding the Donegal TEN-T projects, if approved at decision gate 1 of the public spending code, the next steps will be for work to commence on the statutory processes and the preparation of the project brief for the procurement strategy for gate 2 approval under the public spending code. On the benefits of the TENT-T projects, namely, the N13-N15 Ballybofey and Stranorlar project, through the provision of more efficient and safer journeys the project aims to enhance regional accessibility and improve connectivity and traffic flows to and from the north-west region. In addition, the project will improve the function and operation of road-based public transport locally and regionally. The project will provide significant active travel improvements through newly integrated cycle and pedestrian facilities and areas along the route will become more inviting for tourism. The project will reduce air pollution levels caused by the congested queueing of vehicles, traffic noise and the risk of watercourse pollution along the existing road.

— last month was the thirteenth consecutive month where Ireland's rate of inflation, as measured by the CPI, was greater than 5 per cent;— in Ireland, the cost of gas has spiked 93.3 per cent in the last 12 months, the cost of electricity by a staggering 71.2 per cent, the cost of home heating oil by 65 per cent, and solid fuels up 47 per cent;— the cost of heating and keeping the lights lit at home, in small businesses, schools and community facilities are becoming extremely challenging for many and forcing several more into undisputed poverty; — over the same period, the Government has completely failed to take any steps whatsoever to tackle the root causes of energy-induced inflation; and— during this energy cost inflation crisis, the Government has allowed energy suppliers in Ireland, including renewable energy producers, to make record financial profits on the back of ordinary Irish consumers;further notes that:— within Ireland's Integrated Single Electricity Market (I-SEM), there are markets for energy, generation capacity and system services, and this model includes day-ahead and intraday markets; — generators bid into these markets based on market rules, which are set by the Government and/or the Commission for Regulation of Utilities (CRU);— the market price is determined by these market rules and referred to as the marginal cost of generation capacity, therefore, forming a central component of the wholesale electricity price benchmark;— the average wholesale price for a megawatt hour (MWh) of electricity in August was €387.63, which is the highest monthly figure this year;— wholesale electricity prices decreased significantly by October in many European countries, including Ireland, due mainly to a temporary fall in the price of natural gas and an increase in wind energy production, yet consumers are not seeing the benefits of this;— while the market price is reduced when there are greater levels of lower cost generation, such as on windy days, the benefits to the public have been minimal or non-existent;— the high electricity prices being seen in Ireland are a direct result of the significant increases in natural gas prices but also of the massive profits being made by energy suppliers, including renewable producers, due to the marginal pricing model;— the price increases have severely impacted gas and electricity consumers nationwide, as the I-SEM in Ireland fails to protect the consumer; and— European Union (EU) Council Regulation 2022/1854, which entered into force on 8th October, 2022, with direct effect in Ireland, provides for emergency interventions, including a cap on market revenues that certain producers receive from the generation of electricity and lower price setting for supply to households and Small and Medium Enterprises;calls on the Government to:— outline the number of occasions over the past year that concerns over marginal pricing and the I-SEM mechanism have been raised with the CRU by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications; and— outline the number of occasions over the past year that the CRU, through its Market Monitoring unit which is required to monitor the behaviour of market participants in the I-SEM, have raised formal concerns or made determinations surrounding a lack of openness, transparency, or competition by market participants; andfurther calls on the Government to:— immediately implement, in full, the agreed objectives of EU Council Regulation 2022/1854 to:— reduce electricity consumption by power-hungry data centres, which now consume more electricity, 14 per cent of national usage, than all rural homes;— introduce a rigid cap on market revenues that energy producers here receive from the generation of electricity and redistribute those funds to final customers in a targeted manner;— note that the regulation outlines a maximum cap on market revenues of €180 ($180) per MWh for producers and intermediaries generating electricity from wind, solar, geothermal, hydropower, biomass fuel, waste, nuclear energy, lignite, crude petroleum products and peat;— accept that the cap is one of the best ways to reduce domestic and small business electricity prices, with renewable energy producers still well able to recover their investment and operating costs;— implement electricity price-setting for the supply of electricity for households and small- and medium-sized enterprises and accept that the current Irish wholesale pricing system is broken, as prices for all market participants are set by the last plant needed to cover the demand, which is the plant with the highest marginal costs when the market clears, and given the unprecedented rise in costs for gas and coal-fired power generation facilities, this generally results in such plants establishing the price and simultaneously results in exceptionally high prices in the day-ahead market, with renewable energy producers experiencing very significant increases in their revenues; and— immediately seek to implement an excess profit "solidarity tax", as provided for in EU regulation 2022/1854 upon all/any companies and permanent establishments operating within the oil, gas, coal and refinery sectors in Ireland, which include the Corrib gas field, and give these funds back to consumers to help pay for energy bills;— end the Government practice of having lucrative long-term deals with energy companies that allows them to inflate prices while obtaining Government subsidies, simultaneously burdening working-class consumers with sky-high energy bills; and— accept that the time for inaction is over, and it is no longer tenable to hide behind EU rules or regulations now that the road is cleared to implement a change of energy pricing policy that will directly benefit consumers.Everywhere I go, I am asked why energy prices are going up so much given we are using renewable energy sources, which all consumers can see on their electricity bills. These show that renewables account for more than 60% of our bill. The Rural Independent Group and I have made it our mission to find out about fuel costs. We have been shut down many times in this House over continuing to ask questions. Why is the production of wind energy costing the same as that of gas, oil, coal and peat? Gas, oil, coal, peat and renewables are all commodities for sale in the market. Gas is the most expensive commodity currently, so energy sold in the market will be sold to all the energy companies at this highest price. Some 96% of all wind energy produced in Ireland is priced at the same rate as gas, even though the production costs may be a fraction of the price charged. In layman's terms, if gas costs €1,000 per kWh and generating electricity via wind costs €10 per kWh, then the producer will sell to the providers at the highest component price, that is, at €1,000 per kWh. What is going on here? This is wrong. This is unlawful. Does the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, know this? Alternatively, does he know this and has he decided to ignore it? This is the Minister who went on Twitter last week and stated it was great that Ireland was producing all its wind energy cheaper than gas. We are, however, paying for wind energy at the same price as gas. Does the Minister of State get this? We are paying for wind energy, which accounts for 60% of our electricity bills, at the same price as gas because of an outdated regulation. There is no benefit to Irish consumers because we are paying the marginal cost, that is, the highest provider cost, of energy and this sets the parameter for all suppliers. This motion from the Rural Independent Group seeks to decouple the price of renewables from the marginal cost system, separate the pricing of renewables from that of fossil fuels, compare both and see where value lies. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has stated that the renewable suppliers, such as those producing wind energy, are being paid 600% more than the predicted price over 12 months. The predicted price at that stage was €50 per MWh. What are these suppliers getting today? They are getting €370 per MWh. This is the great wind farm rip-off, where greedy energy giants are selling us wind-generated electricity at sky-high wholesale gas prices. The massive wind energy generation companies operating here are making record profits by selling the energy generated by wind. We just want the Minister of State to get this part. On top of the energy costs we are paying, we have seen the ESB receive record prices and make €1.063 billion in profits last year. This company is 96% State-owned. At a meeting the Rural Independent Group had last week, it was explained to us that this has come about because of a regulation that must be changed. The benchmark for supplying energy in this country is based on the highest marginal cost, which at the moment is that for gas. For example, therefore, if we are producing wind energy at €10 per kWh while gas is costing €100 per kWh, this will mean we are paying €100 per kWh for wind energy. Again, this is wrong. This also includes the VAT receipts the Government takes back on energy. It is putting businesses out of business. On top of this, the Government is about to give €12.5 billion to green power and to these self-same wind farms under the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS. Our motion aims to implement European Council Regulation 2022/1854, that came into effect on 8 October 2022 and forces all member states to implement numerous measures to protect consumers, notably by capping the profits of wind energy producers and reducing energy consumption by sectors, such as data centres. The fundamental problem is not being looked at. I will say this again to the Minister of State to make him get this point. The fundamental problem is that all the energy sources contributing to the cost of our bills are being charged at the same high price as that of gas, even though we are producing wind energy at a low cost. These companies have all shown billions of euro in profits because of the regulation in place and now the Government wants to give them another €12.5 billion, despite these companies having absolutely cleaned out this country by charging us extortionate prices under a law that can be changed and in the context of an EU directive, which allows capping. The Government, however, has sat on the fence and done nothing to help people. Businesses are closing day in and day out because of energy costs. Inflation is at 9.7%, which is the highest level since 1984 according to the figures from the Central Statistics Office, CSO. The gift of €600 towards fuel costs is one of the drivers of inflation. It is no gift, but a token gesture. In the context of all the astronomical prices we are paying, through no fault of our own, we are only getting crumbs from the table. The Government is going to pay this €600 in segments of €200. Householders will get €200 provided towards their energy costs, but they will be paying for this energy at the level of gas prices, even though the energy companies are producing the energy at a lower cost. Under the regulation in place, however, the companies are required to charge a price at the high cost. The ESB has made a record profit of €1.063 billion, but it has been told it cannot give these profits back in any way to consumers because it would be regarded as below-cost selling under competition law and the Government would bring in representatives of the company and ask them why they were doing it, despite the ESB being 96% owned by the State. The €600 the Government has allocated to every household, therefore, is a gift, but an inflationary one. If we were to go to any butcher, coffee shop or any other employer, such employers would tell us their ESB bills have gone up by 500% and 600%. This means the cost of producing food and keeping freezers on, to protect it for people, has gone up by 600%. The Government then came out to say that it will pay a maximum of €10,000 to any business which can show its electricity costs have gone up. We are talking about businesses whose monthly ESB bills have gone from €1,000 to €6,000. These costs have jumped by 500%. We must consider that the sum of €10,000 spread over a year will only give these businesses €800 a month towards their bills. This will mean they will still have to pay €4,200 to keep the fridges and lights on for consumers. The Government has given this €600 to consumers who will then be going back to the same shops that will now have to raise their prices by 300% and 400% to keep the lights on. This is because this Government has not protected these businesses. This all comes back to one thing; we are paying for renewable energy costs at gas prices.It is whatever the market price is and whatever the highest price is for any of the energy providers. That is benchmarked under law. That law was there more than two years ago when the Rural Independent Group first raised the issue of the cost of fuel coming into this country. Europe has given the Government the way forward on how to do it but the Government is still sitting on its hands. All it is doing is giving more money to these same companies that are charging extortionate prices to everybody in the country. This is going to close down every business. Multinational businesses might be able to afford it but every small shop and SME is being held to ransom by the Government as a result of the failure to tackle energy costs or to implement the regulation of energy under EU Regulation 2022/1854. That is it in a nutshell. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said on Twitter that wind energy is being produced in this country at prices cheaper than gas prices but, just to make people suffer, they are being charged for electricity based on the price of gas while the Government is going to give more funding to wind energy farms that are already making billions of euro. The Government is going to give them more funding to charge people more and put companies out of business.

According to the latest consumer price index, CPI, the rate of inflation illustrates a 9.2% increase in the cost of living between October 2021 and October 2022. The rate of inflation in Ireland is being driven by the cost of energy. The cost of gas has spiked by 93.3% in the past 12 months, the cost of electricity has increased by a staggering 71.2%, the cost of home heating oil by 65% and solid fuels by 47%. The cost of heating and keeping the lights on in homes, small businesses, schools - I previously made the point in the Chamber that some schools are going cap in hand to the local parish priest for help - and community facilities is becoming extremely challenging for many and is forcing several more into undisputed poverty. I have been contacted by family-owned supermarkets across County Cork. I have met those families and been to their premises. They do not know how their doors will stay open. I met representatives of the hotel industry in Clonakilty and its surrounds in recent months. They do not know if they will be able to keep their doors open. They are telling me the only way they can pay some of these bills is to have their family members work for free in the months ahead. This is an astonishing situation. They will not be able to take a wage themselves in the same period. That is how bad things are becoming. The Government has failed to take any steps whatsoever to tackle the root cause of energy-induced inflation. Instead, during this inflation crisis the Government has allowed energy suppliers and renewable energy producers to make record financial profits on the back of ordinary consumers. That is why the Rural Independent Group has moved this motion. The simple objective of the motion is to provide cheaper electricity prices for households and small businesses. Almost every day, we hear the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, speak about the increased amount of wind-generated electricity that is supplying the national grid. At the same time, however, the price of electricity for ordinary people is climbing higher and higher. This is resulting in the great wind farm rip-off, where greedy energy giants sell us wind electricity at sky-high wholesale gas prices. Renewables only generate electricity for very short periods when the wind blows or the sun shines. Most of the time, Ireland relies on conventional energy. That is why we need a backup system for when there is no wind. We have to pay very high prices if a gas-fired power plant is only being used half the time because wind energy is given preferential treatment. When such a plant is used, the owner will ask for astronomical sums. When wind energy is backed up by conventional energy, prices go through the roof and that cost is added to the average energy bill. The more wind farms there are, the more expensive the cost will be. This was happening long before the price of gas went up. To make matters worse, the Government intends to pump taxpayers' funds into the renewable electricity support scheme, RESS, with an estimated budget of €7.2 billion, and to provide €12.5 billion for green power production from sources including solar and wind farms. All eligible technologies will compete for subsidies through auctions under RESS, with preferential treatment being given to a small number of energy producers for offshore wind. It is clear that the lobbying power and influence of these international corporations paid off. These companies are to be given 15 years in the form of a premium on top of the market price. This is on top of the massive profits the companies are making. Then we have the Government coming out with electricity credits. While welcome, in reality they are nothing more than crumbs from the table. They merely serve to increase the profits of energy companies as they retain the money, thus driving costs higher and doing nothing to tackle the existing underlying problems. The motion calls on the Government to accept that the cap is one of the best ways to reduce domestic and small business electricity prices, with renewable energy producers still well able to recover their investment and operating costs. It also calls on the Government to implement electricity price-setting for the supply of electricity for households and small and medium-sized enterprises and accept that the current Irish wholesale pricing system is broken, as prices for all market participants are set by the last plant needed to cover the demand, which is the plant with the highest marginal costs when the market clears, and given the unprecedented rise in costs for gas and coal-fired power generation facilities, this generally results in such plants establishing the price and simultaneously results in exceptionally high prices in the day-ahead market, with renewable energy producers experiencing very significant increases in their revenues. It also calls on the Government to immediately seek to implement an excess-profit solidarity tax, as provided for in EU Regulation 2022/1854 upon all or any companies and permanent establishments operating within the oil, gas, coal and refinery sectors in Ireland, which includes the Corrib gas field, and give these funds back to consumers to help pay for energy bills. Finally, it calls for an end to the Government's practice of having lucrative long-term deals with energy companies that allow them to inflate prices while obtaining Government subsidies and simultaneously burdening working-class consumers with sky-high energy prices. To be honest, Ireland needs energy independence. We have been skirting around this idea, whereas the rest of the world is going straight ahead, as per normal. They are letting on there are all these climate action controls but we saw what happened at COP27 last week, where 400 private government jets flew to Egypt. In the name of God, what damage did that do to the climate? It is absolute hypocrisy when you consider they were telling the poor ordinary people on the street to tighten their belts and think about their emissions but they flew in the lap of luxury on private jets. What has that done to the environment? Did it not matter that week because it was COP27 and they could spend their time telling us, the ordinary people, what to do and how to do it? I sought clarity for months from the office of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on whether a gentleman in west Cork could put one bag of turf at the back of a trailer in a market and sell a few lumps of turf. It took months to get the answer, and that answer was that he cannot do so. The governments can fly in private jets all over the world with no problem at all, however. The Government thinks it is codding the people but it sure is not codding everyone. It has conned a few people all right but not everyone is blind. I refer to Barryroe and the opportunities off the Barryroe field. The contracts to be finished are in the Minister's office but he will do nothing apart from let it drag on. He will kick the can down the road. We can bring in fracked gas from abroad and all that and that is all right. The Government thinks nobody will cop that, as if we are all stupid and foolish. We are not foolish at all, however. Liquified natural gas, LNG, floating terminals offer super opportunities for Cork Harbour, Shannon and other places. It is an opportunity to get clean and efficient fuel moving and make the country energy independent. Again, this Government made up of the Green Party, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, with the Green Party wagging the tail, has refused that movement, so we keep bringing it in. Import away; there is no issue there. I spoke about the 400 jets but today we heard that kettles and fridges are going to be removed from offices throughout the country to cut back on energy consumption. You cannot have a bag of turf on the back of a trailer and you cannot have a kettle in your workplace but you can fly in a private jet all you want and fill it with all the types of fuel you want and there is no issue there about the climate. There is no such thing as hopping on a commercial flight to Egypt, not even in first class. They could not do that at all. That would not look good across the world. It is a complete con job that is going on. I heard a Deputy from west Cork giving out that Christmas lights are not being put up in his town by the council. He is sitting in government, delighted. The fact is that there might a blackout this Christmas or next Christmas and there will be no Christmas lights in any town in west Cork.He is oblivious to what is happening in our country.  We should also talk about transport but it is a different area. I commend West Cork Connect, which started a new route. Again, this was done by a private company because the State was not going to cover anything in west Cork when it came to transport. This private company will start running a route from Kinsale to Cork city via Ballinhassig on a daily run on 9 January 2023. We are lucky to have a company like it. It has looked after our needs throughout west Cork while Bus Éireann sits idly by and hopes everything will fall into place and it does not.  Energy independence was where we should have been and we are not there today and will not be there. It is coming at a huge cost to the consumer.

I can appreciate the Deputies' concern, which is shared by all of us, that significant increases in the price of wholesale gas have led to an unprecedented rise in energy prices that has put financial strain on households and businesses in Ireland and across Europe. Clearly, the significant increases in energy bills and the cost of living are matters of very serious concern. The Government is keenly aware of the growing pressures that this is placing on families and businesses. The most immediate factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is sustained high international gas prices, which have risen and have remained high since the invasion of Ukraine. This is why a €2.4 billion package of supports was implemented during 2022 and a package of once-off measures worth €2.5 billion was included in budget 2023. The motion in question calls for the implementation of a recent EU Energy Council regulation. I assure Deputies that the Government is fully supportive of this regulation and implementation is currently in progress.  I will begin by outlining global market developments that have affected Irish energy prices. Subsequently, I will discuss the aforementioned EU regulation being implemented by the Department. I will then outline what the Government is doing in terms of providing support for households' energy costs in terms of both energy efficiency and welfare supports The increased cost of energy is an issue that is affecting not just Ireland but all EU member states. Increased international gas prices as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine have had a serious knock-on effect on the market. As noted by the Deputies, domestic retail electricity and gas prices are now over 80% higher than this time a year ago. Elevated wholesale gas prices have also led to potential windfall gains for producers of natural gas and for certain electricity producers, which have seen an increase in revenues from the wholesale electricity market. A number of points raised in the motion do not constitute something the Government would supply. However, the core focus of the motion is on seeking to address windfall gains in the energy sector with a view to benefiting consumers. It seeks to do this by implementing Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. In response to rising electricity and gas prices in the EU, the European Commission has put in place a number of measures available to member states to mitigate the impact of the energy price rises on households and businesses. The Council of Energy Ministers agreed the Council regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices at their meeting on 30 September. The Council regulation, which was published on 6 October in the Official Journal of the European Union, has three key elements. The first involves the introduction of a cap on electricity market revenues for non-gas generators, including wind, solar, oil and so on. The second is a temporary solidarity contribution based on taxable profits on companies with activities in fossil fuel production and refining. The third introduces a requirement to reduce electricity demand over the winter period. The proceeds from this temporary solidarity contribution and from the market cap will go towards financial supports to consumers heavily impacted by soaring energy prices. Intensive work is now under way to implement these measures by the Department, which is working with the Department of Finance and other Departments and agencies. The best long-term approach for Ireland to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepen the Internal Market in energy. In terms of the overall cost of living, it is vital to stress that a co-ordinated whole-of-government response is being followed and is essential in tackling this issue. The forthcoming energy poverty action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented this winter as well as key longer-term measures to ensure that those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected. This work is being undertaken by a steering group consisting of relevant Departments and agencies. This area of work also includes interactions with the NGO sector. In response to rising energy prices, the Government has already taken action throughout 2022 and introduced a suite of measures worth €2.4 billion to assist households with their energy costs. Throughout 2022, the Government has taken action in response to rising prices through a variety of measures. These include the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, which saw 99% of domestic electricity accounts being credited with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment of €176.22, excluding VAT. The total cost of this scheme to the Exchequer was just under €377 million. This was part of a €505 million package of measures put in place to address increasing costs of living, including increases in the fuel allowance and a reduction in VAT on electricity and gas bills from 13.5% to 9%. Other measures include a €320 million measure introduced to temporarily reduce excise duties on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil, which cut excise by 20 cent per litre of petrol and 15 cent per litre of diesel. Budget 2023 provides a further €2.5 billion in once-off measures for households. The budget package includes a new electricity cost emergency benefit scheme, which this House passed last month and has now been signed into law by the President. The scheme will credit €550.47, exclusive of VAT, to each domestic electricity account in three payments of €183.49, exclusive of VAT, in each of the following billing periods: November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023. The estimated cost of this scheme is €1.2 billion. The scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using their unique meter point reference number, MPRN, to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills automatically without the need for application or approval, including pay-as-you-go meters. Therefore, the payments will help both bill pay and pay-as-you-go customers with their electricity costs. The measures introduced under budget 2023 also include a €400 lump sum payment to fuel allowance recipients in addition to the payment of €33 per week for 28 weeks; a total of €924 each year. Moreover, a €200 lump sum payment will go to pensioners and people with a disability getting the living alone increase, a €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment will be made to all families getting working family payment, there will be a double payment of child benefit to support all families with children and a €500 cost of living payment will go to people receiving carer's support grant and will be paid in November. Furthermore, a €500 lump sum cost-of-living disability support grant will be paid to all people receiving a long-term disability payment and a €500 rent tax credit will be paid to tenants.  Budget 2023 has also increased the total allocation of the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, by 36% up to €480 million. This is the highest ever budget to support the achievement of our retrofit targets. For SEAI residential and community energy upgrade schemes, including the solar photovoltaic, PV, scheme, we are increasing Exchequer funding to €337 million up from €255 million in 2022, which is a 32% increase. Importantly, within this, €291 million from carbon tax receipts will go back to help those households and communities. We delivered 15,500 retrofits in 2021 and are aiming for 27,000 this year. We are going further in 2023 to and expect 37,000 homes to benefit from retrofits next year. This includes 6,000 free energy upgrades under the SEAI warmer homes scheme. The Government is acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs in order to protect families during this energy crisis and this has been key in the design of the new temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which will provide up to €10,000 per business per month until spring 2023 to help meet rising energy costs. The scheme will support eligible companies covering 40% of the increase in their energy bills.  These measures are in addition to Government supports such as the household benefits package, which consists of a set of allowances which help with the costs of running a household, and which include allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs. Recipients are paid €35 per month. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances. Exceptional needs payments can be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost that an applicant is unable to meet from his or her own resources.The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, has found that the once-off measures announced as part of budget 2023 will insulate most households from rising prices this winter. As I have highlighted today, the Government has long provided and will continue to provide practical supports for those struggling with their energy costs. The Government continues to allocate significant funding to these practical supports, via the welfare system, through energy efficiency grants and retrofitting.

Families and businesses across the State need long-term and meaningful actions. They need real actions that will make a difference to energy prices. They do not need short-term, tokenistic gestures. These will not solve the problem. Businesses are still closing their doors and this Government is still sitting on its hands. This makes a mockery of the Government's commitment to enterprise and to the small and medium enterprises throughout this country that are really struggling, in addition to the many families who are struggling and deciding between eating or heating. This is the reality and the hallmark of the Government. The Minister of State mentioned retrofitting and, in particular, the warmer homes scheme. I received correspondence from SEAI which states that a pensioner who applies for work to be done on his or her home must wait 24 months from the time of the application until the work is done. I have many pensioners who come into my office. I am trying to help them get this work over the line and approved for them. They really are struggling. They cannot afford heating, yet the Minister of State and the Government are giving themselves a slap on the back over the great work of retrofitting. I do not believe that expecting pensioners to wait 24 months is anything to be proud of. In fact, the Government should be ashamed of this. I ask for urgent action in order to speed this up. Telling pensioners that they must wait 24 months is not acceptable. The motion presented by my colleagues and me is a real opportunity to test those words. Are the Government's words hollow or does it mean anything it says. We have consistently called for a series of measures to be adopted that would, if implemented, allow people to have greater measures of control over how and in what manner they choose to access energy sources. We have called for greater energy security in terms of offshore gas and LNG. We have called for urgent action in the context of reopening the power stations at Shannonbridge and Lough Ree. We know how capable of action this Government is when it wants to bring in emergency legislation. Then the Government can act with speed. I am sure that if the political will was there, those power plants at Shannonbridge and Lough Ree would be open. I call again for them to be opened. Anything that was removed from those power stations needs to be reinstalled. We are in an energy crisis. We need these power plants for backup. I am aware that such options would take time, and that the stations cannot simply be switched back on overnight. When the Government wants to, however, it can make things happen at the stroke of a pen and can bring in emergency legislation when it wishes. The longer we wait and the deeper we sink into energy poverty and energy dependency, the greater the risk that this issue will become embedded in our system for years to come. I recently asked the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications to provide details of the purchase of emergency generation capacity and mobile turbines, and the total cost involved. He stated that the temporary generation units will not come on stream or be installed until winter 2023-24. The cost is approximately €350 million. This will add €40 to the average domestic bill over the next billing year. Again, this is not a long-term solution. It will cause more hardship for people and will cause more businesses to close. The Minister also confirmed that the purchase of these generators was an option of last resort. How have we arrived at this situation? If the Government listened to and collaborated with those of us who have put forward good and concrete solutions that are sensible, we would not be in this scenario. Just yesterday, the Irish Academy of Engineering sent all Members a report stating quite categorically that Irish energy supply reliability is below standard and that it is threatening to deteriorate further unless addressed. Practical action is needed in order to remedy the shortcomings over the next few years. The fact that we are in this situation also jeopardises foreign direct investment. Ireland is not seen as energy secure, and this jeopardises investment.

We hope that by the time they are sitting in these seats, things will be much better in our country. I put it to the Minister of State that since he, the Green Party, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael came to office in 2020, more things have closed down and more harm has been done than was the case under any other previous Government. The first thing they did was to close down Bord na Móna. The latter had its operations in the middle of the country, including at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough. Since then, the cost of electricity has gone up day by day. The Government did that because it had the power to do it, not because it was the right thing to do. Since then, no proper alternative has been put in place. We have seen the way the cost of electricity has gone up so much. The thrust of our motion is that we cannot understand why people are being charged so much for electricity produced by means of wind generation. God Almighty, surely the cost of the wind has not gone up. How can the Minister of State explain that or condone it? Standing charges have also gone up. In a time of war, when we are trying to help others by welcoming them into this country, we are hurting our own and doing nothing about it. Where is the energy regulator? Where is the Minister in charge who is allowing this to happen? I am not being personal or anything, but it is the Minister's policies; it is not the policies of the people. These policies are wrong. We hear about this big meeting - out in wherever it is - which is COP27. Many of the people who are attending that meeting should cop on. The people of Ireland can see what is happening. The Chinese are building coal-burning generation stations at present. They are adding to the 2,290 stations they already have. They are building 500 more and planning for a further 300 after that. The Germans are burning coal, and here we have the Government telling us, after all that we have been through, that people cannot buy a bag of turf or sell a bag of turf. I am honestly proud of and admire the people who went to the bog this summer. The Minister played no small part in that because he highlighted that he would bid to stop people cutting turf. They proved that they can still cut it. While many of them had gone over to oil or other things that prevented them from going to the bog, I assure the House that more people than ever went back to the bog this year, and they will be going again next year. I am proud that, with the onset of winter, many people can look into their fires and derive the heat that comes from a good turf fire. All the big powers are attending this COP27 event. The Minister is flying there first class, and yet the Government is telling people here that they cannot burn turf and that they should not be warm. Now it has the gall to tell people in public offices that they cannot boil a kettle. What are they at? Have they gone stone loony altogether? I know an elderly woman who is afraid to boil a kettle because it will actually add to her electricity bill. There are many more like her.God almighty, I am appealing to the Minister of State. Government Members are more reactive than proactive. They are talking about introducing a cap now. We asked for this all year. Businesses are going to ground. Butchers who sell abroad are closing down. This will have an adverse affect because finished cattle are down €200 or €300 in price. Many butchers have closed already and it is affecting the trade. I ask the Government to cop on, make the regulator do his job and ensure that the energy companies do not get two or three times the profit they should get at the expense of the ordinary punter trying to light the light, boil the kettle or keep their business going.

The issue of electricity and energy affordability is central at this time. The motion points to the need to reform a broken market. That needs to happen, but we also need to address the cost of electricity and maximise State and community ownership of our national resources. That is not stated in the motion, but it should be. The market is broken, and the Government has stood steadfast against reforms for far too long. Colleagues of mine here and at European level have advocated for market reform for many years. That became a very apparent necessity as far back as summer 2021. The Government, in October 2021, voted against proposals for reform. In June, the Minister of State said to my colleague, Deputy Conway-Walsh, that he did not think it was a good idea to reform the market or decouple the price of gas from that of electricity. On 11 August, the Minister for Finance said of decoupling the price of gas from that of electricity that such a windfall tax would undermine our energy independence. Essentially, it would undermine the profits of energy companies and impact on the amount they would have to reinvest. Countries that took a different approach, such as Spain and Portugal, were able to realise significant savings for electricity customers. The Government has been a barrier to that. I welcome the U-turn, but it was a matter of a nod to the European Union and to the markets and of failing to be brave or act in the interests of the Irish people. That has happened time and again. It is the same in the context of the solidarity windfall tax and tackling the massive profits of Corrib Gas, for example. That is a Canadian company, and we talk about the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement. There are the massive profits of BP and Shell, €9 billion and €8 billion, respectively. The price of wind has not increased. The price of taking gas or oil out of the ground has not increased either, but the massive profits of these greedy companies have increased massively. They need to be tackled fast. My party has advocated for that for a long time. The same goes at home in respect of the standing charge. The latter has been increased time and again, including by State-owned companies such as Electric Ireland and the ESB, without reason or explanation. The CRU tells us it does not have the legislative capacity to deal with that matter. This needs to be addressed. Sinn Féin put forward a suite of proposals in a policy document, Vision for Renewable Energy, it launched this week. The answer for Ireland is energy independence in the form of renewables owned, as much as possible, by the State and local communities, generating jobs in the regions and stimulating local and export economies, in terms of every type of renewable and hydrogen. I will touch on a number of our proposals. We need to reform the public service obligation. That is the mechanism for funding renewables. It is a regressive levy in that it is flat and benefits large energy users because it is levied at peak demand rather than at average demand. We need to increase State investment in the forms of taxation and to incentivise and ensure communities can compete against corporations. We need a task force on the cost of renewables. Those costs are significantly lower than gas, as has been mentioned, but in Ireland those costs are greater than in other countries. That needs to be addressed. The Government has not done enough to protect people and needs to do it.

I commend the Rural Independent Group on bringing forward this motion. This debate has an all too familiar feel to it. For the past 18 months to two years, Opposition Members have been referring to the lived realities of the people we represent, the fact that the cost of living was exacerbating matters and that the long-standing crisis in provisions like housing, insurance costs and other household costs, such as childcare, was being compounded by soaring energy costs. The story is familiar. We bring forward solutions, proposals and those lived realities and a Green Party Minister comes before the House and basically says everyone is wrong, while Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies are in hiding. Then, maybe six months later, Government will take some part of the Opposition proposals and meekly, half-heartedly make some changes. It is always too little, too late. We are in November and thanks be to God it has been milder than usual. Some will say that is not a good thing because it is a sign of the climate change we face. That is true but thank God from the perspective of many people who I deal with on a weekly basis. They are in dread of a cold spell and what it will mean for their electricity costs, and unsure whether they will be able to heat their home or if doing so will be at the expense of feeding their family. Again, a set of proposals have been brought to the Minister of State. Again, Deputy O'Rourke has set out what needs to be done and, again, the Minister of State has outlined that he has virtually no intention of taking on board what has been asked of him, namely, facing up to the giant corporate energy companies who are fleecing the Minister of State and taking him and his Government for a ride. The Government has been defending them and going to Europe to fight measures that would force them to pay additional taxes or to decouple their prices. I implore the Government to change tack and start acting on behalf of workers and families, as opposed to energy companies.

So far, it has not done enough and people are suffering in this cost-of-living crisis. Their voice and message were clear. People are sick of rising fuel and energy prices and the Government must do more. Caitriona Twomey from Cork Penny Dinners spoke and outlined how that charity is feeding 1,000 people per day in Cork. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul said it is receiving 800 phone calls per day for help. One in three people lives in fuel poverty.Is this not a clear message to the Minister of State and the Government that they are not doing enough? Now there is the potential of hundreds, if not thousands, of layoffs in the tech sector. Many of these workers are just struggling to survive at the moment. They could be pushed into poverty and towards using charities such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Cork Penny Dinners and others. The Tánaiste's response is just to shrug his shoulders. It was the same shrug he gave in respect of the Debenhams workers and when we spoke about people who are on prepay meters, family carers, foster carers and pensioners. Where is the support? Where do matters stand as we head towards Christmas. The weather is getting colder. Parents will have children at home for much longer. The worry is how they will heat their homes and how they will provide the additional meals that will be needed. There is not enough in what the Government has put forward for those people. Christmas is meant to be a time for families when people can come together and enjoy each others company and the season. For many, this Christmas will not be a happy time. The Government needs to do more. Energy companies are making huge profits and the Government is sitting idly by.

Earlier this week I spoke to the head of the South Kerry Development Partnership about the work it does in the rural social schemes and Tús schemes in south Kerry. I refer here to care of the elderly, social farming, the rural men's officer, DJ Moran, whom it employs, the maintenance of sports fields and support for meals on wheels. It assists 200 projects in the area. However, the people working on that schemes only receive an extra €19 on top of their social welfare. That is supposed to help them with their travel expenses and fuel and its increased price. According to the latest CSO figures, the CPI rose by 9.2% from October last year to October this year. The price of water, gas and other fuels have risen by nearly 28% over the same period. More alarmingly, consumer prices rose by 1.6% between September and October of this year while water, electricity and gas rose by nearly 9% in that time. I do not need to tell the House what a 10% increase, month on month, over the course of the year will do to people. I have also heard from local businesses that have seen their bills increase by these amounts - sometimes tripling or even quadrupling - in that time. The equation for these small businesses is simple: get help or fold. A capping of electricity prices at previous levels is what they need. We also need a massive investment in renewables because the latter are cheaper and more stable. We are currently far too exposed to energy shocks. Any transition must be fair, however. The regulations and laws have a part to play, but correcting economic inequality cannot be done at the stroke of a pen. That is why measures such as the prioritising of retrofitting for those at risk of energy poverty are so crucial. The Government needs to act. It needs to do more. It needs to cap electricity prices. What it has done so far is a mistake. It needs to act to help the people who work around the Ring of Kerry and the small businesses.

This morning, we have yet another motion on energy prices. It highlights the cost that households are paying but also the lack of action by the Government as well as the market structure that links gas prices with the price of electricity, not to mention the profits being made by energy companies and the lack of windfall tax. For more than a year, Sinn Féin has called on the Government to decouple the price of gas from electricity prices. We can produce electricity from wind and solar at a relatively low price. The current system means that electricity is sold at the same rate as gas-generated electricity. This is ridiculous and makes no sense. We have seen the usual Government flip-flopping on the matter. It has swung from vigorous opposition to it to thinking it was a bad idea to kind of half supporting it. That is not good enough. Sinn Féin has repeatedly raised this matter with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications. Reform is needed. It will make a difference in people's pockets. Why does the Government sit on its hands? Why has it prioritised the profits of energy companies over the interests of ordinary people, workers, families and, in particular, our older people? It is for the same reason that it has refused to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies that are profiteering from the war in Ukraine and the current crisis relating to energy prices. The EU has agreed a way forward and the Government must act immediately. Because of the nature of the market it could take months for the price reductions to be passed on to customers. We need to strengthen the powers of the energy regulator, particularly around standing charges. What we really need is a Government that actually cares how its policies affect workers and families. Sinn Féin will continue to hold this Government to account until we get the chance to be in office.

I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important matter, particularly as the Government's delay in taking meaningful action to address the challenges that continue to be faced by households and businesses is apparent both here and at the European Council. One action that could have a meaningful impact on the dreaded electricity bills coming in people's doors would be to decouple electricity prices from those obtaining in the gas market. This is something that was proposed by numerous countries at EU level and has been repeatedly raised by Sinn Féin for over a year yet the Government actually signed up to a statement confirming its opposition to decoupling. The reversal of the decision here by the Minister for Environment, Climate and Communications is welcome but questions over the Government's ability or wiliness to effectively deal with this do not give one faith in their ability to make the right calls for the people. The windfall tax is another area where the Government is dragging its feet. In September, the Council of Energy Ministers agreed a resolution to implement a windfall tax. The most that we have had from the Government on this is a statement by the Minister that his Department is working with other Departments, Government agencies and stakeholders to implement the regulation. I have said time and again since being elected that there is a real sense that this Government does not accept the urgent need to accept matters that are immediately affecting people and businesses. I find myself saying that again today while families are choosing between heating and eating and while businesses are uncertain about the future. Those are the ones that have not had to close their doors or let people go. It is really not good enough. What about standing charges? Some energy companies have increased them by €300 in the past year alone. One supplier now charges up to €700 a year. This is another way of fleecing an already hard-pressed public. What has the Government done? Nothing. The CRU states that it does not have the remit under legislation to regulate standing charges. Where does the Government stand on this? It is staying silent while people struggle. We need legislation to give the CRU the power to regulate standing charges. The Government has become shameless in its support for the status quo rather than taking measures to deal with the challenges people face. Its poor response to the interests of the Irish people is unjustifiable.

Whether it is individuals or businesses, we all know that we have been inundated in respect of this matter. Some of my colleagues spoke about the weakness of the CRU's remit and powers with regard to standing charges. There are huge anomalies. Many of us will have dealt with issues around communal or district heating systems that are fed by gas and the massive costs that people are facing as a result. I have had many interactions with the Minister of State, the Minister and anyone else who will listen in order to secure a solution for my constituents in Carlinn Hall. There was an anomaly there, like many instances before, to the effect that the CRU is not responsible. While some of this may be rectified, we need to do this as soon as possible and ensure that we have all the tools necessary to deal with the particular issues before our people now. The Government was resolutely opposed to decoupling gas and electricity prices. There has been a change in European policy. We have seen that around caps and windfall taxes. On some level we might say that we are unsure if the European Union is quite as imaginative or creative as it needs to be.That is accepting the issues that exist as regards the electricity markets. We are aware of the realities the Minister is dealing with, including hedging. At every point, there is someone in the market seeking to make money. That is capitalism. I suppose that, at some level, it is unfettered, unchecked capitalism. We are all aware of the huge profits made by some of the energy suppliers internationally. We really need to get down to the crux of the matter so we can reduce the costs for the people as best we can. We know what needs to be done for businesses. I have said before that I am shocked at some level - call it the western world, the European Union or whatever. We all know the crisis we are in because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine and its destabilising impact, particularly in the context of energy supply. However, one of the weapons of hybrid war that Vladimir Putin has is the possibility of considerable contagion and impacts across Europe, including Ireland, because of the high cost of energy. We have to rectify this. As I have said before, we need to examine the temporary business energy support scheme in the context of mitigating the problems associated with communal heating systems. I will be raising this matter with the Minister for Finance later today. We really need to take action. We are not doing enough and not acting quickly enough.

We are aware that energy prices have risen across Europe. That is not in question, but there are particular factors at play in Ireland. Bloomberg is reporting that the biggest monthly gains in electricity costs are in Dublin, where power rates have climbed by 44%. Similarly, the costs of gas and other fuels are going up and up. We can no doubt attribute this anomaly to climate change. While the current unseasonably warm weather has a sinister cause, it has been positive in that fewer people in Ireland have had to turn on the heating so far. However, as we see a drop in temperature, even today, rising costs will have an even greater impact on households. We are all hearing already about the fear of many families and individuals as they face the winter ahead and see prices continuing to rise. On Saturday, I addressed a protest organised by the Cost of Living Coalition in Rathmines in my constituency. I spoke to students, older people, renters and many others. They described the increasingly narrow margins they experience to get by week after week. This is a genuine issue across the country. Undoubtedly, the terrible war being waged by Russia against Ukraine has had a significant effect on energy prices across Europe and worldwide. However, it feels as if we are being held to ransom here in Ireland by energy giants and market speculators. While households here are resilient and looking to where they can cut costs, and cut energy consumption with a climate focus, we can see it is not additional discretionary spending that drives hardship in Ireland; rather, it is the cost of basic necessities that does so. I include the costs of housing, rent, childcare and, of course, energy. Even though we all seek to reduce energy consumption, prices are still rising drastically. We are all hearing about these issues. There are many people who cannot manage without retaining their heating and energy-use levels. Vulnerability to market factors has contributed to the hardship people are in, and a change of system and radical measures are now needed to help, not the sort of Band-Aid solutions or half measures we saw introduced in budget 2023. While one-off measures such as the lump-sum payments assisted people for a while, their initial shine is starting to wear off. Once energy credits and lump-sum payments are used up, prices will continue to rise. Social protection recipients are receiving payments below the rate of inflation, and property and deprivation are likely to increase as temperatures drop. Therefore, it is past time that we saw an end to the undue deference to profit and profit-driven companies when it comes to securing the well-being of our people. A profit motive is fundamentally inconsistent with supporting people through periods such as this. We need to see a strengthening of the role of the State and the intervention of the State in the markets. To be constructive, what did we propose to avoid some of these problems and reduce reliance on the private sector and the market? Labour, in the budget, would have implemented a three-pronged approach to the energy crisis, with a windfall tax on excess profits, a cap on energy prices and changes to the fuel allowance and other energy supports. We have no hesitation in pushing further for the principle of a windfall tax on profits and a solidarity tax. We conservatively estimated that our iteration of a windfall levy would yield €600 million in 2022, rising to €800 million in 2023. The cap on energy prices has been resisted by the Government, which has said it is a complex and dynamic measure. It certainly is but we have seen many EU countries taking this approach. We pushed for the so-called Iberian model, introduced by socialist governments in Spain and Portugal. It has provided a model for limiting the price of gas and electricity production and, in effect, subsidising gas generators. Spain and Portugal have adopted that model since June and have reduced bills for Spanish and Portuguese households by between 15% and 20%. We have called for the temporary nationalisation of the Corrib gas field. I renew that call today in order that the price we pay for our domestic gas supply will be set at the cost of production, plus a margin for the operator, rather than having it set by the international market as at present. This does not entail a cap on fuel prices but such a measure would serve to regulate and reduce the cost for households. It can be achieved using existing legislation. As I have stated repeatedly in the House, this legislation was invoked by previous Governments in the 1970s during the fuel crisis. Alongside these measures, we would have put in place a range of targeted supports through budget 2023 to help cover the costs of the over 1 million households we know to be at risk of energy poverty. We would have created a refundable carbon tax credit targeted at ordinary working families in poorly insulated homes, and we would also have ensured that the credit would be worth €800 in total to low- and middle-income workers. Particularly for families who remain reliant on solid fuel and home heating oil in advance of retrofitting measures, this would have made a significant difference. It is hard to escape the conclusion, without these targeted measures, that a mini budget may well be required in the new year to account for the increasing inflation rate and increasing prices, particularly of energy and fuel. At the very least, the Government could have taken other measures that might have avoided that necessity. An example would be a clawback mechanism of some sort for our existing system of energy credits, such as the withdrawal of income tax credits from those earning €100,000, which we also called for. Another example would involve the application of a levy equivalent to the electricity credit, modelled on the previous non-principal private residence charge, to holiday and vacant homes to prevent those with multiple properties from benefiting from universal measures. We in Labour staunchly advocate universal measures, where necessary and of benefit, but this is a situation where targeting should have taken place. No one should benefit disproportionately when some are suffering so disproportionately. When I speak to individuals and groups who are disproportionately harmed, I want to restate our call for more effective reliefs for people who consume energy on a pay-as-you-go basis. We are all conscious that they are particularly affected. People on lower incomes are overrepresented in this group and are least insulated from price hikes. As with the eviction Bill, there should be a guarantee set in stone so no one’s lights or power will be switched off because they cannot afford to pay this winter. Another group struggling this winter and from whom I have heard in many cases comprises those in district heating schemes. The Minister will know that this group pays for energy at the commercial rate. I heard from an individual in my constituency whose bill has risen by nearly 600%, which is an extraordinary price hike. I am aware that there are others living in hundreds of apartment blocks around the country who are also affected. I submitted a parliamentary question very recently on this. In response, the Minister mentioned a steering group that is to report on the matter. This is an unsatisfactory response for those facing bills of in excess of €1,000 this winter. We need to see more urgent action taken. We are also calling on the Government to examine, as a matter of urgency, the regulation of energy companies' use of standing charges to offset the artificial price reduction brought about by the energy credit scheme. We know some suppliers are now charging nearly €1,000 per year in standing charges regardless of how much energy households or businesses use. Hiking charges is anathema to the message we should be sending, considering that we are asking people to reduce their use of unnecessary energy and switch to renewable sources. Therefore, I ask the Minister to revisit the Government’s decision on this. All of this comes against a backdrop of increasingly visible effects of climate change, on which there is an ongoing debate at COP27 in Egypt, yet Ireland still has what are among the highest emissions per person. Our system remains highly reliant on fossil fuel energy, so we need to see radical measures introduced to ensure a move to renewables and the ramping up of actions necessary to combat climate change.I look forward to continuing that aspect of the debate during the debate on the new climate action plan.

I accept that we have spoken at considerable length about the energy crisis in the past year, but it is important that we continue to do so because many people are still being left behind and the future for many in the community is very uncertain as the energy crisis continues. Therefore, it is a very important issue to discuss. I do not want to repeat previous contributions that I made on the issue, so today I wish to speak about what I see as the fundamental flaws in the Government's approach to dealing with the energy crisis. The first point is that the Government relies on the market, not only to address the climate crisis that we are in, but also the energy crisis. There are major issues with that because relying on the market it is too slow, too expensive and it will not result in a just transition. Essentially, the market will deal with people's needs on a monetary basis and will not take into account fairness and the basic needs of people to be supported and cared for. That is a job for the Government. Unfortunately, the Government is not taking the role seriously. It relies far too much on the market as we try to deal with the various crises. The second point is that the Government tends to wait for someone else to lead. In this instance, when we talk about the windfall tax or the decoupling of the energy, the Government waits for Europe and other countries to lead and then Ireland follows. When it comes to this issue, we need Ireland and the Government to be leaders and to fight for the people we represent. I understand that in some instances it makes more sense in a European-wide market that we work in a collaborative fashion, but there are many things the Government can do to lead on this issue and it has not done so. The Social Democrats has been raising the windfall tax with the Government for a year, yet it has waited for Europe to take the lead on it. As a result, it will be months before the issue is resolved, and similarly with market reform. Spain and Portugal took the lead and represented their people because they understood that their two countries were not quite as integrated into the European energy market as others, which in fact is similar to Ireland. They fought to benefit their countries. Unfortunately, we did not see that with Ireland, which sat back and waited for Europe to take the lead. The third point is that the Government deals with issues in a short-term fashion. The Minister of State outlined the one-off measures that have been introduced, but the reality is that this is not a one-off situation. The energy crisis is with us this winter and it will be with us next winter. Many analysts believe it will be with us for many winters to come. That is also the case with climate change and the need for climate action. The Government's short-term measures are not targeted enough and they are not matching the money to the people that need it. They are also costly because ultimately it is a very costly exercise, but because it is not targeted it means the Government is spending a lot of money on these measures. Again, that is not money that is necessarily going to be available next year. Corporation tax receipts will not be replicated next year and there is a risk that we will go into recession. We are facing a very different economic environment next year and we do not know what will happen globally and with the war in Ukraine. While the one-off measures have given the Government a little bit of breathing space and may have assisted some people in the current month, it will not give it much extra time. Ironically, the fact that we are having such a mild winter has assisted the Government and therefore the impact we are seeing from climate change is helping at the moment. However, this is something the Government will not be able to ignore for much longer. What the Social Democrats wants to see from the Government is it making homes resilient to global energy shocks and climate shocks and for people to be able to rely on their own capacity to manage energy costs. The Minister of State is no doubt thinking about all the money the Government is putting into retrofitting, but the first point I would make in that regard is that when we look at the amount of money it has put into one-off measures – a budget of €2.4 billion – could he imagine what kind of households and communities we would be living in if the money had been earmarked to build in resilience and to assist two and a half or three years ago when the Government came to power? It would be incredible. Let us compare that with the additional €14 million for solar energy. There is a huge disparity there. The Government is not putting enough focus on making homes resilient. I will not only be critical of the Government; I will also offer some solutions. I will keep banging on about these solutions because I want the Government to listen. Its current focus should not just be on retrofitting, as that takes a long time and is costly. There is a much quicker way to help people and ensure they get assistance in the medium term. That is through the implementation of solar energy and ensuring that it is made available to as many households and businesses as possible in this country so they can generate their own energy. Solar energy is practical, possible and quick to do. It would build the level of resilience we need within our system and communities. It would not only help with the climate crisis and reduce energy costs, but it would also help with the grid, which is very vulnerable currently and is incapable of dealing with the level of electricity demand the Government has overseen in recent years. It is a win-win situation if we start to develop solar energy. The difficulty is that it will not be done if we rely on corporations and businesses to do it. This needs major State intervention. The Government must drive a widescale solar investment programme. That means the Government must purchase solar panels. It needs to go to companies in Europe and agree multimillion euro contracts for solar panels, because that is the cheapest and also the quickest way to do it. We would completely overcome any delays in the supply chain by doing it like that. I have spoken to some experts who say it would save 50% to 60% of the cost. That is how it should be done. Once the Government has the solar panels, it will need to put them on people's homes fast. That means going in and doing it by means of State teams of solar experts going around and putting the infrastructure on everybody's roofs. That could be done very quickly. It takes half a day or a day to put it on a roof. By doing that, we would save homes 40% on their energy costs and make them resilient. It would mean the Government would not need to put €2.4 billion into people's pockets next year just to help them get over the winter. It is the most practical way to deal with it. I ask the Government to take the suggestion on board and get it implemented.

I welcome the motion tabled by the Rural Independent Group. It is a good motion which touches on many issues concerning energy. One of the issues I wish to reference relates to the proliferation of data centres in the country. I refer specifically to the South Dublin County Council area where, currently, there are close to 50 data centres. It has the highest concentration of data centres in the country. The facts are stark in regard to data centres not only in this county council area but elsewhere in the State. Currently, data centres use 14% to 15% of all electricity demand but in eight years' time, that will increase to 30%. It is an incredibly stark figure when we think that one third of electricity demand will come from one type of entity in the State, namely, data centres. We are not against data centres per se, but we must question the social use of data centres given their proliferation.With the help of my party colleague Councillor Madeleine Johansson, South Dublin County Council voted to put a moratorium on all data centres in the council area between now and 2028. That vote has been overturned by the Minister of State, Deputy Burke, which is completely wrong. It is against local democracy. Councillors should have a say. They should have a voice with respect to data centres being concentrated in their area. The facts are incredible. Around the world, data centres typically account for up to 3% or 4% of electricity demand. As I said, in Ireland it is 15% and growing. What could happen is that, because data centres are using so much of the resource, a sudden shock in demand will cause households to be in the dark. There is such a concentration of electricity for data centres and it is not sustainable. As a member of the Green Party, surely the Minister of State agrees this is not a sustainable model of electricity supply and demand? I ask him to relay to his Government colleagues that local democracy should be upheld. There should be a moratorium on all data centres, not only in South Dublin County Council but in the State as a whole.

It is refreshingly progressive and we will fully support it. The motion is unusual, coming from the quarter it does, in that it does not promote fossil fuels, LNG, Barryroe Offshore Energy or anything else. They are completely absent from it and I am delighted to see that because it is progressive. The motion calls for a reduction in the use of electricity by data centres, which Deputy Kenny has just gone into very thoroughly. It also covers things like putting a cap on the revenue of the energy companies and details clearly how the profits of the energy companies have skyrocketed out of control, for which there is no justification. The motion also calls for price controls, which is something the Government must look at. It does not make sense. All the previous speakers called for intervention in the market, the market that has failed and that does not work anymore. It is just the obstinacy of the Government preventing us from looking at making an intervention and putting a cap on energy prices. The other thing the motion does is call strongly for the implementation of a profit solidarity tax. I ask the Minister of State directly when the Government is going to come back to us and talk about this. It was mooted months ago and the Taoiseach said the Government would look at it. Europe is supposed to be looking at a solidarity tax but it is lying there in abeyance while the profits increase. I will speak a little about what People Before Profit would do in the energy sector. We would do all the above, and agree entirely with the motion from the Rural Independent Group, but we also believe we must renationalise the energy sector and have a Bill coming forward through the Dáil on same. I will go over the arguments again. In the early years of this State, when we had very little in the way of resources and finances coming into the country, we made a decision as a State that there were certain things we had to do. One was to create a housing stock and some kind of a health service but, crucially, to feed into that, we had to create an energy sector. Ardnacrusha and the creation of the ESB and Bord na Móna were attempts by the State to have a not-for-profit mandate electricity system that would turn on the lights and power the entire State, and so they did. The State did this in a progressive way by employing people in decent jobs, giving apprenticeships, keeping the lights on and providing power to every home and business in the country at a very reasonable rate. That reasonable rate was maintained because the ESB in particular had a not-for-profit mandate right up to 2001, when that was changed. The energy sector was deregulated, and thrown open to competition in the open market. The not-for-profit mandate was removed and now we have one of the highest energy costs to the consumer in the entire EU. People Before Profit believes the renationalisation of the energy sector is the way to go and the simple way to do that is to remove from the ESB the mandate that it must return a profit. All the rest of the businesses competing for profits would fade off into the background, and if they did not, the State could buy them and have one company that produced the electricity and delivered it to homes and businesses throughout the country. The other advantage of that in the current climate is it would take over the production of all offshore energy and all renewable energy power. That would mean renewable energy, which is a natural resource, would not be used as a for-profit tool by these greedy energy companies but would rather be a resource for the people. I heard other Members refer to this earlier, but the Cost of Living Coalition has been an important tool in putting these arguments to ordinary people, trade unions, pensioners and students and for bringing them together to have a loud voice that tells the Government we will not tolerate this. I note there have been general strikes and protests across Europe over the energy crisis and the cost of living. The cost-of-living crisis has not gone away for us here and the winter will be bitter and cold. Post Christmas, people are really going to feel the pinch. To that end, we will be out marching on the question of housing on 26 November with all the groups I mentioned. This campaign will continue right into the new year until this Government begins to listen.

I thank the Rural Independent Group for bringing this to the floor so we have a chance to discuss it again. The buzzwords in a debate like this are "climate crisis" and "climate urgency", but these have led to the cost of living and the different actions, or lack of action by Government, that have led to a cost-of-living crisis. There are many solutions that go with the aforementioned buzzwords like a reduction in emissions or the cost of the fines we pay for not reducing emissions. There is the cost of reduction in farming through convergence, for example. This and other measures led to an increased cost of living, and that is where people are suffering. We must tackle the emergency but we have to be real. All the figures we hear relate to 2030 or 2050 but what about today and what we can do today? That is what people are interested in primarily. If we want to reduce carbon emissions, there are carbon-neutral schemes and reduction targets we can use. I do not just mean electric cars. We can look to using hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO, as a replacement for fossil fuel diesel immediately. The figures on the amount of diesel cars and engines we have in the country are astounding. Some 36% of cars, over 80,000 tractors and upwards of 110,000 heavy goods vehicles, HGVs and light commercial vehicles operate on diesel. There are also diggers, generators and other types of commercial equipment. HVO could be used to fuel them today as it is interchangeable without any need for mechanical alteration to a diesel engine. There is not even any change required at the petrol pumps as all we need is a sign that says "HVO". The reduction in carbon emissions is 90% in the particulate emissions when HVO is used. There is a reduction in NOx of upwards of 30%.It is astounding to think that for five years running, sectoral interests such as the Irish Road Haulage Association have requested a measure from Government in the budget that sees HVO treated differently as a green fuel over and above diesel. The current position is that excise duties are applied to HVO in the very same amount as they are to diesel. We hear every day that diesel is the fuel that is causing the climate emergency and causing our carbon emissions. What we do not hear is that we have an alternative that would save 90% over diesel, which is a tenfold benefit. We do not even hear about it. The reason it is not being used is that when the same excise is applied to HVO as it is to diesel, it actually makes it 20 cent per litre dearer than diesel. There is, therefore, no cost benefit to anybody. There is a massive environmental benefit to the whole island of Ireland and to people in general, particularly in built-up areas and cities such as Dublin. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, said the biggest offender is the Dublin Port area and that static traffic is creating NOx emissions, which are bad for lung health. With all the buzzwords like climate emergency and climate crisis, however, we still do not see Government coming up with the incentive required. The use of HVO provides the ability for farmers to replace the sugar beet industry. An EU directive was brought in to say we can only plant 7% of our hectarage for oilseed rape for the production of food or otherwise or for the production of HVO. It does not matter; the figure is 7%. That would equate to 33,000 ha of Ireland’s landmass. It could be refined here on the island. It would mean we would provide energy security by growing and refining HVO to the tune of 20%. We say every day that we do not have energy security. Our gasfields are about to close, but we will still have them until 2030. We could have this next spring. We could tell farmers the incentive is that this a carbon-efficient rotation crop. It will do wonders for carbon sequestering. The farmers do not get the benefit of that, mind you, but that is another benefit the Government would have. Currently, Government uses the farmers' sequestering of carbon for its own benefit. It is time the Government gave back and admitted we have an alternative, but we are not providing the proper incentives in order that it can be utilised. That is a great shame. What we are seeing here is Government telling us it cannot reduce excise when we know it can. It does not have the will to do it. Government should be providing greening schemes that do not penalise and reduce farmers' production. We should be growing 7% of our hectares under oilseed rape on the basis of refining that into HVO, which is interchangeable for the hundreds of thousands of vehicles I just named, not least the 110,000 trucks and light commercial vehicles on our roads. It should be mandatory for anybody entering the city to use HVO so that we do not get the build-up of NOx emissions. That can only be done if there is an incentive that makes it cost effective, however. From what I outlined, any such scheme would be cost neutral. It is certainly environmentally beneficial. I have not heard from Government why this is not being done. In his answer to this motion, perhaps the Minister of State can outline that. I can see no good reason we would not try to save 90% of emissions and why we would not reduce NOx emissions by 30%. Let me tell the Minister of State that doing so actually reduces the use of AdBlue, of which nobody really knows what the effects will be in the future. This is a proposal that can be instigated tomorrow. The farmers only need to be given notice to grow it next spring. There is no reason not to and, if there is, I expect the Minister of State to outline it. I believe this is a perfectly good and environmentally friendly proposal. If it cannot be done, I ask the Minister of State to tell us why.

As noted previously, the Government is keenly aware of the growing pressures this places on families and businesses. Just like other European member states, Ireland is acutely feeling the effects of the current energy crisis. It is a matter of serious concern to Government that rising electricity and gas prices caused by international conditions are putting increased pressure on consumers. Protecting those in a more vulnerable economic position and at risk of energy poverty is a top priority. Intensive work is now under way to implement the recent Council of the European Union regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices, which includes a temporary revenue cap on electricity producers and a temporary solidarity contribution on excess profits from activities in the fossil fuel sector. The proceeds from this temporary solidarity contribution and the market cap will go towards financial supports to consumers heavily impacted by soaring energy prices. In terms of the overall cost of living, a co-ordinated whole-of-government response is under way. This holistic approach is essential to tackling this issue. As previously outlined, the Government acted throughout 2022 in response to rising energy prices and introduced a suite of measures worth €2.4 billion to assist households in their energy costs. Budget 2023 provides a further €2.5 billion in one-off measures for households. Any major interference in the energy market would need to be carefully considered to avoid potentially disrupting a market that is already facing significant challenges, thereby exposing the Exchequer and, ultimately, the taxpayer to potentially unquantifiable costs. In this regard, direct assistance to customers such as the domestic electricity payment and targeted measures like the fuel allowance are a better approach. As has been highlighted, Government has long provided and will continue to provide practical supports for those struggling with their energy costs. Government continues to allocate significant funding to these practical supports via the welfare system and through energy efficiency grants and retrofitting. Some of the details I wish to outline include the best long-term approaches for Ireland to insulate customers from volatility in international wholesale energy markets, which are to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expand interconnection with European and neighbouring markets and deepen the internal market in energy. In terms of the overall cost of living, it is vital to stress that a co-ordinated whole-of-government response is being followed, which is essential to tackling this issue. The forthcoming energy poverty action plan will set out a range of measures to be implemented this winter as well as key longer-term measures to ensure those least able to afford increased energy costs are supported and protected. This work is being undertaken by a steering group consisting of relevant Departments and agencies. This area of work also includes interactions with the NGO sector. In response to rising energy prices, the Government has already taken action through 2022 and introduced a suite of measures worth € 2.4 billion to assist households in their energy costs. Throughout 2020, the Government has taken action in response to rising prices for a variety of measures, including the electricity costs emergency benefit payment, which saw 99% of domestic electricity accounts being credited with the electricity cost emergency benefit payments of €176, excluding VAT. The total cost of that scheme was €377 million. This was part of a €505 million package of measures that was put in place to address increased costs of living, which included increases in the fuel allowance and a reduction of VAT on electricity and gas bills from 13.5% to 9%. A €320 million measure was introduced to reduce excise duties on petrol, diesel and marked gas oil temporarily, which cut excise by 20 cent per litre on petrol and 15 cent per litre on diesel. The Government has continued to take action. Budget 2023 provides a further €2.5 billion in one-off measures for households. The budget package includes a new electricity cost emergency benefit scheme, which this House passed last month and has now been signed into law by the President.The scheme will credit €550.47 exclusive of VAT to each domestic electricity account in three payments in each of the following billing periods: November-December 2022, January-February 2023 and March-April 2023. The estimated cost of the scheme is €1.2 billion. The scheme will apply to domestic electricity accounts using their unique MPRN to allow the payment to be credited to individual bills automatically without the need for application or approval, including pay-as-you-go meters. Therefore the payments will help both bill-pay and pay-as-you-go customers with their electricity costs. The measures introduced under budget 2023 also include a €400 lump sum payment to fuel allowance recipients in addition to the payment of €33 per week for 28 weeks. That is a total of €924 each year. There is a €200 lump sum payment for pensioners and people with a disability getting the living alone increase; a €500 cost-of-living lump sum payment to all families getting a working family payment; a double payment of child benefit to support all families with children; a €500 cost-of-living payment for people receiving a carer's support grant, which will be paid in November; a €500 lump sum cost-of-living disability support grant to be paid to all people receiving a long-term disability payment; and a €500 rent tax credit to tenants. Budget 2023 also increased the total allocation to the SEAI by 36%, up to €480 million.  The Government is acutely aware of the importance of protecting jobs in order to protect families during this energy crisis. This has been key in the design of the new temporary business energy support scheme, which will provide up to €10,000 per business per month until spring 2023 to help with rising energy costs. The scheme will support eligible companies, covering 40% of the increase in their energy bills. These measures are in addition to Government supports such as the household benefits package, a set of allowances which help with the cost of running a household. This includes allowances towards covering electricity or gas costs and recipients are paid €35 per month. Under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, a special heating supplement may be paid to assist people in certain circumstances. Exceptional needs payments can be made to help meet an essential one-off cost which an applicant is unable to meet from his or her own resources. The ESRI has found that the one-off measures announced as part of budget 2023 would insulate most households from rising prices this winter. As I have outlined, the Government has long provided and will continue to provide practical supports for those struggling with their energy costs. The Government continues to allocate significant funding to these practical supports via the welfare system and through the energy efficiency grants.

Ar an gcéad dul síos, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don iar-Sheanadóir Brian Ó Domhnaill agus do Mhairead san oifig for their research on this. It is quite a basic, simple, honest-to-God motion that ordinary people would recommend. I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State's script that he read out, nor to the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth's script. As usual the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan is not here. Where is he? He is at COP27 in Egypt. Some 400 private jets flew in there and the Government has the audacity to tell people to tighten their belts. I remember the late Charles Haughey with the Charvet shirts telling people to tighten their belts. There is a sense of déja vu; we are here again. This time people are crippled and they are on their knees, begging on life support. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth is gone but I was delighted he was so welcoming of our motion. We are common-sense people. We are not climate deniers. The issue that the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, and others seem to have with us is that we want to keep the lights on here in the interim until we have all the wind that is blowing. At the risk of repeating ourselves and what Deputy O'Donoghue said at the outset, T.K. Whitaker, God rest him, the forefathers of this country and the visionaries had such a passion and a view. I am not an idealist as regards having systems nationalised but we may have to nationalise the power companies because they are not playing ball. Regardless of whether it is a result of pressure from us or our motion, I am glad to see SSE Airtricity has announced today that it will forego all profits for the rest of the year. That is what we need. We need more sticks and less of the codology. We need more cop on instead of COP summits. The children who were in the Gallery earlier, some are still here, were laughing at us because we cannot get this. We are talking about wind and the big plans that are made that in ten years' time, we are going to be all wind, offshore and everything else. Where is it? The wind blows, as Deputy O'Donoghue said, and it does not cost anything for the wind to blow. Where is the regulator? We met the most senior executives of the ESB last week and we learned a lot from them. It is a bad day when we do not learn something. They told us they were waiting for the regulator because this statutory instrument had been passed in Europe. Why are we the laggards always? When it is something that will help the people we are last to do it but if it is something that will penalise the people, we are jumping up and down to do it and to add three or four more statutory instruments to it. Some 96% of all the wind energy produced in Ireland is priced at the same price as gas, even though it is produced at a fraction of the cost. Does the Government get that? It is all bundled in when the ESB or whoever goes out to buy. It is all in there and we are paying that grubby tax on it even though it is cleanly produced. Rip-off Ireland is alive and well in the Government. The regulator is asleep, the energy companies are gouging and no one says a word; why would they? The Government allowed the banks to walk away with billions, bailed them out. It allowed all the big companies put in the data centres. What is big is wonderful as far as the Government is concerned. The Ministers would be great men building snowmen. They would go raving mad altogether at the biggest one, like children with sweets in a confectionary shop. That is what the Government is like while the people perish. Was it Marie Antoinette who said "let them eat cake"? We had lectures this morning for all public buildings not to have a kettle in their offices, not to boil a kettle. Are we going to go back to the beart easnach, the women carrying it tied to their backs with the shawl and they made a little tripod, brought a billy can of water and boiled it? Are we going to do that out in the yard of public offices here? Would the Government cop itself on instead of going to COP26 or 27, whatever it is? It is for a show and glory and to be seen to be better than anybody else. We are small fish in a big pond and we should behave with respect for our nation and not be trying to keep up with all the big boys. We will drive our people into penury to be as good as what they are out there when we see what is happening in China and Germany. We have been talking this morning about what is going on in Spain and Italy where they have implemented this regulation. We will not implement it at all. We will just dance around it and let the taxpayers suffer. In layman's terms, it costs €1,000 per kilowatt hour and the cost of making electricity is €10 per kilowatt hour. The kilowatt hour and all the rest are put in together and the highest price is paid for it. Any of us doing a business deal would not do that. The five or six of us here are small business people. We understand and we feel the pain of all the businesses. I am sure the Minister of State should too, in Limerick. This affects shops, butchers, confectioners and hairdressers; anything using the heat. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth is gone. I asked for clarification yesterday that the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which was introduced to help people up to €10,000, is not applicable if they are using oil as their main source of heating. Where are they going to get piped gas or natural gas in the hills of Hollyford or Killenaule or up in the Knockmealdowns or the Galtees, or much lower down in towns that do not have natural gas? Very few towns have it, a handful in Tipperary. The genie is out of the bottle and the Government is caught napping. I could use another analogy; I will not but I might have to. The Government is wrong and hurtful to the people. I believe it flies in the face of God and it flies in the face of European and national law. What about our Constitution which says we are supposed to look after our people and cherish them equally? We want to honour the big boys. There is a great wind farm rip-off where greedy electricity plants sell us electricity at sky-high prices. It is made from wind, hot air. Goodness, if we had a channel in here we would make a great few kilowatts of it too with the amount of hot air spoken in here at times. I can speak a bit myself as well, I will not exonerate myself from that. Our motion calls for implementation of EU Council Regulation 2022/1854, which came into effect on 8 October. Here we are in the middle of November with no sign of implementing it in this country.When it comes to implementing something good for the people we are laggards and blackguards but when it comes to something that is punitive, whether it is in agriculture, stopping turf cutting or a plethora of issues we do it that night. We can put VAT up here at midnight on budget night and we are debating the Finance Bill 2022, including measures to take away company cars and benefit-in-kind. The Minister blindly said we have to deal with this. Businesses will close and companies cannot compete. We are being penalised and all the workers are being penalised if they do not have a low emissions car. Where is the worker going to charge the car? Where is the infrastructure? Not only does the Government have the cart before the horse but the cart is gone down Dame St. while we are still here with the horse. If the Government had a horse it might break wind and the Government would ban it as well. That is the problem with the Government now that it has become so politically correct. I remember ploughing and bringing hay with horses and I drew water from a well with horses. Are we going to go back to that? We cannot boil the water either, unless we have the beart easnach and the sod of turf. The men in white coats should be around here regularly and checking if people in the Government are feeling okay. What has gone wrong with the Government that it wants to drive our ordinary people into penury, hardship and misery? This includes the man and woman going to work, the delivery services and the man in the van who supplies this country. It also includes the self-employed man with a concrete lorry. I mention SuperValu, which has a chain in Tipperary. In some cases the ESB bill of these shops has gone up from €8,000 to €24,000. They will get half of that back but how are they going to come up with the other €8,000 every month? It is not doable. I mention the price of shopping and Mom's purse is not able to stretch. People will either be hungry or cold or in some cases it will be both. The fear and terror the Government has driven into people is palpable. The media has to take a fair share of the blame too for fanning the flames on climate change. It is real but it is not the be-all and end-all when we see, for example, coal mines being opened in Germany, plants being dismantled in the midlands of Ireland and set up again out foreign and exporting coal and bringing it back in refined. It is codology. If the forefathers who fought for this country thought we would inherit it and follow on with this madness and lunacy they would never have lifted a finger to free Ireland. They would have left it in the United Kingdom or done something else because it is mockery, madness and a charade. The Government is not opposing our motion so I ask it to implement it. Is this another one of the magic tricks or the liquorice allsorts? The Government will not oppose it but it will not implement it either. There is a statutory instrument to be signed into law to make sure that if we are buying energy in bulk the vast majority of what is produced by wind is not charged at the same price as oil. It is making a mockery of the Government's clean energy and how it wants people to go off fossil fuels. It is a three-card trick and these days it is becoming a 24-card trick. All the while the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is outside eating lettuce and smoked salmon with all the rest of them and God knows what they are not eating at COP27; I have not seen the menu and nor do I care about it. I hope meat is on the menu and it might be €120 per plate. I would not look at those lavish things; I would only aspire to them at a wedding and I have a wedding coming up shortly. My daughter is getting married Friday week and hopefully we will have a feast and a good day. We will celebrate as we always do. We want the Minister of State to implement the statutory instrument.

Ar dtús, meabhraím do gach duine a fón a chur ina dtost. An dara rud ná ráiteas atá le déanamh agam. Iarraim ar Chomhaltaí a bheith foighneach ar feadh nóiméid. Sula leanfaimid ar aghaidh, is mian liom a dheimhniú, mar eolas do Theachtaí, go bhfuil scríofa agam chuig an Teachta Marc Mac Searraigh i ndáil leis an ionsaí éagórach gan bhunús a rinne sé ar m'ionracas mar Chathaoirleach i ndeireadh na gCeisteanna ar Pholasaí nó ar Reachtaíocht Dé Céadaoin seo caite. An lá sin, chuir an Teachta Mac Searraigh i mo leith go raibh mé idirdhealaitheach sa tslí ar chaith mé leis siúd agus le Teachta eile. Nuair a rialaigh mé go raibh an Teachta Mac Searraigh as ord agus gur cheart dó suí síos, dhiúltaigh an Teachta Mac Searraigh a dhéanamh amhlaidh, rud a d’fhág gurbh éigean dom an suí a chur ar fionraí. Ní mór dom a chur i gcuimhne do Theachtaí go bhfuil sé mí-ordúil do Theachta diúltú rialú ón gCathaoir a chomhlíonadh. Ina theannta sin, cuirtear i gcoinne ionracas an Chathaoirligh le haon tátal a bhaintear nach bhfuil an Cathaoirleach cothrom agus neamhchlaonta sa tslí ina gcaitheann sé nó sí - mise, sa chás seo - le Teachtaí. Dá réir sin, mar eolas do Theachtaí, tá comhfhreagras chuige sin curtha chuig an Teachta Mac Searraigh. Before we continue, for the information of Members, I wish to confirm that I have written to Deputy Marc MacSharry in relation to his unjustifiable and unfair attack on my integrity as Chair at the end of Questions on Policy or Legislation last Wednesday. On that day, Deputy MacSharry alleged that I was discriminatory in my treatment not only of him, but also other Members. I am particularly conscious that on the day I was elected, I declared solemnly that I would be fair and just. When I ruled that Deputy MacSharry was out of order and that he should resume his seat, he refused to do so, thereby forcing me to suspend the sitting. I must remind Members that it is disorderly for a Deputy to refuse to comply with the ruling of the Chair. Also, the integrity of the Chair is impugned by any inference that the Chair is not fair and impartial in the treatment of Members. Accordingly, for the information of Members, correspondence has been sent to Deputy MacSharry to this effect. Go raibh míle maith agaibh as ucht bhur bhfoighne.

It is a story of an entire generation locked out of affordable housing and locked out of opportunity. It is a generation that works hard and does all the right things but still sees their aspirations pushed further away. Their lives are on hold and their futures are uncertain. Over the past four days, I have received an outpouring of despair from people whose crisis housing situation is badly affecting their mental health. Here is just some of what these people had to say. Amy told me:I'm a [40]-year-old married nurse. We couldn't afford [to] rent anymore. We’ve had to move in with my parents to try to save for a mortgage, but [now] the cost of living [crisis] has ruined things. Only for my parents I couldn't afford to continue living. I am constantly sad and stressed. This is Seán’s story:I’m with my partner of over six years. We are living at home with our parents and sister in a three-[bedroom] house. No room. We want to have kids but where would we put a baby? This is not a life. We both work full time and pay our taxes. We want to start our life, but we can't. My depression is real and it's only getting worse. Kevin said: Myself and [my] partner are in counselling and prescribed medication for stress, depression and anxiety due to the rising prices of houses and [the struggle] to make a life while [we are still] living [with] our parents. We’re considering moving to Canada for a chance at a better life. Edel said:I’ve been homeless since the start of 2020. Going from house to house, room to room. We’ve lost our furniture, our clothing, and the feeling of having a home again. I’m mentally exhausted and the whole family has been dealing with tough mental health issues. This isn't normal. [This] is not right. There is stress, anxiety, depression, medication and a housing Minister who said that we do not have a housing emergency. The Taoiseach said that his housing plan is working. He speaks of indicators of success, but each of these stories is an indicator of the Government's housing failure. I have put it to him time and again that the Government's housing targets are too low, but each time he refused to accept this fact. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has now acknowledged that the targets are wholly inadequate. Finally, last night, the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, was forced to admit that the Government has been working to housing targets that are no where near what is needed. The truth is that this Government falls far short on planning and delivery and people are paying a heavy price. Tá an éigeandáil tithíochta ag cur isteach go mór ar mheabhairshláinte go leor daoine anois. Teastaíonn freagairt éigeandála a dhéileálann le scála na géarchéime. The Taoiseach said housing is the number one issue for his Government. Yet, after two and half years in office, the housing emergency has only got worse. House prices, rents and homelessness are up and now people’s mental health is on the floor. That is the legacy of the Government’s housing plan. Does the Taoiseach now accept that we have a housing emergency? When will we see housing targets that match the actual scale of this emergency? We need energy, pace and an all-of-government approach to fix housing.

I also said that the Housing for All plan is the most substantive plan document detailed of any plan that has been produced by anyone in this House. No Opposition party has come near it in terms of its detail, variety, breadth and depth. The bottom line is progress has been made. However, for many people, we need to build more houses and build them faster. I have always acknowledged that. Since this Government came to power, there has been very significant delivery. On social housing alone, more than 18,000 new social homes have been added to the social housing stock under this Government up to quarter 2 of 2022. This year we are targeting an extra 10,000 social houses between build, lease and acquisition. That is on a scale that has not been seen for decades. Not in the first two decades of this century has that scale of social housing been seen. Progress is being made. However, I am very clear that we need to make more progress than that. On affordable housing schemes, very significant initiatives have been taken. I refer to Sinn Féin's alternative budget, for example.The Deputy has talked about people who are distressed and I acknowledge that people are in distress. However, under its alternative budget, Sinn Féin would have abolished the help-to-buy scheme, which has supported over 35,000 home buyers. Those are ordinary young people who wanted to buy their first homes. Sinn Féin would scrap the first home scheme, which has been introduced in recent months. It provides an equity share up to 30% in a new property. There are already 640 approvals under that scheme. What would Deputy McDonald say to the Jameses, Marys and Johns who have got those approvals? What would she say to the 35,000 people who got help under the help-to-buy scheme? Sinn Féin would also eliminate the new vacant and derelict property grants of €50,000. There are 419 applicants for that scheme. We are expanding that scheme to rural areas and city centres. Sinn Féin would scrap that scheme despite the fact it will help many people. Through affordable housing schemes and Croí Cónaithe, we are making significant gains in respect of affordable housing. That is the bottom line. Sinn Féin has now become the party of catastrophe. That is how it labels itself. I have to put it to the Deputy that if she is sincere in her description of the housing situation as an emergency - and I am saying it is the biggest social issue we have - she must reconcile how the Sinn Féin Party can vote against 1,200 social, affordable and private homes in Ballymastone and Donabate. Some 253 of those homes were intended as social homes and another 253 were to be affordable homes. How could Sinn Féin vote against 853 public homes on Oscar Traynor Road in November 2021 if it is the emergency Deputy McDonald says it is? How could Sinn Féin vote against what was then 768 homes in O'Devaney Gardens in 2019? There are now 1,000 homes, including 275 social homes and 248 affordable homes. Let us think about the language that Deputy McDonald has been using for the last number of months on housing, "emergency" and "catastrophe", and yet she herself objected to 1,600 apartments on the grounds of Clonliffe College, 10% of which are social housing.

If this is described as a catastrophe, then all bets are off in respect of how we provide housing in this country. That is the point I am making. Sinn Féin cannot play it both ways. You cannot say in this House it is a catastrophe and in another chamber vote against housing and housing provision. It is time to get off the fence. I make that point sincerely. I do not think the Deputy can reconcile those two stances. The Government is making progress. We will exceed our targets for this year. I repeat that we will build more than 24,500 houses this year. We need to do more and build more rapidly.

The Minister cannot even accept that it is an emergency. Does the Taoiseach accept that it is an emergency?

I will try to be of some assistance to the Taoiseach by telling him that the answer to this catastrophe is not to produce houses and accommodation that are way out of the reach and price range of ordinary and average workers. The answer is not to incentivise and roll out the red carpet to international funds, vulture or cuckoo funds, call them what you will funds-----

Close to 28,000 homes were built in the 12 months to September 2022. There were nearly 21,000 houses alone built in the first nine months of this year. That already exceeds the total for 2021, which was 20,000. We are projected to reach more than 26,000 homes by the end of the year. It will be the highest number of homes built since 2008. There were more than 16,000 first-time buyers in the past 12 months. That is the highest number since 2007 and it represents 33% of all home purchases, up from 25% in 2015. Construction of 27,400 homes commenced in the year to September alone. More than 167,000 people are now working in construction. That is 20,000 more than pre-pandemic levels and 40,000 more than this time last year. Objectively, people have to acknowledge that progress is being made.

She should allow me to respond to her sound bites and sloganeering and the absence of substance that comes across time and again. The bottom line is that we have to do more than what we have done already. Let us be very clear that we are making progress. The bottom line is that the Deputy is saying that the figures need to increase and we should be building 40,000 homes per year. My point is that we cannot build 40,000 homes per year if the Deputy herself objects to 1,400 units in her own constituency and her party objects to thousands of houses across the board.

We now know that at least 233 men have made allegations of abuse against 77 Irish priests from the Spiritans order. Of that number, 57 have alleged they were abused on the campus of Blackrock College. Some of the abusers were serial abusers who abused with impunity over decades in that school. At night, they roamed freely through the boarding school, abusing their victims in their beds. A culture of omerta and a desire to protect the institution over the children in its care ensured that this dark chapter in the school's history remained shrouded in secrecy until now. We all owe a huge debt of gratitude to brothers Mark and David Ryan who spoke bravely on an RTÉ documentary last week about their own abuse at the hands of Fr. Tom O'Byrne and other priests. Tragically, neither brother knew the other had been abused by the same man until they finally told their parents and went to the Garda in 2002. Their story has prompted many more from a number of different schools run by religious orders to come forward and tell their stories of abuse, trauma and shattered lives. The Irish Times today features an interview with John, which is not his real name, who was repeatedly abused by Brother Luke McCaffrey in Willow Park in the 1980s and 1990. John said he still wakes up screaming, "No, Brother Luke. Please, Brother Luke, please, Brother Luke." He goes on to state:I could never hold down a job, a steady relationship and have alienated all my friends, systematically. I have not met anybody socially in years, and am effectively a recluse, bar walking the dog. I am forever apologising to people for things I haven’t done wrong. I have never been convicted but have always felt like a criminal.How can we stand over a situation in which those who have been abused feel like the criminals and the perpetrators do not? Many abusers have lived long lives and were respected in their communities until they died. In the past hour, the Spiritans have announced that independent experts have been appointed to examine abuse in Spiritan-run schools. We need to examine the detail of that. However, this independent process covers just one congregation. The State has an obligation, belatedly, to act. We must have a public inquiry into what went on in these schools. We must know how many children were abused and by how many abusers. Why was it covered up for so long? There have been allegations of paedophile rings operating, which must also be examined. It is long past the time that we in this country finally dealt with our past in which children were repeatedly raped and abused by those who had a duty to protect them. I am asking the Taoiseach to agree to a public inquiry into these matters.

The level, scale and nature of sexual abuse carried out in Blackrock College and in other school settings is sickening and shocking. Our sympathies, if that is the right word, and thoughts go out to all the victims and survivors of such terrible abuse. Such sexual abuse causes immense trauma for the entire lives of those who have been abused.It destroys many aspects of their lives. Unfortunately, that has been this story for many people for far too long. It is a stain on our society that so much abuse occurred in settings where people were entitled to feel safe and where they should have been protected and nurtured. In that context, we have had many inquiries in the past into abuse in different settings, primarily church settings. I refer to the inquiries into what happened in the Ferns diocese, the Dublin archdiocese, the Cloyne diocese and the industrial schools, many of which were run by the religious. We have learned a lot from many of those inquiries, which were very painful and traumatic for many concerned. We have agreed to a debate on this matter next week. I would be interested in engaging with Members of the Oireachtas and with other parties on how best to go about this. The Government is going to give the matter further consideration in the context of the most effective way to have a victim-led approach to unearthing all aspects of what went on here and if there was a cover-up, the nature of that cover-up. More important is to get a proper understanding of the scale of what went on. I am very conscious that in the past some inquiries took longer than people would have anticipated. I am very conscious that some were more effective and gave outcomes more quickly. The mode and manner in which we go about this is important. We have to learn lessons from previous inquiries in that regard. A bespoke-type of inquiry may be required. As the Deputy knows, the scope and terms of reference of any inquiry are very important. The Government is certainly giving this consideration, but I would like to do it in consultation with other Members of the Oireachtas.

It is going to be necessary in order to find the best way to move forward. This is about isolation and people feeling they are the only one. It would not be possible for this to have gone on as long as it did without that feeling of isolation. On last night's "Prime Time" programme, Mark Ryan said, "You think you're the only one who has been abused. What's needed is a true picture of what happened." We need to get to that true picture of what happened, otherwise people will feel there is no accountability and will continue to feel that isolation. Essentially, some people will have spent a the whole of their lives responding to this. That poor man John feels that he is a criminal, even though he has done nothing wrong. I would appreciate having that engagement. The Taoiseach might articulate how that might happen in addition to the debate next week.

The sexual crime management unit of the Garda National Protective Services Bureau has received a number of new complaints this week. Obviously, the Garda will be fully supported in carrying out its work in pursuing every lead possible. I agree with what the Deputy said about the need to give support to survivors and victims who are coming forward to let them know that they are not alone and that the State will be there to support them in the context of getting the true picture of what happened in this context. We need to continue to lift the veil of silence over this particular matter and try to give some degree of closure, if possible, but also a sense of justice to those who have been abused and those who have been traumatised by what happened in the college and to end the sense of isolation the Deputy spoke about.

Many are living in hotels in Killarney, Tralee, Ballybunion and other places. It is estimated that there are more than 6,000 in the county now, with almost 4,000 housed in hotels and guest houses in Killarney. Our town of Killarney is at capacity. If we are to look after our own people and the refugees and the asylum seekers who are already here properly, it is clear that we cannot accommodate any more at this time. Our medical services, GPs and social welfare officers are under immense pressure. Come the middle of February 2023, what alternative accommodation does the Government have in mind for the massive number of refugees who are housed in our hotels and guesthouses at present? The children who have come here have been integrated into our schools. Our tourism product and our hospitality business in Kerry depend so much on these hotels to provide accommodation for tourists. They are the vital cog in the wheel that keeps the industry going. It is vital for employment for people in craft shops, souvenir shops, tea and coffee shops, confectionery shops, bus and coach tour operators, taxi and hackney operators, jarveys in Killarney and the Gap of Dunloe, the boatmen, the big entertainment venues, such as the INEC and Siamsa Tire in Tralee, small rural pubs that provide music and entertainment, storytelling and culture and tell visitors about traditions, and our entertainers and musicians. All our visitor attractions depend so much on hotel accommodation being available. We have places like Killarney House and Gardens, Muckross House Gardens and Traditional Farms, the national park, our wonderful visitor centres in Ballinskelligs and Dingle and many other attractions. The Taoiseach has spoken about building modular homes. Where will they be built? Will modular homes be built for our people? We must look after our own. Some people have been on the housing list in Killarney for up to 16 years. We want to treat the Ukrainian people properly but we do not want to treat them better than our own people. We need to look after our own people. We need to realise that the businesses I have mentioned are only barely back on their feet after being closed down for two years. What are the Government's plans. How is the Government going to address the accommodation centre for Ukrainians in Killarney after the middle of February?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	64	I appreciate the Deputy raising this important issue. However, we are in a war situation on the Continent of Europe. These are not normal times. An illegal and immoral war is being waged by Russia on Ukraine. That war is being carried out in a manner that targets civilians. Putin is weaponising migration, energy and food. This has caused significant economic upheaval. About 14 million people have been displaced. It is the worst humanitarian crisis on the Continent of Europe since the Second World War. I understand that 7 million of those people are internally displaced in Ukraine and the other 7 million have fled the war and moved across Europe. People are very fearful. In the latest phase of the war, Putin has decided to target critical energy infrastructure in order to try to freeze the inhabitants of Ukraine during winter, thereby making life unlivable for them and causing them to flee. It is a deliberate war tactic. As a nation, we must have some moral values. The entirety of Europe has to hold its nerve and stand up to this. We must not allow ourselves to become fractious or split from each other in terms of rebutting what is happening.To me, what is going on is unthinkable, as is the manner in which Russia is targeting the war. It has consequences. I think up to 63,000 and maybe more Ukrainians have now come into the country. I want to thank the people across the length and breadth of the country, including in Kerry and the Deputy is correct in saying the numbers have been particularly high in Kerry, who have welcomed people into their communities and who have worked very hard to make Ukrainians feel at home. I do not think the vast majority of Irish people see it as our own versus the Ukrainians who came in. Rather, they see it as a matter of what we can do to help. It is challenging for many communities, of that there is no doubt. For our schools and in many areas, it is challenging. I pay tribute to many principals across the country, to boards of management and to teachers who brought Ukrainians into their schools and who are working to help those Ukrainians navigate education in this country while also continuing to access education back in Ukraine. Many Ukrainian parents are doing that with a view to the war eventually ending and they can be in a position to bring their families back and to reunite with their families. We have a whole range of plans. We have started rapid build housing for Ukrainian families. We hope to do 700 by early next year. We will also now do rapid build housing for social housing in Ireland. Advanced manufacturing technology, which is the term in construction technology and is offsite manufacturing, can assist in more rapid construction of housing. That is something we need to embrace more strongly in the country. Given the wider issues that exist in the area of housing we need to build more and at a more rapid place.

Yes, we are in a war situation. I recognise that and everyone recognises that and we feel for the Ukrainian people. But we have an industry in Killarney that has taken generations to build up. Many hotels are taken up with refugees at the present time. I asked the Taoiseach a straight, honest question. How will he deal with the refugees who are supposed to leave those hotels by the end of February? What accommodation has he arranged for them at the end of February? I told him that so many aspects of our tourism sector have only barely started back on their feet again this year. It has been a bare few months. Surely, they should not have to lose out or be compromised because the hotels are not free. They are already taking ye to court for moving them from one hotel to someplace in Wicklow to someplace in Monaghan. Will they leave the hotels? Will the owners of those hotels now want to let them go? The Taoiseach has not answered my important question.

As I have said, my strong answer is that we are in a wartime situation. That is why so much hotel capacity has been made available to take people, including women and children, who are fleeing war. That is why. There is no easy solution to this, but we have managed it so far. There has been an extraordinary response by the country and the sheer numbers are unprecedented. We will work as we have worked since the beginning of the war to continue to accommodate the people who come in as best as we can. It is very difficult and challenging and it will remain challenging until this war is over. We are reconfiguring a number of public buildings that are not quite reconfigured yet to take additional numbers. As I said, we are also looking at rapid build to try to accelerate that and to get higher numbers. We are continuing to work with the many people who have made their facilities available. However, we are one of the few economies in Europe that is still growing. The war is having an economic impact and there is no escaping that. This Government was very supportive off the tourism industry during Covid-19, and it has acknowledged that, but we are in a wartime situation that casts significant shadows and clouds over the economic sky of Europe and that will remain so until this war is over.

By that time, he will have been in this House as a Deputy for 33 and a half years. That is some achievement, as is reaching the highest political office in this land and it would be churlish not to congratulate him on that. My question to the Taoiseach is in his experience and in his tenure in this House, can he tell me how the people can effect change? We elect representatives to make decisions on our behalf or we have referendums. I have repeatedly raised the issue of University Hospital Limerick, UHL, with the Taoiseach and with the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, with the former Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, during this Dáil, as have the other representatives from Clare, Limerick city, Limerick county and the broader mid-west. This week, we learned that 72 non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, made a protected disclosure highlighting a series of near misses at the hospital. They said that patients have to wait more than ten hours for a bed in the unit without any medical attention, while other lost patients are sometimes missed and are left unseen by a doctor for a number of days. They say that many NCHDs do not want to work in UHL and that they actively avoid it because of the working conditions. Many people in my constituency and in neighbouring constituencies do not want to go to hospital there. They are afraid to go to hospital there. Most worryingly, they say that there is a great concern among staff about escalating clinical incidents or important issues to the management. There is a fear of retribution or informal punishments, should a person be identified as suggesting change or discussing pertinent issues in UHL. A similar letter, not a protected disclosure but a letter, was written last year and it is my understanding that there was a witch hunt by senior management to find out who wrote it, where they worked and where they intend to work in the future. That is worrying. I have raised these issues in UHL with the Taoiseach repeatedly and he has said that it is not for this Government to manage a hospital, but it is a matter for the HSE and for the management. I have repeatedly asked the Taoiseach about cases where they are not managing it adequately. It would appear from this protected disclosure, from the letter that was written last year and from a letter that was written by senior consultants which I also brought to the Taoiseach’s attention, that the system is not working. How then do we effect change? I accept that it is for management in the HSE to run hospitals, but when they are not doing this, what happens? I could highlight other incidents. I highlighted the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS. A resolution was passed unopposed by this House, but nothing has changed. We got a document from the Ceann Comhairle’s office. It is nice, yellow and it kind of represents parchment, but that is the extent of it. There was a Covid-19 committee on which Deputy Devlin, who is sitting behind the Taoiseach, sat, as did Deputy Donnelly before he became Minister. That produced a report, yet nothing has happened. There has been no accountability for the billions of euro that was spent, a lot of which was squandered, although not all of it. There has been no accountability for the deaths in nursing homes. How, then, can the people effect change? If democracy does not work, then the centre does not hold. An issue the Taoiseach has highlighted often himself is the importance of democracy and the importance of the centre holding, but the centre has to respond to legitimate concerns in order for that system to work.

On a serious note, we have to keep working hard to effect change. We all have to keep at it. It is interesting that in the last 20 to 25 years, health has been transformed. There is no comparison between outcomes and survival rates today when compared with 20 or 25 years ago. I said yesterday in the House that the reason for this was that we took a more strategic approach to the big diseases that were killing people. There are a number of aspects to health. There is access, which the Deputy touched on, and of how people are treated in an emergency. There are also the matters of how we increase life span, how we increase quality of life and how we reduce the burden of disease on people. To me, that is the big story in health that always gets lost in the most immediate headlines and that is frustrating for many people who are working. As I mentioned yesterday, I spoke to a consultant in stroke care who posted a story on Facebook last year about an almost miraculous intervention with a patient through thrombectomy. The patient got to hospital in time.He got 1 million views. The point he was making to me was that we were not communicating events like that. It just took off. It was a very good story about how a person was saved through modern methods of dealing with stroke, but also a better strategic approach to dealing with stroke in terms of stroke units. The cancer strategies have been immensely successful, with the centralisation of cancer centres and so on. The cardiovascular strategy has been very successful. However, numbers are growing because the population is growing and I feel that services have not grown over the 20-year period to match population growth. That would be a view I would have, and I think that manifests in health. In terms of the specific issue, my understanding is that the protected disclosure might have been sent in June. I stand to be corrected on that. The Minister has met with the NCHDs concerned. As the Deputy knows, the HSE performance management and improvement unit led an intensive engagement with the hospital group and the mid-west community healthcare organisation, CHO, throughout the summer in response to how the hospital was functioning. To be fair, it was not just NCHDs. I think HIQA also raised issues about the hospital. The unit worked with UHL to support and oversee the implementation of rapid improvements in services in the region. These measures include a renewed focus on hospital avoidance, patient flow discharge planning, and regular and frequent assessments of patients with long stays. The performance management and improvement unit is still supporting UHL. It remains a work-in-progress. There is a bespoke site-level plan for Limerick as part of the national winter plan. It needs more consultants and the recruitment of extra staff - two emergency medicine consultants and discharge co-ordinators to target patient flow. That is now happening and they have been hired. The plan also includes improving access to diagnostics in the emergency department, the enhancement of GP out-of-hours services, and committing to the presence of senior decision-makers on a 16-hour, seven-day-per-week basis. The workforce in Limerick has grown by 833 whole-time equivalents. That is an increase of about 29%.

What is actually changing? We can list out reams of statistics. The Taoiseach spoke about changes over 20 years, but the single greatest change over those 20 years has been that people in Clare no longer want to be brought to that hospital. That is a major change. People on the street and in the countryside do not have confidence in the hospital and NCHDs do not want to work in it. At this stage, it should be evident that the hospital is not working. We can pour as much water as we want into a leaking bucket or throw as much money as we want at a system that does not work, but none of that will improve matters. I do not want to speak about individuals, but will the hospital's management structures be examined? Until we do that, the profound change required will not happen.

There has been huge pressure on that hospital over recent years. The workforce has increased - I went through that with the Deputy - and the budget went up 20% in one year alone. In 2022, it is €315 million, an increase of 19%. Actually, that is since 2019, so it was not in one year. The new 60-bed module was put in in 2021 and has opened. There were rapid-build projects. There will be further developments. Work has just commenced on a new four-storey, 96-single bed acute inpatient ward block. That has to happen. I know the Deputy is saying that we are pouring water, but Limerick is the key hospital in that region, so we have to work to improve-----

We also need to consider current concerns. News is breaking about a person against whom serious allegations of abuse have been made and who is living on the grounds of Blackrock College. I have been supplied with the name of that person and I understand he is living in Willow Park Lodge. There are current issues around child protection concerns that an inquiry needs to look into.

He was not able to give a full answer, so I wish to ask him about it again. The Government claims 1,765 new-build social homes were delivered in the first half of this year. Analysis by Laoise Neylon of the Dublin InQuirer shows that the majority of social homes in Dublin city that were categorised as delivered in the first half of this year were not completed. Out of 200 homes claimed to be delivered, 138 were not finished and were still being worked on several months later. This is not disputed by the organisations involved in their delivery. Why are homes that are not completed ending up in the official completion figures of social homes and is this happening in other parts of the country as well?

We are commencing houses. We are allocating resources to approved housing bodies and to local authorities to build social houses. We want them built as fast as we can get them built and, on a 12-month basis, we can see at the end of the year how many we get built, how many we acquire and how many we lease. That is the key point.

We want to exceed that if we can. Next year, we have a target of 29,000, which will be more challenging because of pipeline issues and so on, but we are determined to try to reach the targets we have set on an annual basis.

I can speak for Clondalkin in the constituency I represent, Dublin Mid-West. The shortage is so acute at the moment that a number of schools have large waiting lists of 50, 60 or 70 students. What normally happens is that most students will find a school in their vicinity. In the academic year starting next September, though, students will not be able to find a place in the area whatsoever. Children not having a place is not acceptable. This is an issue of capacity and resources, but how can the Taoiseach put parents' minds at ease about students having places come next September?

Every effort should be made, be it by providing temporary accommodation in respect of some areas, to make sure that kids and young people can access schooling.As the Deputy has said, some of this can get resolved by the time the next academic year starts, but there are mechanisms now whereby schools work together with regard to transparency around the lists and those who apply to different schools to try to ease the anxiety and worry that many students and parents feel.

I very much welcome the €1,000 reduction in the student contribution fee that was announced in the budget. It is relevant for this academic year. On balance it is a good thing and is making a very positive difference downstream. Unfortunately, it is only relevant to students who are eligible for the free fees initiative. The Taoiseach may or may not be aware that there are two groups of students who are excluded from this scheme: those who are repeating an academic year and those who are doing a second degree such as graduate entry medical students. I would be grateful if the Taoiseach and the Minister could look into this to see if we can get these two cohorts of students into the scheme. It will make a huge difference to those affected.

This is the week that refunds have started flowing into students' accounts, which is the €1,000 refund. We will also see the bonus student grant payment on 16 December, and all student grants rising by between 10% and 14% from January. I will look at the two specific groups the Deputy has referred to. I must point out that this is the first reduction in student fees in some 27 years. We will also have other measures, such as the student assistance fund, to assist the students in financial hardship. I will refer to Deputy directly.

The housing crisis exists in every county and the costs for building houses are similar. In Tipperary we want to attract developers to build houses so that families can get into housing. Developers tell me it is unattractive for them to build in Tipperary in comparison with Laois, which is next door, Offaly, Limerick and Waterford, where they can make a reasonable profit due to the higher supports there. The scheme needs to be a level playing field. Why has Tipperary such a low purchase ceiling? Has the Government has any plans to increase this to make it a level playing field with our neighbouring counties? We want to help families to try to get into housing. It is a good scheme but it needs to be tweaked to have fairness and balance for my county in comparison with every other county.

Does the Taoiseach believe Mercosur should have to be ratified by individual parliaments or by referendums, or does the Taoiseach believe the Commission should be able to ratify that directly without consultation with national capitals' parliaments?

We must have a balanced approach to this. I have not heard compelling arguments against free trade agreements, particularly from a country like Ireland, which is an open economy that exports 90% of its goods and services and creates thousands of jobs. The Canadian deal has been very beneficial but everyone is condemning it. Actually, it has been beneficial. There are 400 Enterprise Ireland client companies benefiting from the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and many more companies are getting good access to the Canadian market, and vice versa. The Supreme Court has brought clarity to it and I believe we can deal with it. Obviously we must analyse the judgment.

On rural roads there is an increase in incidents of wild deer in collisions with cars, especially now during the rutting season. There seem to be more of them throughout the country. Drivers really are not expecting to be dealing with that kind of a hazard. They might see a sign but many drivers do not recognise the danger of it. There have been four incidents on the N22 east of Macroom recently, and another car was written off on the N22 just west of Baile Bhuirne. Drivers are not expecting that kind of a hazard. During the rutting season the wild deer have no interest in traffic; they have a different focus. The Road Safety Authority, RSA, has a focus on promoting road safety, it has the budgets, and it should be drawing the attention of drivers to this. Could the matter be raised with the RSA to promote road safety and to raise awareness of the hazard?

The route presented to my dad for education when compared with that presented to my son are such that it is like two different countries. We have crossed many extraordinary milestones in that regard but there is one remaining milestone to be crossed, which relates to the provision of further education and training. The Minister, Deputy Harris, made a significant announcement this morning on funding the establishment of the Atlantic Technological University, ATU. We also need to look at the infrastructure that we provide for the delivery of further education and training, FET, in this country. The people operating in that sector are deserving of our respect and we need to have infrastructure and buildings that convey respect to a sector that has a huge role to play in education in Ireland. The Galway-Roscommon Education and Training Board, GRETB, currently has a very significant proposal before the Department for a new FET college that could and should become the exemplar for the development of similar facilities throughout the country. I urge the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, to consider that application favourably. If we look at what is happening in Armagh, we should be following that example and looking to give the respect to the students and practitioners who operate in our FET sector.

The Deputy is so right that there has been huge progress when it comes to further education and training. We are all proud of what happens in that sector but we are not proud of the infrastructure in which people have to operate.

I expect to have an update on that project in the next month.

Despite months of efforts by the principal and others, first year and second year students have no woodwork, no metalwork, and no technical graphics, because there are no there are no teachers available.

An employment regulation order, ERO, to increase their pay and conditions has been challenged for a second time by three security companies. Some of these companies have extremely lucrative contracts with the State. On the one hand, the companies are negotiating multimillion euro contracts with the State, while on the other, they are doing their utmost to deny decent pay and conditions to their workers, who are delivering on these contracts with the State. I ask for an update on the Government's defence of the ERO on behalf of security workers. Are there plans to consider whether further contracts should be negotiated with these companies? Their workers deliver contracts on behalf of the State, while the same workers watch on as these companies take the Government, essentially, to court to deny workers the pay rise they deserve.

There is very little the State can do to cherry-pick who gets or does not get a contract. There are times when local authorities, states or even governments might like to do that, but then you are down a slippery slope. We urge that EROs not be challenged in the manner this one is being challenged. I will come back to the Deputy on a specific update.

It is a once-off payment and is, unfortunately, not at present applicable to those studying in Northern Ireland, Britain or elsewhere outside our State. That is wrong. We have to encourage students to travel to study on a cross-Border basis, particularly in our own country. This needs to be revisited. There is also the welcome introduction of the rental tax credit of €500 to parents of third level students paying their child's rent in a tenancy registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. That should also be applicable to students whose parents are paying for registered accommodation outside the State. Whatever obstacles exist to ensuring those two benefits are applied to all Irish students should be removed without delay. It is within the capacity of Government to ensure a level playing field and that students who, in many cases, did not obtain places in the State and are studying elsewhere are not disadvantaged.

He has consistently raised this issue. It was a significant initiative by Government to reduce student fees by €1,000 this year and €500 next September. There have been post-Brexit changes, generally speaking, in terms of the grant regime in Scotland vis-á-vis Irish students and fees. I will discuss this again with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science to see what can be done but it is not as straightforward as we would like. I will see what can be done about both issues the Deputy raised.

It is a new development. I do not think I have ever been sanctioned before. I will have to be updated on that and see what the implications of it are. It is part of a broader propaganda war being waged by Russia. As I said in relation to Deputy Danny Healy-Rae's comments on the challenges around accommodation of Ukrainians, we all have to stand together across Europe on this.

I raised it with the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte. She was to raise it the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I think it is to be addressed. I am raising it here again to make sure, because there is confusion, that this applies to people on community employment, CE, schemes and in back-to-work education. They have transferred from disability to a different payment for a short time while undergoing education or training or while on employment schemes. Pensioners should also be entitled to this. If they have a disability, it does not disappear once they turn 66. They still have an additional cost of disability to contend with. Will the Taoiseach provide clarification and a commitment that the additional payments given to people, mostly to address exorbitant energy costs, will not be used in means tests next year for social housing, SUSI grants, medical cards etc?

It has been raised by a number of Deputies. Regarding any anomalies of that kind, we do not want to punish people for being on a training course or that they would lose the once-off payment. We will come back to the Deputy to clarify that but my understanding is those anomalies are being dealt with. The Deputy raised issues in terms of pensions, which are broader social protection policy issues. On means testing, these are once-off payments in respect of an energy crisis and should not affect means tests.

I met with John and Eddie from the Waterford branch. They told me the only person who receives a payment of any kind in that branch is the person who comes in to clean once a week. It is an outstanding voluntary organisation. If people have a need to pick up the phone, somebody will be at the far end of the line 24-7 to pick up and talk to them. You will have a fully trained volunteer on the end of the line. There will be no judgment or pressure. You are advised to let it all out and you are in charge of your own call. The representatives I met did not have a specific ask and I told them that is something they had to come back with, more usefully, but they did say that many of the phone calls they get now relate to loneliness. That has been very much exacerbated by the multiple lockdowns we had to deal with the pandemic. Are we doing enough to tackle the scourge of loneliness across our society?

When I was Minister for Health we had a discrete lottery fund allocation at the time and were able to assist Dublin and Cork Samaritans with new facilities. We should always seek to ensure their facilities are good and any training or whatever is supported. That is their esprit de corps and ethos.

They range from energy bills to delays in accessing energy grants and rebates, on top of rising rates, insurance problems and town planning issues, which are crippling many businesses coming up to Christmas. The representatives have asked for two things. First is the inclusion of ISME on the board of the Labour Employer Economic Forum, LEEF, which I previously brought up in this House. Second is the creation of a body to help non-exporting businesses access export markets in terms of the domestic economy. I ask one more thing. Given the significant problems in the indigenous sector, will the Government look at developing an emergency task force to look at the incredible challenges facing small business? Otherwise, we will have a raft of business redundancies and unemployment in the new year.

The reply was that the Minister was not in a position to state when the work would commence. Seventy-one years later, we had a briefing from Kerry County Council on the residential-zoned land tax that there are more small towns and villages out of the scope of the tax than are actually in scope. Annascaul is at maximum capacity and needs work on its wastewater treatment. That is in addition to other places. There are three students here from Gaelcholáiste Chiarraí who might be interested. Annascaul, Camp, Glenbeigh, Fenit, Castlegregory, Kilflynn among others need it. The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, says that it will be 20 years before water can be adequately cleaned. Development in these towns and villages is being hampered because you cannot build more than two houses because the system is not there. When will the Government do a proper system and allocate proper money so that these can proceed?

No progress has been made despite the fact that TII and the Department of Transport have sent emails to say that they would provide 20 car park spaces for HGV vehicles within the customs facility. The Taoiseach was there himself. It is an expansive facility. It holds 53 trucks. It is used to the tune of four trucks at any one time. The traffic to the UK has reduced substantially and is now around 20% of Rosslare's traffic over the direct ferry. We need road safety. Kilrane National School has 350 children partaking in the road safety programme. Will the Taoiseach please intervene?

On the specifics, I will talk to the relevant authorities but these are issues where there are authorities on the ground who should be doing these things.

I am horrified that today, 99 Clare children who have been referred are still waiting to be seen by the CDNT in Clare. That does not take account of the children that still await a referral. The programme for Government commits explicitly to support the services. However, these families are being failed. What can the Taoiseach tell these children and their families today?

It is a good scheme but unfortunately, there are some cohorts which do not quite fit in. Farmers who are on the hen harrier scheme and superficially in Clare, Burren farmers. There are 400 farmers in Clare in the Burren Life programme. It is a fantastic project which is run by Dr. Brendan Dunford and his team. I have met them and the Irish Farmers Association, IFA. The new scheme does not cater for them. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, will meet them next Tuesday and hopefully there will be a positive outcome. This is a project that has led the way. The fields in the Burren are scored on a one to ten grade. Farmers are paid by the environmental inputs. The project has been recognised by UNESCO. I do not know of any farm, field or tract of land that has been recognised in Europe apart from the Burren. It is now a geopark. Will the Taoiseach comment on the mass resignation of board members from Horse Sport Ireland?

I have convened meetings with the Ministers for Health and Education, Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and the HSE to prioritise the recruitment of therapists for special needs children. I have had issues on how this has progressed in certain areas with disability where children's access to therapists is not optimal. The issue seems to be particularly acute in the disability services in respect of the capacity to recruit therapists. Other sectors of the health service seem to have a better track record of recruiting therapists. That is an issue that needs to be sorted out by the HSE in respect of recruiting sufficient therapists for disability services for children. ACRES is a fantastic scheme. I have a note here which I can share with the Deputy. I think that it is being expanded. The Burren programme involves a total area of just 11,000 ha of habitat being scored as a result of the results-based assessment. By comparison, under ACRES it is expected that almost 40,000 ha will be scored. That is a significant upscaling of environmental monitoring and assessment of that region. I have heard some concerns that farmers might get a lesser amount or whatever. I think that we have to address that. I will engage with the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine on that because we want to reward people doing good by the environment. We have to make sure that the entire thing is environmentally sound and that we do not lose the gains that have been made by the original programme.  The Minister is evaluating the situation regarding Horse Racing Ireland and I will come back to the Deputy on that.

Throughout the CETA debate, Government parties consistently sought to reduce the discussion to one in which one was either for trade or against it. The reality, of course, is that no one in this Chamber is opposed to trade that incorporates and protects environmental rights and the rights of workers. Investment courts actively work against these rights and ride roughshod over democracy and domestic judicial systems. I commend Deputy Costello on pursuing this matter through the courts. I am sure it was a difficult decision for him. The Government parties must now take time to consider in depth the significant judgment, which includes the seven separate opinions of the Supreme Court members. As has been stated repeatedly, the trading element of the agreement is already under way. There is no urgent requirement for Ireland to ratify it. Several EU countries, including France and Germany, have not yet ratified it in full. Ireland is not alone in its concerns. There is growing opposition across Europe and in the US to investor courts, for which there is neither a need nor a legal basis. I urge the Government's three party leaders to fully consider the implications of the judgment and, if they remain wedded to the investor courts system, to put the question to the people through a referendum.

This week, I had two families in tears in my clinic. They felt absolutely hopeless owing to the prospect of their being made homeless with their children. They were worrying about the mental health impact on their children, who were on the floor with depression at the prospect of being made homeless. In addition to addressing all the policy issues related to delivering affordable and public housing and stopping evictions, many of which the Government will not address, could the Taoiseach, at a minimum, provide better Government information on what people should do so they will have a place to go? I suggest that we develop a housing hub or portal as part of the GIS. It should be widely advertised on radio and television in order that there would at least be a place for people to get information on what they should do in a crisis and how they should access affordable housing or cost-rental accommodation. It should deal with all the frequently asked questions of people in acute distress because of the housing crisis, giving them a place to go. I will set aside the wider policy debates, which we have had many times. At the very least, the Government could vastly improve the information it makes available to people, particularly those in desperate circumstances.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	147	I presume the Taoiseach is aware that the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, decided, on the basis of a 3:2 majority, that it would not investigate further my complaint about the leaking by the then Taoiseach, now the Tánaiste, of the GP contract to his political supporter Maitiú Ó Tuathail. I want to focus on the reasoning set out by the commission. In its concluding paragraph, it states, "The commission carefully considered its legal advice and all the evidence before it, including the acceptance by the respondent that he did disclose the agreement but that it was done pursuant to the functions of the office of the Taoiseach and in furtherance of the policy goals of the Government." It adds, "In such circumstances, where the commission is of the view that it has no role and/or remit to consider either the lawfulness of the action or the extent of the powers of the office of Taoiseach, it is the opinion of the commission that evidence sufficient to sustain a complaint is not and will not be available, even in circumstances where the disclosure of the Agreement is not in dispute." Effectively the Tánaiste, the then Taoiseach, used the Nixon defence or Trump defence: I leaked the contract, broke the ethics legislation and breached the codes of conduct but did it as Taoiseach in pursuance of the policy goals of the Government, and therefore it is okay. The commission has accepted that defence and does not go into whether it is true. It does not make a judgment on whether the former Taoiseach did what he did in pursuance of the policy goals of the Government. Once he raises the defence in question, the commission states it cannot look into the matter any further. Does the Taoiseach agree there is a problem here that creates a very troublesome precedent, whereby the next Taoiseach, who just happens to be the person complained about, or another future Taoiseach will be able to blatantly breach ethics legislation and stop any investigation by simply saying he did what he did as Taoiseach?

If the audience is going to groan at one of the ads, which one will it be? I bet it will be the one that ends with the words, "This ad was brought to you by the Government of Ireland." When the punter goes to the cinema or switches on the television, he or she should be able to watch the movie or television show without having to swallow a dose of Government propaganda. A person who, for example, strongly dislikes this Government and its policy might, unfortunately, be more inclined to ignore public health advice if it is part of a package that finishes up by telling him that the ad and information have been brought to him by the Government of Ireland. Does the Taoiseach agree with the point I am making? Does he agree that it is high time for Big Brother to take a bit of a hike on this issue and for the Government to decide to lay off on the propaganda?

I have welcomed the clarity the Supreme Court has brought to the issue in respect of the manner in which CETA can be ratified. The ruling by a 6:1 majority was that CETA could be ratified by the Oireachtas if certain changes were made to domestic legislation, in particular the Arbitration Act 2010. The Deputy opposite criticised me for raising free trade but it is my view that her party has been very negative about CETA and has never commented on the benefits of the free trade deal with Canada, which as she outlined, has provisionally been in operation for five years. Trade has increased by 30%. It is good for jobs in the country. I have never heard ringing declarations from Sinn Féin about free trade. It has always been the opposite, consistently, in recent years. That has been Sinn Féin's position. The party is entitled to have the position it has held, and it may change it. I am even beginning to detect subtle hints of change already in the Deputy's contribution this afternoon. We will see. More fundamentally, I would make the point that all the free trade agreements have a standard practice globally of using arbitration mechanisms. It is not to enable companies to sue countries on anything but rather to make sure that the terms of the actual agreement are met in terms of fairness and the application of the rules pertaining to any agreement. It is very clear that as a member of the European Union, we cannot engage in any practice via the trade agreements that would be contrary to the treaties. It is the European Union, specifically the Commission, that negotiates these trade agreements with parties like Canada, which is a liberal democracy itself. The overall benefit to Ireland is always very positive from such trade deals. It never gets acknowledged in the debate that it has been a positive for Ireland, right across all the various trade deals that have been negotiated. We are a small country with an open economy and we sell most of what we produce and make, which creates jobs and enables companies to develop and grow. We will analyse the judgment. We will give sufficient time to all parties to do so, and we will come forward with our view then in respect of how we deal with the situation. To date, some 16 of the 27 EU member states have ratified CETA. It remains provisionally applied, as the Deputy says, since 21 September 2017. In respect of this, in the past five years, the world has not caved in. Canada is a very important export market. Some 400 Enterprise Ireland client companies are doing business in the Canadian market now. We exported approximately €4 billion worth of goods and services to Canada in 20-----

CETA is in the interests of workers, taxpayers and businesses in rural and urban Ireland. All agreements have dispute resolution mechanisms. Deputy Paul Murphy raised the SIPO decision. SIPO has decided. It is a body that is independent of the Oireachtas. At times, I worry that if a decision does not go a person's way that it somehow has to be re-interrogated and it must be wrong because it does not accord with the Deputy's position. Every decision can be subject to subjective analysis. In this case, the Deputy has a perspective on it. Whether one likes it or not, the decision has been taken by an independent body that is independent of the Oireachtas. We should respect that decision. There already has been an investigation that went the whole way to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. The Deputy knows that the decision was that there was no case to proceed with. SIPO should be allowed to continue to act independently of the Oireachtas in respect of all its duties and in terms of decisions. There is a danger of indirect pressure being put on SIPO to get the right result.

I recall that some years back I went to see the premiere of "Michael Collins" in the Capitol cinema in Cork and a rather innovative PR adviser to the Fianna Fáil Party at the time decided to put advertisements about getting tough with the drug lords, and lo and behold, at the end of the advertisement, it was announced to the full audience that the advertisement was brought to them by Fianna Fáil. There was a collective groan from the audience, which was waiting for the premiere of "Michael Collins". Deputy Barry brought that memory back to me. Covid proves him wrong. The vaccination level was 96%. The advertisements were brought to the people by the Government of Ireland and people responded to the public health message. In fairness, they were brought in a very non-political way. It is important that that is the case.

I was missing a pen when Deputy Boyd Barrett raised the issue about housing. There is a cross-government communications approach to housing. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has clear communications portals for people to contact depending on their housing situation on the various schemes they can access. I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett and follow up on the point he made about his suggestion for a one-stop-shop. I think his suggestion was along those lines.

It was a fair point. In response to Deputy Bacik, during Covid, an assistant secretary in my Department oversaw the Covid situation and co-ordinated with other Departments. Advice was taken from professionals in the field about the type of advertisements and other such issues. Research was done by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and other such bodies as to the best type of advertisements. There are professionals in that field and there is no political involvement in terms of either the content of advertisements or how they are designed. I am meeting with the Irish Thalidomide Association tomorrow morning.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	166	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 11, inclusive, together. The sustainable development goals, SDGs, adopted in 2015, are the United Nations blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all by 2030. They address the global challenges we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental degradation, peace and justice. Under the programme for Government, the Government is committed to continue work towards the 17 goals. This is a whole-of-government effort, led by the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, who has lead responsibility for promoting and overseeing the coherent implementation of the SDGs. The implementation of measures associated with individual goals is the responsibility of relevant Ministers and Departments. Political oversight is provided through the Cabinet committee system and, where necessary, at Government level. A senior officials group, chaired by my Department and supported by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, provides a mechanism to co-ordinate and monitor progress towards the goals. It brings together representatives of all Departments responsible for implementation.In addition to monitoring implementation, it provides strategic input on tasks including development of Ireland's national implementation plan, the second iteration of which was published in October. It will also support preparation of Ireland's second voluntary national review of progress towards the goals, which is due for delivery at the United Nations High-Level Political Forum in July 2023. The group's work is supported by an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, and by the Central Statistics Office's data governance board. The Government's vision is for Ireland to fully implement the SDGs at home and to contribute to their achievement in order so that no one is left behind. I was pleased, therefore, to launch Ireland's second national implementation plan for the SDGs along with the Tánaiste, the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, and other Government Ministers on 5 October 2022. The plan sets out Ireland's implementation strategy until 2024 and is focused on ensuring that the goals are better integrated into our work across Government, and more widely across local government. It sets out five key strategic objectives and 51 actions, involving 119 individual measures, to significantly increase Ireland's ambition and strengthen our implementation. Implementation of the goals is both a domestic and international priority. I was pleased to meet with the President of the General Assembly, Csaba Korösi, at the UN General Assembly high-level week in September and to agree to his request that Ireland take on the role of co-facilitator of the political declaration for a UN SDG summit to be held in New York in September 2024. Ireland is deeply engaged in the elaboration and adoption of the goals. In that context, I very much welcome this opportunity for Ireland to play an ongoing role as we approach the mid-point in the journey to implementation by 2030. As I highlighted in my address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, progress made in implementing the goals in previous years has stalled, or in some cases gone into reverse, more recently as we have grappled with the Covid-19 pandemic, increased natural disasters and the consequences of the war in Ukraine, including for food security. It is all the more important, therefore, that governments redouble their efforts ahead of the summit in 2024 and in the years remaining to 2030.

The core commitment of Agenda 2030 is a pledge to leave no one behind. A focus is placed on ensuring the needs of the most vulnerable are met and quality and accessible services are to be enhanced. The Taoiseach has outlined the 51 actions involving 119 individual measures, but Ministers must deliver on outstanding Government commitments upon which these goals are built. An example is the transfer of disability services from the Department of Health to Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, which has still not taken place despite there being a commitment in this regard in the programme for Government. I understand the blockage to the transfer lies with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but no clarity has been provided as to what the issue actually is. We now have a crazy situation where the Minister for Health will no longer answer questions on services and budgets he says he is no longer responsible for and the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, will not address these matters until such time as the transfer has taken place.

Both apply to a developing situation at Scoil Eoin in Innishannon, which I recently visited. It is a fantastic school with amazing staff. It has children with a whole range of intellectual disabilities and it is crying out for extra special needs assistants, SNAs. Not only is the school having an issue securing an extra SNA allocation, it is struggling to get the special educational needs organiser, SENO, to visit the school to see the situation on the ground. The SENO was supposed to visit the school on October 26 but now it has been put back. This is not only impacting the education of the children at the school but also the school's ability to provide education to future pupils with intellectual disabilities. I ask the Taoiseach to use his offices to intervene and ensure that at the very least, the SENO visits Scoil Eoin as soon as possible.

Goal 16 relates to justice, strong institutions and access to same. I put it to the Taoiseach that the Government's commitment to CETA threatens access to justice. He should not throw sand in people's eyes with talk about who is for free trade or trade generally. I am for fair trade, by the way, rather than free trade for the sake of it with no regard to whether it is fair or not. I am absolutely for trade that is mutually beneficial. The issue with CETA is the investor court system, which has not been implemented. The Taoiseach says trade with Canada has improved.

This is a potentially important directive that would make corporations responsible for abuses of labour rights, environmental protection and consumer protection right through their supply chains. However, a massive corporate lobbying effort to water it down is happening. An important part of that effort is saying finance should be excluded. The Irish Coalition for Business and Human Rights met the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, last week and asked if the Government has taken a position on this. The coalition was told the Government has not done so. However, the next day Reuters reported:Luxembourg, Ireland and Germany have indicated they want to exclude asset managers and institutional investors from scope [...] Ireland said in a submission it could not signal its agreement to including financial undertakings, and called for an assessment from the EU's securities, insurance and banking watchdogs ...Is that the Government's position? How can the Taoiseach possibly justify it?

I wish to speak about two goals. Goal 6 concerns clean water and sanitation, which speaks to an issue in my constituency of Dublin Bay South. I welcomed the recent announcement by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, that water quality monitoring would now take place year-round, in response to an ongoing campaign I have been running along with Deputy Carroll MacNeill. It is very welcome. In the interest of public health and goal 6, will the Government now inform swimmers about how to ensure safety in water as we see more and more recreational use of our water? I am taken with the Taoiseach's reminiscence about the cinema. It has been a long time since I went to the cinema but we can see an advertising campaign "brought to you by the Government of Ireland", informing people about water safety. I met Water Safety Ireland recently in Galway and it has some great creative advertising campaigns that deserve more support. I refer also to goal 7 on affordable and clean energy-----

While he was trotting out the hype in Egypt, the reality at home is very different. Take the well-being framework for example. The framework monitors 35 indicators of well-being and the 2022 report finds progress in some areas, a neutral, as-you-were situation in others and only one that was negative. Which indicator was negative? It was environment, climate and biodiversity. The report noted Ireland now has the highest greenhouse gas emissions per capita in Europe after Luxembourg and scored poorly on water pollution, etc. Will the Taoiseach accept Governments led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael that were beholden to big business interests that put profit before the environment have failed, and are failing badly, on these crucial issues?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	178	I thank the Deputies for raising the issues. The focus today is very domestic, whereas the SDGs have declined globally to a far more significant extent, especially with respect to nutrition. The World Food Programme is extremely alarmed at how, over the past five years, the numbers facing famine have grown exponentially and reversed the progress of the previous decade.This is a big worry. That said, we need to keep a global focus on the SDGs. In terms of the transfer of transfer of disability services from the Department of Health to Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, that was a decision the Government took at the beginning of its term. I am concerned at the length of time it is taking. I have told all Ministers that I want that brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, is working away all the time, with the HSE and within her Department, in terms of advancing a range of issues pertaining to disabilities more generally. To be fair, she has secured pretty significant additional resources over two budgets in respect of children with special needs and disabilities. I want to get the issue of the transfer brought to a conclusion. I do not disagree on that. It is something we will pursue. Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan raised the issue of Scoil Eoin in Innishannon. I will certainly follow that up with the National Council for Special Education in the context of the SENO visiting the school. That is important. There has been a dramatic increase in expenditure and investment in special needs education in the past two years. The increase is quite dramatic when we look at it nationally. We should be in the position to help out in terms of what the issues are in that regard. Deputy Boyd Barrett again raised the issue of CETA. I do not believe CETA represents a threat to justice or access to justice. As I said to him, all trade agreements have dispute resolution mechanisms.

I endorse what she said about some very imaginative advertisements around water safety. Her view is that we need to do more in terms of water quality monitoring. That is improving now. it is going to enhance for swimmers, in particular the quality of water in their bays. I read Mr. Mark Henry's chapter on this. There has been a dramatic improvement over 20 or 30 years in water quality. The lesson is that we could do more faster in the current era to get more water treatment plants done, and also flood protection schemes. They are being objected to left, right centre, however.

There always has to be a balance and trade-offs in terms of trying to get the vital infrastructure that protects water quality and protects people from being flooded on a continuing basis in place. There are always groups that want to get the optimum in different situations, and we have problems with infrastructure. I can tell Deputy Barry that I was not doing the best-boy-in-the-class routine at Sharm El-Sheik. What you quoted from the well-being framework is what I quoted some weeks ago in this House in answering questions to your good selves.

I have been very modest about Ireland because Ireland has been a laggard for the last ten years of respect of climate change. We are now catching up but we have a long way to go and much to do. What I said at Sharm El-Sheik was that the carbon tax gave us very substantial funds to enable us to combat fuel poverty, provide for environmentally friendly farming and, above all, provide for a comprehensive sustainable retrofitting programme for the next ten years.

The high-level action plan for the Report of the Commission on the Defence Forces sets out initial implementation and oversight structures. It was agreed by the Government on 12 July 2022. Under the action plan, a high-level steering board will oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations. In addition to supporting and guiding the implementation, the board will also act as a clearing house for issues or blockages in the implementation of the Commission's recommendations. The steering board will be chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. Membership of the board will include the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, the Secretaries General of the Departments of Defence, Justice, Foreign Affairs, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Environment, Climate and Communications, as well as the Chair of the implementation oversight group. It would not be anticipated that the board will meet until the implementation process has had some time to get under way. The independently chaired implementation oversight group will oversee and drive progress with regard to the implementation of the recommendations of the commission. Significant work is progressing on the early actions and the development of the implementation plan. To support this work, the implementation oversight group met for the first time on 3 October, with a further two meetings due to take place before the end of the year. A civil-military implementation management office has been established to support the implementation of the overall programme required to implement recommendations from the commission's report. The initial focus of the office is the implementation of the 38 early actions as set out in the high-level action plan and the development of an implementation plan within six months of the Government decision in July. Reporting mechanisms have been established to facilitate regular progress on the early actions.

Yet, the Minister was told in June 2021 there was just one such allegation to that point. How can the Women of Honour group and others have confidence that the review group that was set up after the Sinn Féin motion calling for a full statutory inquiry will effect the necessary change when such contradictory information surrounding even the level of reporting exists? We should not confuse engaging with that review as complete support for that review. Has the Taoiseach seen the interim report by the review group? Does it address the allegation processes that sought to limit or circumvent reporting? Does it address the use of non-disclosure agreements? The majority of those in the Defence Forces are honest, hard-working people. They also need to have confidence in this report. When will the transformational change to modernise the organisation culture be in place, namely, the civilian head for transformation and the gender adviser?

We all condemn Putin's bloody war and the escalation we are seeing at the moment. However, the Government's association with and echoing of the NATO line, abandoning a position of neutrality which should be about upholding opposition to war and military solutions in dangerous conflicts like this, is undermining our neutrality and our international reputation as a neutral country. Ultimately it is endangering the Irish Defence Forces.

That comes on top of the revelation that Ireland participated in person at two meetings happening at NATO headquarters in Brussels over the last couple of months and one meeting at NATO allied air command at the Rammstein air base in Germany. It also comes just before participation in a military training exercise for Ukrainian troops. According to the press statement, the aim of the mission is to contribute to enhancing the military capability of Ukraine's armed forces. It is clearly a full spectrum. Will there be a vote in the Dáil?

The Defence Forces have had a culture of sexual harassment, sexual assault and sexual violence which has thrived on secrecy. That culture of secrecy is now being bolstered and supplemented by the State's use of these non-disclosure agreements. We are told that the independent review group will submit its report to the Minister by the end of the year. Can the Taoiseach be more exact? Will it be next week, or the week after? When is the Taoiseach going to concede the necessity of a full statutory inquiry which the Women of Honour have been forced to wait for for too long now?

In respect of the Women of Honour issue, I have met with both groups and we are waiting for the conclusion of the review. It was important to do that review and then to take further action depending on its recommendations. There is a need for fundamental culture change within our Defence Forces in respect of the treatment of women, parity of esteem, respect and true equality.

We are seen by Putin as a protagonist and the Deputy is sort of saying he is right, that the Taoiseach should be worried because Putin sanctioned me. I do not understand where he is coming from, genuinely. He added on that dangerous line about endangering the Irish Defence Forces because Putin is a bully and is trying to intimidate people.

The agenda covered Ukraine, energy, economic issues and external relations. In his contribution this afternoon, the Minister of State, Deputy Thomas Byrne, will address a number of the external relations agenda items, including the forthcoming EU-Association of Southeast Asian Nations summit scheduled to take place in Brussels on 14 December. He will also address the western Balkans, including looking ahead to the EU-western Balkans summit taking place in Tirana, Albania on 6 December. I will address all other issues. At the meeting of the European Council we considered preparations for the 27th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties, known as COP27, which commenced last week and is continuing this week. At European Union level, the launch of the European Green Deal in December 2019 brought new impetus to climate policy and action. The European climate law, as one of the elements of the European Green Deal, sets a binding target of a climate-neutral European Union by 2050 and at least 55% greenhouse gas emissions reduction in the EU by 2030 compared to 1990. The EU's strength is our solidarity as a bloc with the common purpose and shared vision of achieving a transition to net zero over the coming decades. I would like to take this opportunity to update the House on my own participation in the world leaders' summit in Sharm El-Sheikh on 7 and 8 November. I delivered Ireland's national statement at the summit, setting out Ireland's climate ambition and the Government's commitment to supporting vulnerable countries which, despite having contributed least to climate change, are bearing the brunt of its impact. While the situation facing the world is very serious, I was clear that it is not too late to act and that it is realistic for our legacy to be a sustainable planet. While at the summit, I also engaged in a number of high-level events and round-tables, including on food security and on the sustainability of vulnerable communities. I highlighted Ireland's commitment of over €800 million to support nutrition over the next five years and over €100 million in response to the devastating drought and food security crisis in countries in the Horn of Africa. I particularly condemned the weaponising of hunger by Russia in its illegal and immoral war on Ukraine. I attended a round-table event hosted by the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, and the President of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo, where I announced that Ireland will contribute €10 million to the Global Shield initiative for 2023, to protect the most vulnerable from climate loss and damage. This initiative is sponsored by the G7 and by the V20 group of vulnerable countries and is aimed at scaling up the finance needed to protect against climate risks in poor countries.In my various engagements I highlighted Ireland's ambition to see progress on the issue of loss and damage. We need to see commitments entered into on previous occasions implemented, including on climate finance. Under Ireland's climate finance roadmap, we are aiming to more than double our finance to at least €225 million a year by 2025, with a continuing focus on adaptation and resilience to climate impacts, along with newer themes such as biodiversity and loss and damage. Recent disasters underline the need for Europe to accelerate the radical transformation needed to tackle the climate and nature crises and make our economies and democracies more resilient, our industries more competitive, and our societies fairer. October's meeting of the European Council was our fifth meeting since Russia began its full-scale war on Ukraine on 24 February. The European Union continues to be resolute and united in our response to Russia's blatant disregard for human life, human rights, and international law. In discussing the latest developments in the war and their wider implications, we sent a strong message that the EU will stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. We are concerned about the death of civilians in Poland near its border with Ukraine yesterday. The Polish authorities are investigating the matter and we wish to express our condolences to the families of those whose lives have been lost overnight in Poland and since the start of this terrible war. We should be clear, however. Wherever it turns out the missile concerned originated, Russia is wholly responsible for the consequences of an illegal war that it launched and is continuing to prosecute against Ukraine. At the European Council, we discussed the need for continued strong political, military and financial support to Ukraine, including for its liquidity needs, and how to step up our humanitarian response, in particular as winter approaches. In that context, I am pleased to confirm that on 10 November, the Government agreed €30 million for 2022 to provide bilateral institutional support for the stability of the governments of Ukraine, which will receive €25 million, and Moldova, which will receive €5 million. This is particularly to mitigate the impact on essential government services in those countries due to Russia's war. The European Council condemned the despicable and indiscriminate missile and drone attacks against civilians in Kyiv and across Ukraine and the devastating impact they are having on Ukraine's energy and other critical civilian infrastructure. We also welcomed the adoption of the eighth sanctions package on 6 October and underlined our resolve to continue to reinforce sanctions as well as calling for their effective implementation. The European Council also discussed how to ensure the security of critical infrastructure. Since the start of the war, we have seen an increase in the use of hybrid attacks, including deliberate acts of sabotage such as those against the Nord Stream pipelines. These need to be met with a united and determined response. We reiterated our condemnation of the illegal annexation by Russia of Ukraine's Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions. The European Union will never recognise such illegal annexations. The recent liberation of the city of Kherson by Ukrainian forces is welcome. The obvious joy of the population at the retreat of the Russian forces gives lie to the sham referendum held by Russia in the region in September. The liberation has, once again, revealed the depravity of the Russian occupation and the extent of war crimes committed against civilian populations. The European Council reaffirmed our commitment to hold Russia to account on such crimes and expressed our resolute support for investigations by the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court. We also discussed how to increase pressure on Russia further to get it to end its war of aggression, stressing the importance of a united European approach on travel visas for Russian applicants. Ukraine will continue to need extensive international support after the war to rebuild and repair the extraordinary damage the Russian campaign is inflicting on the country. This will take a global effort. The European Council discussed the governance and financing of its efforts to support Ukraine's relief, rehabilitation and reconstruction ahead of the International Expert Conference on the Recovery, Reconstruction and Modernisation of Ukraine in Berlin, which subsequently took place on 25 October 2022. I am glad the European Commission has also since published a formal proposal on 9 November to put funding for Ukraine's current needs on a more structured footing, proposing a package of highly concessional loans of €18 billion for 2023. EU leaders also discussed recent developments in Iran. In the context of Ukraine, we condemned Iran's military support to Russia's war of aggression, which must stop, and welcomed the EU sanctions in this regard adopted on 20 October 2022. Just as Iran is assisting an oppressor abroad, within Iran we are seeing unjustifiable and unacceptable use of force by the authorities against peaceful protestors, in particular against women. This too has to stop. At the European Council meeting, leaders welcomed the EU's restrictive measures adopted on 17 October 2022 against the perpetrators of these serious human rights violations. We had an important further discussion on energy in the context of high prices and supply constraints. Leaders discussed the European Commission's communication on the energy emergency, as well as a proposed emergency regulation, which had been published by the European Commission in advance of our meeting. There was a strong commitment among leaders to accelerate and intensify efforts to reduce demand, ensure security of supply, avoid rationing, and lower energy prices for households and businesses across the Union while preserving the integrity of the Single Market. We called on the Council and the Commission to submit concrete decisions on a number of additional measures, as a matter of urgency, in areas such as voluntary joint purchase of gas, measures to limit the potential for price spikes in the natural gas market, and a temporary framework to cap the price of gas in electricity generation, including a cost and benefit analysis. We also called for progress on fast-tracking the simplification of permitting procedures to accelerate the roll-out of renewables and grids. Energy ministers are continuing to meet to examine these issues in detail, and I expect the European Council to return to them when we meet again in December. As the House will be aware, proposals in this area are complex and need to take differing national circumstances and energy mixes into account. It is important to recall also that the European Union has already taken significant measures on energy, both to underpin security of supply and to mitigate the impact of the dramatic price increases we have seen for businesses and consumers. As a result, we have seen a significant diversification away from Russian fossil fuels and towards more reliable suppliers, including Norway, the United States and others. In advance of this winter, gas storage across the EU has been filled to well over 90%. As the only viable solution for the long term, it is vital we accelerate the green transition and step up investments in future-ready energy infrastructure, including interconnections and innovative renewable technologies, to enhance our energy security and meet our climate ambitions. The European Council also took stock of the economic situation more generally. As highlighted by the European Commission in last week's autumn 2022 economic forecast, the sharp rise in inflation, in particular rises in energy, food and other commodity prices, is impacting a global economy that is still affected by the economic consequences of the pandemic. The EU is among the most exposed economies due to its geographical proximity to the war in Ukraine and heavy, albeit diminishing reliance on imports of fossil fuels. Although the Commission suggests that growth in 2022 is set to be better than previously forecast, the outlook for 2023 is significantly weaker for growth and higher for inflation compared with the European Commission's previous forecast presented in July. The Commission is forecasting GDP growth falling to 0.3% in 2023, with inflation declining but remaining high at 7%. Leaders will continue to co-ordinate closely in our policy responses, including to the economic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I welcome in this context the amendment adopted by the European Commission last month to the temporary crisis framework for state aids, which will enable member states to continue to use the flexibility foreseen under state aid rules for emergency circumstances. Protecting households, businesses and jobs is our immediate priority, in particular the most vulnerable in our societies, while preserving the European Union's global competitiveness and the integrity of our Single Market. At our October meeting, we also had a strategic discussion on the EU's relationship with China. The EU has long recognised China as a partner, competitor and rival in different areas. The EU co-operates with China, for instance, to address important global issues such as climate change and global health issues. China is also a part of increasingly integrated global supply chains, as we saw clearly during the pandemic. At the same time, this is a time of heightened geopolitical uncertainty, including as regards China's stance on Russia's war on Ukraine. It is also in a context where the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has reported that the restrictions and deprivations against the Uyghur people and others in Xinjiang may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity. There are also deep concerns about human rights and political freedom in Hong Kong.The European Council considered how we can collectively best use our influence to shape developments. Leaders also took stock of preparations for COP15 of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, which will take place in Canada in December, with a view to agreeing a new global framework to provide for the transformative change that the biodiversity crisis urgently demands. Ireland is committed to continuing to work effectively so that the European Union and its member states present a strong and coherent voice for nature and biodiversity to help bring about this change. I will travel to Brussels in December for the next meeting of the European Council, when I expect we will again discuss developments in Ukraine, energy and the economic situation. We will also reflect on a continuingly challenging geopolitical context exacerbated by the war, hunger, economic disruption and, as so often happens at times of uncertainly, threats to democracy. It is only through the hard yards of collective thinking, compromise, innovation and persistence that we, as the European Union, can continue to chart a way through for our citizens and as part of a wider global community of values. I will have to leave the debate for a little while.

Ministers can no longer hold office and take decisions to support the people in the North. The DUP has cited concerns about the protocol, but in reality it is holding democracy to ransom. There is no justification for putting Stormont on ice while talks about the protocol continue. While the DUP refuses to allow politicians in the North to do their jobs, ordinary people pay the price as they are abandoned at the time of an unprecedented cost-of-living crisis. Ordinary workers and families are worried about paying their bills, keeping the lights on and weathering the cost of the cost-of-living crisis. They cannot afford to be held to ransom by the DUP refusing to re-enter the Executive to work on protecting hard-pressed people from rising prices. Across the North, people want to see their political leaders working together to tackle the big issues, such as investing in the health system and ensuring people can pay their energy bills, not political stunts and brinkmanship that grabs headlines but ultimately achieves nothing. The DUP must get back into the Executive without any more delay or posturing. It must accept the outcome of May’s election and get back to work. Issues around the protocol exist, but they can be resolved through dialogue, partnership and a genuine commitment to ensuring the needs of people in the North are met. This is a time for political leadership and a genuine commitment to delivering solutions, not empty stunts and inflammatory rhetoric. I believe our European partners are determined to resolve the issues around the protocol. I hope the Taoiseach impressed on the leaders at the European Council the importance of stable governance in the North and the need for the British Government to stop placating the DUP’s antics and to genuinely deliver for the people in the North. It is crucial now that the British Government engages in good faith with constructive negotiations with the European Union and that it abandons the reckless approach of the past. The protocol protects all-Ireland trade, the Good Friday Agreement, communities and business in the North from the damage caused by Brexit. Indeed, many businesses have spoken of the positive effects of the protocol, as it gives them the best of both worlds through access to the British and EU markets. Many businesses have experienced how the protocol continues to help in the creation of jobs and attracting investment. While it is not perfect, issues around the protocol can be resolved through good faith discussions. Indeed, in the current economic climate, the protocol must be built upon and protected rather than undermined. There is no credible alternative to the protocol, and those who attack it while providing no alternative are absolutely fooling no one. It is to be hoped the Taoiseach made it clear to our European colleagues at the European Council that support for the protocol in Ireland is clear, steadfast and crucial for protecting the North’s interests. I would also be interested to hear whether he made clear the need for the DUP to end its appalling boycott of the North’s democratic institutions and whether he secured support for the restoration of the political institutions in the North and the formation of an Executive that can make politics work for everyone in the North. I hope he secured commitments from European colleagues that they will continue to work on constructive solutions around the protocol and to insist the British Government and the DUP end their bad faith posturing and deliver solutions that genuinely meet the needs of the people in the North. I also welcome the Council’s ongoing support for the people of Ukraine amid their continuing struggle to bring an end to the brutal Russian invasion and partial occupation of their country. While reports of recent and ongoing Ukrainian military success, particularly in Kherson, lend themselves to the belief that the conflict is moving towards a scenario where we may well see a route emerging to a position where both sides may be able to engage in negotiations, I believe this remains some way off at the moment. However, every effort must be made to push for negotiations to bring the brutal invasion, the occupation and war to an end. Undoubtedly, there is growing pressure on Vladimir Putin as a result of the many military setbacks suffered by his forces since the Ukrainian counteroffensive began. Unfortunately, the failure of EU leaders to come to an agreement to address the impacts of the global energy crisis on the Continent lays bare the soft underbelly of the western strategy of support of Ukraine. Ukraine’s military successes have made Russia more reliant on and likely to engage in the hybrid flank of war effort, a major aspect of which is predicated on the Russian belief that the EU and the wider western world lacks the ability or will to sustain the ongoing economic, social and political impact of its support for Ukraine. The ability of the Russian leader to instrumentalise energy and food supplies along with the fate of refugees and their impact on the EU, not to mention the wider world, remains a major concern. In particular, the failure of the EU leaders to secure agreement at the European Council on the issue of price caps on energy supplies effectively undermines the Ukrainian war effort and offers succour to Putin in the longer term. On our own national situation, the slipshod ad hocery, so to speak, we have witnessed in the Government’s failure to put in place a tangible and workable plan to accommodate the well-advertised number of refugees who were expected from Ukraine into Ireland is a disgrace. The Government and its supporters want to talk up the supposed benefits of undermining Irish neutrality in terms of the military role Ireland could play in the conflict in Ukraine, yet it cannot accomplish its part in the key role asked of the EU by Ukraine, which is preventing Russia from using those Ukrainian citizens forced to flee in the face of Russian aggression as an instrument to undermine the political will of the EU to continue the scale of its support for Ukraine. Now that Russia has sanctioned 52 Irish politicians, will the Irish Government finally come to the realisation that we have to send a clear, strong message to the Russians and Putin by terminating the Russian ambassador’s existence here in this State and finally make the decision to expel Yuri Filatov from Ireland? While the EU is firmly focused on the external threat of Russia to EU democracy, it appears to be much less concerned at the ongoing threat to the values of democracy across the EU by the actions of individual member states in the use of spyware on EU citizens. That is according to the senior MEP charged with leading the inquiry into the use of Pegasus spyware. Sophie in ‘t Veld has accused the European Commission of ignoring the grave threat to democracy posed by the use of spyware by governments of EU member states and the failure of members to co-operate with her inquiry.The investigation has revealed that the phones of the French President, Emmanuel Macron, and the President of the European Council, Charles Michel, and other key officials, opposition figures and journalists across Europe were being monitored. The Commission remains silent on the threat. According to Ms in 't Veld, this has created a climate of lawlessness around the use of spyware on citizens within the EU. Is the Irish Government one of the EU governments that has refused to co-operate with the investigation into the use of Pegasus, the hacking software sold by the Israeli surveillance company NSO Group, and other equivalent software?

It remains critical that Russia is called out at every international forum, whether a meeting of the EU Council, the Inter-Parliamentary Union, which recently met in Kigali and brought together parliamentarians from every nation, or the G20. Russia must be isolated as the sole aggressor responsible for the untold hardship being endured by the people of Ukraine and by the entire world in terms of food shortages, fuel poverty and the massive inflation that is impacting citizens here and across the globe. The indiscriminate missile attacks on Ukraine's infrastructure, designed to bludgeon the Ukrainian people into submission, are quite unconscionable. They are pushing our Continent and the world closer to a full-scale war beyond the borders of Ukraine. What happened yesterday evening in Poland should send shock waves through all of us and every nation. A miscalculation, mistake or malfunction can easily set in train unimaginable consequences. That is the position we are in. The liberation of parts of Donetsk have revealed many more potential Russian war crimes and crimes against humanity. This is unprecedented in Europe, our Continent, since the end of the Second World War. I also want to mention the sanctioning of 52 Irish politicians that was announced yesterday. Our Taoiseach, most of the Cabinet, many of us on these benches and our speaker, our Ceann Comhairle, are not welcome in Russia. They are banned from Russia. How can we have an ambassador down the road who tells the elected representatives of the Irish people they are not welcome? What is the response to that? We must have a robust and clear response because that is an assault on our democratic right to function as the voice and parliament of the people of Ireland. One of the clear impacts of Russian aggression has been and remains the energy crisis. Irish citizens, like all others, are struggling to ensure their homes are heated and energy bills can be afforded in the coming months as the temperature plummets. While I welcome the actions of the Government to date in seeking to mitigate the increased cost of fuel and everything else and to support struggling households and businesses, more will have to be done. That is for another debate. It is important that a greatly accelerated plan of action on a pan-European level must be implemented to address security and affordability in the supply of energy and a speedy agreement on a windfall tax on those companies, those large corporate entities, who have seen huge profit increases on the basis of an international crisis. There are many issues demanding attention at European Council level. I give out on every occasion. These debates are intended to report back from European Council meetings and five-minute time limits for Members are ludicrously small. I will raise one issue of real importance. There are many other issues, as I said, demanding attention, and humanitarian catastrophes can slip down the agenda and not receive the focus they deserve. I raise the issue of Somalia, which today is experiencing yet another devastating humanitarian crisis. Millions of people are in danger of starvation and death. The Somali refugee crisis is one of the most significant mass displacements in the world. Drought in the Horn of Africa, the impact of climate change, has made a disastrous situation even worse. Its neighbouring countries, Kenya and Ethiopia, have endured an incredible change in climate that is causing food cost inflation that is disastrous. I ask the Minister of State to ensure these important issues are also kept in focus as millions of people struggle to exist.

It has delayed negotiations between the UK and the EU on the implementation of the Northern Ireland protocol. As a result, there has been no progress regarding efforts to put a functioning Executive in place in Stormont. Thankfully, it seems the appointment of Rishi Sunak as British Prime Minister has brought this instability to an end, a point put eloquently by Matt Hancock in the jungle on "I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out Of Here!" A change of British Prime Minister on this occasion has indeed been a genuine chance to reset the relationship between Dublin and London. That certainly seems to be the case. The attendance of the British Prime Minister at the recent meeting of the British-Irish Council was significant and sent out all the right signals as regards future relationships on these islands. Thankfully, the Northern Ireland Secretary of State, Chris Heaton-Harris MP, has listened to all parties and has extended the deadline for the calling of fresh elections to the Stormont Assembly. This effectively puts off a possible election until 13 April next at the latest. All sides now seem to be agreed that there should be a negotiated settlement to the protocol issue and that genuine concerns need to be addressed. The main issues now seem to be checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland and the role of the European Court of Justice. We must inject a new determination to resolve these problems, to compromise where it is needed and to get these technical negotiations finalised as soon as possible. I also draw attention to the dire situation unfolding in the Horn of Africa and, in particular, Somalia, Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Sudan and South Sudan. Those countries are already prone to ongoing conflict. The region is now experiencing a five-season drought caused by climate change, resulting in acute food insecurity and malnutrition, and the associated spread of diseases such as pneumonia, measles and cholera. The war in Ukraine is also taking its toll given that the global supply of grain and fertiliser has been curtailed, which is especially impacting the Horn of Africa. Some 90% of wheat supplies in the Horn of Africa come from Russia and Ukraine. Global increases in the commodity prices of food and energy are making things even worse. In excess of 36 million people are experiencing severe drought in southern Ethiopia, northern Kenya and Somalia. It is estimated this translates into severe food insecurity and malnutrition for more than 20 million people in the area. In southern Sudan, in excess of 8 million people are experiencing serious food insecurity. The risk of famine is acute. Millions are fleeing these areas in search of food and water, thus increasing ongoing conflicts even further. Many parts of the region experienced famine conditions in 2010 and 2011, at which time the global community said this could not be allowed to happen again.It is happening again and it appears to many that the world is turning a blind eye to the unfolding catastrophe. How should Ireland and the global community respond to this humanitarian disaster? For a start, Ireland must be to the forefront in highlighting this disaster both in the EU and at the UN, including at the UN Security Council. We should emphasise in particular the role played by climate change. In addition, humanitarian aid should be increased substantially by donor organisations in these countries. Our own overseas development aid, ODA, budget now totals €1.2 billion, the highest on record and we must also continue to increase our funding package for this region both to Irish NGOs and to international aid organisations. Last month Dóchas, Trócaire and Concern made a presentation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the situation in the Horn of Africa. Their reports from the region were shocking. These NGOs have since outlined a programme of action to tackle these problems, action for the short term and action for the longer term. I hope the Government can respond positively to this proposed action plan. The European Council continues to express strong solidarity with Ukraine. This week, Russia again bombarded several cities and power plants with missile strikes thus endangering the civilian population. Recent events in Kherson gave us all a little hope that Ukraine can successfully fight back. The retreat of Russian forces eastwards across the Dnipro river and the raising of the Ukrainian flag on government buildings in the previously annexed Kherson have given everybody a great morale boost. I hope that this setback will lead ordinary Russians to start to question the wisdom of the so-called special military exercise and Putin's regime generally. As winter arrives, Europe must continue to stand resolutely with Ukraine. An eighth round of sanctions has been agreed and these need to be rigorously enforced. Further effective sanctions should be considered as the need arises. I understand the establishment of a military assistance mission for Ukraine was further considered by EU defence ministers this week. Ireland is committed to participating in this mission. Our expertise in de-mining and on improvised explosive devices has been talked about. The Minister should keep the House fully informed of developments in this regard. Ireland has supported Ukraine in other ways. We have given €20 million in humanitarian aid, as well as a €66 million commitment for the European peace facility. We have also given a commitment of €3 million to the International Criminal Court, which is establishing a case that war crimes have been committed by Russia in Ukraine. As we know, last Friday the Supreme Court issued its judgment to the effect that the proposed method to ratify the Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement, CETA, between EU and Canada was unconstitutional. In short it ruled that CETA cannot be approved by the Dáil under Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution. The Joint Committee on European Union Affairs considered this agreement in detail. My view was that Ireland had nothing to fear from the investor court system. There seemed to be much scaremongering in this regard, including exaggerated claims concerning the so-called "chill effect". I also believe it would not be practicable to renegotiate this agreement, involving as it would the European Commission and Canada as well as all 27 EU member states in respect of their ratification procedures. Free trade is good for this country as a small open economy. The judgment indicates that a referendum on the agreement is not a legal requirement for ratification. In these circumstances I do not believe we should have one. It seems to me that a way forward is to change arbitration legislation in order that the High Court has powers to decline to give effect to decisions of the CETA tribunal where they are seen to compromise the constitutional identity of State or obligations to legislate for EU law.

It took a very nasty turn over the last 24 hours with an enormous bombardment across Ukraine of missiles. One of the missiles, whether it came from Russia or Ukraine, landed in Poland. We should be very seriously concerned about the advancement of Russia's war. I am also concerned that Irish politicians have been placed on this list and we need to deal with that. The Government will have the support of everyone in the House to do something firm over what Russia intends to do regarding parliamentarians from these Houses who clearly stand with democracy and who clearly have a voice to be heard in respect of that. The big issue with the war in Ukraine and all these developments is security across Europe, particularly food security and energy security. We need to have a co-ordinated effort across the European Union to deal with these issues. The previous speaker mentioned CETA. There is an element of international trade and elements which are blocking that and are causing issues in that regard. Of course, many people have concerns about CETA and particularly the impact the investment court may have. We also need to deal with that. Developments in the past few days on both these issues concern us all and should concern the Government greatly. We need to ensure that we provide a solution to it. Clearly, I think the solution that has been set out by the courts is that we need a referendum on CETA. That needs to happen as quickly as possible and Government needs to move to do that. The issues of food security and energy security in the European Union relate to an issue raised by another colleague here in regard to the Horn of Africa, namely, the impact that climate change is having on the entire world and our need to move away from fossil fuels including gas and to have alternatives. Each country in Europe cannot do that on its own; we have to work together to do that. We need co-ordinated efforts across the entire European Union not just to resolve the problems that we have with own addiction to fossil fuels, but to resolve the problems the entire world has with global warming. Some changes have happened in the recent months internationally. The election in Brazil gives many people hope that there might be a change in respect of that. The lungs of the Earth, the rainforests, are somewhat safer than they were some time ago. Many people also took great hope from the elections in the US that things may be moving in the correct direction. Within the European Union we have had a number of elections recently. Italy and Hungary seem to be going in the opposite direction. We need to be firm over where the world politics needs to go. We need to look after people rather than vested interests. We need to look after the needs of our communities across the entire globe rather than looking after the needs of corporate interests. For too long that has been the play. It has been about the big corporations and what they need delivered for them rather than what needs to be delivered for the people. Overall, the war in Europe and the situation with global warming are issues that need to be addressed in a co-ordinated fashion across the entire European Union.

Government Members have said that there is no legal requirement for a referendum. However, enough has happened in terms of public discussion and public discourse. There is probably an ethical and civic requirement. If this is to become law, perhaps there is a requirement for us to have that conversation and a referendum is certainly one way for us to do that. While there might not be a legal requirement, there is certainly a civic requirement. In a country, politicians have responsibility to convince the public. I would hold a very different view in believing there is an ethical and civic requirement for a referendum before we even attempt to ratify the parts of CETA including the investment courts. When the Deputy says that is nothing to worry about, I note that some parts of Romania, for example, are currently being sued by a corporation.Even Scotland was sued by the alcohol industry over a decade ago. There is definitely a civic requirement for a referendum and we in the Social Democrats are pushing and supporting that call.  In terms of my discussion around the post-European Council statement, I want to take a look at some of the Taoiseach’s comments. There is a confluence of crises happening that requires leadership and Ireland is in a unique position to provide strong moral leadership and to take a step out to the side. Hostilities are incredibly heightened at the minute and there is a responsibility on us and potentially on others to step outside the hostilities. While we condemn Russia's horrid invasion of Ukraine in the strongest terms, we saw last night how quickly tensions can rise. I note for example that Germany's defence ministry last night was very quick to suggest sending aircraft to patrol Polish air space because the assumption that there were Russian rockets. Indeed, they probably were Russian rockets but perhaps they came from Ukraine and went into Poland. We need to be extraordinarily careful. We need to step away from this jump to militarisation. There is a role for Ireland here. Our position as a country is that we have never invaded another and that, along with our role on the UN Security Council, means that we can be the people who step forward in the call for diplomatic solutions in the immediate term because the world is in a precarious place. Ireland must and will continue to support refugees and we must overcome the equity issues that arise in regards accommodation. It was announced yesterday for example in my own constituency of Dublin Central that it is likely that 600 Ukrainian refugees will be coming into Drumcondra and East Wall. In inner city Dublin and in Dublin Central as a whole, we have played a massive part in welcoming and in being enhanced by the people who have come to us from Ukraine. We also need supports to help the people who came as refugees. That support must come in the form of childcare places and extra provision for education. Everybody is playing the part in our collective effort. I have not seen the level of hostility that has been talked about elsewhere, but there are basic human needs for which we needs supports, in the areas of education, childcare places and in access to the jobs market. That can foster this continuing spirit of collective endeavour that we have seen. Energy bills have doubled in the EU capitals according to new data. The EU is in a deep crisis when it comes to energy this winter. That will further exacerbate the level of poverty that already existed in the European Union. I will make the point in all statements before and after every EU Council that poverty is the single greatest threat to the European Union. I believe at the moment one in five people in European Union are living in poverty. If people start to feel cold, both in real and philosophical terms, and if they do not feel the warmth of the EU, that will be a real threat. We have seen that with Brexit, where the communities that were left behind because of advancement were the same ones that went out and voted against being part of the European Union. If we are to have a place it needs to be to confront the everyday lived experiences of people within our borders.  I will briefly touch on COP27. The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said that loss and damage is the priority at COP27 and I endorse those that. It has to be. With that principle in mind, we have to focus on the Horn of Africa. This issue has already been touched on by speakers such as Deputy Haughey and others. The drought, famine and human tragedy that are unfolding in the Horn of Africa at present are unimaginable. We have to both play our part and stand forward and demonstrate as much leadership as possible because the tragedy that is happening there is unlike anything we have seen, certainly in my lifetime. We need to support the charities that are working on the ground and that are getting whatever resources into those communities so that they can access water and food. We are seeing child loss of life on a scale that is simply tragic. Though so many other issues are currently happening, I can think of no greater role that we can play than to be people who are standing up for those who are in need in the Horn of Africa and I hope that we can do that.  I wanted to touch on Italy’s recent elections and rule of order principles, but I can talk about that next time.

I will begin by adding my voice to those of other Members across the House, such as Deputies Howlin, Gannon and Haughey, who made strong statements about the dire situation in the Horn of Africa. We are beholden as a Parliament, a democracy and as a developed country to do everything we can that is within our power. I think the Minister of State will agree and I think the Taoiseach agrees also. I commend Deputy Howlin on his strong speech with regard to the news today that Russia has essentially made 52 Members of the Oireachtas personae non grata. I do not know who these 52 are, but it is outrageous that another state would treat a sovereign nation such as Ireland in this way. I want to add my voice to Deputy Howlin’s condemnation.  The Taoiseach in his statement mentioned COP27 and I raised it with in during Questions on Policy or Legislation yesterday. He showed leadership on the international stage in showing how we must deal with climate change. He said we do not have a minute to lose and I absolutely agree with him, as I think Members across this House also do. The Government has shown leadership at home and the Oireachtas has generally shown leadership at home. I chair the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Climate Action and as best we can we have sought to achieve a consensus approach to what is necessary. This Oireachtas can be proud that we agreed quite overwhelmingly to bring in the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021. Nobody said it was going to be easy and we have set ourselves an incredibly difficult target of reducing emissions by 51%, based on a 2018 baseline, by 2030. We are finding now as we move into the review of the climate action plan in the next few weeks just how hard it is. If you look at the numbers across every sector, such as agriculture, energy, transport or any other sector, the numbers do not lie, and they make it difficult.  We are in a situation where we have set ourselves ambitious targets but are in danger of getting caught up in the rhetoric and perhaps patting ourselves on the back for setting such ambitious targets. What matters is achieving them. When the climate action plan comes out in a few weeks’ time, it will show a refined path towards 2030, but there will be a lot in there that will be quite difficult. All Members of this House have experience in their communities of where climate action is difficult because if you take a simple example of how we use our road space, we will have to reallocate a lot of our road space away from private vehicles to modes that can carry more people and that can do it in a more sustainable ways, such as buses, cycle lanes and wider footpaths. Any time you try to do this in any community in this country there is uproar because you are saying to the community that what they know and understand will change and that it has to change. I fear that we are not doing a good job as an Oireachtas in communicating why we need climate action at the local level. We have put ourselves in a position where any of these issues in any town, village or city in Ireland can be used as a wedge issue and can be exploited. Ultimately, if that is the approach we take, we will not achieve the emissions cuts that we need to achieve. It beholds all Members of this House, as well as the Upper House, to figure out how we can do the community engagement to achieve climate action at the local level because it is not easy.  During the week, an important climate project was announced in my neck of the woods and it is linked to the broader European agenda. Members will know about the trans-european transport network, TEN-T, across Europe. In Limerick, the Minister announced just this week that we are going to reopen the Limerick to Foynes railway line. This is an historic step in Irish transport. The Acting Chair knows haulage better than perhaps anyone in the House and I would be interested in chatting with her about this. Much of the haulage that is currently on our roads can be put on rail and carried more sustainably. Dublin Port is fairly choked with traffic. Just as there is for Rosslare, Cork and Waterford ports, there is an opportunity for Shannon Foynes Port to develop as a cargo port. This rail project will, in time, be seen as a significant shift in how we do haulage.

I send my solidarity to the ordinary citizens of Iran, especially the women who are putting themselves at risk in challenging appalling human rights abuses. There needs to be a stronger response from the EU, not just on this issue, but on Iran's continuing support for Russia in the latter's brutal assault on Ukraine. The EU needs to go further to get the parties to that war around the table. There needs to be an agreed solution and that starts with a conversation. The EU must use its influence to make this happen. We saw last night how matters could escalate. Warmongering needs to stop. I implore the Minister of State to put equal effort into seeking peace. The ongoing war has affected energy security and energy prices. The recent meeting proposed several solutions, which must be progressed immediately. We need a windfall tax on excess energy prices, we need voluntary joint purchases of gas and we need to address the decoupling of gas and electricity markets. The market approach is not working. It is feathering the nests of multinational energy companies at the expense of ordinary workers and families, in particular older people. Small businesses are dying on their feet and need a lifeline now.

I also welcome the Council's intention to explore how the assets legally seized from Russian entities that may have sought to profit from the imperial actions of their President can be used to support Ukraine's reconstruction. I wish to discuss the issues of energy and the economy, in particular conclusion 18(d), in which reference is made to calling on the Commission to submit concrete decisions urgently on a temporary EU framework to cap the price of gas and electricity generation. I note that mention is made of doing this while preventing gas consumption increasing. I understand why this was mentioned and its importance, but how long is it likely to take the Commission to make such a submission? Has the Commission contacted the Council regarding the progress made to date? I wish to ask about the progress being made by the Government in putting into action the regulation agreed at European level on a windfall tax. The need for urgency in this regard cannot be overemphasised, but the Government seems to be taking its time in implementing the regulation. I must express my extreme dissatisfaction with the Minister's seemingly relaxed attitude to this, all while households and businesses are struggling. What is the delay in implementing this regulation-----

He stated:If this generation doesn't step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us.As leaders, it is our responsibility to drive the transformation necessaryIn Ireland, the government has set legally binding emission reduction targets of 51% by 2030, and has committed Ireland to becoming climate-neutral by 2050.The only problem is, he did not mean a word of it. He did not mention the fact that we were going to miss all of those targets and that, instead of reducing, emissions in agriculture, electricity and transport were actually increasing this year. He did not mention the €30,000 per month agreed in the budget for data centres, which are now responsible for using more electricity than all of the rural homes in Ireland combined. He did not mention the continued commitment to the industrialised model of agriculture, which is our No. 1 emitter of carbon, and the refusal to move away from it. He did not mean a word of this. He is a gross hypocrite. The problem for the whole world is that he is not the only one. All of the world's leaders are in it together. It is why they can come together, say they are going to save the 1.5 oC target, agree a set of targets nationally that amount to an increase in temperature of 2.7 oC, and actually be on track for an increase of something like 3.5 oC. Those who are suffering the most are the people suffering from floods in Pakistan and from drought in China and the hundreds of thousands of people who are likely facing death in the Horn of Africa as a result of famine caused by climate change. Words are fine but, as the UN Secretary-General said, politicians and big business are saying one thing but doing another. He said: "Simply put, they are lying." The reason they are lying is because they are wedded to an ecocidal capitalist system that is based around the profits of the big fossil fuel corporations globally and, in this country, the profits of big agribusiness. That is why we have to overthrow this system and we need eco-socialist change. I wish to raise a point about loss and damage. Last year, the EU, with the backing of the Irish Government, betrayed billions of people in the global south by refusing to back a loss and damage fund at COP26. It was devastating for all of those who had been campaigning for many years. It was the defining failure of COP26. Rich countries are responsible for 90% of the emissions that are causing climate breakdown, but the most serious effects hit those in the global south. A loss and damage fund is a crucial issue at COP27. Can we get a clear commitment that the Government will not repeat last year's betrayal and will give its unequivocal backing for the establishment of a loss and damage fund at COP27? I wish to address the energy charter treaty. In recent days, we have been treated to all sorts of nonsense by the Taoiseach, who has told us how investor court systems are a normal part of trade and so on. Ireland is only part of one investor court system at the moment, that being the energy charter treaty's. It is a rotten treaty designed to protect energy companies' investments and profits, which in practice means protecting the interests of fossil fuel companies. Through it, we are signed up to an investor-state dispute settlement system, the only one unless we ratify the CETA investor courts. Oil, gas and coal firms have already been awarded more than €100 billion under the energy charter treaty. To quote The Guardian, "As countries have sought to curb their emissions in line with the Paris climate agreement after 2015, the number of claims being brought has exploded." For this reason, many European states are leaving the energy charter treaty or have announced that they will. Italy has withdrawn and other major EU states, including Germany, France, Spain, Poland, Slovenia and the Netherlands, have announced their intention to withdraw from this unjust and environmentally criminal treaty. Will the Irish State be withdrawing from this anti-environment, anti-worker and pro-fossil fuel company treaty?

COP26 failed to agree a facility on loss and damage. It is the central issue of COP27, which is taking place in Africa geographically approximate to the terrible catastrophe playing out in the Horn of Africa. News has just broke that the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has been appointed the EU's lead negotiator on loss and damage, which is the central and most contentious issue of COP27. That is a tribute to the Minister.More importantly, it speaks to the quality of the Irish negotiators and diplomatic staff who are out there attending. It shows the importance of having people attend this conference. The previous meeting of the European Council happened in the shadow of the climate conference in Sharm El-Sheikh. It is next to impossible to talk about one thing without speaking about the other. I very much welcome that the Taoiseach spoke about his participation in and contribution to COP27. I agree with Deputy Paul Murphy that it was a very fine speech. I also agree with the Deputy that we must live up to those words if they are to have any meaning at all. I have seen criticism in some quarters about participation in structures such as COP. I have been critical of the mechanisms of the international structures of COP, the UN and the EU in the context of how unwieldy they are and the internal politics involved, including those relating to vested interests and bad faith actors. There is a lot of truth in those criticisms. I can kind of understand how some people would say "Okay, should we walk away from these types of structures? Should we take a step back from international action and multilateralism?" I am reminded of an address given by President Higgins in October 2019, when he said:There is a moral basis to those who are protesting to those who would like a communitarian new beginning, but I believe that to walk away from the State would be a tragic error [...] Obviously, of course, to rely entirely on advocacy directed at the State, and to neglect the possibilities and promise of alternatives within civil society would be a disastrous choice too.Neither of those approaches is necessary. In fact, we need action at all effective levels, be it the multilateral structure of COP, at a national level or in our communities, and we must be able to relate that down into how we live our own lives. That does not mean for a moment that we should ignore the imperative to radically reform some of our international structures. I would make the argument that a flawed process is better than no process at all. As I said, we see in the appointment of the Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications and by us participating in this process that hopefully we will get a positive outcome for what I believe is the defining issue of this COP. The Taoiseach mentioned the food security crisis and, in particular, the unfolding catastrophe in the Horn of Africa. For the remainder of my contribution, I will dwell on the issue of food. As the Taoiseach noted, we are seeing hunger and energy being used as twin weapons in the context of the illegal war being waged in Ukraine. We have seen the reverberations of the shutdown of exports, in particular of wheat exports, from Ukraine and the impact this has on world commodity prices. As ever, and as it always was, it is the most vulnerable who suffer the most in these situations. I am aware that good work is happening at EU Council level around solidarity lanes, which were previously discussed, and good work has also been done in respect of supporting and improving export corridors. That work must continue. I will address specifically the findings of a recent UN report on the opportunities for repurposing agricultural support to transform food systems. The report found that emissions-intensive and unhealthy commodities receive the most subsidy in the context of supports given and agricultural supports. The report found that it applies to products like sugar, which I suppose is no longer pertinent here in Ireland. As the Acting Chair, Deputy Verona Murphy, will be aware, it was very much an industry across Wexford, Waterford, and Carlow. Beef and milk get the greatest share of worldwide support despite the potentially negative impacts, not just on climate but also on health. The negative repercussions on climate are particularly relevant for high and upper-middle income countries that consume the most meat and dairy per capita. In the least developed countries, there is the opposite effect where cereals, including wheat, rice, and so on, are subsidised. This has negative impacts for biodiversity, climate adaptation, on-farm diversity and growth. It also has a knock-on consequence with regard to the nutritional value in people's food. Looking at that report, we cannot ignore the messages this has for our agricultural system here. As has been stated, we cannot promise the earth, moon and stars, on the one hand and perpetuate a myth that we are feeding the world, on the other. We must be honest about that: we are feeding the developed world dairy and meat. That is the truth of it. In that vein, but tangential, I acknowledge the work of organisations such as Community Gardens Ireland and GIY that encourage people to grow their own food. Indeed, Community Gardens Ireland, along with Social Farms and Gardens in Northern Ireland, has called today for people growing their own food to be recognised as a climate adaptation action. There are significant carbon savings for every kilo of our own food that we grow. It might be easy to cast down on that and to ignore the impact of that action. Even the IPCC has acknowledged that urban agriculture initiatives can assist with reducing greenhouse gases, improve urban food security, improve biodiversity and have positive impacts in the context of adapting to climate change. If it seems like a drop in the ocean and something that can be easily belittled, we must remember that the ocean is made up of drops. There must be something not just in our multilateral action and not just our national level action, but also at that community and individual level. Even if somebody growing the few spuds in the back garden is not the solution to climate change, sometimes the scale of the problem that faces us paralyses us. We must remember that sometimes the best antidote to despair is action, be they small actions in a person's own life. Small actions can add up. We in the Green Party have always encouraged people to think globally and act locally, and this is one such way of doing so. Of course, all of these things must be rolled in together. We do need a combination of multilateralism, national ambition, community development and individual action if we are to have any hope at all of facing up to the existential crisis that we all accept we now face.

I am fairly sure that nobody was preparing to travel to the Russian Federation. This is an affront to our democracy and to our place in the world. We need to ask Ambassador Yuri Filatov to make his journey home. If the Government will not agree to that, then we definitely need some sort of action to be taken in respect of this matter. One could quite easily say that Russia has one hell of a nerve, given what it is engaged in doing. We have had the utterly criminal invasion of Ukraine. There has been an escalation in attacks on civilians and civilian infrastructure. Our hearts go out to those two men who lost their lives in Poland 10 km from the border with Ukraine. Unfortunately, civilians will always face severe penalties in war situations. When an opportunity arises, we have to play our part, as many others do, in ensuring that we can actually get Ukraine to a more peaceful and hopefully a more prosperous future. I agree with what others have said. In the context of Trump, Brexit and Marine Le Pen, a mistake has been made and there is a major issue in the sense that people have been left to the side and have felt peripheral. If we are talking about the energy crisis and the other crises we are dealing with, we need Europe and we need domestic governments to deal with the issues that impact on our people.

This is a massive problem that is placing a major strain on services. Those addicted to crack cocaine behave differently and require different treatment from those who are addicted to heroin. We desperately need a concerted effort across Europe to find a synthetic and safe substitute to crack cocaine, similar to methadone, in order to try to give people a chance at stabilisation and starting their road to recovery. Given that Ireland is a small State, but one with a loud voice, we might not have the physical capacity to develop these treatments but we should advocate at every available opportunity for the European Union to develop a plan to tackle this crisis we are facing.This will not just reduce harm, it will save lives. We are willing to work with the Government and our European partners on this because crack cocaine is becoming a major issue across Europe.

I will start on the pack of cards and the Russian announcement in the past couple of hours of the sanctioning of and declaring as personae non gratae 52 Irish politicians. I am not sure if the Minister of State made the cut. If he did, congratulations; if not, commiserations. I am not sure if I made it. If not, I should probably try harder. There can be no greater accolade for an Irish politician than to be on that list. It shows we are getting under the Kremlin's skin, doing what we are supposed to be doing and pushing back on Russia's behaviour in Ukraine. Joking aside, it raises a serious question in relation to Ireland. Will we ignore it? It is fairly pathetic. Alternatively, will we respond? If we choose to respond in our own good time, the Russian Embassy in Dublin should be firmly in the cross hairs. I am not saying we should shut it down completely, but we have four Irish diplomats in the Irish Embassy in Moscow. I see no reason why there should be more than four Russian diplomats in the embassy in Dublin. There are about 30 at the moment, and they are not all typists and gardeners. Nobody has any difficulty with genuine diplomats doing diplomatic work but we have a difficulty with people masquerading as diplomats and doing nefarious work in this jurisdiction. If we are to respond, we should set our sights firmly on the Russian Embassy. I offer my sympathy and condolences to the Polish ambassador and to the families of the two Polish people who tragically lost their lives yesterday. The preliminary supports suggest that what happened was caused by a Ukraine surface-to-air missile which was fired in good faith to intercept an incoming cruise missile but which malfunctioned and landed in Poland. Regardless of the cause, it does not make things easier for the families, but it emphasises the risk of escalation and the fact that there is no guarantee we can contain this conflict. The blame again must be laid squarely at the doorstep of the Kremlin. The missile was fired in self-defence . The war could stop tomorrow if the Russian regime calls a ceasefire and withdraws its troops. I welcome the continued military, diplomatic, financial, economic and political support on the part of the European Union for Ukraine, in particular the additional €30 million Ireland is providing, consisting of €25 million for Ukraine and €5 million for Moldova. It is good to see Moldova getting support from us as well. I welcome the commencement of the Irish military training mission there. It is based on Germany and Poland, focusing on mine clearance and improvised explosive device, IED, demolition. There is another component we might want to consider. There is considerable corporate knowledge here of war crimes investigation. Many people in Ireland have worked directly and indirectly for The Hague and have a skill set that could be involved in that training mission. If we are looking to add an extra string to the bow, that is something we should consider. The Taoiseach mentioned energy and stated that gas reserves in the EU are at about 90%. That is a good and positive story. The mild weather in the past month or so has probably helped. I know it is outside the Minister of State's remit, but Ireland has no gas reserves. We have plenty of oil reserves because about 25 years ago the European Union decreed that we should have 90 days' supply. Oil is fine. We have reserves on this island and in Denmark and Spain, but we have no gas reserves. It is a key vulnerability so we need to develop that capacity urgently, or certainly as soon as possible. I appreciate the update regarding the EU Council meeting. I look forward to the next meeting on 15 December.

The focus of the contribution in the pre-European Council debate was largely on the energy impacts of Russia's brutal war in Ukraine. That continues to have a tangible impact on our country, notwithstanding the desperate measures taken by the Russian regime this morning to sanction 52 Members of these Houses. Energy prices, accommodating so many welcome refugees in the State and the general global insecurity are impacting on us greatly. Much has been done in respect of the desire to impose a windfall tax on energy companies. We all agree that doing this collectively at European Union level will have the most impact but it is becoming increasingly urgent because this windfall tax needs to be given back to ease the burden, the energy difficulties and the cost-of-living crisis in heating a home or keeping the lights on in a business. Those crises are being driven by a vicious and oppressive war in Ukraine by a terror state. I ask that it continue to be a top priority for Ireland when discussing energy at European Union level to get this windfall tax or measure introduced. In respect of the war in Ukraine, it is clear that the European Union and Ireland, as part thereof, are on the right side of history and of this conflict. I welcome the decision taken by the European Union to commit 15,000 personnel to training missions for the Ukrainian military and the reports that Ireland has signed up to it. There are limitations on what we can do due to our opaque policy of military neutrality. My opinions on that are well known - and I will set them aside - but the notion of contributing small numbers of members of the Defence Forces to missions like teaching Ukrainians to clear land mines and IEDs is a righteous one that should have the support of all Members of the House. We need only look at our history or the history of conflicts around the world to see the impact these crude IEDs have had on so many lives, whether in Iraq, Afghanistan or parts of sub-Saharan Africa. The notion we can play a part in helping one Ukrainian child or civilian be safer is a good one. I hope members of our Defence Forces contribute and that it is not just a couple of individuals but all those capable of delivering the training and in a position to go. Clearing land mines and IEDs is something in which we have a particular skill set. We have the most modern equipment for it and have invested in this area of our Defence Forces' capabilities. I strongly support any Irish involvement in this new EU measure above and beyond what has been rumoured in the press. I ask the Minister of State to take away that the Irish people want the Government and Defence Forces to do as much as possible.

This regulation places a cap on market revenues for non-gas technologies in the electricity sector and introduces a temporary solidarity contribution based on taxable profits for fossil fuels production and oil refining, as well as reduction targets of 10% of overall electricity consumption and 5% of consumption during peak hours. I am pleased that we will implement this regulation, but will the Minister of State outline, for households and businesses heavily affected by soaring energy prices, where the proceeds will go? The public needs to know. The number of phone calls I have received from business owners in recent days has been worrying. There is concern about energy costs and whether they will be able to keep their businesses going. That is a major factor across the board.Would the Government consider a communication or information campaign on this? One butcher rang me to say he has six huge fridges, and while he is trying to do his best - I know the Minister of State is aware of this - if things keep going on like this, he does not know if he can sustain it. I would also ask the Minister of State to address the issue of accommodation for our Ukrainian refugees. This is another huge issue for me. This is also something I have received several phone calls about. There seems to be something failing in the system. I know we were not expecting this and the system was not either. However, two property owners in Carlow and Tullow have come to me who can accommodate 60 refugees, and despite my intervention and going to all the areas to see where I can help, I have still received no word. That is going on months. I am concerned that morale will go if we are not seen to be working with people who own properties. It is the same with people who have houses and are looking to accommodate families. There seems to be a lack of communication. How do we address it better?  I welcome that local authorities now have directors of services for Ukrainians, but they do not work within the accommodation sector and that is a big flaw. While we have those directors of services, I would ask that we also work with the local authorities, particularly on local knowledge. The Minister of State will know himself that there is nothing as good as knowing local businesses, property owners or people with housing who know they can accommodate these people, so I ask him to look at this. I know, as others have said, that the Government is committed to this but these are issues that keep coming up for me in Carlow and Kilkenny and I would ask that the Minister of State would address these.

As usual, the Taoiseach does not wait around for us to make our views known. The Minister of State, Deputy Byrne is here and I have no issue with that, but I repeat what I have said before: they are both completely gobsmacked by the EU. They are serving the global masters instead of serving the people who elected them. In the Minister of State's case it is the people of Meath East. The people will have their say when the next election comes. The Taoiseach will probably head off to Europe and leave the Minister of State behind. One good thing to come out before COP – I said it is cop-on we should have, not COP – was the 2022/1854 directive. It is in place more a month, yet we still have not put manners on the ESB and other companies that buy on the market to ensure wind energy is not charged the same as fossil fuels. The genie is out of the bottle. You cannot be codding the people. The Government must do something meaningful to look after our people. Look at all the businesses that Deputy Murnane O’Connor mentioned. We all have those businesses and those sad stories. There is a fundamentally flawed policy of being wedded to the EU no matter what it does. I for one do not support the same thing as Deputy Richmond and others that we would train Ukrainians and others to clear landmines. Our Army is a peacekeeper and has been recognised all over the world. We already gave the Ukrainians €10 million for uniforms and for hats. Are we neutral or are we not? We know the Taoiseach does not respect neutrality and he thinks it is out of date and out of fashion. He wants to be one of the global leaders. We are a dot here. When Europe tries to help us with something, other countries take it up but we are last to implement it because we must serve the global masters. We must serve the big oil companies and the big international companies, all the REITs and housing companies and all the international data centres. It is time Fianna Fáil went back to its roots where it was founded and have some understanding of and empathy for the people and serve them. We can play our part as a proud nation of the world with the United Nations and not be a lackey for the European leaders and for globalists. It is shameful. The Minister of State can look at his book or whatever he is looking at. He will not look me in the face here because he cannot look me in the face because he knows it is true what I am saying. It is shameful. It is wrong. It is despicable. We gave €10 million towards the damage and liability fund. We are being made to pay up for everything while we see Germany and other places stripping out coalmines at the moment. The ESB told us last week it imported 250,000 tonnes of coal in one shipload but the ordinary people cannot burn a sod of turf. The people are sick, sore, sorry and tired of the Government’s semantics and of its globalism and lack of representation.

The motion was to decouple the prices of electricity and gas so that we could get wind and solar energy and fossil fuel energy on two different footings. Everyone in this country can see from their bill that they have, say, 64% renewables. What they did not know until we simplified it today for them was that the 64% renewables on their bill is being charged at the gas price rate, that is, the highest rate. Whether a company is providing its electricity from gas, coal, briquettes peat, oil, wind or solar, customers are being charged at the highest rate by whoever produces the power. The Rural Independent Group brought this forward. Some 12 months ago we raised the crisis in fossil fuels and businesses going to the wall over transport. Again the Government has done nothing about that. It has been shown now that many of the Government backbenchers and Deputies do not even know what they vote for until we simplify it for them. They are told what to do by the Government. Many of our backbenchers make decisions against their own counties which they represent by not knowing what they vote for. That is what they have done. Today, the 2022/1854 directive showed again that they have to listen to the Rural Independent Group which brought forward this motion that was unopposed by the Government. This is to let them know we know more than they do because we are on the ground with the people. The Government is responsible for every business in this country, including SMEs foreclosing. The Government will be responsible. Its members are the ones who will be remembered.

This was the seventh time since Russia began the war that EU leaders discussed the situation in Ukraine, which gives a clear indicator of the importance of this topic and the effect this war has had on all of Europe. However, I fear that due to the constant focus on Russia, the EU is failing to address other issues adequately. For example, I note that at the Council meeting, EU leaders reiterated that Russia bears the sole responsibility for the current energy and economic crisis. This is simply not true. Energy prices were increasing significantly before any Russian invasion. The Government knows that too. There is no doubt the war in Ukraine has exacerbated and added to the difficulties but it is not the sole cause. Prices and everything else have increased significantly because of that. We know and I believe this energy and cost-of-living crisis is largely the fault of corporate profits. Big oil and energy companies have doubled and tripled their profits this year, making eye-watering money. The more we point the finger at Russia, the more corporate greed is being allowed and facilitated. We need to be honest about where this energy crisis is coming from and what exactly it is we have to do to address it. Again, this meeting raised concerns for me regarding Ireland’s neutrality. We need to ensure our neutrality is not being compromised when discussions such as these take place. The Taoiseach's contribution to the debate showed that our neutrality in his eyes is long compromised and long gone by the looks of it.He stated, "Wherever it turns out the missile concerned originated, Russia is wholly responsible for the consequences of an illegal war that it launched and is continuing to prosecute against Ukraine." Russia is responsible for the war but since we do not know what happened in the incident, we should be very careful about laying blame. Something could happen that we will regret. The Taoiseach also stated:The European Council also discussed how to ensure the security of critical infrastructure. Since the start of the war, we have seen an increase in the use of hybrid attacks, including deliberate acts of sabotage such as those against the Nord Stream pipelines.As far as I know, we do not know for definite who carried out the attack on the Nord Stream pipelines. It has been presented that it was Russia but that does not seem to make any sense. Comments have been made to the effect that it could have been Americans carrying out dirty tricks. We do not actually know. We have to be very careful about what we say about this so we will not inflame things more than necessary. We are putting in jeopardy our own neutrality, which is very serious. We must remember that standing with Ukraine and continuing to maintain our neutrality are not mutually exclusive. We can do both. We can maintain what has been a very honourable role for Ireland in global affairs. We have a role that can be regarded as significant and important. In the European Union, Ireland may be the only neutral country at this stage. Maybe Austria is neutral also. Sweden and Finland have rushed to join NATO in recent months. I do not see how that will protect them in the long run. NATO, whether we or the EU wants to admit it or not, did a lot to foster and drive this war. There is no excuse for Russia invading Ukraine-----

It has been pushing and pushing and using Ukraine as a proxy in its own conflict with Russia. That is what has been happening across the board. We have to be very careful and maintain our neutrality. Our neutrality gives us a unique and much-needed voice for peace in Europe and throughout the rest of the world. We should be using that and be proud to do so. I note that the Council mentioned the EU military assistance mission, the first common security and defence policy mission to be conducted on EU soil. It noted that the cost of the EU military assistance programme for Ukraine since the start of the war was €3.1 million. Ireland's membership of any military alliance and contribution to any type of military mission would undermine its reputation as a neutral State, and we must remember this.

It is very clearly an attempt to silence critics who have rightly decided to stand with Ukraine against the brutal occupation and invasion seven months ago. I reiterate my call, a call made by Members of this House and others over the past seven months, to move finally to expel the propagandist in situ in this city, Mr. Yuriy Filatov, who represents the brutal occupying force of Russia. The attack on the democratic Houses here and democracy itself by sanctioning 52 Members has to be met with a very strong message from the Government. What actions will the Government finally take? Will it finally take the decision to expel the mouthpiece for the brutal invasion force of Russia, Putin's spokesman in Ireland? Will the Irish Government finally move to expel Mr. Filatov?

I am absolutely convinced that Russia, in this particular manoeuvre, whatever it is, will try to do the same. It will try to divide us. It tried to do it with the fishers and tried to do it many other times over recent years. There were certainly people supporting it in that endeavour over recent years. All we know is what is in the media reports and what the Russian Foreign Ministry has published on its website. We know no more than that. We do not have a list of names. Some Ministers in the Government were listed on a press release but many others were not. We are certainly not going to overreact to this. I have no idea what the sanctions entail but am quite certain that nobody on the list, certainly those in the political world, has any assets in Russia, any bank accounts there or any reason to visit it any time soon. We would all love to visit Russia if it were to become a democratic state and if it were brought back into the normal democratic system of the world. That is not likely anytime soon. Therefore, we are not going to react to something on which, as yet, we have no information. We certainly believe we have taken a united approach to the Russian Federation and the brutal assault on Ukraine. All our democratic focus in this House should be on Russia, which is 100% responsible for what has happened. If there is anything to react to, I have no doubt the Government will make decisions, but at the moment it simply does not have the information to hand. I suspect we will have very little to do as a result of this decision by the Russian Federation.

First, I want to revisit the question just posed. I find the Minister of State's response entirely unacceptable. I refer to the notion of not overreacting. There has never, from my recollection, been a situation where the Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann was sanctioned and told he was not allowed to visit a country with which we have diplomatic relations. Where 50 Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas, including members of the Government, including the Taoiseach and Tánaiste, are told without precedent that they are personae non gratae in a country with which we have diplomatic relations, it is hardly an overreaction to do something stronger than simply say Putin is trying to divide us. Putin is a bully and, like all bullies, needs to be stood up to. I ask the Minister of State to reflect again on what action the Government will take if what has been described proves to be the case. My second question is on the issue of the Horn of Africa. I am deeply concerned that because of the focus on Ukraine, an increasing number of countries are retrenching their bilateral supports to developing countries in general, but those in Africa in particular. This happened in a now-non-EU country, the UK, when its Department for International Development was subsumed under the department responsible for foreign affairs. I understand it is now happening in Sweden. There is much more focus on migration in Europe and Ukraine, and areas like the Horn of Africa are being taken out of focus. In his discussions with his EU colleagues in particular, will the Minister of State ensure there is a focus on catastrophic events in the Horn of Africa?

There may well be actions taking place in the Department of Foreign Affairs at the moment. I believe this became public sometime after 1 o'clock today, so it is breaking news. The idea that I would come in here with a formulated response to something that has appeared on a website in the past couple of hours would not be correct. Our entire focus is on helping Ukraine. We can stand here and say how terrible this statement is but all the while missiles will be dumped on Ukraine, affecting its people.We must keep our focus on that, which is what we have been doing. I will come to the other issue, but the manner in which the Russian Federation has done this contrasts completely with what the EU has done, which has been to be entirely open about how we issue sanctions, namely, people passing laws-----

Several Deputies rightly raised the situation in the Horn of Africa. This is extremely serious. The Horn of Africa is experiencing its most severe drought in more than 40 years, which has led to high levels of acute food insecurity and malnutrition. As Deputies have said, 36 million people are affected. The number has increased from approximately 19 million that were affected in July. The numbers are staggering and shocking. It is right that Deputies have raised this. It is also right that the Government is providing support and is actively involved in the region. By the end of this year, Ireland will have provided more than €100 million to our humanitarian and development partners in the region. We remain fully committed in that regard. We are providing lifesaving humanitarian aid and longer term development programmes to address food insecurity. Communities in the region are also supported through multilateral humanitarian action, including the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund. Ireland has already given €11.5 million to this fund.

Was that with the imprimatur of the Government? The ships were from Canada and Great Britain, among other places. Why are they there and why are they being minded by a large number of gardaí? When anybody approaches them peacefully, not to damage a warship, by walking up to it and asking questions, armed and unarmed gardaí arrive. The other question I would like the Minister of State to respond to is on whose authority the Taoiseach decided we are not a neutral country anymore. He stated a number of times that our neutrality is outdated and we can see that by his actions. On whose authority is he acting? We had no debate on that in this House. We had no plebiscite or referendum on the matter. As a buachaill óg, I always understood that our neutrality was sacrosanct. I was in the same party as the Minister of State. Has this all changed with the Taoiseach, Deputy Micheál Martin, in his quest to become a European Commissioner or whatever else in Europe? On whose authority can he sign up to funds for various causes, be it for uniforms, hats or training in minesweeping? We have not had a debate on the issue. The Taoiseach has not been authorised to do anything in that regard by this Parliament, certainly as far as I am aware. I am on the Business Committee and no debates have been put forward in that regard either. I would like a response to those questions. On whose authority is the Taoiseach acting? He has delayed the handover now for two more days. We must sit on 17 December, despite what staff and everybody else might have to put up with almost in Christmas week, so that he can attend another global summit. He is intending to go out in a blaze of glory as a globalist.

Warships visiting ports is not a matter for the European Council, so I have no information on that. I suggest that the Deputy ask a parliamentary question of the relevant Department or inquiries could be made to the Port of Cork or Cork City Council. I suppose they would have the answer. I do not have the answer, as I am here to discuss the European Council, and it was not raised at the European Council. Regarding neutrality, the Taoiseach has made it very clear our neutrality is characterised by non-membership of military alliances. He has also said there are no plans to join any military alliance. When one country gets effectively beaten up, with many of its citizens killed by another country, there are very basic principles of international law that have been broken. Those basic principles come from the United Nations system, an international system, which the Deputy knows a previous Minister for Foreign Affairs and member of Fianna Fáil, Frank Aiken, played a massive role in putting together over many years. That is the system we uphold, one we must uphold if we want to be a democratic state bound by the rule of law and if we want to insist that others maintain those principles. My party - Deputy Mattie McGrath's former party - has a very proud tradition in the United Nations system. The UN General Assembly, on many occasions, has condemned Russia's actions because they breach the basic principles of the United Nations to which we have all signed up. It is a very simple proposition for us on this side of the House. There is no issue with it whatsoever. There is no suggestion we are joining NATO, that we are taking part in any common defence, or that we are providing weapons to Ukraine. What we have done in the temporary protection directive is contribute to non-lethal military equipment. Austria, which is also a neutral country, has done the same. We have been proud to do that. The equipment is very important and has been very gratefully received by the Ukrainians.

I refer to the toolbox we were given. I will give just one example. When the fuel crisis came, we asked the Government to help the SMEs, road hauliers and others involved in transport around the country. It introduced a fund that would only benefit those with a road haulage licence, which took out 65% of the trucks and vans in this country. The Government only supplemented one side of the equation. It did not provide a supplement for everybody. Prior to the energy crisis in this country, Newcastlewest had four butchers and now it has only one because of the costs. I go from town to town and village to village where we have SMEs that are relying on energy and the Government has not reacted because it does not seem to understand the consequences of all these small businesses closing down. We can see from our electricity bills that 64% of electricity comes from renewables and that we are being charged a high rate for gas. Why can the Government not react fast enough? It brought the VAT down to 9%. It gave people €600, inclusive of VAT, which brings it down to €550. The taxation system in this country is killing the SMEs because of the energy cost. I want to save lives, families, businesses, and communities. Why is the Government so slow to react and help people even when Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 was introduced on 8 October? There will no businesses left in rural areas. It will only be the multinationals that can sustain the cost that will be able to stay open and the SMEs will close.

His constituents this week are massively benefiting from Government supports that come from taxation to help them with their fuel bills.

The Government has been working very hard and is about to introduce significant measures for the SME sector. We have done a large amount at European level. We have gone to the European Union and worked together with all the other governments and we have made these decisions together. We have taken action to attract new gas supplies into the European market, including for ourselves. European Union countries have stored 90% of their requirements. Many Deputies, including Deputy Murnane O'Connor, to be fair to her, welcomed the regulation on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. That is about demand reduction, but there is also a cap on energy companies making excessive profits from renewables and other sources as well as making a solidarity contribution from fossil fuel profits. One Deputy asked about the delay, but if he had read the regulation, we are required to comply with it from 1 December. There is extensive work involved in doing that. I accept the price of energy is a key consideration for us, but the businesses in Deputy O'Donoghue's constituency, in my constituency and throughout the country also need security of supply. We must make sure we can give them the supply. There are two sides to the equation: getting the price down and making sure we have the supply. The Government has been entirely focused on that. By any measure, we have achieved substantial results in the face of the crisis and we will continue to work on the situation as well.

The Minister for Defence, Deputy Coveney, would be in a better position to discuss that. We welcome the agreement reached to established an EU military assistance mission in support of Ukraine. Ireland is engaging with Ukraine at present to assess how best to respond to its specific request for support in the area of de-mining where, as the Taoiseach noted last week we have some expertise. To be fair, the Ukrainians have severe needs and the whole area of mines is the classic civilian problem both during wartime and thereafter, where ordinary people are put at risk because of the mines that have been planted. We have some expertise and that help could be provided through the EU military assistance mission but there is work to be done on that. The Minister for Defence and the Taoiseach undoubtedly will be able to provide the Dáil with further information. As I stated in respect of energy, a lot has been achieved. I have already listed out what has been achieved to Deputy O'Donoghue and more work is ongoing. The Deputy is correct that the Heads of Government and State will return to this issue in December. It is important work and takes time. The fact that there can be disagreements or complexities around this issue is a feature rather than a flaw of the European system. We are working together to protect all of our national interests, all of which are important, but we also realise the importance of working together as member states of the European Union, contrary to what Deputy Mattie McGrath alleges, at all European debates, about there being some kind of conspiracy. We should try to keep conspiracy theories out of the Dáil and this whole thing about globalism is a conspiracy theory. There is no conspiracy. The governments try to work together for their peoples in the knowledge that by doing so, we get better results for the European people as a whole. We in Ireland have a specific situation in respect of gas because our gas supply is not connected to the continental European market, and we must protect that. To be fair to the other member states, they recognise that. When you start looking around the table, however, you see that each country or region has its own specificities that must be addressed as well. We are not unique in that regard.

Is deis a bheidh ann freisin do AE agus ASEAN cinneadh polaitíochta comhroinnte a léiriú chun aghaidh a thabhairt ar shaincheisteanna atá ina n-ábhair imní go réigiúnach agus ar fud an domhain. Beidh cruinniú mullaigh idir AE agus na Balcáin Thiar ar siúl i dTiorána na hAlbáine an 6 Nollaig. Casfar ceannairí AE ar a macasamhlacha ó na Balcáin Thiar i mí na Nollag agus is deis a bheidh ann chun iniúchadh a dhéanamh ar na réimsí inar féidir leis na Balcáin Thiar agus AE tacaíocht agus cúnamh frithpháirteach a chur ar fáil i bhfianaise na ndúshlán comhchoiteann.  Leaders discussed the EU's relations with Asia and in particular with the ten Asian countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, ASEAN, and preparation for the upcoming EU-ASEAN commemorative summit on 14 December. Ireland is a strong supporter of EU-ASEAN relations and 45 years of partnership between the EU and ASEAN is a significant milestone. The summit will be an opportunity to give a strong political signal from Europe that we want to strengthen our strategic relations with south-east Asia through concrete and practical co-operation so the full potential of both regions can be realised. It will also be an opportunity for EU and ASEAN to demonstrate a shared political determination to address regional and global issues of concern. The summit comes at a critical time in terms of the current geopolitical context with Russia's war in Ukraine and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar. It will be a welcome opportunity for the EU and ASEAN to clearly signal shared support for the international rules-based order. As I have already said, an EU-western Balkans summit will take place in Tirana, Albania on 6 December. It is welcome and significant that it will take place for the first time in the western Balkans region itself. The western Balkans, like the rest of Europe, is currently facing multifaceted challenges arising from the war on Ukraine, in the form of security concerns, political disruption, energy security and cost-of-living concerns. This comes on the back of the challenges of trying to rebuild their economies, which were laid low by the pandemic. When EU leaders meet with their counterparts in December, it will be an opportunity to explore where the western Balkans and the EU can provide mutual support and assistance in the face of these common challenges and where the EU can use its collective strength to assist its western Balkans neighbours with the political and economic supports to drive economic recovery, including with a view to an accelerated European Union pathway. The pathway to EU membership is of course a thread that runs through all of our relationships in the western Balkans. Ireland would like to see the opportunities afforded to us as a member of the EU afforded to all countries who are prepared to meet the requirements of accession and Ireland will support those who wish to join. The Taoiseach was pleased to contribute to the decision of the European Council in June to grant EU candidate status to Ukraine and Moldova and potential candidate status to Georgia. This will support all three in moving forward with their reform agendas and towards full membership of the European Union. I welcome that the EU, through the General Affairs Council, officially launched accession negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia in July. This sent an important signal to the region that the EU remains serious about enlargement. I am supportive of Bosnia and Herzegovina's European perspective. I expect the Commission's recommendation that Bosnia and Herzegovina be granted EU candidate status will be on the agenda for discussion at the December European Council. This moment represents a real opportunity for Bosnia and Herzegovina to move forward on its EU path but it can only do so by delivering on key reforms. I pay tribute to the team at the UN where the mandate for Operation Althea for Bosnia and Herzegovina was approved by unanimous vote of the UN Security Council at a meeting I attended. I am out of time but that covers almost all the issues the Taoiseach asked me to.
#NiallCollins	unknown-#NiallCollins-party	unknown-#NiallCollins-dob	unknown-#NiallCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	331	I move:That Dáil Éireann resolves that the period of operation of sections 1 to 7 and 9 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 (No. 14 of 2021) be extended for a further period of six months, beginning on the 1st day of December, 2022 and ending on the 31st day of May, 2023. I am here to introduce a resolution on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy McEntee, to extend the sunset clause in the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021. The extension of this Act will allow the hospitality sector to continue to provide the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in outdoor seating areas. Deputies will be aware that the Act was introduced in July 2021. The provisions of the Act were in place until 30 November 2021 and have already been extended on two occasions from November 21 until 31 May 2022 and from June to November 2022. Subsection 9(4) of the Act provides that the relevant provisions of the Act can be extended for up to six months at a time if a resolution approving its continuation has been passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas. On 25 October 2022, the Government agreed the extension of the Act for a further nine months. The Government took this decision as there is an ongoing demand for the provisions, which allow businesses to provide clarity and certainty with regard to the law around outdoor dining services. Therefore, I am now bringing forward a proposal that the Act should continue in operation until 31 May 2023. At the same meeting of Government on 25 October, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, was pleased to bring forward the general scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill, the aim of which is to radically reform, streamline and simplify the extremely outdated existing law relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol. The Bill would repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2018, as well as the Registration of Clubs Acts 1904 to 2008, and replace them with provisions more suited to modern conditions. It is also the intention to repeal the Public Dance Halls Act 1935. The need to reform and modernise licensing laws is because many years. Most recently, the Report of the Night-Time Economy Taskforce, published in September 2021, highlighted the inadequacies of the current system and how a modernised licensing system could contribute to revitalising the night-time economy. The sale of alcohol Bill will, among other initiatives, make long-term provision for outdoor dining. The relevant parts of the general scheme make provision for the amendment of references to licensed premises to include outdoor dining areas and the inclusion of a definition of outdoor dining. Once enacted, the sale of alcohol Bill will remove the need for the renewal of these specific provisions, which were introduced in July 2021 during the pandemic when a number of issues arose regarding the use of outdoor spaces by bars and restaurants. The reform of our liquor licensing laws is a major priority for this Government. The Minister, Deputy McEntee’s, Department is prioritising work on drafting the Bill with the aim of having it enacted in 2023. In the meantime, we need to extend the outdoor dining provisions provided for by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 to allow for ongoing certainty for all those operating in the licensing trade, their patrons and An Garda Síochána. The increased availability and popularity of outdoor dining and socialising has been welcomed by many. Its innovation is typical of the demand for more variety in ways we socialise and the types of venues and social spaces that are available. It is also clear that the increased use of outdoor dining has brought many benefits to our local communities as a whole, including increasing the vibrancy of our town centres and further enhancing our tourism offering. Furthermore, in a context in which Covid-19 is still circulating in the community, any measure that creates options for those who would rather not visit indoor settings can only be welcome. While we are pleased that we are able to address this element of licensing law through this specific initiative, it is clear that the industry and society as a whole need a more comprehensive solution to the inefficiencies and complexities of the current framework. The general scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill will reform the licensing framework in its entirety to bring it up to the expectations of modern society. The sale of alcohol Bill intends not only to modernise our licensing laws but also to ensure they better reflect the social, cultural and economic needs of our local communities. Our night-time economy and culture are not thriving in the way they should. This can be seen in all our towns and cities. Certainly, the pandemic and the necessary restrictions that were put in place at the time meant that the industry has been through a very challenging period. It is also clear that the industry is working under an outdated and ill-fitting licensing framework, however, which is inhibiting its development and creating unnecessary burdens for all those seeking to provide the places of entertainment and gathering that are so central to our sense of community. The sale of alcohol Bill will address these issues by creating a simpler, more straightforward licensing framework that will make it easier for licensed venues to do business. At the same time, it is also important to recognise there are harms caused by alcohol consumption. It is for this reason that Ireland has for many decades operated a restricted regime for the sale of alcohol, given its known social and health effects. The sale of alcohol Bill will retain that approach. The sale of alcohol will continue to require a licence and engagement with a robust licensing process that ensures the necessary protections and standards are upheld by all licenceholders. The Minister, Deputy McEntee, is confident that we can modernise and streamline the existing system while keeping public safety and public order to the fore. It will be crucial that public health needs and the needs of those who may be impacted by any harm caused, including members of the Garda and local residents, are taken into account when decisions are being taken regarding licensing. The general scheme makes provision for objections to be raised in court to the granting or renewal of licences, and the list of those who may object has been expanded. New grounds for objection to the renewal of a licence relating to failures to protect staff, patrons and performers from harassment, including sexual harassment, have been added with a view to creating a safer environment for everyone. We are also mindful of the need to support An Garda Síochána with regard to the enforcement of the licensing framework and ensuring public safety. To broaden the range of possible enforcement options available to the Garda, provision has been made for a compliance notice for offences regarding drunkenness in licensed premises and with regard to the duty of a licensee to preserve order. The Garda will also have the power to apply for a temporary closure order for failure or refusal to comply with a compliance notice. One of the key objects of the proposed legislation is to ensure the licensing application process is modernised, efficient, cost-effective and facilitates accountability. The general scheme provides that where a licensing application needs to be heard in court, this will now be dealt with by the District Court instead of the Circuit Court. This will help to reduce the costs involved and reduce pressure on the court system, while ensuring an accessible and transparent system. The sale of alcohol Bill updates and streamlines licensing provisions, including with regard to restaurants, hotels and off-licences, to make these simpler to apply for and to enforce. It will also make changes to the current permitted opening hours in line with the expectations and needs of today's society and to encourage the development of a modern diverse night-time economy. Regular trading hours for off-licence premises change to 9.30 a.m. to 9 p.m. every day of the week. This removes the current restriction on Sunday mornings whereby off-sales are not permitted until 12.30 p.m. Regular trading hours for licensed premises change to 9.30 a.m. to 12.30 a.m. every day of the week. This results in an additional hours' trading on Monday to Thursday and three and a half additional hours on a Sunday. The general scheme makes provision for both an annual late bar permit, which would allow opening until 2.30 a.m. any night of the week, and an annual nightclub permit that would permit the sale of alcohol until 5 a.m. and closure at 6 a.m. This will remove the need for such venues to obtain special exemption orders for each night they may wish to open, removing a complex and cumbersome requirement and thereby making it easier for such venues to do business. I am sure many Members are aware of the large numbers of pubs that have closed down in small towns and rural areas, particularly in recent years. When a town loses a pub, it loses an important part of its cultural fabric. Pubs are important places for communities where we can gather to celebrate and socialise, as well as to mourn. The current requirement for an existing licence to be extinguished before a new licence for a public house can be granted is an unacceptably high barrier to entry for those who want to open or reopen venues that could reinvigorate town centres and communities. Therefore, the general scheme provides that the extinguishment will remain for public houses for three years from the enactment but will not be required thereafter. The extinguishment requirement will remain in operation with regard to off-licences. Another potential contributor to a reinvigorated night-time economy is the cultural sector. In line with the recommendations of the night-time economy task force, it is recognised that cultural venues and facilities where the sale of alcohol is ancillary to the main activities should be able to opt for a licensing option on those terms.The general scheme, therefore, provides for amenity licences for small cultural venues such as theatres, galleries or museums to ensure public safety but also a level playing field. The same procedure for raising objections to the granting or renewal of an amenity licence applies, as well as a requirement that amenity licences must meet the same regulatory requirements as retail licence holders. In summary, we are here today to deal with one element of our current licensing system that needs our attention, namely, the extension of the outdoor dining provisions which have proven to be popular with both industry and patrons. It is widely recognised there are many other elements of the current licensing framework that also require attention and updating. The general scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill will aim to address all of these issues. It will introduce a long-term solution to the arrangements with regard to outdoor dining but will also introduce a wide-ranging framework for reform of the licensing process, which will make it easier to do business and contribute to the reinvigoration of our night-time economy while cutting down on administration and complexity and keeping public order and public safety at the forefront of our priorities.

We all recognise that Covid brought massive changes to our lives, one of which was the advent of a more continental European-type lifestyle where people drink and eat outdoors, which we had not been doing to any great extent up to then. We recognise the positive benefits of that. The last time this legislation was before us we spoke about how there was a need to reform many of these laws permanently to ensure we had this in place permanently. I acknowledge the Minister of State's reference to that and the work that has been done around the liquor licensing laws, trying to bring them into the 21st century from the Public Dance Halls Act right the way back to previous legislation. That work is welcome and ongoing. We have all co-operated in trying to make it as positive as possible. However, there are some concerns around it. We also need to acknowledge that. We have had a significant problem in this country of alcoholism and of people becoming seriously addicted. We have a problem of antisocial behaviour, particularly in late-night situations. We see it in the city of Dublin and there is evidence in many areas around the country of the negative impact when alcohol is used to excess and all that flows from it. We need to be conscious of this as well. I was recently in the United States, where there are very long opening hours for licensed premises. One of things they are very strict on there is people drinking outdoors in public. We have to find the correct balance here. I hope we can do that. I am also conscious that the whole tourism industry has been in turmoil. That sector has had a very difficult couple of years. We look forward to what is hoped will be better times ahead. However, it has to be said also that many of our hotels are at present facilitating the provision of accommodation for refugees and people from Ukraine, who are very welcome there. I think some 20% or 25% of our hotel rooms are taken up for that use at the moment. The Government has stated that it is possible people from Ukraine who are staying in the hotels will not be provided food in them. I wonder about the knock-on impact that will have. Obviously, many of the hotels will be getting a lower rate. Will they decide to opt out of it because they want to get back to the business they set themselves up for in the very beginning, namely, providing accommodation for tourists, people in business or whoever needs hotel accommodation? We could find the move might have a negative impact. It needs to be done with great caution and care. Further to that, for many communities that have welcomed people from Ukraine, which is the most recent crisis, and indeed other people seeking international protection from other areas, there are massive issues in respect of resources. We had resource competition in this country for a very long time before anybody came from anywhere else. Whether people seek educational, health or social resources, there is intense competition. When people come from other places and put more intensity into that competition, it causes friction and difficulties. There needs to be a great effort by Government to support communities to welcome people, as they do, and to put the resources in place so that it does not create too much additional pressure. Everyone in this House would understand that there is pressure and many of our citizens are in dire need in respect of GP services, hospital waiting lists or special needs assistants in schools. All of those things are coming under greater pressure as more people come from Ukraine and other countries. We need to acknowledge that by ensuring we put more people in place to provide those services. The efforts that have been made to reform the alcohol laws and the issue of late trading are very welcome. We have work to do. The Minister of State hopes the legislation will be coming forward in 2023. I hope this will be the last time we are renewing this emergency legislation if the other legislation comes into place. We have no difficulty in supporting it. One of the difficulties with it from the very outset was that it went a distance that people were not expecting. Many of the local authorities did not have provisions in place such as by-laws and so on. There were also issues for the Garda as to how legal it was for people to be drinking on the streets. There was a grey area there. The gap was filled but there are difficulties around these things. I accept and understand that, in the context of Covid, there was no other way of doing it, but rushed legislation leaves space for mistakes to be made. We need to learn from those mistakes when we are putting permanent measures in place, as I hope we will be doing with the new legislation. We understand the efforts that were made through Covid by everyone across the board. All of us on this side of the House are critical of Government for many reasons when things could be done better or more could be done. There were instances where more could have been done, things could have been done faster or people supported more. That said, to our credit, the community in Ireland did a great job in ensuring we have kept to an absolute minimum the numbers of people who contracted Covid, died from Covid or have had long-lasting impacts of it. That is something we should take credit for as a society and a country. I know Covid numbers are fluctuating and we have better medicines now to deal with it. However, there are a lot of people with long-term symptoms of Covid-19. There are serious issues in regard to how that has been dealt with. The medical provision to assist people with long Covid has undergone some reduction in services and resources. The Government needs to focus on that and ensure we put the services in place. I have had people in my constituency office who are suffering from the long-term effects of Covid and find it very difficult to get the kind of assistance they need. The Government needs to reflect on this and ensure we do everything we can to assist those who, unfortunately, contracted the disease and have the serious impact of a long-term health problem. The problems businesses may have in regard to how they can make a profit is certainly something we have to deal with, but the most acute thing we have to do is ensure those who have long-term, continuous health problems because of contracting Covid-19 get the resources they require. That is a serious issue the Government needs to deal with. We have no difficulty in supporting the ongoing provision of this legislation. I hope this is the last time we are doing this and that full and proper measures will be in place before we have to return here in six months.

One of the very few legacies of Covid that could perhaps be regarded as positive is the vast improvement in the availability of outdoor dining and socialising, provided for by the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which this motion seeks to extend. The effect of the Act was that pubs and restaurants were specifically allowed access to and use of outdoor spaces for eating and drinking. This was done by emergency legislation, effectively sidelining by-laws and local authorities to allow us all to try to get some semblance of normality without being forced indoors and the resulting exposure in confined spaces to Covid-19.There is no doubt that this disease was having a real, devastating and unpredictable impact on people’s health prior to the arrival of the vaccines. Our condolences still go out to those who lost friends and family to Covid. The intention behind this motion is to extend the provision in the Act. The terms of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2021 are clear and explicit; that it is supposed to be a temporary measure. The Title to the Act states that its purpose is to:A. make provision, on a temporary basis, for the sale or supply of intoxicating liquor in certain circumstances in seating areas located outside licensed premises in order to allow, in the public interest and having regard to the manifest and grave risk to human life and public health posed by the spread of the disease known as Covid-19, the businesses of licensees of such premises to operate in a manner that mitigates the spread of that disease ...The question is not whether we agree with the changes but whether there is still a sufficient risk from the pandemic to justify bypassing local by-laws and the democratic control of local councils and continuing with this emergency legislation in place. We have to be careful that we do not just end up using the Act as a permanent solution. However, there is still sufficient justification for us to extend the provisions of Act for six months as outlined in the motion. According to the Government's Covid-19 data hub, there were 32 deaths from Covid-19 reported last week, there was a test positivity rate of 12%, there were 316 confirmed cases in hospitals and there were 11 confirmed cases in ICUs. There is no doubt that the effects of vaccination have provided a significant protection for many. While many of us have moved on and are living lives that have mostly returned to normal, there is still sufficient prevalence of Covid-19 to justify the extension of these measures for now. We cannot take this for granted on a permanent basis, however. While in the majority of cases there has been little controversy regarding the implementation of the Act, if we want to extend it on a more permanent basis, this should be done on a firmer statutory basis, while retaining the role of the local councillors and councils to make local adjustments. It would make more sense to extend it until the end of next August, rather than the end of May, given that the summer months are when spaces get the highest use and are of most benefit to everyone. However, the base legislation only allows for an extension of six months. By the time this extension is finished, I would hope the Government would present a mechanism whereby the changes put in place would have the chance to be approved for extension by local councils and councillors across the country who should be deciding matters in any event. I would suggest that, as I have done in my remarks, one of the advantages of the Covid-19 readjustments to socialising was the experiment of utilising previously unused space on public pathways and so on. We have to move to a situation where, in our capital city and in towns across the country, the car being excluded from that space is continued. We need to reclaim that public space for public dining and socialising in order that families with young children and elderly relatives do not have to constantly worry about cars, vehicles and speeding traffic. Far too many of our towns and cities are choked with vehicles, and traffic management takes precedence over socialising and over that most basic need for human connection. If we can get any good out of the devastating pandemic of recent years it is that we can reimagine our civic spaces and public realm and extend these powers to the local authorities to reimagine how we interact with each other on a more permanent basis. The Labour Party supports the motion. However, in the future, we can hopefully have a more imaginative way of doing this through the local council mechanism.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	334	I welcome the fact that the provisions of this Act are going be put on a permanent footing and that this will hopefully be done before the sunset clause lapses. There are still many issues that will have to be thrashed out in the practical application of the forthcoming legislation. It is much broader than the issue we are dealing with today, namely, the sunset clause today. The Department needs to engage with local authorities on outdoor seating areas and provide advice to them on standards. There is a lot of stuff out there that is quite ugly. We have done a great deal of work at local authority level to try to make sure you can get good shop fronts and facades on buildings in order that they are not festooned with advertising and all the rest of it. However, some of what has been constructed would be full of advertising and it is the only thing people see. It is important that there is set standard and that there is good co-ordination between the local authorities on that. Some logic needs to be applied in the context of seating areas on the street. These spaces often have nearly replaced some of the seating on the street that would be free. It is not right that people can only occupy a place if they pay for it. That was important from the point of view of people socialising and of keeping businesses viable at a difficult time. We have to learn lessons from that. Covid-19 will not be the only virus that will circulate. Hopefully, there will not be another pandemic but there is a value in this, including for some people who like the idea of sitting in an area where there would be much more ventilation. Temple Bar Square, for example, used to have a lovely second-hand bookshop and a book market. That whole area has essentially been taken over by box seating for nearby restaurants. I completely understand that these restaurants have come out of a hard time and that this is temporary, but we have to think about what these places will look like if we are to continue some element of this into the future. These public spaces are not just commercial spaces; they are spaces for people to enjoy. The architecture in these spaces is quite important in the context of how people engage with each other. Outdoor bar and restaurant seating is no substitute for permanent seating in places where people gather, which is an important point. In cities, it will often be in these spaces that people socialise and get to know their neighbours. It is important that there is some retention of this and that we do not destroy the character of areas. There have been other problems, such as those relating to mobility for people with disabilities and those with buggies. It has become less easy to navigate some areas because of what is an impediment for some people, while it is equally a place that people enjoy. It is important that we take all of that on board in order to ensure that there is good guidance to local authorities to the effect that this is something that will go on into the future. There is a licensing aspect to what we are dealing with and there is also a by-law aspect. The licensing aspect was the one in respect of which there was the real difficulty if I remember rightly. As I said, people with difficulties have to be accommodated and local authorities must ensure that there is a clear right of way for pedestrians that is free from clutter. I remember walking around an area with some friends of mine, one of whom has a significant visual impairment. That person talks about the damage done to their legs as a result of their constantly crashing into things. The latter are things you would not even notice except when somebody draws your attention to them because of the difficulties they face. I refer to things like sandwich boards in this regard. There is also the necessity for people to get up and down off footpaths, which can be problematic for some. Streets becoming pedestrianised can be good because sometimes having a lot of people on a street makes it safer and a place into which other people will go into. Empty streets are often the ones on which people do not feel safe. I am in favour of all of that, but we need to see good design.We need to see the architectural character of streets being retained. I hope we will deal with that when the sale of alcohol Bill comes in front of us.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	335	I welcome the motion, which seeks to extend sections 1 to 7, inclusive, and section 9 of the Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act to allow for the sale or supply of liquor in outdoor seating areas for four to six months - from 1 December next to 31 May 2023. We can all recall why this arrangement was required. The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, which came into force in July 2021, was in direct response to the issues streaming from Covid restrictions, whereby those in the licensed trade, the tourism industry and people involved in businesses in towns and villages across the country had no way of making an income. The Government took the decision to introduce a stopgap measure while there were ongoing discussions about whether by-laws or primary legislation was needed. I supported what has been done and today I will support the motion to extend the provisions of this Act. There is an ongoing demand for the provision that allows businesses to provide outdoor dining services. I have spoken to numerous businesses in Dundalk that invested heavily in fitting kitchens and external seating areas in order they could survive during the lockdown. The Covid restrictions support scheme helped, but this was an expense they never intended nor expected to incur. Now they want a return on their investment, especially coming into the busy Christmas period, which will likely see a ramping up of clientele in the context of outdoor dining and Christmas parties. The extension of this Act is required in order that they can offer to serve liquor in outdoor seating areas. Ireland is behind the times. Outdoor eating and drinking is commonplace in Europe. Berlin and Brussels, for example, have outdoor dining throughout the year. People like the option to sit outside in spite of the Irish weather, particularly as most facilities have implemented heating systems and spacious sheltered areas to mitigate the effects of our climate. In some cases, however, footpaths have been made narrow and people with disabilities have not been able to pass or enter. It is essential that we do not impede people who have visual impairments or physical movement difficulties. Many businesses made use of whatever space they could in order to survive, but they did not think about the needs of those with disabilities. I do not blame businesses, but there must be an inclusive space that people with disabilities can enjoy equally. There have also been issues with parking in towns, so design really needs to be considered. The programme for Government, as well as the justice plan, includes a commitment to modernise alcohol licenses. Design must be taken into consideration to ensure inclusivity for all. There are some issues around the licensing laws and the consumption of alcohol. Clarification in law is required, specifically in relation to the distinction drawn between a liquor licence and a licence approved by a local authority. There is also a significant uncertainty in the context of enforcement. The Act obliges licence holders to maintain order in outside areas. Yet, there was a mixed message as to the power of An Garda Síochána in respect of public order purposes. As far as I am concerned, the general powers available to An Garda Síochána to maintain public order apply to those outdoor spaces in the same fashion as they apply to indoor licensed premises. Clarity in law and certainty were sought and are still required by businesses, local authorities and An Garda Síochána. Although I will acknowledge that there has been some movement in the context of the proposed sale of alcohol Bill, which will provide a permanent solution to this issue as well as a permanent modernisation in relation to this Act, this needs to be done within the next six months if the extension is passed today. By no means do I mean to rush the reforms and consolidation of the Licensing Acts, but this is the third six-month extension. The Government should have used the past 18 months to get the legislation drafted and passed. It is time we recognised that this arrangement has worked and that we need to put something permanent in place as soon as possible in order to ensure it can work into the future. Overall, I have no problem supporting the extension of the provision; indeed, I welcome it. Coming off the back of the pandemic, the hospitality and tourism sectors have made good recovery. However, the war in Europe, the rising cost of living and inflation rates are still offering significant blows to businesses, especially in my constituency of Louth and East Meath. These businesses need every support we can give them to keep their doors open in the coming months. Every extra chair and table will help them keep afloat. We need to support the sector any way we can and we can do this by extending this Act for an additional six months. As I said, it is a stopgap. Eighteen months is a long time. It is very important for the Government to put something out there at the moment. People like dining outside. I am a Pioneer and I really enjoy eating outside. I have no problem putting on an extra coat or scarf. The communication between people is far better. As I said, other European countries do it. I do not see any reason why we cannot do it. The downfall is regarding people with disabilities, especially those who have problems with their sight. There are others, however. In Dundalk, I saw a mother pushing her child around in a wheelchair and they were forced to go out into the main road. That should not happen. It is very important, as I said, that the Garda enforce the law. There are also serious issues with parking. It is important that local authorities and everybody works together to get the solution done. I welcome this and it is a step in the right direction. All of the businesses appreciate it. They have invested much money over the past two years because of the pandemic and this is money that they owe to their banks. It is an opportunity for them to come in to a busy Christmas and perhaps have a bit of outdoor dining and drinking. I support the motion to extend the Act, but I ask the Government to please put something more permanent in place.

The Act was introduced in July 2021. There is an ongoing demand for provisions that allow businesses to provide outdoor dining services with clarity and certainty in relation to the law. Therefore, that appears to be the rationale for the extension of the Act. Ireland’s pubs, restaurants and nightclubs have been heavily impacted by Covid-19-related restrictions for the past two years. The necessary public health restrictions affected the industry significantly and many of businesses in it are still struggling. The aim of this extension of the Act is to facilitate the continued operation of outdoor seating areas, many of which were introduced during the past two years. It would provide clarity for the pubs, bars and clubs in a position to provide an outdoor seating area to customers and members. The impact of Covid on the hospitality sector and now the energy costs crisis is truly horrendous. Many licensed premises simply did not recover, while others are struggling to do so because the energy crisis is hitting hard. The compounding impact from cost-of-living pressures on businesses is driving many to the brink. On the basis of what is proposed, I support what is being done. However, the one simple question I have relates to why a permanent solution is not being provided. Surely the Minister had sufficient time to make more permanent changes and give the struggling sector some long-term assurance beyond May next year. No businesses can plan and invest in the context of such an ad hoc arrangement. Let us face it. Day in, day out we hear of businesses in dire trouble. We should absolutely do anything we can do to help them. I have a number of serious concerns. I suppose I have a conflict of interest. I have two brothers who own two public houses in west Cork and a daughter works in another one. I am therefore aware of the struggle the sector is going through. It is having a horrendous time. I can see many public houses closing throughout Ireland. Many Government decisions taken down the years that were anti-local pubs and their survival are going to succeed and lead to their closure. Obviously, the increase in price of alcohol last week was another kick in the teeth for them. On outdoor seating areas, there should be consultation with local communities. Local authorities must have consultation with communities, particularly in the context of people with disabilities. What is needed is a good bit of respect, and sometimes that is not shown. In general, I support this motion.

It would give pubs and clubs clarity in planning for the season ahead in the context of outdoor seating and their customers and staff. We could see during Covid how important these outdoor areas were. The Minister of State is aware of the awards Limerick won with in respect of its outside areas. There are fantastic facilities within those areas. Why can we not get a permanent solution? Many people had outdoor areas during Covid and these have proven very successful. People were conscious of their surroundings and where they were going. Also, the those who provided these outside areas had to look at a future plan of how long they would be there, whether they would be allowed into the future and the risks involved. I support what is proposed, but we need a long-term plan not only for the pub and restaurant sectors but also for all others sectors. We need to show what outdoor areas will be permanently exempted from the planning laws. Structures were erected during Covid, and many of them won awards for their diversity in helping people outdoors. A worrying aspect is that we must protect people and staff. In case there are any alterations within those areas, we have to look at the role of the Garda. How do we introduce the Garda into this? Some 800 gardaí have promised, but only 23 graduated recently. Some 284 gardaí retired, were off sick or off duty due to disciplinary matters. Some 87 gardaí resigned. We must consider that because the Garda protects our counties. The budget contained an allocation in respect of the 800 gardaí to whom I refer. Where is that money? Will the funding be increased for next year? Where has the money that was allocated gone? Garda management has asked gardaí to work a week of seven days or six days on and take two days off. The rota is wrong. How do we encourage gardaí back into our areas in order that we can facilitate people being in outdoor areas and longer opening hours?

It is intended that the extension of the Act until 31 May 2023 will continue to provide clarity in respect of the provisions relating to outdoor dining for licence holders, patrons and the Garda. It is clear that there is ongoing demand for the provision of outdoor dining. In the meantime, as I outlined earlier, work is progressing on the drafting of the sale of alcohol Bill, which will provide a long-term solution to the issue and many other issues which bedevil our outdated and unnecessarily complex licensing system. By extending the Act until May, businesses will be able to continue to utilise outdoor spaces for a further six-month period. The Minister recognises there is great interest among Deputies in the sale of alcohol Bill. It is an extensive piece of legislation that will benefit from detailed discussion and debate. The general scheme of the Bill has been referred to the Joint Committee on Justice for pre-legislative scrutiny and the Minister awaits with interest the outcome of the committee's consideration and engagement with various sectoral groups. It is important that we hear all views and opinions in respect of the reform of our licensing laws. The publication of the general scheme is an indication of the Government's commitment to modernising our licensing laws. The provisions made by the general scheme are envisaged to provide us with a more streamlined, up-to-date and cost-effective licensing system. It is important that we continue to modernise our licensing laws to meet the demands of today's society. Through the reforms outlined in the general scheme, we aim to revitalise our hospitality sector and our night-time economy culture for the benefit of businesses, patrons and our local communities in general, particularly in smaller towns and rural areas. I am pleased to address the specific issues of outdoor dining provisions today on behalf of the Minister, who intends to provide a long-term solution in due course. We have achieved an important milestone with the approval of the general scheme of the sale of alcohol Bill by Government and its publication last month. The Minister assures colleagues that she is committed to bringing forward these important reforms in order to ensure that our hospitality industry has the modernised and streamlined framework our society requires.

It is designed to lengthen the timeframe in which a guarantee given pursuant to this agreement will increase from six years from the date of the agreement to seven. In 2013, the Department commissioned a review of the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme, which was carried out by First Choice Financial Services and AJS Financial Advice Limited. They were appointed by the Department to specifically review the scheme. The review focused on giving the scheme the best possible chance of success. In the recommendations submitted, the steering committee, appointed by the then Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, stated that the three-year term was too short because most loans are for a minimum of five to seven years. It made a key recommendation to extend the term of the guarantee to seven years. This was to allow for guarantees to be extended and thereby loans also. This Bill seeks to set the terms for this scheme at six years. I have submitted this amendment in part to understand why one of the key recommendations of the report commissioned by the Department has still not been taken on board.

I can see the argument for wanting a longer period, and it is not that we disagree. The state aid basis for the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme is the European Commission's state aid temporary crisis scheme. The relevant section of the framework puts the maximum term of loan at six years. My Department is required to notify the Commission of the terms of the scheme, and this is already under way. By keeping within the standard terms of the framework as suggested or required by the EU, we can expedite the scheme as quickly as possible. Moving outside the standard terms would mean less opportunity for lower interest rates and a longer timeframe for approval. This scheme is focused on short- to medium-term lending. My Department has another loan scheme in development, the growth and sustainable loan scheme, which was approved by Government last week, as I mentioned on the floor of the House. That loan will cater for lending to SMEs for longer terms of seven to ten years. That will be another offering that may deliver what the Deputy is seeking.The Ukraine credit guarantee scheme, UCGS, will focus on assisting business in the current crisis by providing loans to cover input costs for the next 12 to 24 months by spreading the costs over six years. I recognise why the Deputy has tabled her amendment but if we accept that amendment we are into an unknown timeframe of when we could have this completed and when we could deliver the product. We are anxious to get this up and running as quickly as we possibly can. We believe that if we can get it through the Houses this week, we should be in position to have a loan offering under the credit guarantee scheme before Christmas or certainly very soon after. I ask for the Deputy's co-operation. For this one we will stick with six years but the next loan product will be longer.

That explanation is very helpful because bypassing the recommendations on the temporary partial credit guarantee scheme seemed to be out of step with where I thought the Government might be. While I am not trying to put words in the Minister of State's mouth, he is basically saying this is to comply with existing rules. I know the Minister of State is not suggesting it, but just for the avoidance of any doubt this amendment was not tabled in an effort to frustrate or elongate the process. As indicated at the start of this, we on this side of the House are very willing to work with the Government to get this through. As the Minister of State stated, the ambition is that this money will be with people before Christmas. The intention was not to delay or frustrate the process but merely to get an answer on that. On that basis I am satisfied with the explanation.

The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, funding the scheme through the guarantee, plays no role in the application or decision-making process which is fully delegated to participating lenders. As a result, the loans are issued, operated and overseen by the respective banks. In other words, the banks administer the scheme, they make decisions on whether to issue loans based on their own for-profit criteria for loan insurance and not the criteria of the Department. We are debating this Bill today because we need a scheme that specifically helps businesses during the current inflation crisis and the crisis caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine. While the Bill tries to address this, we are submitting this amendment to further strengthen the loan scheme. We have called for interest rates to be capped at 2.5% instead of 2.75% as was the case with the Covid-19 credit guarantee scheme. We also believe it would be a major incentive if the loans were interest free with zero repayments for the first 12 months. As the Minister of State knows, these companies are only now coming out of a very tumultuous and difficult period of trading. Having zero repayments for first 12 months would incentivise people to take them up. People are understandably very careful and very worried about taking on additional debt. Some of these people are only just getting out from the debt they incurred following the 2008 financial collapse. As we know, it was standard practice for many of the Covid-19 credit guarantee loan schemes across the European Union to have 12 months with zero interest and no repayments. It would make a significant difference to this scheme if we could defer the interest rates for 12 months and it would go a long way towards assisting business. It would also recognise that some people will naturally be very cautious about taking on debt or additional debt as it will be from many of them.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	344	I again thank the Deputy for the amendment which again we cannot take on board. I hate saying we will oppose it when we are explaining why we cannot take it on board under the existing rules. It is a formality that we have to oppose it, I am afraid. We oppose this amendment. The aforementioned notification of the scheme to the European Commission is based on a state-guaranteed loan scheme. Interest-free coverage is a different type of scheme under the framework and not permitted under this scheme. It would require a different premium and would have more onerous state aid implications for the businesses. As a premium is required to be paid quarterly by the business to cover the guarantee by the State, if no payments were made over 12 months, the guarantee would not stand. This would result in the end user having worse terms and conditions, including collateral and personal guarantee requirements, and interest rates. We believe that having the scheme will lead to greater availability of credit and loans because they are divested on behalf of the banks. The requirement to have collateral up to a certain level would be eliminated by having this scheme as well as reducing interest rates. It is important to have this scheme and to work within the existing rules. The Credit Guarantee Act has facilitated a number of schemes, including the standard credit guarantee scheme, the Covid-19 scheme and now the Ukraine credit guarantee scheme. None of these credit guarantee schemes have utilised a cap in the interest rate. This is because the bilateral agreement is decided on an individual basis between the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the finance provider. The legislation does not set out a cap, but this allows for a level of flexibility. The scheme and the temporary crisis framework demand that as a result of the guarantee the interest rate is demonstrably reduced from market rates. I addressed that on Second Stage. There will be a reduction on market rates. That is required to be in the scheme and that has proven to be the case on the schemes in the various iterations previously used on this legislation as well. This will be evident to the business in the loan documentation. We monitor and track that. The State is involved in this loan process and we will certainly keep an eye on that. Larger banks tend to provide standard term loans with a considerable reduction in interest rate. However, smaller non-banks, including credit unions, would not be able to meet the proposed cap. They will provide a reduction as required but could not go to the level proposed. I want to see a strong level of competition in the range of finance providers participating in the scheme and not having a cap will facilitate this competition because the cap would exclude certain providers. Competition is important because these smaller lenders provide different types of lending, including asset-backed financing such as hire-purchase and discount invoicing. In addition, they might be the lender of choice for some of the businesses we intend to help here. This competition is important for the market but more so for the businesses as they can choose the lender that suits them. Pre-eligibility will now be assessed by the Strategic Bank Corporation of Ireland. Following approval, they can go to any participating lender. We hope to have a number of lenders involved in the scheme. The initial offering will probably be through one or two to get it out quickly before Christmas and then it will be open to all the existing people using this scheme and others to come forward and bid for some quota here as well. In the interest of competition, it is important not to have a cap.

While he might not have it here, does he have information on how many loans have been issued by the credit unions under the other schemes? Are they intrinsically involved? My understanding was it was mostly the main banks. I appreciate the point the Minister of State has made. Notwithstanding that I intend to press the amendment. The banks will do a lot of heavy lifting on this. The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that it works. The Department cannot set the terms beyond what we are discussing here today and it will be back over to the banks after this. I share the same ambition as the Minister of State. I want to see the scheme work and help those businesses that are viable but vulnerable and ensure that not just businesses but the jobs can be saved. For that reason, I will press the amendment.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-11-16 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	346	The amendment is two-pronged. It seeks to have 12 months interest free, which we cannot do as an interest-free payment is not permitted under the rules. It also seeks to apply a cap. I do not have to the breakdown on the number of lenders that participated in schemes previously. I can certainly get that for the Deputy. The intention of having these credit guarantees is to do two things. It is to make credit available quicker and cheaper with less collateral required by the businesses which are under immense pressure. They can spread the cost, which is causing difficulty at the moment, over the next six years to give them a chance of being able to survive. It is important to have that scheme up and running as quickly as we possibly can. It is guaranteed to be at a reduced rate compared with the products available today without the scheme. That is guaranteed in the legislation, as it must be with the framework of the scheme. We want to attract the maximum number of lenders into this area. We are trying to increase access to finance for our SME community. We believe there is an opportunity under these schemes to attract lenders, such as credit unions, more into the space of making credit available to businesses as well. The 2.5% interest rate cap will probably rule out many potential lenders coming into the scheme. We cannot force the scheme. We will be asking lenders to avail of the scheme and if we put a cap on this that is probably too low in real terms, even though we always like to make money available to businesses as cheaply as we possibly can, we must also be realistic that this would not attract in the lenders. While we can guarantee that there must be a reduction to reflect the State's involvement beyond the guarantee, we need to be realistic that a 2.5% cap would probably prevent some of them coming into the scheme. The credit guarantee has worked in the past and delivered good results.More than 7,500 people benefited from the last scheme. When you sit down with the business community, which we do on daily basis through all the various forums, we find the interest rate is not the bit they are concerned with, but it is access to the money and the number people in the system who are making the money available. That is what we trying to do here. While we of course want to keep the costs as low as we can, and we will demand that, that is not the biggest issue. They say to us that having a number of lenders that are in a position to loan this money is important to them, as well as quicker access with de-risk. By having the straight guarantee, the banks and lenders will change the profile of the customer they try to lend to, which is what we want. I also want to flag the role of Microfinance Ireland, which also has products available to smaller companies. This is a good offering and there is an opportunity in some of those schemes to have an interest-free period. This a different scheme and it is targeted at different businesses, but it is worth mentioning and is another part of the offering. This is to strengthen our toolkit to respond to the needs of business and that is why we are trying to get it through the Houses.

“Report on the establishment of a Land Price Register 
8. The Minister shall, not later than 3 months after the passing of this Act, commission and publish a report on the establishment of a Land Price Register to be operated by Tailte Éireann which would— (a) expand the register that records residential property sales prices,(b) establish a new land and other non-residential property transaction database, (c) set out in detail all other key considerations.”.”Amendment No. 2 is on the issue of a land price register, which should be a key function of Tailte Éireann. It seeks to ensure that if this amendment was passed, no later than three months after passing the Bill, a report on the establishment of a land price register would be published. In the US, since 2000 the price of land has increased at a much faster rate than the consumer price index or even the price of housing itself. The collapse in the price of land after the great global recession more than decade ago was also much sharper than the collapse in the other prices. We can see from the data that is available in the US that the one the key drivers of house price inflation has been linked to sharp increases in the price of land. My point in telling the Minister of State about the US is that we know of this data in the US. This information is freely available in the US because of the US land price index. There is no such equivalent register index or data available in Ireland. We do not have transparency around land prices or developers’ margins and we do not have the information we need to tackle the cost of delivering housing. We do not have the information we need to help end land hoarding and land speculation. At the moment, according to the Government, there is 8,000 ha of zoned land available for housing that is sitting unused and on which more than 250,000 homes could be built. A land price register would help to provide the data that is required for an effective land hoarding tax. In whose interests is it that we do not have this information and that it has not been made transparent? I ask this especially in the context of the housing disaster we have the moment, where we have the highest ever house prices, the highest ever rents and the highest ever number of people in homeless emergency accommodation. Huge numbers of young people are emigrating and are stuck living in their parents’ homes well into their 30s and we do not have transparency around this. I would ask that the Minister of State would accept this amendment.

I understand the intention of this amendment is that Tailte Éireann would commission a report to explore the feasibility of expanding the register to include an additional set of land and non-residential property information. The intention of this Bill is to bring about the merger of the Property Registration Authority, Ordnance Survey Ireland and the Valuation Office, which includes the transfer of the current functions of these bodies into Tailte Éireann. It is not envisaged at this point to expand the current functions of the existing bodies during the merger process. However, there is already scope under the legislation for the Minister to call for reports and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to legislate for a specific report such as that which was outlined in Deputy O’Callaghan’s proposal. Under section 10 of this Bill, the board of Tailte Éireann will have the statutory power to generally guide the strategic direction of Tailte Éireann and to advise or make recommendations having regard to Government policy. The Civil Service Renewal 2030 programme includes the ambition to develop and deliver trusted evidence and insights to inform public policy which advance the social, economic, cultural and environmental wellbeing of Ireland. Improved data quality, analysis and sharing can improve the evidence base for policy development and can drive more seamless delivery. The pathways in Housing for All address challenges in our housing system, however, these do not exist in isolation but sit in a wider context. Under Housing for All, the Government's housing plan to 2030, my Department is committed to evidence-based policy development and will continue to improve data availability and analysis. The Government recently published its first annual update of the plan's actions, which sets out how the Government is responding to changed circumstances in ensuring that focus remains on delivery. Under action 24.2 of the progress report, the Government has committed to developing a national zoned housing land register based on local authority development plans, including the potential housing yield or capacity, with a targeted delivery timeframe of quarter 1 of 2023. This register can also form the basis for the associated calculation of land use values required for land value sharing measures. Therefore, while I note the benefits of evidence to supporting policy development, such as the measures in the Deputy's proposal, the appropriate time for considering these matters is following the establishment of Tailte Éireann and the appointment of the board.

It is great that the Government supports and is committed to data and to the evidence-based policymaking that we can engage in thanks to data, but given that this amendment would not create a land price register and would only create a situation in which there would be a report on the matter, why not commit to that now? The Minister of State made the point that this provision did not need to be in the legislation because the Minister could ask for such a report anyway. I have been raising this matter for quite some time with the Government. Is the Minister of State giving a commitment that, after the Bill's enactment, the Minister will seek a report on a land price register?

It is an important point and I can give a commitment that the Minister will give consideration to it. However, the important element is the establishment of Tailte Éireann first. I believe the Minister will then give consideration to the Deputy's request.

	“Timeframe for valuation of commercial property 
9. Tailte Éireann shall, within 4 months of the substantial completion of a commercial unit, assess the Net Annual Value of the property and set a valuation in line with rental values at the specified valuation so that commercial rates may be applied.”. This amendment relates to the Valuation Office and the length of time it takes to value commercial units. Often, housing developments which could have been described as newer, though many of them now are built out ten or 15 years, have a considerable level of vacancy in the commercial units. I have stated before that some are in my constituency, in areas like Clongriffin, but the level of vacancy is a national issue. Incredibly, the Valuation Office has not valued the empty units for commercial rates ten, 12 or 15 years on. This is significant because local authorities no longer provide a full exemption on empty commercial premises. They charge a level of rates on them to encourage a commercial or meanwhile use. If it is not commercially viable and there is no meanwhile or community use a unit can be put to and which could contribute to this vacancy rates bill, it forces the question of whether there is an oversupply of commercial units. Do some of these units need to be converted to residential use? Could they be converted to such use if they are on the ground floor? There are issues with that because there must be enough services and a balance of uses in any large new development. However, if a valuation is done, it helps move this along in terms of insufficient housing supply and insufficient commercial, meanwhile or community uses in developments that are not complete. It is unacceptable that the Valuation Office, more than ten years on in many areas, has not valued these commercial units. That is a logjam that is holding this up. If the Minister of State does not propose to accept my amendment, although I hope he does, how will the Government address this issue? What will the Valuation Office do to ensure we are not in this position in a decade's time, with places not being valued for rates?

Section 28(5) of the Valuation Act 2001, as amended, provides for the completion of revision applications within six months of the making of a valid application. The section has not yet been commenced. The Valuation Office is mindful of the backlog of revision cases from local authorities and third parties. Measures to address the backlog effectively need to be in place before section 28(5) can be commenced. Options to address the backlog continue to be considered and the Valuation Office will continue to engage with my Department to find a way to ultimately allow for section 28(5) to be commenced and adhered to.

I can understand why section 28(5) has not been commenced given the serious backlog. This is not a backlog; this is ten years late and it has not been done. I accept this is only part of the solution and not the entire solution, but it would help move things along. Communities are left with a sense of incompletion and with vacancy, which can lead to dereliction. This is often in the heart of the residential area, maybe where there are commercial units or shops opened, and some other amenities and facilities. It can be where transport hubs are located and people get off buses and trains. To be left a decade later with all this vacancy is completely unacceptable. It takes the heart out of these areas and means they do not have the vibrancy, vitality or completion they need. Children who were not born when their parents moved into these areas are now moving into their teens with this vacancy continuing in their area. What is being done to address the backlog? What commitments can the Minister of State give that the Government is taking this issue seriously and providing resources to quickly deal with the backlog? We need this to be done to achieve fairness for these communities. It is part of the solution and could identify and free up areas to be converted to residential uses. That would have an impact on the housing crisis.

The Valuation Office is engaged in a national revaluation programme, the immediate objective of which is to ensure the first revaluation of commercial and industrial properties in all rating authority areas in over 160 years is conducted across the country as soon as possible and on a phased basis. Substantial progress has been made in this regard. The latest part of the programme is known as Reval 2023 and comprises revaluation of rateable properties in the rating authority areas of Clare, Donegal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, where it will be the second revaluation, as well as Galway, Kerry and Mayo county councils and Galway City Council. This is due to be completed in 2023 and, following this, Cork city and county councils are the remaining local authority areas to be revalued for the first time. The Valuation Office has endeavoured to progress the national revaluation programme in tandem with providing an effective revision service. In recent years, a backlog of revision cases has developed. The Valuation Office has taken steps to address this, including outsourcing revision work to a third-party provider. The outsourcing has supported the Valuation Office in its revision work. To eliminate the backlog of revision applications is an objective of the Valuation Office's strategic plan 2021-23. In the Valuation Office's oversight and delivery agreement with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, quarter 4 of 2022 is the target date for finalising plans to commence section 28(5). The Covid-19 pandemic has impacted on Valuation Office services, including revision services. There were periods during the pandemic when inspections of properties were not possible due to restrictions. Part of the national revaluation programme, now known as Reval 2023, was originally commenced with a valuation date of September 2019. On foot of the pandemic, the valuation date is set for 1 February 2022. This has necessitated the Valuation Office recalibrating its valuations for this revaluation. The Valuation Tribunal, an independent body set up for the purpose of hearing appeals against determinations of the Valuation Office, has increased the volume of appeals it is processing. In responding to the increased volume of appeals being processed, the Valuation Office has had to increase the resources applied to this task. The Valuation Office is mindful of the backlog of revision cases from local authorities and third parties. Measures to address this backlog effectively need to be in place before section 28(5) can be addressed. Options to address it continue to be considered and the Valuation Office will continue to engage with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to find a way to ultimately allow section 28(5) to be commenced and adhered to.

There is also the environmental waste of building new buildings. They contain all that embodied carbon and then for them to sit empty and not be put to use is hugely wasteful from an environmental point of view. Is addressing this something the Government is committed to? Are the Valuations Office and Tailte Éireann, when it is set up, going to be told to prioritise vacancy in these newer developments which has been going on for over a decade, partially because valuations have not taken place? I am sure that the Minister of State will agree that it is unacceptable to have vacancy and dereliction in the country at all, and to have it in newer developments where good buildings, facilities and infrastructure have been put in place is completely unacceptable. Will the Minister of State tell us that it is a priority for the Valuations Office now and that it will be a priority for Tailte Éireann?

I agree wholeheartedly. This is an issue not just in large urban centres but right across the country including in towns like my own of Kilkenny. Properties that have been built in very recent times are lying vacant and could be put to productive use. They could be readapted for housing or to manage the current refugee crisis. We really need to seize those opportunities. We are giving an assurance that this will go towards addressing that problem.
