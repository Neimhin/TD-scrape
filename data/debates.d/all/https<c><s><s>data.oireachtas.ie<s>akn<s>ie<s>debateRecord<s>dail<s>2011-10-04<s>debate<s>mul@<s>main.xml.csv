#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Direct negotiations between the two sides are the only way to achieve a comprehensive peace settlement in the Middle East.  The issues are complex and difficult, but they are not insoluble and an agreement is there to be had, if there is the political will on both sides.  The United States, under President Obama, with the support of the European Union and the Quartet, has worked over a long period to try to bring about the beginning of talks between the parties.  However, apart from a brief and abortive beginning in September 2010, their efforts have been frustrated.Last week the Quartet issued an important statement setting out a timetable for renewed talks.  This calls for a preparatory meeting between the two sides to take place within one month to agree to a timetable of not later than the end of 2012 to reach an agreement.  The parties will be expected to come forward within three months with comprehensive proposals on the initial issues of security and borders and to deal substantially with these within six months.  Other issues would be addressed as progress allowed.  This is a challenging timetable, but there is no reason it cannot be achieved if the parties genuinely wish to reach an agreement and are prepared to take the risks required.  In particular, Israel must be encouraged to see that its own best interests are not served by maintaining the short-term advantages of the status quo and the occupation.I very much hope we can convince the parties to engage on this basis.  It is particularly important that they create the right conditions for success by refraining from provocative actions, including further settlement expansion.  In this context, I condemn last week's announcement of 1,000 new dwellings being constructed in the east Jerusalem settlement of Gilo.  Ireland, both nationally and in the European Union, will do everything it can to support the relaunching of substantive peace talks.

There had been some speculation in the media on that occasion that he would perhaps depart from his speech on Ireland's traditional position in terms of the Middle East conflict.  I commend him for the position he took.  All parties in the House will be supportive of the work on which he will engage in the future.The Tánaiste quoted appropriately Martin Luther King in terms of the "fierce urgency of now".  In fairness, this is reflected in the response of the Quartet and the timescale set out.  Given the impediments and particular problems with Mr. Netanyahu, will the Tánaiste indicate whether he and his EU colleagues will engage collectively or bilaterally on the matter and whether it is envisaged that he or other EU foreign Ministers will meet Mr. Netanyahu directly to try to address the awful problem of the continued settlement expansion because therein lies the greatest difficulty?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Deputy for his support of the statement which I made on behalf of the country at the United Nations last week.  I also thank Deputy Mac Lochlainn, among other Deputies, for expressing support for that position.I am very conscious that the position I outlined at the UN General Assembly is a national one.  As Deputy Ó Fearghaíl indicated, this country has had a long-standing policy of supporting Palestinian statehood.  The resolution of the problem in the Middle East will only come about following discussions.The Quartet statement provides a timetable within which discussions would get under way within a month and then a period within which the issues of borders and security would be addressed, and it sets a definite date by which negotiations should be completed by the end of 2012.The High Representative of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Baroness Catherine Ashton, on behalf of the European Union, has been engaged with both sides in seeking to bring that forward.  There will be a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union next week and I expect that the issue will be discussed further at that stage.I intend to visit the Middle East at some stage.  I have not yet set exact dates for it but I will co-ordinate with Baroness Ashton about that so that the position of the European Union and its Foreign Ministers can be co-ordinated in the efforts that we make.

An active approach is required in this instance.  Given the trade relations between Israel and many EU member states, bilateral connectivity between the Governments of EU states and the Israeli Government could be helpful to bring all parties to the table as a matter of urgency.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I agree with that.  There is ongoing bilateral contact between European Union states and our own.  I have spoken directly with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Lieberman, about the issue and I intend to do that again.  When we are in a position to diary it, in particular, I intend to co-ordinate this with Baroness Ashton, to schedule a visit to the Middle East and to make our own direct involvement in the issue in order to help and facilitate moving talks forward.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The appalling situation in the Horn of Africa highlights the importance of planning longer-term solutions to the problem of hunger in developing countries.  This is exemplified by the effect of the crisis on Ethiopia and Somalia.  Somalia, which has been wracked by conflict for two decades, is reeling from the ravages of the drought.  Ethiopia, which has a stable Government and a strong relationship with the international community, is meeting the challenge head-on.While there are undoubtedly enormous humanitarian needs in Ethiopia, mechanisms to deal with the crisis are being deployed against a backdrop of relative peace, stability and high levels of Government co-ordination.  Ireland has played a role in building this resilience, as Ethiopia has been a priority country for Ireland's aid programme since 1994.  A clear example is our support to the productive safety net programme, which provides the vulnerable with predictable cash or food transfers in return for work on projects such as land rehabilitation.  This programme helps to protect the lives of more than 7 million people annually.  This year, the Government has allocated more than €32 million to Ethiopia.Kenya is not a priority country for Irish Aid but NGOs, missionaries and the UN system are working in longer-term development activities there and receive significant support from Ireland.  Based on 2010 expenditure we expect to provide more than €7 million in assistance in 2011.In addition, the Government has allocated more than €10 million in emergency support to the current crisis and has committed an additional €10 million before the end of 2012.  Funding decisions are based on the ability of partner agencies to address the most urgent needs, such as emergency feeding programmes which target the most vulnerable.  These allocations have also been informed by the recommendations of three field visits by Irish Aid officials to the region this year.

It is clear that the same environmental circumstances pertain to Ethiopia and Kenya, but they have not faced famine at this point.  What can Ireland do, as part of the international community, to address the food instability crisis as it pertains to Africa, particularly at times like this?  How do we deal with the commodity-based approach to vital crops that could save lives in these areas?  What can Ireland do as part of the European Union?  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade recommended that an EU envoy be sent to the region to address the political instability there.  It is being reported that the al-Shabab group, which has deterred those who are trying to provide aid and save lives, carried out a bombing in Mogadishu today.  How can we play a part in finding a solution?  How can we ensure these problems are not repeated in the future?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	7	We can raise our voices in all the international forums at which we are represented, including the foreign ministers' forum, which the Tánaiste attends, the development ministers' forum, which I attend, and the UN agencies.  We have consistently raised our voices at international level.  At the recent meeting of development ministers in Poland, I raised the need for a co-ordinated response from the European Union in this context.  We also have a presence through Irish non-governmental organisations on the ground.  It is difficult to get into Somalia with aid.  Agencies like Concern, Trócaire and the International Committee of the Red Cross have a long-term presence and local staff in Somalia.  We receive a great deal of information about what is happening on the ground through those agencies.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that we have to continue to use whatever opportunities we have in an international context, for example through the EU or the UN, to raise these issues and support any measures being taken to bring some kind of peace and stability to the area in question.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I commend the Government on its efforts to assist in meeting the $1.87 billion international target that has been set in the context of this immediate emergency.  I understand that we have committed more than €10 million and we have said we will commit a further €10 million.  We have met our responsibilities.  It appears to me that many of our international partners, including EU member states, have not met their responsibilities.  What is the current position in terms of meeting the targets I have mentioned?  Is the Government happy that its European and international partners have responded adequately?  Are we happy that the non-governmental organisations with which we are working have a long-term approach to dealing with the issues I raised in my initial question?  I will return to the question of aid effectiveness, which arises in this context.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I understand that a total of $1.8 billion has been contributed as part of the international response.  The UN has identified that a further $700 million will be required by the end of the year.  The Deputy is right to suggest that some countries, including Ireland, have had a strong response whereas many other countries have had a relatively weak response.  We need to continue to raise this issue at international level.  The Deputy's second question related to non-governmental organisations.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I asked whether we are happy that the non-governmental organisations and UN organisations we support — having looked at the list, I am satisfied they are of international repute — have a long-term approach to working on the ground and helping to overcome political instability.  We need to ensure agricultural matters are addressed, for example by providing bore holes.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	11	We are running out of time.

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	We are in ongoing discussions with those bodies to ensure such solutions are provided.  The very fact that they are among the small number of international non-governmental organisations that are actually allowed into parts of Somalia is an indication that they are there for the long haul.  They have been working there for a long time.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I welcome the adoption by the UN Security Council on 16 September of Resolution 2009.  This resolution reaffirmed that the United Nations should lead the efforts of the international community in supporting the Libyan-led transition and rebuilding process aimed at establishing a democratic, independent and united Libya.  It also established the United Nations Support Mission for Libya, UNSMIL.  UNSMIL's mandate is to assist Libyan national efforts in a range of areas, including the restoration of public security and order, the promotion of the rule of law, the restoration of public service and support for human rights.  Mr. Ian Martin has been appointed UN Special Representative and Head of UNSMIL.UNSMIL is a civilian mission and will largely be staffed by police, judicial and political experts.  It is expected that, at full strength, the mission will have a staff of about 60 persons.  Many of these are expected to be drawn from within the UN system itself.  I understand that, as a consequence, only a limited number of potential contributors have been approached.  To date, Ireland has not received a request to contribute to UNSMIL.  If such a request is received, it will be given careful consideration.In addition to the establishment of the new UNSMIL mission, UN Security Council Resolution 2009 also sends political messages to the new administration in Libya and modifies arrangements for the arms embargo, the asset freeze and the no-fly zone.  My Department continues to follow the situation in Libya closely.  In addition, Irish Aid has provided over €1.3 million in humanitarian assistance to Libya since the beginning of this year.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I would certainly welcome and fully support the move of the peoples of Libya for democracy but I do not believe the role of the UN and, in particular, NATO has done anything to further that aim.  I note the Tánaiste said we have not received a request as of yet but, clearly, he would be open to an Irish intervention if that was the case.  When one considers the role of the UN in the scenario in Libya to date, one would have to examine this.  In reality, what we have had is a cover under the guise of the need to protect civilians, a claim that was contradicted by Amnesty and Human Rights Watch.  There was a military intervention on one side of a civil war which went beyond the original objective of United Nations Resolution 1973——
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	16	A question, please.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The question is that this was the starting point of the international intervention under the guise of the UN.  Effectively, everything was left to NATO, which had troops on the ground and basically outsourced security and peacekeeping, funded the Transitional National Council and is now intervening to deal with the fallout.  It is not very democratic, particularly when a majority of the world's population opposed or abstained in regard to the original resolution to move into Libya.Will the Tánaiste comment on the question of whether, if this request comes back, it will be dealt with?  If the UN asks him, will he say "yes"?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	18	First, I disagree with Deputy Daly in respect of the role of the United Nations in regard to Libya.  This country has always argued that the United Nations should be at the centre, at the heart, of the actions taken by the international community, which was the case in this case.  Resolution 1973 was for the purpose of ensuring that civilian populations would be protected.  We can recall the way in which Gadaffi was attacking people in Misrata and, at an earlier stage, in Benghazi.The position now is that it is not intended the United Nations will have any military presence in Libya.  The presence that is intended by the UN is a civilian presence to support the establishment of democracy in Libya, the development of its public services and the rebuilding of the country after what has happened there.As I said, Ireland has not been requested as of yet to provide any assistance.  The type of request I would expect would be in the area of the provision of police, civil service experts, perhaps people from development agencies, such as Irish Aid, to develop humanitarian aid and perhaps in regard to infrastructural rebuilding.  If we receive such a request, we will consider it very favourably, but no request has yet come.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Despite what the Tánaiste says, the UN was not at the centre of operations.  In reality, it stood back and allowed NATO call the shots.  The Tánaiste has again reiterated there would be no military presence.  We were told this all during the situation yet everybody knows that special forces from the US, France and Britain were actively on the ground in contravention of the UN resolution.  The point is they facilitated regime change in a country that has the biggest oil reserves in Africa.  Clearly what is designed here is not assistance to develop democracy in Libya but to move in on that country's vital resources, including oil and water, and potentially one also will see a US military base on that continent.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	20	During the course of the week I was at the United Nations in New York, I attended a high-level meeting on Libya on 20 September.  I have heard what the National Transitional Council and its representatives have had to say, which is it is the council's intention to build a democratic state in Libya.  It will be supported in that effort by the United Nations and Ireland will in turn support the UN.  Under resolution 2009, the United Nations has been given the lead role in post-conflict Libya and Ireland will play its part, either directly or through its participation in the European Union.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Government came into office with an explicit commitment to restore Ireland's standing as a respected and influential member of the European Union.  Members of the Government are availing of opportunities to meet their EU colleagues, as well as representatives of the European institutions, to underline the Government's constructive engagement with the European agenda and to ensure close working relationships at political level across the Union.Since taking office six months ago, I have attended a number of EU ministerial meetings and at this stage have had the opportunity to exchange views on the key issues on the EU agenda with all my EU colleagues.  These contacts are critical in conveying and ensuring a good understanding of our objectives and interests and of positions we are taking on EU and international issues.I have had, on the one hand, formal bilateral meetings with a number of counterparts and on the other, a wide range of informal discussions in a variety of fora.  In April, for example, I met with my counterparts from Luxembourg and Finland on the margins of the General Affairs Council meeting of 13 April.In May, I met the United Kingdom's Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, William Hague, in London.  During the Queen's visit to Ireland, I had the opportunity of further meetings with Foreign Secretary Hague.  I also in May had a detailed exchange of views with the French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppé.  Our discussion focused on issues on the international agenda, including the Middle East peace process and the events of the Arab spring, as well as economic issues.In July, I met the German Foreign Minister, Guido Westerwelle, for bilateral consultations in Berlin.  The focus of our discussion was on economic issues and we also addressed international issues including the Middle East and the Arab spring.  I have also had extensive bilateral contact with my Lithuanian colleague, Audronius Azubalis, and with the Lithuanian Prime Minister, Andrius Kubilius, on issues related to Ireland's forthcoming chairmanship of the OSCE, as well as the EU Presidency responsibilities which we both will assume in 2013.Last week, I had bilateral discussions with individual EU counterparts at a number of events we attended together on the margins of the UN General Assembly opening week in New York.  These events included the ministerial breakfast on mediation on 20 September, which also was attended by the Finnish, Belgian and Swedish Foreign Ministers, the high level meeting on Libya and the traditional EU-Russia and EU-US meetings.The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, has also had a substantial number of bilateral meetings at EU level, including with the secretaries general of the Commission and the Council and the President of the European Parliament, as well as with British, French, German, Polish, Bulgarian, Slovak and Greek counterparts.

He raised this issue himself last July when he referred to a meeting he had held with Mr. Alain Juppé.  I tabled a question in the context of the clear need to have a carefully planned programme of engagement in respect of both Ireland's EU-IMF programme and the Tánaiste's responsibilities with regard to trade.  I suggest that what the Tánaiste has set out for Members today constitutes a disappointing level of bilateral engagement.  The Tánaiste's reply indicates there were at most six formal bilateral meetings.  As far greater activity is required, does the Tánaiste have in place a plan to have a comprehensive level of bilateral engagement both on the EU-IMF programme and with regard to his highly specific and important responsibilities in the area of trade promotion?  What seems like two informal engagements with Mr. William Hague, Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, of our major trading partner, appears to be an inadequate response to the challenges facing us.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	23	As I stated, I have met all my EU colleagues.  Some of these meetings have been formal, bells and whistles, bilateral meetings, while some have been discussions on the margins of EU Foreign Affairs and General Affairs Council meetings and various UN and OSC meetings, to which there has been a number of objectives.  In the period leading up to our renegotiations with the European Union and the IMF it was clearly important to brief all the Foreign Ministers on Ireland's objectives and, in particular, to discuss directly with them the issues and difficulties surrounding the reduction in our interest rate.  There were also requests from other countries in respect of our corporation tax regime.  The bilateral meetings I held with the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Juppé, and the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Westerwelle, in particular, were focused on the reduction in the interest rate and the issue of the corporation tax rate.  As the Deputy knows, we have now secured a reduction in the interest rate and at the same time retained our rate of corporation tax.Regarding my meetings with the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Hague, I remind the Deputy that in the course of the British Queen's visit to Ireland we established a British-Irish chambers of commerce for the first time, formalising the trade relationship between Britain and Ireland.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Public support and engagement are essential for the successful delivery of the Government's aid programme which is managed by Irish Aid in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The principles that guide the programme are set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid.  Transparency and public ownership are central.  They ensure our assistance delivers clear results in the lives of poor people and communities and makes a practical contribution to the fight against global poverty and hunger.  They ensure a focus on the poorest communities in some of the world's poorest countries, the building of strong partnerships, and effective and efficient use of resources.  That is why Ireland is recognised internationally as a leader in making aid more effective.The oversight provided by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Committee of Public Accounts is extremely important in this regard, as is the role played by the independent Irish Aid expert advisory group.  Irish Aid has in place comprehensive systems of appraisal, monitoring, audit and evaluation to ensure funds are spent effectively and benefit the most vulnerable people.It is essential that the public can engage actively with the aid programme and have easy access to clear information on its priorities and programmes.  The Irish Aid annual report which I launched recently at the Irish Aid volunteering and information centre provides full details on the programme's activities and expenditure and the practical results being achieved.We are undertaking a review of the White Paper on Irish Aid.  This will involve wide consultation with the public and interested organisations at home and in our partner countries.  I look forward to strong public participation in this process which will result in a clear set of priorities for the future direction of the programme.

In these times when so many of our people are struggling to cope with the austerity measures more than ever we need to demonstrate that Irish Aid is effective in getting aid to those who need it the most.  This is a very important area for Ireland, one in which we have an extremely strong international reputation.  We inherit a very honourable legacy which we need to protect.  We need to maintain this and ensure we meet the millennium development goal of achieving a figure of 0.7% of GDP by 2015 which will be a big project ahead.  AWEPA has referred to the issue of parliamentary oversight in the donor and recipient countries to ensure there is full parliamentary oversight of the money from when it is donated to when it is spent.  The money can clearly be tracked all the way through.  Does the Minister of State envisage parliaments having a critical role in showing that the money is getting to those who need it most?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	The public consultation process will mainly take place in the early part of next year.  I would certainly welcome any suggestions on how we can make sure the process is as inclusive as possible.  If there are any suggestions from Deputies on the other side of the House, we would be very glad to take them on board, because we want to make sure this engages the Irish public.  The Deputy is right.  It is a lot of money at a time of austerity in this country, so we want to make sure people know exactly how the money is spent.In respect of the Deputy's suggestion on AWEPA and parliamentary oversight, I presume he is talking about parliamentary oversight within our programme countries.

We already provide support for the strengthening of parliamentary systems and the various other civil society systems in our programme countries to ensure there is public participation.  I would be happy to strengthen that in whatever way we can, including parliamentary oversight, and we would be happy to engage with our partner countries in that area.

Is there room for conditionality on aid?  This would mean the programme countries clearly meet acceptable international criteria on human rights.  We are playing an important and constructive role in aid for Malawi, but there are significant concerns about human rights in that country at the moment.  That is just one of many examples I could give.  Does the Minister of State agree that we need conditionality?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	30	We raise human rights issues constantly with our partner countries, either through Irish Aid officials or through Ministers and Ministers of State who visit, including myself.  We will continue to do that.  If we were to withdraw all our funding from a particular country due to human rights issues, then we would be depriving the poorest of the poor people in those countries.  We need to make sure we know exactly where our money is going and if necessary, shift it into particular areas to ensure we have full oversight.  We are constantly watching how we spend it.  A big part of this is to ensure that how the money is spent is absolutely transparent.  As we have a lot of influence in these countries due to our development programmes, we genuinely can influence change for the better and we have done this in many human rights areas.  However, I would not be in favour of suddenly pulling out of a country completely, because that has a devastating effect on the most vulnerable people.

The strategy is titled Ireland and Africa; Our Partnership with a Changing Continent.  It was launched at the first ever Africa — Ireland economic forum, which was organised by the Department in partnership with the UCD Michael Smurfit Graduate Business School and the African ambassadors accredited to Ireland.  I was very pleased to open the event, which was attended by a large number of Irish business representatives, diplomats, NGOs and academics.The elaboration of the strategy involved a series of consultations within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, with other Departments and agencies, and with private sector and civil society representatives.  Its objective is to ensure a more co-ordinated and coherent approach to our relations with Africa — political, development, economic and trade promotion — at the bilateral level and in the context of our membership of the European Union, the United Nations and other international bodies.  There is a particular focus on enhancing the capacity of Ireland's embassy network in Africa to support the work of State agencies, including Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia.The strategy builds on the relationships established over many years by Ireland's development assistance programme, which is recognised internationally for its strong focus on the fight against poverty and hunger and for its concentration on the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  This will be maintained.  However, the strategy seeks to respond comprehensively to the realities of a changing continent in which economic growth is beginning to open up new opportunities for economic development.I presented the strategy at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade on 28 September.  There are no specific plans for a debate in the House at this stage.  However, I look forward to continuing to consult closely with the joint committee as the Department moves ahead with implementation of the Africa strategy.

While an interesting and worthwhile debate was held in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, it would be useful to discuss these important matters on the floor of the House, not least given the challenges the Tánaiste and Minister of State will face in protecting and maintaining the current, necessary level of overseas development aid.On our role in Europe, has the Minister of State discussed with her counterparts in the European Union how we can collectively move to protect the level of overseas development aid in these difficult times?  Has she found a means of challenging wealthier but much less generous member states to increase their contribution to development aid in order that it is on a par with the contribution of citizens of this State who are highly committed to this issue?It was a great achievement to publish the Africa strategy initiated by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Martin.  It is very positive and a recognition of the potential Africa offers that 140 Irish companies were represented at the strategy's launch.  Does the Minister of State agree that it was also positive that none other than Mr. Gay Mitchell, one of the presidential candidates, highlighted this issue today as one of his objectives in the event that he is elected President?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Deputy's suggestion that we have a debate in the Chamber is a good one.  I will speak to the Government Whip to try to arrange a time for such a discussion as the more engagement Members have on the strategy, the better.On ensuring the development programme is supported in all other European countries, this issue was debated at one of the meetings of development ministers when one of my counterparts read out the figures on the percentage of GDP member states allocate to overseas development aid.  Ireland was commended on being in the top group, having reached a figure in excess of 0.5% of GDP.  The naming and shaming at the meeting did not go down well with all the ministers present.  It is appropriate, however, that we constantly highlight and apply pressure on this issue, although I accept it is more difficult for some countries than others.I concur with Deputy Ó Fearghaíl on the importance of the strategy and the attendance at the launch was very strong.  Africa is experiencing growth rates of more than 5% and these are likely to increase.  The continent is changing rapidly, with the number of people living in cities also increasing.  While we must continue with our development programme, African countries and Ireland could benefit from the trading opportunities that are available.

At headquarters level and through our embassy network we work closely with the IDA, which is tasked with the attraction and development of foreign investment in Ireland.  We also work with Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland to assist Irish companies to access markets in a number of practical ways.  Our embassies provide local commercial information and raise specific issues with foreign governments, where appropriate.  Priority markets for Ireland in established and emerging economies have been identified under the trading and investing in a smart economy strategy.  The Export Trade Council, which met last week for the first time under my chairmanship, will keep the list of priority markets under review as well as opportunities in new markets as they emerge.  It will also oversee the programme of trade missions.Economic and trade issues will be a key element of the global Irish economic forum meeting later this week.  They are also a priority for my visits to Japan and Korea next week and to Moscow in early November when I will co-chair a meeting of the joint economic commission between Ireland and Russia.  My colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development will shortly lead trade missions to Saudi Arabia, Qatar and South Africa.The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has lead responsibility for trade policy and represents Ireland on EU committees which deal with tariff and non-tariff barriers to European produce.

Have any issues been identified as obstacles to the expansion of our trade and the establishment of new markets and, if so, to what extent have they been isolated with a view to our addressing them?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Yes.  The new Export Trade Council brings together all Departments and State agencies involved in trade and export activity and representatives of the private sector.  Last week at a meeting of the council we discussed some of the challenges facing Irish exporters and those engaged in trade.  They include, for example, language education, a matter we intend to address further.  Issues also raised with us involve the necessity for greater co-ordination between State agencies and our Embassy network.  Our embassies and ambassadors will take the lead role in co-ordinating the work of the various agencies involved in order that there will be a co-ordinated single Irish approach to the expansion of trade and the attraction of investment to Ireland.

However, I will add a caveat.  When we are a party to free trade agreements, we need to ensure the natural resources of a developing country are not handed over to private enterprise in exchange for its participation in our markets.  In recent decades there have been bad experiences, to say the least, with these agreements.  How do we protect the long-term interests of the developing countries that engage with us?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The first way of doing so is to adopt a position of respect in working with the governments of developing countries, respecting their sovereignty and wishes.  We must take our lead from the governments of those countries of which we are partners as to how they wish to manage their natural resources and other matters.  Human rights are also a very important dimension, of which we are very conscious in the trade engagements we have with other countries.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The cost base and the issue of competitiveness are very much at the heart of Government policy.  As a country we must be competitive.  The Deputy will acknowledge that there have been significant improvements in Ireland's competitiveness in recent times which are reflected in the improved position of our exports.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The millennium development goals, MDGs, were adopted by world leaders at the United Nations in 2000.  They set out specific targets for reducing global poverty, hunger, disease and inequality, and provide the framework for international development up to 2015.  The planned MDG special event in 2013 is part of an ongoing process of review and assessment of their implementation.  It will build on the MDG review summit held last year in New York.The millennium development goals are at the heart of Ireland's aid programme and our development policy.  We have been working internationally to ensure international development policy remains focused on their achievement.  Last month in New York I met the heads of the main UN agencies and reviewed progress, looking ahead to the UN events in 2013 and 2015.  Ireland has played a strong role throughout the MDG process to ensure the focus has remained on the poorest and most vulnerable populations, and especially on the continuing global hunger crisis.  This will continue to be our priority in the run-up to the 2015 deadline and beyond.The United Nations conference on sustainable development will take place in Rio de Janeiro in June 2012.  The key objectives will be to secure a renewed political commitment to sustainable development, assess progress on the implementation of the outcomes of previous summits, and address new and emerging global challenges.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is co-ordinating Ireland's preparations for the conference and Irish Aid is engaging actively on the international development dimension.  The Department has begun a stakeholder consultation process and will organise a public seminar in October.  It is also preparing a revised national sustainable development strategy which is expected to be published for public consultation later this year.

Concerns have arisen in this regard because if one considers the figures, one can see that Ireland's contribution reached a peak of €769 million in 2008.  This was almost 0.6% of GDP, which meant we were moving close to our target.  In the interim, however, there has been a significant reduction — a couple of hundred million euro — in the level of our contribution to 0.52%.  This represents a decline of almost 0.1% and means that we are moving in the wrong direction.  What is the Department's strategy to ensure we might begin, in the context of the forthcoming budget, to move in the right direction again and seek to honour our commitment?
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	As the Deputy is aware, the programme for Government states that Ireland is committed to reaching the target of 0.7% of GDP.  All the countries which signed up to the agreement aspire to this goal and we are working very hard to reach it.  I acknowledge that there has been a reduction of approximately 30% in the level of our contribution in recent years and that the figure currently stands at 0.52% of GDP.  While obviously I cannot inform the Deputy with regard to what is going to be in the budget, he will be aware of what is contained in the programme for Government.  As Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development, I am fighting hard to ensure we get back on the right track.  There is no doubt we will face a challenge in this regard, especially in light of our current economic circumstances.  We are doing everything possible to ensure we get matters back on an even keel and proceed to increase the level of our contribution.

I wish to make a suggestion in that regard.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	46	It would be better if the Deputy asked a question.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The matter to which I wish to refer relates to the Irish Aid budget.  Compared with its counterparts in many other European states, Irish Aid has been very effective in delivering value for money and doing great work in the countries in which it is involved.  Would the Minister of State consider establishing a permanent exhibition of the work of Irish Aid and housing it at the Irish National Famine Museum in Strokestown Park House?  Doing this would provide a very good tie-in between what happened in this country in the past and what we are doing to ensure the events which occurred here will not be replicated anywhere else in the world?

#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	An event which links our development work with the Famine is due to take place shortly.  The Minister for Arts, Heritage and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Deenihan, is taking the lead in respect of that event, at which I will be delivering an address.  There is a strong folk memory of the Famine and that is why there is such support for our programme across the political parties and among members of the public.  A recent opinion poll indicated that despite the difficult circumstances, 80% of people are supportive of the amount of money we are spending on the overseas development programme.  I presume we would have to engage with the people who run the Irish National Famine Museum in respect of the Deputy's suggestion, which is certainly worth considering.As Deputy Naughten is aware, information relating to this matter is available at the Irish Aid volunteering and public information centre on O'Connell Street in Dublin.  The Deputy is correct in that we must constantly engage with the public on the quality of the work we are doing.  On Monday I met the representatives of the OECD carrying out the mid-term review.  The compliments on Ireland's programme are very strong and we are seen as a world leader because of the effectiveness of our programme.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, at a major event focusing on world hunger which was attended by hundreds of people from all over the world.  Although we are seen as a world leader in this respect, the Deputy is correct that we must ensure the public is aware of the issue.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Irish embassies worldwide perform a wide range of functions in support of Ireland's national interests.  Since taking office, I have directed that all embassies and consulates should redouble their efforts in promoting trade, supporting Irish business and seeking out new markets.  In practical terms, this means embassies are actively promoting an awareness of Ireland and its business potential; assisting Irish companies in gaining and maintaining access for their goods and services; reporting on economic and business trends and developments; assisting in the resolution of problematic regulatory issues; maintaining a network of high level business related contacts; and providing assistance and support for other Departments, agencies and, as appropriate, individual companies.  Despite the modest scale of our network and the small size of our embassies, this is something we have been successful at and will continue to prioritise.Underpinning this approach, my Department is focused on progressively implementing, with other Departments and State agencies, the recommendations made in the strategy and action plan for Irish trade, tourism and investment to 2015.  A thorough analysis, conducted last year, of the potential for Ireland in terms of markets and sectors identified a number of priority markets.  These are in both established and emerging economies.  There is already an embassy in each of the priority markets identified in the strategy and ambassadors at these locations chair local trade, tourism and investment teams.  With the active participation of the relevant State agencies, these teams have prepared annual market development plans to support our trade objectives.

Specifically, will the Tánaiste indicate if within our embassies there is a strategic plan for the promotion of trade and tourism?  It is all very well to have an idea that we should be out there, but unless we work to a very specific and appropriate plan, we will get nowhere.  How many new diplomatic missions are envisaged or planned in the context of the need to aggressively promote ourselves in the trade sector?  How many missions are without an ambassador?  For example, we are without an ambassador in Australia.  How long, on average, does it take to replace somebody when he or she retires or leaves a post?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	53	It is important to state the total number of embassies is 76, with most of our missions having three diplomatic staff or fewer.  Seven missions have one diplomat.  In talking about a strategic plan, in most of our embassies it is to multi-task and perform a range of functions.  These include consular activity, intergovernmental work and leading the trade effort.In dealing with the trade effort the embassies lead a market team, involving agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Bord Bia and Tourism Ireland.  This team, in turn, feeds into the work of the Export Trade Council which co-ordinates activity across all Government agencies.  The council is chaired by me and other ministerial colleagues.  Four embassies have vacancies.  We are looking at the embassy network in the context of the comprehensive spending review.  I intend to bring proposals to the Government shortly in respect of the ambassadorial posts to be filled.

I do not want to be evasive on the matter.  The post has been vacant since August.  Normally the filling of an ambassadorial post takes time for a variety of reasons, including the movement of individuals from one place to another.  I intend to bring proposals to the Government shortly in respect of the ambassadorial posts to be filled.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50, 96 and 108 together.Addressing the position of the undocumented Irish and reforming our migration arrangements with the United States remain important priorities for the Government in its relationship with the US Administration and Congress.  The Taoiseach and I discussed these issues with President Obama when we met him on 23 May in Dublin.  Responding to our concerns, the US President expressed his interest in achieving progress.I also discussed the issue of Irish immigration with the Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and Senator Patrick Leahy, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, when I met him in Dublin on 3 June.  I met representatives of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform and the Coalition of Irish Centres in New York on 23 September.  The Government has provided almost $365,000 to support that organisation since 2006, including $40,000 this year.  Acting on my behalf, our embassy in Washington DC continues to engage on an ongoing basis with the US Administration at various levels and with both parties in the US Congress.The introduction of a new comprehensive immigration reform Bill in the Senate on 22 June last was a welcome development.  This Bill which has been brought forward by senior Democrats, including Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer and Robert Menendez, is similar to that introduced in the previous Congress and, once again, includes provision for a new E-3 visa for Ireland.  Senator Menendez has indicated that in circulating the Bill he aimed to provide a framework for debate and negotiations.  The continued inclusion of the E-3 visa for Ireland in the Bill represents an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.The successful passage of E-3 visa legislation would strengthen the human bridge between the two countries, which underpins our excellent existing bilateral relations, and provide a mechanism for Irish nationals seeking to work in the USA in the future.  While we continue to press for such a scheme, including with Members of Congress, any efforts to pass immigration-related legislation in the current US domestic political climate would, however, face considerable challenges.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I am also conscious that the E-3 visa would not provide a solution for the difficulties faced by the undocumented Irish in the United States and their families in Ireland.  The nature of their status means that it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate for the number of undocumented.  My Department, particularly the embassy in Washington, and I will continue to work actively on highlighting the situation of the undocumented Irish in the United States in our contacts with the US Administration, Congressional leaders and Irish immigration reform advocates, and work towards identifying positive outcomes on their behalf.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	I thank the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade for his response and especially for the work he is doing on this issue.  Anybody from the west would have a significant interest in it.  From the discussions, what are the prospects of the Bill brought forward by Senators Reid, Schumer and Menendez making progress in the US Senate?  I know there is an upcoming election cycle in the United States which always taints the view, but is there a realistic chance that it will make progress in the current climate?There was mention of reforming migration arrangements with the United States.  Has any consideration been given to establishing a bilateral agreement with the United States under which we could deal with US citizens who are undocumented in Ireland?  There would be reciprocity by dealing specifically with Irish citizens who are undocumented in the United States.  The scale may be different, but the issue is equally as important for US citizens who are undocumented in this country.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank the Deputy for his kind remarks.I understand and sympathise with the plight of people who find themselves undocumented in the United States and are unable to return home for funerals and for other family contacts.  It is a very difficult situation.  We are optimistic that the legislation will be introduced, and obviously we must work with the promoters of the legislation to ensure the E-3 provision is included.  Our embassy in Washington is very much engaged with that.On the wider issue of immigration reform in the US, there has been talk for some time about comprehensive immigration reform, but it is probably fair to point out that the prospects of such reform are remote.  In the meantime, we are examining every other option.  I recently had direct discussions on this with our ambassador in Washington.  We discussed a range of options that must be considered and should, perhaps, be progressed, or at least explored, to see whether we can make some progress to the benefit of the undocumented and Irish people currently in the US.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	Will the Tánaiste consider that type of reciprocal arrangement, which might get around the difficulties that naturally exist on Capitol Hill?  What work is the Irish Embassy in the United States doing in terms of effective lobbying of the Senate to ensure this Bill makes progress in the upper house?  My understanding is that there has been criticism in the past to the effect that while a great deal of work is being done at governmental level, the Irish have not been as effective as they should be at lobbying level.  Given how the US system works, it is imperative this aspect is not ignored.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	There is no embassy in Washington more effective at lobbying Capitol Hill and the American political system than the Irish Embassy.  We have had outstanding service there over the years from our ambassadors and diplomats, including those currently serving there.  They miss no opportunity to lobby on this issue and this country's other issues.In respect of the reciprocal arrangement mentioned by the Deputy, we are examining every option, including reciprocal arrangements.  When one is dealing with immigration issues in the United States, there is always a sense that what is achieved by one country in respect of immigration concessions is then sought by other countries.  We must bear in mind that what one country is doing is always watched by another country.  Nevertheless, we are exploring every possible opportunity.  Our embassy in Washington has been hugely active on this but in addition to that work, if necessary, I will engage in some of that directly.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Ireland's trade relations with Turkey are good and levels of trade are increasing.  In 2010, Turkey was Ireland's 22nd largest merchandise trading partner, with the bilateral merchandise trade valued at €685 million.  This represented an increase of 8% on 2009 figures.  Figures for the first six months of this year show a 16% rise in merchandise trade over the same period last year.  The Embassy of Ireland in Ankara plays a very active role in supporting Enterprise Ireland's work to identify opportunities for the growth of Irish companies in Turkey.  EI client companies report a 61% rise in exports to Turkey from 2009 to 2010.Turkey is a significant economic regional power with a population of 79 million people.  As a candidate country, Turkey's trade with the EU is significant and growing.  Its membership of the EU would potentially generate significant gains for Ireland due to the increased size of the Single Market and the trade opportunities for Irish companies which would flow from accession.  Obstacles which can hinder the development of trade relations can take the form of both tariff and non-tariff barriers.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade works closely with the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has lead responsibility for trade policy and represents Ireland on a number of EU committees which discuss both tariff and non-tariff barriers in the context of ongoing EU free trade negotiations.

Certainly, trade relations are improving rapidly and we must be pleased with a 16% increase in the current year.  However, I have a concern.  I regret that the Minister of State, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, is not present as I raised this matter previously when she was present.  She is currently hosting on her personal website critical comments about Turkey and its application for accession to the EU.  One of her statements is that the Irish people are horrified by the prospect of Turkey's accession.  I do not believe that statement represents the true position of either the Irish Government or the Irish people.  While we are all conscious of the need to manage carefully the accession of a country with 79 million people, it is not helpful to the endeavour in which the Tánaiste and the Minister of State are involved to have one of their colleagues hosting this type of very critical comment on the World Wide Web.  I ask them to engage with their colleague, who is a person I respect, and ask her to remove a statement that is offensive both to Turkish people living in this country and to people who wish to do business with this country.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, had a family bereavement at the weekend.  That is the reason she is not present today.  I am aware of the statement she made in April 2010, but she was an Opposition Deputy at the time.  The Government's position is consistent with that of previous Governments, which is that it supports Turkey's candidacy for EU membership.  Progress on this requires that established criteria are met.  Progress on its EU membership is quite slow and is likely to take a number of years.  It has been stalled over recent months.  A number of areas must be addressed, including human rights issues.  Ireland's official position is that it supports accession when and if that becomes appropriate.

I was not aware of her bereavement.  None the less, the point stands, and I again ask the Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, to use her influence.  I presume we cannot prevail on the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, to change her views but I am not sure it is incumbent on her to broadcast them on the World Wide Web.  Given that she holds the position of Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, it is highly inappropriate that such views should be broadcast, especially when they are not in accordance with the view of both the Irish people or the Irish Government.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I have consistently made clear, including in my address to the UN General Assembly last week, that the Government opposes Israel's illegal settlement of occupied Palestinian territory and that we want an immediate halt to such activity.  This policy is stated at every opportunity, both directly with the Israeli authorities, in international fora and in discussions at EU level.  The illegal Israeli settlements are a key driver of the unresolved Arab-Israeli conflict.The expansion of settlements inherently involves the seizure of Palestinian lands, destruction of homes and eviction of families, and the exclusion of farmers from their fields.  The network of checkpoints and closed roads that bedevil the lives of Palestinians in the occupied territories exists primarily not to ensure the security of Israel, but the security of the settlements.  Violence by settlers against Palestinians is increasing and is largely ignored by the military authorities.  The whole settlement enterprise sends a clear message that there is one law for Israelis and another for Palestinians.The settlements also constitute, and are intended to constitute, an obstacle to the achievement of a comprehensive peace.  If the settlements had not been put in place, the way to a comprehensive peace agreement between Israel, the Palestinians and the Arab world would now be clear and that such an agreement would be readily achievable.  I am firmly of the view that a reinstatement of the settlement construction freeze, which ended last September, would be a major confidence building measure that could enable direct negotiations to resume.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I commend the Tánaiste on standing by this in America last week.  Surely, he must be as disappointed as I am that President Obama has failed to deliver.  Sadly, during his three years in power, Mr. Netanyhu has given him the run around and there has been no progress in the Middle East and his international record will not look great.  Obviously, he is now much more interested in trying to get re-elected and in cosying up to the Israeli vote rather than making decisions in the best interests of the Palestinian people who are getting a pretty raw deal.I refer to the decision to give the go ahead for more than 1,000 units in Gilo in East Jerusalem.  This was only days after the Quartet asked that both sides avoid provocative actions so that the peace talks could get under way soon.  What Israel did in the days after the UN meeting was a slap in the face for the quartet.  Would the Tánaiste consider speaking to the Israeli ambassador about this issue?  We know that as long as the settlements continue, there will be no appetite for peace.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	President Obama is a very good friend of Ireland.  This country has very warm and close relations with the United States which we will continue.  President Obama will state his country's position on international issues at the UN, just as I stated Ireland's position on this issue.  In respect of the expansion of the settlements, I said in reply to an earlier question that we strongly condemn the decision to go ahead with the 1,000 household settlement plan in Gilo in East Jerusalem.  I agree with the Deputy that coming directly after the quartet statement, it was not a very good signal on whether progress can be made.I remind the Deputy that the quartet statement is an agreed one between all the members, namely, the United States, Russia, the European Union and the UN, and it sets down a timetable.  It also sets down very clearly that provocative and pre-emptive actions should not be engaged in, and I agree with that.  My colleagues in the European Union, High Representative Baroness Catherine Ashton and I will focus on how we can make that quartet statement become a reality, get negotiations going and try to get a settlement.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I do not disagree with the Tánaiste that President Obama may be a friend of Ireland but it does not change the fact that his international reputation will be seen as one of impotence and incompetence.  I would still like the Tánaiste to have a chat with the Israeli ambassador and point out in black and white that its stance is completely outrageous.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	On several occasions since I came into office, I have spoken to the Israeli ambassador and representatives of the Israeli Government.  I have also spoken to its Foreign Minister Mr. Lieberman.  He and I were to have met at the UN General Assembly but there were changes on the Israeli side to that arrangement and the meeting did not take place.  It is fair to say the Israeli Government is in no doubt as to where Ireland stands on this issue and on the continued expansion of the settlements.  We will continue to use every opportunity to repeat and reinforce that.

He must be aware that the inconsistency of the international community in implementing UN resolutions in regard to illegal settlements and the profoundly provocative actions by the Israeli state will cause a big problem in the context of the Arab spring and Egypt.  I have no doubt Syria will move towards democracy in the near future.  What will happen is that more assertive representatives of the Arab people in those countries will emerge and they will not tolerate the continued approach of the international community.  This is urgent.What will be the European consensus in addressing this question and in ensuring the Israelis cease constructing illegal settlements, comply with UN resolutions and immediately engage in an honourable settlement with the Palestinian people to stabilise the situation in that critical fault line in terms of global conflict?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	I refer to my approach to this issue in the European Union context.  There are domestic and political considerations which influence the way the United State responds to this issue and the way it engages with it, and I think Deputy Wallace referred to this.  Therefore, the European Union has a particular role to play in seeking to make progress.  There is a framework around the quartet statement which the US, Russia, the UN and the European Union developed and put forward.  The approach I will take is to encourage European Union colleagues and High Representative Ashton to take that forward.  I will play whatever role I can on behalf of this country — a country with a long-standing record on this issue — in the EU Foreign Affairs Council and with European Union colleagues to support European Union efforts on this issue and to try to make progress towards talks.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The Select Sub-Committee on Finance has completed its consideration of the Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution) (No. 2) Bill 2011 and has made amendments thereto.The Select Sub-Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine has completed its consideration of the Welfare of Greyhounds Bill 2011 and has made amendments thereto.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I ask the Taoiseach to be up-front with the Dáil and the people about a very fundamental issue.  I was very surprised last week when it emerged, and was confirmed, that the publication of the comprehensive spending review would be held back until after completion of the budgetary and Estimates process.  The Taoiseach said the Minister would not publish it.In opposition, Fine Gael and the Labour Party waxed lyrical about an open and a transparent process on the budget.  This is certainly not the case now.  Each Department supplied the required information as early as last June and memos were circulated in July.  The Taoiseach knows what is likely to be proposed.  Will he tell us now and not one week after the elections on 27 October?  The Taoiseach and his Ministers have repeatedly claimed they have revolutionised strategic planning in government.  If they cannot even give us dates as to when decisions will be taken, how can we seriously believe this?By law, the Taoiseach must propose spending figures well in advance of the budget and these must be voted on by the House.  There are only weeks available for this to be done.  If the Taoiseach will not publish anything and will not even say when basic information will be provided, the only implication to be drawn is that he is keeping the information hidden until after 27 October.This issue is to be added to the list of broken election promises.  The Government is delaying the publication of the comprehensive spending review when it knows, as we do, that essentially the work was completed by July.  The Taoiseach has had the material from the Departments for three months and has had detailed reports for two months, so why is there a delay in publishing the comprehensive spending review?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The answer to the Deputy's question is that it has not yet been completed.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has asked every Minister to carry out an analysis of every section of his or her Department and report to him on the spending of public moneys and taxpayer's money which, as the Deputy will be aware, was obscenely wasted in many instances.  The Minister has not completed his public expenditure review, but he will have the information to hand when it is completed.  There are more than two months to budget day and the process is in train.  The pre-budget outlook will be available, while a three year fiscal plan will be published.  The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance will hold detailed discussions with every other Minister on what is submitted.  The Deputy will have plenty of information to digest and discuss in due course.  He has asked what is causing the delay in the publication of information on the comprehensive public expenditure review.  It has not yet been completed.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Last week the Taoiseach stated in the House that it was almost complete.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	He also noted that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, had stated it would be held back until after the budgetary and Estimates process had been completed.  Let us not try to engage in sleight of hand.  The Taoiseach knows that what I am getting at is the deliberate delay in publishing the comprehensive spending review because of the presidential election.  The people are facing choices.  The last Government published comprehensive spending reviews well in advance of the budget or the publication of any three year plan.  It published them in isolation in order that the people would see the spending choices being put before them and to allow for a genuine debate in this House about the priorities and areas that should be protected such as the numbers of special needs assistants and class sizes.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Deputy has made the charge that information emerging from the public expenditure review is being held back because of the presidential election.  That is absolute and utter nonsense.  Given the complexity of conducting a detailed expenditure review of public moneys in every section of every Department, it is not something that can be done overnight.  The Deputy will also be aware that the memorandum of understanding signed by the previous Government requires us to produce a timeline for complex legislation.  This has taken up a considerable amount of Government time.  His question is why are we not publishing the comprehensive review.  The answer is that it has not been completed.

Mar is gnách, áfach, bhris sé an gealltanas sin díreach ar an nós céanna le gealltanais eile.  It is disgraceful that nearly €300,000 of taxpayers' money is being spent on employing constituency workers in his office.  On taking office, he spoke about the need for leadership to be shown by those who held high office in the public sector.  With great hullabaloo and as a sign of his Government's commitment to sharing the people's pain, he introduced a pay cap of €92,000 for special advisers.  Why are two of the special advisers employed in his Department earning a salary of €168,000, nearly five times the average industrial wage?  How did he manage to circumvent his own publicly stated pay cap for special advisers?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	114	The Taoiseach's private office had 12 staff in 2009 and now has 11.  The cost in 2009 was €627,473 and is now €574,000.  The Taoiseach's constituency office had a staff of seven and now has five.  The Chief Whip's private office had four staff and now has four, while the constituency office had four staff and now has three.  The private office of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for European affairs had three staff and now has two.  These salaries have been agreed and are far below the level that obtained previously.  I indicated that there would be reductions both in terms of numbers and overall costs.  I can forward to the Deputy the absolute details in comparison to what they were previously.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I have the absolute details and it sounded a little like the five sorrowful mysteries.  Deputy Kenny was not Taoiseach in 2009.  He put a cap of €92,000 on the pay of special advisers.  Two of his special advisers are earning €168,000.  I asked him to explain how he had circumvented this cap.  Last week I asked him if he would give a commitment not to break the pay cap for the next CEO of Allied Irish Banks, but he would not do so.  He did, however, clearly rule out any reversal of the cuts to pensions.  We now know what is happening in terms of the Government's commitments and its rhetoric of sharing the people's pain.Rather than putting a supplementary question, I will put the same question again.  How did the Taoiseach manage to circumvent the publicly stated pay cap of €92,000 for special advisers, given that two of them are now being paid €168,000?  Does he think this fits with the great pain people are feeling due to all stealth taxes and household charges?  I ask him to tell us how he managed to do this.

Many parents and groups will attend the launch.  I wish to raise the important matter of disability services in the State and the urgent need to support people with disability in these difficult economic times.  Statistics indicate that 18.5% of Irish people have one disability or more and the percentage is increasing as the population ages.  A total of 75% of voluntary disability organisations have reported that the demand for their services has increased although their public funding has been reduced.  This is the tough world for many people with a disability.Did the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste state on the "Prime Time" programme on 22 February 2011 that disability, including mental health, was to be their social justice priority?  Did the Taoiseach give that commitment?  It is stated on page 54 of the programme for Government that we need a realistic implementation plan for the national disability strategy, including sectoral plans with achievable timescales and targets.  Where stands the plan now?Will the Taoiseach outline what has been the impact of the recession on this historically disadvantaged group?  Does he share my concerns that the social infrastructure is now being broken up and people are looking for hope on the matter?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	127	This is a matter of concern.  Yes, I did say prior to the election in the television debate to which the Deputy referred that the 300,000 people who have mental health challenges would be a priority.  It is true that at the time, the leader of the Labour Party, now Tánaiste, did refer to those in the disability sector.The delivery of mental health services has been allocated to the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, and is to become a central part of the delivery of normal health services.  As Deputy McGrath is aware, those with mental health challenges were sidelined for many years.  Yesterday I had the privilege of opening a primary care centre which will include the delivery of mental health services as a normal part of the delivery of services in the health sector.I congratulate the disability authorities on the preparation of their pre-budget submission.  I met a number of such groups.  They are well aware of the constraints on the country and are happy to work with Government in putting forward credible proposals for the implementation of a plan for disability.  From that perspective, their views and proposals will be taken into account.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I thank the Taoiseach for his response to the issue.  It amazes me that there is always extra money for political advisers yet we see cuts in respect of special needs assistants, SNAs.  Is he aware that a total of 2,461 independent assessment of need reports have been completed for children under five by the HSE up to 2011, and yet 751 are currently overdue, implying that 31% have not been completed within the prescribed time limits?  A total of 13% more visually impaired people have accessed services that have recently been cut by 7%.  Where is the fairness in that?Will the Taoiseach halt the reduction in income supports for people with disabilities dependent on benefits?  Will he maintain funding for the services needed by people with disabilities?  An important issue for the Disability Federation of Ireland is whether he will publish and implement the national disability strategy and incorporate it into budget decision-making by all Departments and public agencies.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Deputy McGrath asked me detailed questions.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has referred to the difficulties that are being encountered in respect of assessments for children under five years of age.  The putting together of all the requirements to have a Ministry for children which has the capacity to deal with all the various interconnected children's issues took some time.  The Minister is now focusing on that.  In so far as the Department of Health is concerned also, there are direct connections between what is happening there and in the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the Department of Education and Skills.When I met a number of disability groups, I advised them that they should outline the priorities they think are credible and achievable given the circumstances in which the country finds itself.  They are happy to work with that.  The determination of what funding will be available for the disability and the mental health sectors has not been made yet but these areas must be given priority in the sense that one just cannot remove funding because of the concerns and difficulties that would present.Work on the publication of an achievable national strategy for those with disability is ongoing.  The Minister will publish a strategy when those involved finalise what they can agree on.  I congratulate the disability groups on their continued and valued interaction with Government.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	130	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, together.I advised the House on 11 May last of my intention to continue with the process of dialogue between Government and churches, faith communities and non-confessional organisations that was inaugurated in February 2007.  On 19 May I had the opportunity to meet representatives of many of the partners in this dialogue to convey this interest directly.I was very pleased to visit the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland in Clonskeagh on 3 September as the community continued their celebration of the Eid festival.  It was a welcome opportunity to meet local and regional representatives, together with many families and community members.  Both these encounters were important as foundations for the relationship the Government will build during its term of office, but our discussions were introductory and informal and consistent with the occasions.  I hope to arrange further meetings soon with individual dialogue partners.  The structure for dialogue will also include meetings at official and ministerial level.  The agendas for those meetings will be agreed in advance with each dialogue partner.The process of structured dialogue was envisaged from the outset as a channel of consultation and communication on matters of mutual concern, but not to displace or override the normal arrangements for the conduct of policy and administration by Departments and agencies in their functional responsibility.  I am satisfied that the process of dialogue will develop in the years to come to be a very valuable support in dealing with issues of change in society, and I am confident that the opportunity to exchange perspectives and address issues of mutual concern in this way will be of great benefit to all the participants.

Tá sé an-thábhachtach.  Ar ardaigh an Taoiseach ceist an Bethany Home le hEaglais na hÉireann?  Did the Taoiseach raise the issue of Bethany Home with the Church of Ireland?  Does the Government plan to revisit the existing redress scheme for survivors of abuse while in State institutions or other institutions run by religious orders to include the survivors of Bethany Home?  I cannot understand why those survivors have been excluded from the redress scheme.  I have written to the Minister for Justice and Equality on the issue and I raised it also with others.  As the dialogue is ongoing, will the Taoiseach raise the issue, if he has not done so, with the Church of Ireland?  In particular I urge him to open up the redress scheme to include the survivors of abuse in Bethany Home.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	132	No, I did not raise it directly but I am aware that it is a matter of considerable interest.  An agreed agenda will be put together before I deal with the church directly.  This is a matter that I am quite prepared to put on the agenda and discuss with the church authorities.  In my meeting with the Church of Ireland I did not have an opportunity to raise Bethany Home because of the nature of the discussion that took place on the day.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Could the Taoiseach provide clarity?  The Government has ruled out thus far including the survivors of Bethany Home.  I would like to see the Government including it, but thus far the Government has not.  Could the Taoiseach give a reason they are not included?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	134	The question of including Bethany Home within the scope of the redress scheme was originally considered in 2004 and was rejected by the Department of Education and Science as there was no evidence of a public body having a regulatory or inspection function.In May 2007, the Department of Health and Children contacted that Department to advise that papers had come to light which indicated a State regulatory and inspection role.  These papers related to its inspection under the Registration of Maternity Homes Act 1934.  There was another reference on the papers held by the Department of Health and Children to "Bethany Mother and Baby Home".  The Department concluded that as Bethany Home operated as a mother and baby home it was not eligible to be considered for inclusion in the redress scheme.In October 2009, a former resident of Bethany Home drew the Department's attention to a notation on the maternity home's inspection report on the home in 1939 which stated that the home also operated as a children's home for those up to three years of age.Deputy Costello of the Labour Party tabled a parliamentary question in December 2009 requesting the inclusion of Bethany Home in the redress scheme.  In response, the Minister stated that the issue of including the home had been previously considered and it was decided that it should not be included.  He advised that the Department was examining further information submitted to it in relation to the home together with a renewed request for its inclusion, and that the examination would be completed as soon as possible.At the same time, there was a range of demands for the redress scheme to be extended to other categories such as psychiatric hospitals, Magdalene laundries, foster care, and mother and baby homes.  While the possible inclusion of the Bethany Home could have been examined on the grounds that it operated as a children's home, other institutions such as psychiatric hospitals could equally have been considered and the Government decided against extending the redress scheme.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	135	As the Taoiseach will be aware, minority religions have long seen their ability to offer schools, and particularly schools of their faiths, as central to protecting their existence in our country.  They have been scared of the agenda, as announced by the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, of transferring 50% of schools away from religious patronage.  Did this come up in discussions with the minority faiths?  It has been an important issue in the continuing inter-faith dialogue.  Did the Taoiseach give the churches he met any reassurance on that point in terms of religious patronage and their role in education, which they, particularly the minority religions, see as central in terms of protecting their faith?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	136	No, but I can give Deputy Martin some information now.The Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector was officially launched by the Minister for Education and Skills on 19 April this year.  It is a key education objective of the programme for a national Government 2011-2016.  In announcing the establishment of the forum on 28 March, the Minister stated that it would take a multidimensional approach involving consultations with the key education stakeholders, including parents.  He appointed an advisory group to convene that forum to receive and look at the various views and perspectives of participants and to provide policy advice having regard to the terms of reference.  The advisory group has to conduct a number of meetings and report back, obviously, having sought submissions from the public as part of its work.  This was not a matter of any discussion at the meeting I had with it but when we meet the churches, this will be a matter of concern on both sides.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	137	The Taoiseach answered the question at the end.  I know the policy.  I simply stated that it is a matter of concern to the minority churches and asked did the Taoiseach discuss it with them, and he stated he did not discuss it with them and did not offer reassurances.Minority churches are equally concerned about and sensitive to changes in school staffing and school funding models, and they are worried about certain leaked proposals on class sizes and on funding generally.  Was that discussed and did the Taoiseach give them any reassurances on those matters?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	138	A series of statements was issued by each of the participants at that.  This was the first such meeting we had and there was not any detailed discussion about any of that.  Obviously, there was not the time at a first meeting in plenary session to do that.  It merely set out a range and agenda that we would discuss at future meetings, setting out the prospectus of each of the individual participants in it.I would expect that as the individual meetings take place, these matters will be explored in far greater detail.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	139	What was discussed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I can give Deputy Martin the information from each of the churches as to what they said in their contributions.  They set out the dimensions of where they themselves stand and how they see the importance of this forum and the terms of reference that it set out.As I pointed out in the reply earlier, it was never intended to override or supersede the normal workings of Government.  It is an important element of consultation and an opportunity for Government and the churches and religious groups to interact on matters of importance and social change, some of which Deputy Martin mentioned.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	141	As Deputy Adams will be aware, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade met the Papal Nuncio, Dr. Giuseppe Leanza, on 14 July 2011 to convey the consideration and concerns of the Government arising from the Cloyne report.  The church authorities will also have noted the discussion in this House of the report on 20 July.I have not had any contact with the church authorities in Ireland or the Holy See in the matter in the intervening period.  The response of the Holy See to the Government, appropriately addressed to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, was received on 3 September.I accept the testimony of Cardinal Sean Brady that the statement from the Holy See was "carefully prepared and respectfully presented."  I acknowledge that the response, as described by the Cardinal, conveys the profound abhorrence of the Holy See for the crime of sexual abuse and its sorrow and shame for the terrible sufferings which the victims of abuse and their families have endured.  I appreciate the acknowledgement by the Holy See that it is "sorry and ashamed" for the terrible suffering of victims of child abuse in Ireland and their families and the acceptance of "grave failures" over the handling of the child sex abuse scandal.I am aware that many people were disappointed that elements of the argumentation advanced by the Holy See in its response were technical and legalistic, rather than focused exclusively to the Government's concerns about the welfare of children.  Nonetheless, I am satisfied that the response from the Holy See is of value in coming to terms with the sad history of abuse and the inadequate handling of cases.The Holy See has suggested that the way forward is through continuing dialogue and co-operation.  The Government will insist on arrangements that ensure, as far as possible, the safety from abuse of children.  With confidence, I require and expect to have the complete and unreserved co-operation of the church authorities and everyone in our society to that end.

Is the Taoiseach satisfied with the procedures and the attitudes now adopted by the Catholic hierarchy on compliance with the law?I note last week the report In Plain Sight, which was published by Amnesty International and launched by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, put the issue of the abuse of tens of thousands of Irish children in sharp focus.  According to the report, children were tortured, brutalised, starved and abused in institutions run by the State and the Catholic hierarchy in what has been described as the greatest human rights failure in the history of the State.  Ós rud é go bhfuil an tuairisc ar Cloyne ar fáil ó mhí Iúil, cén dul chun cinn atá déanta le páistí a chosaint?  Given that this Amnesty International report follows on from the Cloyne report which was published in July last, what progress has been made in bringing forward statutory changes in procedures to ensure the protection of children?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	143	Is dócha, ar dtús, go bhfuil an t-Aireacht Leanaí agus Gnóthaí Óige curtha i gcríoch.  Tá sin críochnaithe agus tá an Roinn ag obair.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta Adams go bhfuil dlúth-cheangailt idir an Roinn Leanaí agus Gnóthaí Óige agus an Roinn Dlí agus Cirt agus Comhionannais ó thaobh na deacrachta seo.  The Deputy is aware that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, is working actively in her Department, which was established specifically to deal with children and youth affairs.  The Department is working on the introduction of vetting legislation and the statutory implementation of the guidelines for children.  It hopes to bring the children's advocacy groups together again to discuss the changes recommended by a previous Attorney General to the wording to be used in a potential referendum on children's rights.  These are matters of absolute priority for the Minister.  I do not doubt that she will be quite willing to answer any detailed questions Deputies may have about them.  Although this question relates to the Cloyne report, I should say that I was also shocked by the Amnesty report, which is of considerable interest to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Taoiseach raised an issue in his speech on the Cloyne report.  As Head of Government, the Taoiseach made specific points about the behaviour of a separate state.  We have all gone on the record to criticise the response and record of the church on the abuse of children.  When we make assertions, we have to be willing to do more than simply say we stand over them.  The Taoiseach's spokesman said that the Taoiseach had no incident in mind when he claimed that the Vatican had hindered an investigation.  The Taoiseach said at the time that another state had frustrated and hindered an investigation.  When this claim was challenged by the Vatican, the Taoiseach or his spokesman said that the Taoiseach had been referring to a much earlier letter.  The report itself does not suggest that the letter in question was used to frustrate its inquiries.  Why have we been given two different explanations for the words used by the Taoiseach?  Can the Taoiseach clarify the situation a bit more for us?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I recall very well standing here in my own humble way trying to reflect the anger and the deep sense of violation of the Irish people regarding what had happened.  I make no apology for standing over the comments I made in the Dáil.  This was a statutory inquiry into a specific set of allegations in the diocese of Cloyne.  There should have been nothing less than full and comprehensive co-operation on the part of the church, as the organisation that was the sole subject of the inquiry.  The level of church co-operation with the Murphy commission from the Vatican and locally appointed leadership was not acceptable.  There is no doubt that the absence of full co-operation undermined the opportunity for the inquiry to get to the heart of the allegations.  As I said in my reply to Deputy Adams, I respect the words used in Cardinal Brady's response and the profound abhorrence of the Holy See.  I expect the church authorities and everybody else to work with the Government as it does its work in the interests of putting in place legal protection for all the children of this island.  I hope that what has happened cannot happen again.  Standards are being set out and work is being done by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I hope that as a result, the Irish people will have an opportunity to vote in a referendum on children's rights that goes further in setting out the standards and principles we espouse in respect of all our children.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	146	We all agree that the church and the Vatican, in particular, were not sufficiently proactive down through the years in response to the issue of child abuse and child sexual abuse, in particular.  I established the Laffoy-Ryan commission to examine industrial schools.  I established the Ferns inquiry, which revealed horrific abuse of children.  The aspect of the Cloyne issue about which I am asking is the Taoiseach's assertion that another state frustrated or hindered an inquiry in this state.  I am trying to ascertain the exact way in which it hindered or frustrated the inquiry.  Was there a specific incident in mind?  Was there a specific issue on which it actually tried to frustrate or hinder the inquiry?  I am trying to ascertain the Taoiseach's basis for making that assertion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	147	In my contribution here, I did not refer to specific incidents.  I said that there was less than full and comprehensive co-operation with the statutory inquiry into very serious allegations about child sexual abuse in the diocese of Cloyne and that it did not help the inquiry to get to the heart of the matter.  Clearly, the desired level of co-operation from the Vatican and from local leadership was not available to the Murphy report.  That upset me greatly.

I have not had any particular contact since 21 July.  At an official level, contacts are ongoing with the Northern Ireland Executive and the British Government.  A number of North-South Ministerial Council sectoral meetings have taken place since the recess.  The sixth meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council in institutional format took place yesterday, 3 October.  The Tánaiste is due to meet the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on 6 October.  I hope to visit Belfast in the period ahead, although a programme has not yet been put in place.  I will travel to Armagh on 18 November to meet political leaders and attend the 11th plenary meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council.  I have not held any discussions with political leaders in the North concerning any tribunal of inquiry.

As we approach the date of the Presidential election at the end of this month, can I bring to the Taoiseach's attention the fact that Irish citizens in the North and in the diaspora are excluded from voting?  Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil suim ag a lán daoine 60 míle ón gcathair seo go mbeidís ábalta vóta a chaitheamh sa toghchán, ach níl an ceart sin acu go fóill.  Does the Taoiseach agree that the extension of voting rights to all Irish citizens and passport holders would be a natural outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, which enshrines the right of the people of the North to Irish citizenship?  Has the Taoiseach given any further consideration to extending the franchise for Presidential elections north of the Border?  Perhaps that can be considered in the context of the upcoming planned constitutional convention.

I have given some consideration to the Deputy's suggestion.  It is right that the constitutional convention should consider this matter.  I hope to announce the establishment of the convention after the Presidential election.  Obviously, I will consult the Opposition leaders before doing so.  It will then be a matter for the constitutional convention to consider and take hearings about the matter and a range of other issues that will fall within its legitimate remit, including the Presidential period of service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	153	Questions Nos. 7 to 9, inclusive, are in my name.  I might follow up on them separately.  The Taoiseach has been in office for seven full months.  He will appreciate that people want to know how he intends to lead on Northern Ireland.  Thankfully, it has been a relatively quiet period when it comes to constitutional issues.  This is an opportunity to drive change and policy forward.  The lesson we consistently need to be aware of is that nothing can be taken for granted in relation to the North.  The consistent position of the Irish Government has been that it sees itself, along with the British Government, as a guarantor of progress through the institutions established by the Good Friday Agreement.  I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the assertion that it is not enough for institutions to be established and for politicians to hold positions without actually delivering for the people.  It is a matter of regret that one of the failings of the Northern Ireland Executive is that it has not functioned very effectively in recent years.I can recall, prior to the Hillsborough Agreement, that it was quite dysfunctional in terms of how it was operating as a collective Executive, in regard to circulating memos and papers to each other and so forth.  In that context, does the Taoiseach agree it seems surprising that even the position of Deputy First Minister is one which can be put on hold for about two months?When Mr. Peter Robinson stepped down as First Minister, we saw this caused a lot of inaction and drift for that period.  Ministers in the Executive tend to come and go, almost on a yearly or two-yearly basis, which seems to be more about electoral advancement than actually doing things, whereas being in government means one has to do — one has to execute policy and deliver.  It is a curious aspect of the Northern Ireland Executive that there tends to be the sense about it that people can come and go, and divert, whereas there is very serious work to do.  This is almost the equivalent of the Taoiseach saying he is taking two months off because he wants to go off and campaign somewhere.I do not mean that in any personal sense.  It is a very real issue in terms of how the Northern Ireland Executive works.  It has been one of the reasons there has been a lack of confidence in public opinion towards the institutions in the North.  The medium to long-term damage emanating from this can actually undermine the edifice of the Good Friday Agreement itself if people are not careful with regard to the office, the institutions and the positions within the Executive.  I make that point sincerely.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	154	I do not disagree with that broad principle.  The Deputy is well aware from his own experience of the incredible sensitivities of the discussions that took place over many years to bring about the Good Friday Agreement and to have an Assembly in place.  When that final structure was being put together, nobody would have assumed that what has happened would happen.  I know that when others might have considered leaving the Assembly or leaving Northern Ireland politics, they chose not to do so.I share the Deputy's view that there is a fragility about the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement that requires strength, leadership and solidity.  As I said, I do not disagree with the broad principle he has outlined, namely, when people are appointed under the d'Hondt system to these positions following the elections, they are generally expected to complete their remit and responsibilities, or, if they choose for some other reason to leave, they are free to do so.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Is the Taoiseach concerned, and has he had any discussions with Northern Ireland leaders or his British counterparts, with regard to the effects of the projected stg£4 billion in cuts outlined in the Northern Ireland budget at the beginning of this year?  These are, from here on, designed to result in thousands of job losses in the public sector, on which the North is very dependent, as the Taoiseach knows, given the collapse of manufacturing over many decades and the serious effects on health and education.In view of the fact there are already quite severe areas of disadvantage in working class communities in Northern Ireland in both Protestant and Catholic areas, and serious alienation of a certain cohort of youth in particular, is the Taoiseach concerned that these cuts will give rise to more unemployment, poverty and alienation, and are grist to the mill of dissident paramilitary organisations, whether on the republican or loyalist side, where young people seeing a dead end get diverted into these worse dead ends, with all the destruction that is involved?  Will the Taoiseach make representations to the British Government on these issues and even to the leaders of the Assembly, who should be fighting them as well?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	156	As Deputy Higgins pointed out, I have certainly noted the impact of budgetary policy in respect of Northern Ireland and the implications it is having.  Clearly, it is a matter for the Executive in its dealings with the British Government.  The Deputy is also aware of this House's interest in keeping alive the importance of foreign funding for social upkeep in Northern Ireland, of which we are very supportive.  At the discussions on the North-South Ministerial Council, as happened in the past, we are supportive of contributing to the well-being and the support of issues that have a benefit both North and South.It is not for me to interfere in the workings of the Executive and its relationship with the Chancellor in the Commons.  Obviously, we have discussed the interest of the Northern Assembly and its constituent members in regard to taxation matters and the matter of employment and investment, North and South.  However, as I said, it is a matter for the Executive how it does its business in respect of its budget.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	157	It is a bit rich to hear a lecture on what is happening in the North.  As the only Teachta Dála who was honoured to serve people in the Northern Assembly, let me say there is confidence in that institution and also in terms of the requirement to fulfil fully the Good Friday Agreement.On the Government's plans to amalgamate the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission, the Human Rights Commission is an essential part of the Good Friday Agreement and the Government will be in contravention of that agreement if it goes along that track.  I was at Hillsborough, as was the leader of Fianna Fáil, when the then Taoiseach refused to raise the issue of Irish language rights with the Unionists.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	158	That is not true.  It is so untrue it is unbelievable.  Why does the Deputy seek to tell such untruths?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	159	It is absolutely true and the Deputy knows that.  He should look at the public record.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Can we have a question, please?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	165	Is it not more in keeping with the Government's responsibilities that it should uphold all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement?  I am particularly drawn to this issue of amalgamating the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I did not say that there was not confidence in the Northern Ireland Assembly.  It is entirely a matter for the people of the North who they elect to their Assembly.  I understand the point being made by Deputy Martin is that, when the Assembly was set up, it was not envisaged that people could leave for a while and come back again.  I do not disagree with that broad principle which he set out.In respect of the Human Rights Commission, that matter was a specific part of the Good Friday Agreement and it was cleared up and accepted by the Northern Assembly and the Ministers in respect of the amalgamation here of the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority, and for very good reason, as was explained by the Minister for Justice and Equality in co-operation with both the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission.  I had the opportunity to address both organisations in a fitting assembly close to Leinster House recently, where members of both organisations set out on a new agenda.  That is perfectly acceptable and, in fact, the Human Rights Commission, as was, which had been diminished in its capacity to do its work, is now strengthened by the addition of the Equality Authority.  It is accepted as a continuation in a stronger way from this jurisdiction.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	167	What always struck me in terms of language and cultural issues was that it was successive Irish Governments, with the British Government, that actually delivered for the Irish language in the North, not any party.  It amazed me that Sinn Féin always allowed a Unionist become the Minister with responsibility for culture and language and then complained about lack of delivery on the language in the North.  I could never quite understand that one.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	168	This is Question Time.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	170	They get mixed up sometimes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The review of the work of cross-Border bodies and the examination of new proposals was a core part of the St. Andrew's Agreement.  We have now had the general election and the Assembly elections.  Will the Taoiseach provide an update on the publication of the review?  Will he agree to continue the policy of seeking to expand the scope and reach of these cross-Border bodies?  A review has continued for ages; publication has been stalled and so on.The Taoiseach has stated he made no call to any Northern leader before announcing changes to the Smithwick tribunal.  This caused much concern at the time regarding the Government's approach and commitment to the objectivity and independence of the tribunal which is very important in terms of confidence within the Unionist community.  The Taoiseach has also stated he has held no further discussions with any political opinion in Northern Ireland in that regard.  People need reassurance in respect of the tribunal being allowed to finish its work without hindrance or interference.  It is a vital issue in terms of Unionist perception of the South and how we in the Republic conduct our inquiries and so on.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Yes, I can give the Deputy that assurance.  On 1 June the Dáil passed a resolution amending the terms of reference of the Smithwick tribunal to require it to provide an interim report for the Clerk of the Dáil not later than 30 June 2011 and to present its final report to the Clerk of the Dáil not later than 30 November 2011.  Mr. Justice Smithwick had previously indicated to the Minister for Justice and Equality that the tribunal would be able to conclude its work in the timescale established in the amended terms of reference.  The Minister emphasised in his statement to the Dáil that if for any unforeseen reason, the chairman found he could not conclude his inquiries and report by 30 November, he could report that matter and the Oireachtas could consider it further.  It also was made clear that the Government's response would be fully cognisant of and consistent with the need for the tribunal to fulfil its obligations fully and as expeditiously as possible.  I understand the Minister spoke with the Northern Ireland First Minister, Mr. Peter Robinson, and the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice, Mr. David Ford, to inform them of the content of his speech in the Dáil on the Smithwick tribunal and the motion passed.  As the Deputy is aware, the tribunal is conducting public hearings.  He has my assurance that there will be absolutely no interference — nor should or could there be — with the chairman in his dealings with the tribunal.  As I stated, if for some unforeseen reason, he is unable to conclude the hearings within the timescale set out, he can report the matter and the House will consider it further.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	173	The rights of people in the North in respect of the Irish language are important.  However, far more pressing at this time in working-class communities is the massive crisis with regard to jobs, the beckoning health and education cuts and the sectarian division that, unfortunately, still underlines society in the North.  As a representative of a political tendency that historically has opposed both British imperialism and paramilitarism of all kinds, I am seriously concerned that the intensification of the economic crisis, leading to greater poverty and the alienation that goes with it in the North, poses a threat to the possibility of society advancing and ordinary people in the North having the decent society and life they deserve.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, unfortunately, while Members welcomed the end of the insane paramilitarism on all sides and recognise that British imperialism and capitalism are in crisis and do not really have a solution to offer, the institutionalisation of sectarian division which is the reality of the structures put in place on foot of the Good Friday Agreement has fault lines and that such fault lines can be badly exposed if the economic crisis, poverty, alienation, unemployment and cuts to services are intensified.  Therefore, in the interests of ensuring a decent future and overcoming the problems of sectarian division, I suggest to the Taoiseach that it is critical that these issues be addressed.  I note his own Government does not give good example in leading a massive barrage of cuts here.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	174	The Deputy should stay in Northern Ireland for the moment.  We will get back to the other one later.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	175	It really is up to ordinary people, the trade union movement and others in the North to stand up and fight against the cuts being implemented, whether from London or the Assembly.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	176	For once I agree with the Deputy on the impact serious cutbacks can have on any area of society, particularly one in which people are under pressure.  That is the reason I have had some involvement with them, albeit not as much as I would like.  I hope that when I get the opportunity to travel to Belfast in the near future, I will be able to have a look at a number of issues there.  However, this is the reason the Government has been highly supportive of the continuation of funding from both the European Union and the United States.  It is also the reason the Government was happy to support the expansion of health services at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry and is happy to support, where appropriate, infrastructural projects that benefit both sides.In addition, there is a number of strong examples in which a community gets involved with young people in particular, especially young males who might be tempted to take the wrong direction in life, and makes whatever impact it can.  We have raised elements of this issue, as always happens between North-South ministerial colleagues, and in so far as we can encourage and assist in any way, we will be happy to so do.  However, as I noted to Deputies Adams and Martin, it is a matter for the Executive to decide how it conducts its negotiations with Britain.  In so far as general support is concerned, I understand the issues of depression and pressure, as well as, unfortunately, the tragic impact of suicide in a number of locations in the North where disillusionment and an absence of hope have reigned too long.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I call Deputy Adams to ask a final supplementary, as we want to move on.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	178	There will be a huge cead míle fáilte for the Taoiseach when he visits Belfast.  We are very fond of County Mayo and if he gives me notice, we might arrange for him to visit Michael Davitt GAC which is a fine hurling club.  However, he stated — perhaps the leader of Fianna Fáil said the same thing — it was not foreseen that a member of the Executive could leave and then return.  Clearly, he was talking about Mr. Peter Robinson, the only person to have done this.  All Members respect this as in his dire and hugely difficult family circumstances, this was the appropriate and right thing for him to do.  As a matter of eolas or information to the Taoiseach and the leader of Fianna Fáil in respect of the only other person to do so, Mr. Martin McGuinness, his temporary replacement, Mr. John O'Dowd, has been praised by other Unionist Ministers for the way in which he is handling his brief.  Moreover, the Taoiseach will be aware that on foot of the help his Ministers are giving to Mr. McGuinness, perhaps he might not be obliged to return.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I do not now whether that was listed as one of the questions.

We want to move on as only 17 minutes remain and 40 questions to the Taoiseach were tabled.  I am anxious to try to facilitate all the Deputies present as we could spend all day on this issue.  Does the Deputy have a quick supplementary?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	185	No, that is fine.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 11 together.As Members will be aware, I had bilateral meetings with the Prime Minister in London on 18 April and in Dublin on 18 May during the Queen's visit, as well as meeting him at European Council meetings.  I also spoke with the Prime Minister prior to the British-Irish Council meeting that took place in London on 20 June.  We have had no direct contact since Dáil Éireann rose on 22 July.I expect to next see the Prime Minister at the European Council meeting on 17 and 18 October.  We have agreed to keep in close touch on a regular basis on bilateral matters and matters relating to Northern Ireland.  I spoke briefly to the British Deputy Prime Minister at the European Union Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw last Friday.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with the British Prime Minister on the plight of the Travelling people in Dale Farm in England?  These people, who are either Irish or English-born Irish Travellers, are facing extreme difficulties, including the threat of possible imminent eviction from the homes where many of them have been for a long time.  The Travelling people in England face many of the same problems they have traditionally faced here in discrimination and in particular difficulty in finding suitable locations to reside and educate their children etc.  Has the Taoiseach made any representations on their behalf for proper accommodation and that their civil human rights would be respected?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	188	No, I have not had any discussions with the British Prime Minister about this.  I understand that is a pretty complex case in which litigation is still ongoing.  Personally I have not made any representations about it, but I have obviously read some of the reports and seen some of the news headlines about what appears to be a very complicated issue.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	189	When did the Taoiseach last raise with the British Prime Minister the issue of the British Government's failure to co-operate fully with the inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  Has he brought to the Prime Minister's attention the resolution passed here in May?  Mar dhéan cad é an freagra a fuair sé?On a number of occasions I have raised the issue of funding for Justice for the Forgotten, which has been working with victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  Thus far it is not in receipt of funding from the Government.  Can that be rectified?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I raised the question of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings when I met the British Prime Minister in April and again when I met him on the occasion of the state visit here by Queen Elizabeth II.  Obviously everybody recognises the sensitivity of this, including all of the issues surrounding the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, without getting into endless open-ended inquiries.  A recent Dáil motion acknowledged that we are approaching this task in the context of transformed relations on this island and between Ireland and Britain.  We still have many sensitive issues to deal with towards finding a resolution.  However, as the Deputy knows, we do so on the basis of partnership in a very different way.There were two significant and lengthy inquiries by the judges, the Hamilton and Barron inquiries, thorough examination by an Oireachtas committee and a full commission of investigation conducted by Patrick MacEntee.  I understand the cost of the Barron inquiry came to €3.5 million and the total cost of the MacEntee commission was €2.6 million.  There were very significant and lengthy inquiries by those two gentlemen.  The Pat Finucane case also arose in the context of my discussions with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron.  I understand the British Government is continuing to consider how this matter might be resolved.  I have not had any communication with Britain since then.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	191	The question was about the contacts the Taoiseach has had with the British Prime Minister "since Dáil Éireann went into recess in July 2011".  However, he never answered that question, with respect.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	193	What contacts has the Taoiseach had concerning the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?  Has he raised the issue since we went into recess in July?  I also asked about funding for Justice for the Forgotten, which he also did not answer.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I raised the question of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings with the British Prime Minister in April and again when I met him on the occasion of the state visit of Queen Elizabeth II.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	197	It would be a cause of some surprise that since those meetings in May there has been no follow-up or pursuit of the issue of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  When the Taoiseach was questioned in the House on that occasion he said he remained committed to doing something on the issue.  Clearly it has not been raised since then with the British Government.  Given that members of the Government are currently talking about atrocities over the years of the Northern Troubles and all the violence on the island of Ireland, surely this is an issue that should be of equal concern to the Government and Ministers.  I agree that people should be open and honest about what they did during the years of violence, but I respectfully suggest the Government cannot have it both ways.  Is it not time to stop equivocating on the issue and to meet the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, and tell him that covering up files concerning the worst atrocities of the Troubles — it must be remembered that the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were the worst of all of them even though there were some terrible atrocities all around — goes directly against the spirit of the peace process?  I ask the Taoiseach to put that to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, in terms of the impact of this on the victims and also in terms of confidence within the broader peace process.Do I take it from the Taoiseach's reply that he has had no discussion since May with the British Prime Minister on the eurozone crisis?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Deputy is correct in his last question.  I have not had any discussions with him since I last met him.I agree in respect of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings.  When I was sitting where the Deputy is now sitting, I raised the issue many times with the former taoisigh, Mr. Ahern and Mr. Cowen.  On each occasion the response was that the British Government would consider the matter.  I got the same reply when I raised it directly with the British Prime Minister.  It is an issue for all of us here.  I do not want to get into a long series of endless inquiries, but it is an issue I will continue to raise and I will report to the House on a follow-up from the last time I raised it.  Obviously when I do it again, I will be happy to come back and give the Deputy the up-to-date position.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I propose to take Questions Nos. 12 to 18, inclusive, together.I attended the Eastern Partnership summit in Warsaw on 29 and 30 September.  I had bilateral meetings on the margins of the meeting with the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mark Rutte; Chancellor Faymann of Austria; the Prime Minister of Finland, Jyrki Katainen; President Yanukovych of the Ukraine; the Prime Minister of Moldova, Vlad Filat; and President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia.  I also spoke informally with several other EU leaders.I will also attend the British-Irish Council in Dublin in November, and the European Councils in Brussels on 17 and 18 October and 9 December.  I hope to be in a position to travel to China later this year, subject of course to final agreement with the Chinese authorities.  Other arrangements, including for meetings with key European partners, are being prepared and will continue to be based on assessment of strategic priorities and dates.  I will continue to keep the House informed.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	200	When the Taoiseach next meets the leadership of the European Union on 17 and 18 October and on 9 December, given his election pledge to the people, does he intend to resume to seek a significant cut in the amounts of bad debts that are to be repaid to the European bondholders, bankers and speculators who gambled so wildly on Irish property or given that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, capitulated to the president of the ECB, Mr. Trichet, in Poland two weeks ago, has he now given up on that promise and therefore negated what he said in his opening speech on the day the new Dáil first met with regard to sharing the burden and so on?  When the Taoiseach meets the likes of Council President Van Rompuy, Commission President Barroso and ECB President Trichet in the next few weeks, will he demand an explanation for their insistence that the Irish people carry tens of billions of euro on their backs for private European institutions?  I would like him to ask that question on my behalf, as a representative of the Irish people and taxpayers.  How can he sit at meetings with these people, who are blackmailing the Irish people, demanding that they be gouged for up to €60 billion, their services and living standards cut, the future of their children put at risk by being forced out of this country, in order to pay off private profit-seeking institutions in Europe?  Does the Taoiseach find that revolting?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I do not find it revolting.  The Deputy's salary is paid by the decision of these people and the European Central Bank.  We do not control the ECB, although our governor attends its meetings.  The 17 eurozone governments obviously each have very different views about how individual countries operate their economies.  From those with triple A status down along the line, there are very different views.  The leaders of which the Deputy speaks were the leaders who made the political decision to bring in the EFSF, and consequently followed through with the decision, which was in part put on the table by Ireland, that there be no margins for funding, which has meant a substantial saving for the Irish taxpayer here.We have pointed out recently the impact of the discussions between the Minister for Finance and Mr. Trichet about writing down debt against senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, which might result in a saving of €100 million.  The Minister for Finance made it perfectly clear that if it were possible to do something in respect of the promissory note over a longer period, the savings would be of a very substantial nature to the Irish taxpayer.I do not find it revolting to sit at meetings with leaders who are democratically elected by the people in their countries and who make decisions there about the European Union, of which Ireland is a central player.  At this meeting, I spoke to President Barroso, Mr. Van Rompuy, the special representative, Ms Catherine Ashton, the Prime Minister of Poland, the German Chancellor and a number of other leaders who were present.  In so far as Ireland is concerned, we will continue to point our country in the direction it is now headed, which is one of increasing confidence, with an injection of equity into our banks and an inflow of deposits.  These represent a sign of confidence, although I recognise we have a long way to go and have some difficult decisions to make.  We will continue to work with our European partners to ensure Europe gets back to where it should be, which is right up there at the top.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Does the Taoiseach agree that it is surprising that he has gone seven months without a substantive bilateral meeting with a eurozone leader?  At the start of April, the Government announced it would be holding a series of these meetings.  In April, the Tánaiste announced he would be undertaking a series of bilateral meetings with his foreign ministerial counterparts, and that in turn, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance would engage with Heads of State and other finance ministers.   The Tánaiste has had a few such meetings, as has the Minister for Finance, but the Taoiseach has not done so.  He told Members he had no intention of either phoning or meeting anyone before the July summit.  Given how central the leaders are to this crisis, can he explain why he has taken this approach?

I do not dictate the schedules for other European leaders, no more than they dictate ours.I had a bilateral meeting with the Finnish Prime Minister, which is a triple A rated country.  Finland had inserted a clause in July that its participation in the EFSF would result in a requirement for collateral to be made available to that country.  This was a source of considerable difficulty for other countries, but the matter has now been resolved.  I spoke at length to the Finnish Prime Minister about that, and one of the issues we discussed was Finland's interest in looking at the global economy next year, the possibility of a downturn in the Finnish economy, and the production of a competitiveness index for the European Union and the eurozone.  I pointed out to him the reduction in unit labour costs here, the increase in our competitiveness and the decisions taken by the Government that impact on that.  We both agreed on the potential of the Single Market and the opportunity provided to European countries to market their goods.The Dutch Prime Minister's view in July was for a charge to be levied against countries that avail of EFSF funding.  That matter has been dealt with technically and it has all been sorted out.  I also discussed the future with the Austrian Prime Minister.  As a triple A rated country, the Austrians were anxious to hear about the decisions Ireland has been making and the consequent progress that has been made.I have been in touch with Chancellor Merkel's office on a couple of occasions.  I expect we will be able to arrange a formal bilateral meeting of substance.  I cannot confirm the date yet, because it depends on schedules here and there, as well as with the——

The situation in the European and international economy is grave, as it has been since 2008, yet the leaders of Europe continue to kick the can down the road. Tomorrow we will have a debate on the eurozone crisis, but according to the Chief Whip's office, the Taoiseach will not be participating in it.  What we are seeing across Europe is a failure of leaders to do what they know is necessary.  Their unwillingness to take direct control is a large part of the problem.The Taoiseach has yet to come to the House to discuss the report on the July summit and will attend another summit in two weeks.  Will he make time tomorrow to discuss in the House the core part of his responsibilities rather than palming everything off to his able Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan?

However, as the Minister for Finance has just returned from the ECOFIN meeting and a specific request has been made on a number of occasions for this kind of debate, it is important that he should keep us informed as to the up-to-date position.  I understand Greece is funded until November which would require that a decision be made by the end of October.  I also understand the troika has not yet reported back with its findings and a recommendation.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me an opportunity to discuss this important topical issue, namely, the need for the Minister for Education and Skills to give urgent consideration to designating Longford as the headquarters of the amalgamated County Longford and County Westmeath vocational education committee.  I welcome Deputy Troy's presence as I understand he made a strong case for Longford last Friday.In light of Longford's prime location and the significant capital investment by the Department of Education and Skills in its vocational education committee infrastructure in the past two years, the town is an ideal location, both geographically and in terms of facilities, to become the headquarters of the new amalgamated VEC.  County Longford's current VEC headquarters comprise administrative offices and a section of the Connolly Barracks site housing a number of buildings on 4.5 acres, which were purchased from the Department of Defence in 2009.  This development is relevant in light of a meeting of the Minister for Defence with a delegation from Longford on the purchase of the entire Connolly Barracks site with a view to creating a community-based campus for education, training and other activities such as tourism infrastructure.  The VEC headquarters would be the cornerstone of such an educational hub.The administrative offices of County Longford Vocational Education Committee are located on Battery Road in the town, which is directly adjacent to the N4 Dublin-Longford primary route and on the northern side of the N63 Roscommon-Galway road.  Longford, which is recognised for its central location, is equidistant — 43 km — from both Mullingar and Athlone.  Furthermore, the Longford-Dublin rail link provides an excellent rail service and the M4 motorway, which is due for completion in a few years, will be in close proximity to the town.The building housing the VEC's administrative offices was acquired from the Office of Public Works in 1932 through a 99 year lease for which a nominal annual fee of €20 is charged.  The site, which was originally part of the former barracks, features a building consisting of 720 sq. m with a disability access lift and a car park accommodating 50 vehicles which has the potential for the development of further spaces.  Investment by the Department of Education and Skills in the past two years resulted in the complete refurbishment of the office, including a complete mechanical and electrical upgrade and the installation of modern information technology infrastructure.  Recent work also included the installation of voice-over Internet protocol, VOIP, technology, which allows for the integration of offices at no extra cost.  A second development in 2009 was the purchase by the VEC of a section of the Connolly Barracks site from the Department of Defence.  This acquisition was funded by the Department of Education and Skills and buildings on the site are finished to a high standard with parking for an additional 80 vehicles.In the past two years, County Longford VEC has been allocated approximately €2 million for the purchase and development of the Connolly Barracks site and refurbishment of the administrative offices.  A number of buildings have been renovated and now house various adult education programmes.  Spare capacity in these buildings could be used for additional office space as required, and there is an ample supply of accommodation.  To maximise this investment I ask the Minister to designate Longford as the headquarters for the amalgamated vocational education committee.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I welcome this opportunity to outline to the House the decision taken by the Government to revise the configuration of VECs, and to set out the factors the Minister will consider in deciding on the location of the headquarters of the new entities.  With specific regard to the matter raised by the Deputy, in arriving at a decision on headquarters location the Minister is considering a range of factors.  These include the need to ensure that the location of a VEC headquarters will, to the greatest extent possible, facilitate staff redeployment under a redeployment scheme within the context of the Croke Park agreement, and the need to operate at lowest cost having regard to the accommodation available in existing locations.  Where redeployment of all of the headquarters staff in an entity to one location is not possible due to a distance factor, or where, for other reasons, such as suitability of buildings, it is not feasible to have all of staff based in one headquarter building, the Minister is giving consideration to the possibility of having sub-offices in some locations, at least for the medium term.  Following completion of the Minister's deliberations, the headquarter locations will be announced later this evening.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	228	I am delighted that Longford has all the infrastructure required.  A broadband fibre ring passes in front of the administrative building.  In addition, there has been significant capital investment in VEC infrastructure in Longford by the Department of Education and Skills in the past two years, which enables it to be a centre of excellence for a VEC headquarters.I hope the Minister will make an announcement tonight in favour of Longford as the headquarters.  The potential is there and it would be a shame to waste it.  It would be a much appreciated investment in the county.  I understand the headquarters in Mullingar is rented at considerable cost whereas the rent in Longford would be much smaller.  Perhaps the Minister of State might give information on the current cost of the Westmeath headquarters.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I am not aware of the cost of the headquarters in Westmeath, but I will undertake to get the information and pass it to the Deputy concerned.  I also undertake to take on board the comprehensive case he has made to have the VEC headquarters located in Longford and will pass it to the Minister, Deputy Quinn, as he finalises his deliberations.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The rehabilitation and support programme, RASP, and the youth service, Sphere 17, are based in north Coolock in Dublin 17.  RASP provides an outstanding community-based approach to anti-alcohol and anti-drugs support, education and outreach programmes and is the only community rehabilitation centre in the Dublin 17 region.  Sphere 17 provides vitally important youth services for local children and young people aged from 10 to 21.  Although both organisations run critical programmes and services in that part of my constituency, they are desperately worried their funding may be significantly reduced under budget 2012.  My plea to the Minister today is that he examine the outstanding work of both organisations and at least ensure that the critical core funding provided in budget 2011 for RASP and the essential 2011 Sphere 17 funding are maintained under budget 2012.RASP's approach to citizens who have been addicted to alcohol or drugs is multi-disciplinary, providing vocational and therapeutic elements to get their clients' lives back on track and play a key role in their families and their communities.  Among the psycho-social and vocational support programmes run by RASP are weekly care planning; computer studies; literacy support; group therapy; drama therapy; cookery; one to one support; family support; counselling; homelessness and advocacy support; post-prison support; stabilisation programmes and after care support.  One of their unique programmes is a horticultural training course with the support of the horticultural industry in north Dublin.Since its inception in 1998 more than 200 people have been RASP clients and there are usually about 18-20 clients at any one time being supported by RASP.  There are three people employed at the project, including participants who are supported by the community employment programme.  The organisation is led, outstandingly, by the Coolock community activist, Mr. Kevin Behan, as chair, and by the general manager, Mr. Pat Hanna.  From 2000 when RASP was mainstreamed it was funded with approximately €200,000 per annum but in 2009 this budget was cut by one third, to €138,848 per year.The other Dublin 17 organization I wish to mention in the Dáil today is the Sphere 17 regional youth project which is located in the Darndale-Belcamp village centre, Dublin 17 and has three different youth work teams covering the Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood parishes.  I have been a long-time director of the Coolock development council campus where Sphere 17 is also now providing a new youth centre for Bonnybrook parish.  Sphere 17 estimates that the population of young people in north Coolock between the ages of 10-21 is approximately 3,450, or 22% of the population.  The project works with more than 1,500 local young people in this age group each year, through more than 170 different programmes.The programme was founded in October 2005 and since July 2007 has worked out of an impressive new dedicated youth facility in Darndale village, under the tremendous leadership of Mr. Mick Ferron.  It provides services up to 10 p.m. each night and at weekends, including educational, health, art, drug outreach and counselling programmes, as well as support for the local Traveller community.  The wonderful ethos of Sphere 17 is found in its statement: "All young people have the ability to achieve great things; some just need a little support."  Importantly, Sphere 17 also facilitates the Woodale youth justice project which is part of the national Garda youth diversion projects.  The programme had more than 17,000 registered contacts between local young people and the service in the past year and its detached youth work team made more than 2,000 contacts with young people through its evening street work programme.  Twenty full-time professionals are currently employed by Sphere 17 alongside part-time and CE staff and more than 20 volunteers.  In 2010, Sphere 17 received €1,198,195 in funding from a range of sources led by the City of Dublin VEC but in 2011 it received only €918,000 and, since 2008, its budget has lost €230,000.RASP and Sphere 17 are already struggling to maintain the current essential services they provide and, like most community organisations, have come under severe pressure because of the impact of the recession on families and communities.  It is therefore crucial that they and the people they and I serve have certainty that they will continue to receive the funding they need in 2012 and beyond.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.My Department contributes to the overall aim of Government policy in regard to drugs and the national drugs strategy, which is to provide an effective integrated response to the problems posed by drug misuse.  Part of my Department's contribution to the national drugs strategy is to provide funding for a number of projects in local drugs task force areas.RASP, the rehabilitation and support programme is a community-based drug rehabilitation project for adults who are in recovery from addiction.  Through the provision of a community employment scheme it provides a number of placements for adults from the Dublin 17 area who are currently on a treatment programme with the adjacent Beldale Clinic, operated by the HSE.  The project provides a programme which has an educational content and a rehabilitation emphasis.This year, for the educational component of the programme, my Department has allocated €138,847 to RASP, which is the same as the 2010 allocation for the project.  This funding primarily goes towards the cost of one staff salary, the cost of leasing a premises and other programme costs.  My Department will take a decision regarding the provision of an allocation to RASP in 2012 in the context of the overall budgetary process for 2012.Sphere 17 is a regional youth service for young people aged between 10 and 21 years in such areas as Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood across Dublin 17.  It provides young people with a wide range of programmes and activities which reflect their needs, interests, capacity and age profile.  These programmes and activities include personal and social development with a particular focus on recreation, education and health.My Department provided an allocation for the Bonnybrook Youth Project under Sphere 17 youth service in the years up to 2010.  In 2010, my Department carried out a review of projects in local drugs task force areas.  As a result, responsibility for 21 projects, including Sphere 17, transferred, with appropriate funding, to the then Office of the Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, with effect from January 2011.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs continues to provide allocations to the Sphere 17 regional youth service under several funding streams.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	232	In regard to these and similar vital projects throughout the country, can the Minister of State state that there will be a full cost benefit analysis before there are any further cuts?  Some weeks ago, our colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, visited the Sphere 17 facility.She was informed by the manager, Mr. Mick Ferron, that if a cut in funding of 10% were to be imposed, this would result in reduced hours in respect of all funded posts by at least 20%, a reduction in programme output by up to 40%, service closure on one day — from Monday to Friday — per week, a reduction in the weekday service by 50% and an annual reduction of an estimated 400 young people out of the 1,500 to whom I referred who are engaged in the service.If we go down the road of introducing cuts, there will be a number of serious impacts.  One of the worst impacts that will be felt by Sphere 17 if its funding is cut relates to its plan to open a new youth centre in the third major parish of north Coolock, namely, Priorswood.  This project has already been postponed and if the budget is cut again, it will have to be postponed indefinitely.  As the Minister of State will appreciate, Sphere 17 plays a vital role in supporting An Garda Síochána and its youth diversion programmes.The chief executive of RASP, Mr. Pat Hanna, estimates that it costs in the region of €100,000 per annum to keep a prisoner in jail.  In contrast, approximately €130,000 — or a little more than the former amount — can assist 18 to 20 people in overcoming addiction in order that they might begin to play a useful role in society.  Mr. Hanna also estimates that for every €1 spent on anti-drug programmes, the State saves €3 in other costs.I appreciate that there are organisations similar to those to which I refer in other constituencies.  However, Sphere 17 and RASP are vital to the Dublin 17 area and it is critical that their funding for 2012 be maintained.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	233	In addition to the funding provided for RASP and five other projects in local drugs task force areas, my Department is making a significant contribution in support of the prevention pillar of the national drugs strategy through the mandatory social personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum at primary level and in the junior cycle at second level, the initiatives under the delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS, action plan to prevent early school leaving and achieve better educational outcomes for students and the guidelines on substance use policy issued to all schools.  It will be a matter for the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to approve decisions regarding future funding for the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service.  In this regard, I understand her Department will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, co-ordination and impact in youth policy and provision in order to ensure quality outcomes for all.The Deputy has raised the possibility of carrying out a full cost-benefit analysis of the programmes to which he refers.  I would be concerned that my Department would not have sufficient resources to allow it to carry out such an analysis, particularly in the context of engaging in the type of forensic investigation that would be required in order to establish whether the programmes provide a benefit for those who avail of them or whether the communities which they serve are obtaining full benefits from them.  However, the Deputy's concerns are extremely valid and he made a very compelling case for the retention of both services.  I will undertake to pass on his concerns to the Minister when we are engaging in the final stages of the comprehensive spending review which is under way.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	234	In addition to the privilege of being elected to this House, I have been afforded the honour and privilege of serving as Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on social protection.  In the latter role and as an ordinary Deputy I have come face to face with the reality relating to the social welfare system on a daily basis.  Irrespective of my specific responsibilities in this area, many of my colleagues and I have been inundated with representations from persons seeking to avail of social welfare benefits and entitlements, including domiciliary care allowance, invalidity pension and other allowances, and programmes and projects relating to areas such as career training, education, etc.As everyone is aware, a huge cohort of people are dependent on and in need of assistance.  The agenda for Government policy in the area of social protection was set not last February but on budget day in 2010.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael voted against the budget introduced in December last year and also the subsequent Finance Act.    They specifically stated they would reverse the 4% cut in social welfare rates and then fought an election on that premise and promise.  The programme for Government specifically states, "We will divert staff from elsewhere in the public service to clear the social welfare appeals backlog, and introduce a consolidated appeals process".  On entering Government, Fine Gael and the Labour Party restated their policy on social welfare rates and indicated that there would be no cuts.  On the anniversary of the Government's first 100 days in power, this policy was again affirmed.  To be fair, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, immediately recanted her previous utterings when she entered office.  She has fudged direct questions on the maintenance of social welfare rates and failed to provide straight answers.  This is a sure sign that the rates will be reduced.I wish to explode two myths with immediate effect, the first of which is that the memorandums of understanding are not set in stone.  When my party's spokesperson on finance, Deputy Michael McGrath, met representatives of the troika earlier in the year, he was informed that austerity must not affect the vulnerable.  When representatives from Social Justice Ireland met officials from the IMF in July, Mr. Ajai Chopra echoed these words.  The forthcoming budget will test the Government's mettle and oblige it to make decisions.  It will be held accountable for these decisions and its actions will be weighed against the promises and commitments made earlier this year.On its election to office, the Government stated it would renegotiate the four year plan and the interest rate relating to it.  Eventually — by accident rather than design — the rate was reduced with great fanfare and, to use cycling parlance, Enda came home in the yellow jersey.  However, the Taoiseach is no king of the mountains.  Why could he not ring-fence the savings which will supposedly amount to almost €1 billion per year resulting from the interest rate cut and use them to safeguard social welfare rates, protect the poor, the needy and the unemployed and target detailed programmes at the skilled and unskilled in areas where there are employment opportunities such as the ICT sector?  He sold dummies to many in Roscommon, Portlaoise and Loughlinstown.The initiative of the Minister for Social Protection to tackle fraud is commendable, but it is not really new.  Savings of €500 million were made in this area last year and the Minister hopes to save a further €625 million this year.  It does not take a rocket scientist to identify the areas in which these savings are being made, namely, living alone allowance and lone-parent allowance and those who are working and claiming.  There is no need to seek public support for major cuts by making statements on people's lifestyle choices in order to stigmatise them.  This is all a smokescreen.  The time people are obliged to wait for decisions on their appeals — be they in respect of claims for jobseeker's benefit or carer's allowance — is way too long.  The amount of time it takes to lodge an application and then have one's appeal heard is astronomical.The State has made provision for the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  We put supports in place and established entitlements on the proviso that they would be accessible and available.  The representations I have received indicate that this is not the case.  The staff of the Department are inundated with work and their tempers have reached boiling point.  This is a crisis and the Minister must deploy additional staff resources.  She must take control and make decisions in order that the current difficulties might be alleviated and that people will gain confidence in the process.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I am informed by the chief appeals officer that the number of appeals waiting to be processed is 17,655.  This is a reduction of some 3,126 on the number at the same point last year when the Deputy's party was in power.  Fianna Fáil created a meltdown in the economy and, thanks to its efforts, unprecedented numbers have lost either their jobs or businesses.  These individuals have been obliged to apply for social welfare payments.  When the Deputy referred to the increase in the number on social welfare, he was actually  complaining about his own party and the depredations it visited upon the country.  The Deputy's party has the singular responsibility for the hundreds of thousands of people who lost employment and their businesses because of the party's failure to deal with the banks and the disastrous decision on the bank guarantee.  If the Deputy is going to lash out, perhaps he should look in the mirror and at the Fianna Fáil Party first.The number of appeals waiting to be processed must be seen against a background where there has been a significant increase in the number of appeals from 14,070 in 2007 to 32,432 on Fianna Fáil's watch in 2010.  Current indications are that there is now a slight drop in the number of appeals being received in 2011 because the economy has begun to stabilise, although unfortunately it is at a very low level.  We must all fight to get the economy to recover.The annual intake this year is still likely to be close to 30,000 for the year.  In an effort to reduce the backlog of appeals, the Department made nine additional appointments to the office earlier this year on my becoming a Minister.  These assignments augment the three appointments made to the office during the Fianna Fáil tenure — a massive increase — in 2010.  This brings the total number of appeals officers serving in the office to 29.  In addition, a number of initiatives have been undertaken with a view to increasing capacity and the combination of these initiatives and additional staff resulted in 22,226 decisions being made in the first eight months of 2011.  This compares to the 17,000 appeals completed under the remit of the Fianna Fáil Minister in 2010, and the 10,911 decisions made in 2009.We are dealing with a vastly expanded load because of Fianna Fáil's destruction of the economy and we are actually dealing with them faster and more comprehensively.  More emphasis is placed on deciding claims on a summary basis where possible, and enhanced business processes and ICT have also increased the capacity of the office.  Some 3,000 cases registered before 31 December 2010 have been ring-fenced, with a team of ten of the office's most experienced appeals officers having been freed from all other work to concentrate on clearing the Fianna Fáil backlog by the end of this year.  I hope the Deputy understands who has caused the build-up of appeals, although we are sorting it out.  The Deputy's party caused it.Overall it is expected that the increase in the number of decisions being made by appeals officers will continue and this, combined with the slight reduction in the numbers received, should lead to ongoing reductions in the backlog of appeals and processing times.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	236	I thank the Minister for the response but we should get a few facts straight and sing from the same hymn sheet.  I have been elected to this Dáil, not the previous Dáil.  I carry no candle for the previous Administration, although that is no reflection on the various and many improvements which have accrued to this State from its time in office.  It is high time the Minister and her colleagues began to take cognisance of the fact that they head the current Administration, having been elected to this Dáil.  They should take responsibility for the current position.The people of Laois-Offaly elected me to represent them and I will continue to do so.  My party has also asked me to take responsibility for the social protection portfolio, and I take soundings from my colleagues.  I have some examples of our current position.  I will not talk about what was the case, what brought about our current position or anything like that, as I was elected to this Dáil.An applicant for the domiciliary care allowance in respect of her son in September 2010 had it refused in October 2010.  The decision was appealed and to date no decision has been made on her claim.  Having phoned the social welfare appeals office on numerous occasions we have been advised that the case is with the chief appeals officer for decision, with an instruction to call back in a few days.  There has been no decision.  An applicant for a domiciliary care allowance in respect of her son in June 2010 was refused in August 2010 and the decision was appealed on medical grounds; a decision was only reached two weeks ago and I am thankful the allowance was awarded.An application for disability allowance was refused and the decision was appealed on medical grounds in 2010, with a listing for an oral hearing on 27 November.  That applicant is still waiting to be called for an oral hearing.  Only this week a 92-year-old woman being cared for by her son had care withdrawn, and the parties sought for the decision to be reviewed within the three-week period.  There was advice from staff that this would be pointless, and that it should be appealed, with an 18-month wait.These are just some examples and the Minister's colleagues and party can give similar cases.  There are lists of questions on the Order Paper every day dealing with similar cases throughout the country.  Irrespective of where we came from, the Minister has the current responsibility in this regard, so she has the responsibility to act appropriately.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The Deputy may not have been listening to the figures but there has been a reduction in the backlog left by Fianna Fáil.  Perhaps there is a Fianna Fáil nua and we did not hear the announcement that Fianna Fáil went out of business completely.  The Deputy is a member of the Fianna Fáil Party and it has, unfortunately, bequeathed this massive backlog of appeals.  We have begun to reduce that.I am sure the Deputy will be pleased to hear that on Friday I signed the regulations which bring community welfare officers and the social welfare appeal system fully into the Department of Social Protection.  We will now have an additional ten former HSE appeals officers integrated into the social welfare appeals office on foot of the changes.  It will take time to deal with the backlog and, as I mentioned to the Deputy before, in the case of applications based on medical decision making, it is important that people have as complete an application as is possible at the original stage.  We have discussed before how many people could help their position if there was more complete evidence at the time of the application.We have also put more emphasis on deciding claims on a summary basis where possible, particularly if the medical evidence is clear and strong enough.  That has brought down numbers but because of the massive unemployment which the Fianna Fáil Party bequeathed to the country, this is the unfortunate consequence of what Fianna Fáil did to the economy.  It melted it and employment down and left us saddled with the bank guarantee.  I take absolute responsibility to clear up the mess, and I am doing so while reforming the system.  I assure the Deputy on the matter.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise what many people see as an important issue.  I hope the Minister of State will share that view.  We were all absolutely shocked when we heard last Tuesday on the airwaves what women were facing in 2011 with regard to access to refuge.  The position has worsened.There has been a 42% increase in the number of women contacting domestic violence services in the past three years, and the recession has much to do with this because of pressure being put on families because of a loss of jobs, unemployment and little money coming into households.  There is also the stress in paying bills.  Some 7,235 women received support in 2010, up 5,000 since 2007.  Some 3,900 people, including 2,355 children, lived in refuges in 2010.  However, the scandalous aspect of this is that on 3,236 occasions women could not be accommodated due to lack of space.  Everybody thought this problem was in the past and that the issue of women and children accessing refuge and protection had been dealt with.Currently, there are 141 refuge places, a third of the minimum standard recommended by the Council of Europe.  This is scandalous.  According to the Council of Europe recommendation, the north west should have 24 family unit places but it only has two.  In the east region, which covers Dublin, it is recommended that there be 150 family unit places, but there are only 39.  Research shows, and the Minister will be aware of this from her own experience, that the most dangerous time for these women is when they attempt to leave an abusive and violent relationship.  Being turned away from a refuge due to lack of space places these women and their children in an extremely dangerous situation.  A total of 38% of the women who sought refuge said they had nowhere else to go.It is the most vulnerable people who feel the cost of the banker and developer bailout.  Since 2008, SAFE Ireland has reported cuts in funding ranging from 5% to 30% in the north-east region.  These are not feasibility cuts but cuts to the service.  In the Leinster area, services which provide 80% of services nationally were contacted by the HSE and were given two weeks notice of a 10% cut.  There must be an urgent response by the Minister.  Every day thousands of cases are being reported.  At a minimum the refuge in Kildare that is ready to get up and running should be opened as a priority.  Violent assaults, rape and abuse of children, including of the unborn through violent attacks on pregnant women, as has been reported by SAFE Ireland, are taking place in families and behind closed doors.  There must be an urgent response.The Government must commit to signing the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence without delay.  Ireland is one of a small number of countries that have not signed the convention, which was adopted by the Council of Europe on 11 May 2011.  The second step the Government must take is signing that convention to show the women, children and everybody in this country that it means business and will turn around the situation that has existed for the past three years.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I thank the Deputy for raising this topical issue as it provides me with an opportunity to clarify the current situation.Domestic violence is a serious health and human rights issue.  In March 2010, the Government launched a four year strategy to provide a framework for sustainable intervention to prevent and effectively respond to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Cosc is the national office for the prevention of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and was established in 2007 under the aegis of the Department of Justice and Equality.  Cosc's key task is to ensure the delivery of a well co-ordinated Government response to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.The HSE also launched its policy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence in 2010.  The principal actions of this policy are in line with the national policy.  The health care system is usually the first route through which domestic violence victims seek support.  HSE staff are trained to recognise, respond and refer appropriately to cases of domestic violence.  The HSE also manages the significant impact of domestic violence on the health and well-being of victims through primary care and hospital services.  HSE staff and allied health professionals provide a range of services to people who experience domestic violence.Nationally the HSE also funds 47 front-line domestic violence service providers.  Twenty of these provide refuge accommodation and this number has risen from 15 since 2000.  The services provide a wide range of supports such as advocacy and counselling and were funded to the amount of €I4 million in 2010.  Every HSE region in Ireland has at least one refuge available providing crisis emergency accommodation.  All but one, located in the western region, are accessible on a 24 hour basis.  There are ten counties in which refuge facilities are not located, but the support service providers in these locations may refer clients to refuge services in neighbouring counties.There are currently 138 emergency accommodation units funded by the HSE nationally. These units may offer accommodation to a single client or a client with accompanying children and are intended to provide emergency or transitional crisis accommodation.  Teach Tearmainn, a domestic violence service provider in Kildare, is on the point of completing a major new capital development which includes four self contained apartments to be used as crisis accommodation for victims of domestic violence.  Teach Tearmainn is currently funded by the Health Service Executive to provide an information and advice service to women who experience domestic violence in Kildare.  I recently met the committee that has been established to run Teach Tearmainn and with the two local Deputies, Deputy Martin Heydon and Deputy Jack Wall.The capital aspects of the new development were fully funded through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Teach Tearmainn has applied to the HSE for revenue funding to operate the new units.  While the HSE has indicated its broad support for the new project, there was no allocation for this budgeted in 2011 and all available funding for 2011 has already been allocated.  However, the HSE has undertaken to investigate potential avenues of funding for 2012 and this process is currently under way.  We should have news about it soon.Last Wednesday, the National Statistics on Domestic Violence 2010 were published by SAFE Ireland, the national representative body for 39 women's front-line domestic violence services.  These statistics show a substantial increase in demand for services in 2010 compared to 2009.  It is within the context of this increased demand for domestic violence services that the HSE is currently engaged in a national and regional review of domestic violence service provision.  The aim of this review is to ensure that funding is allocated according to need and areas of high demand are appropriately resourced.  I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully committed to addressing the problem of domestic violence.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I welcome the fact that there is an investigation of how to access money to open Teach Tearmainn in Kildare.  It appears from the Minister's comments that the money will be accessed.  It is important to get that facility up and running.However, I am still a little concerned about some of the points made.  All the reports show there has been an increase in domestic violence and in violence against women in the home.  There is concern in the Cosc office and in SAFE Ireland that progress is slow and that issues are not being dealt with quickly enough.  SAFE Ireland recommends that the needs and experience of victims be centre stage in any action being implemented.  It does not believe that is being taken on board and I ask the Minister to make a point of doing that.Although the Minister says the Government is fully committed on this issue, it must sign up to the Council of Europe convention on preventing and combating domestic violence.  That will clearly indicate that the Government fully supports the convention.  A total of 17 countries have already signed up to it and Ireland is in a small group of countries that have not signed it.  I do not know why.  I call on the Government to state that it will sign the convention within a short period.  That will show it fully supports the convention.It is scandalous that although the Council of Europe recommends that the north west of the country should have 24 family units, it only has two.  It recommends that the west have 41 but it only has 11; it recommends 36 in the mid-west but there are only 20; it recommends 39 in the north east but there are only 22.  This issue must be addressed and it is important that we address it soon.  We cannot continue to listen to women on radio stations speaking in absolute despair and sorrow.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I do not disagree with anything the Deputy says.  We are agreed that domestic violence is an absolute scandal.  However, we must also address the elephant in the room.  If there are that many women running with their children in fear of their lives to find refuge in places outside their homes, what are we doing about the perpetrator?  If the Deputy and I were attacked tonight on our way home, were beaten and terrified for hours and driven out of our homes, and if we knew the perpetrator, he would be charged.Do we really need to continue?  We do because the situation is such that we must provide accommodation for women and their children who are terrified.  God only knows what the long-term effects will be.  It is probably the only crime where the victim must leave home.  We have dealt with the issues of incest and rape and insist that the perpetrator be placed at a disadvantage.  The figures involved are minuscule.  I understand why victims of domestic abuse do not go the whole hog and go to court.  I also understand their worry and confusion.  In other cases, we do not depend on the victim, in respect of which I agree with the Deputy.  However, this is a bigger issue.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I move:That the Ceann Comhairle direct the Clerk of the Dáil to issue his Writ for the election of a Member to fill the vacancy which has occurred in the membership of the present Dáil consequent on the death on 10 June 2011 of Deputy Brian Lenihan, a Member for the Constituency of Dublin West.It is with a true sense of sadness that I move the writ occasioned by the passing of a remarkable politician and good friend to so many of us in this House.  It is hard to believe it is less than four months since Brian Lenihan left us.  I know I speak for every one of his colleagues on the Fianna Fáil  benches when I say we miss so much his enthusiasm, humour, wise counsel, political brilliance and, most of all, friendship.I take the opportunity to thank the Taoiseach, the leaders of all the others parties and all other Members of this House who spoke so genuinely and generously about Brian Lenihan when we paid tribute to him in June.  In Brian's case, all of that praise was well deserved and hard earned.The loss of Brian Lenihan to Irish public life is immense.  As I said previously, he was undoubtedly the outstanding public representative of this generation.  We, in Fianna Fáil, are fiercely proud of him and what he achieved for Dublin West and Ireland.  The courage and commitment he showed in staying in his post as Minister for Finance while battling a terminal illness and the exemplary manner in which he carried out his duties defined grace under pressure.Brian Lenihan faced events of a scale and magnitude with which no other Irish Minister has ever had to contend.  He did an outstanding job in extraordinarily difficult circumstances.  He was prepared to take unpopular choices, knowing there would be a political price to pay for them, because he believed such decisions had to be taken for the long-term good of the country.  He was criticised by many, especially at the time of the last budget, but that budget is on track and winning international notice, something the Taoiseach recognised last week.  It is becoming increasingly clear the measures Brian set in train were the right ones to stabilise the economy.  The very fact that those who walked through the division lobbies in this House in opposition to Brian's policies are now enthusiastically implementing them in government shows that he made the right choices and that he had the courage of his convictions.  Irrespective of the political battles in which we engage at election time or in debate in this House, it is proper that this point should be acknowledged and respected by everyone.We, in Fianna Fáil, are proud of Brian Lenihan's work and will continue to defend his reputation and protect his legacy.  Nowhere is the inspiring Lenihan legacy stronger than in Dublin West.  For 34 years Brian and his distinguished father before him gave remarkable service to their constituents across Dublin 15.  It is hardly surprising that for many in Dublin West, the Lenihan name is a by-word for efficiency and getting things done locally.Brian Lenihan was first elected to the Dáil in a by-election in April 1996 and the people of Dublin West returned him to the Dáil in four subsequent general elections.  Even when the tide was out for Fianna Fáil across the capital last February, Brian's constituents in Dublin West stood by him.  In the end they did not let him down in his final electoral battle, in which there was a sense of poetic justice because he had delivered day and night for people locally.  He was a politician who was respected and admired across the political spectrum in Dublin West for his great work rate on behalf of the constituency.Only last Thursday on the streets of Castleknock time and again I was reminded of the enormous regard in which Brian Lenihan had been held by the people he represented.  I always knew about his huge commitment to the people of Dublin West and it was wonderful to meet so many people who remembered him with such fondness.  People spoke to me about the tremendous work he had done in securing investment for Connolly hospital, the tireless support he had given to St. Francis's hospice in Dublin 15, his commitment to local sports clubs across Dublin West such as St. Brigid's and Castleknock Celtic, his work in delivering a new railway station on the Navan Road and his efforts in developing Blanchardstown Institute of Technology.  There are so many issues on which and so many people for whom Brian delivered during his 15 years as a public representative.  There can be no doubt he leaves behind a stunning record of achievement and accomplishment on behalf of the community in Dublin West.That great tradition of service to his neighbours, community and local people that characterised Brian Lenihan's career is something the Dublin West Fianna Fáil organisation is determined to preserve and build upon in this by-election.  We are proud to have Mr. David McGuinness as our candidate.  It would be unfair to say no one could fill the shoes of a political giant like Brian Lenihan but in David McGuinness, Fianna Fáil has a candidate of immense potential and with a true commitment to his locality.  He is a young man completely dedicated to the community in which he was born and bred.  He is a teacher in Riversdale community college and passionate about education as a vehicle towards social opportunity.  He is extremely active in the local community of Dublin 15 and serves on the boards of management of Castleknock community college, Coolmine community school, Luttrellstown community college, Blakestown school and Pobal Scoil Setanta in Ongar.  His work locally has given him a strong insight into and grasp of the issues that matter to the people of Dublin West.Aged only 25 years, David McGuinness was the youngest Fianna Fáil councillor elected in the country at the last local elections.  He also ably supported Brian Lenihan in February in a very difficult election for Fianna Fáil.  Brian was determined that David would run alongside him in the last general election, even when some party strategists argued that running one candidate might be the best option to retain the Fianna Fáil seat.  It is a measure of the man that he still managed to keep his eye focused on the needs of the future.  He felt it was important that a young candidate be given the experience of running in a general election in the hope this would stand to the party and the constituency at a later date.David McGuinness was someone Brian Lenihan had encouraged in politics from the first day David joined Ógra Fianna Fáil in Dublin West.  Brian was a firm believer in the necessity of bringing forward young people as a force for renewal and vitality in our political system.  David's career in politics is testament to this.  We look forward to him fulfilling all the potential Brian first saw in him when he encouraged him to seek a career in politics and give of himself to public service.David McGuinness is young man of integrity and ability and has a phenomenal work rate.  These are all values he learned working alongside Brian Lenihan during the years.  With all our Fianna Fáil members in Dublin West, he will be doing his utmost to ensure that distinguished tradition of local representation continues in Dáil Éireann.In the next four weeks Fianna Fáil will be campaigning hard to support our candidate, David McGuinness, in the by-election.  David's campaign will be a positive one highlighting the issues that matter to local people and articulating the concerns about which he hears on the doorsteps of Dublin West in places such as Corduff, Ladyswell, Huntstown, Hartstown, Clonsilla, Ongar, Clonee, Tyrrelstown, the Ward,  Blanchardstown, Carpenterstown, Porterstown, Castleknock and Swords.  Dublin West is a constituency which has been particularly badly hit by many of the problems of the economic crisis.  Both long-established and new communities are struggling with mortgage debt, unemployment and new pressures on local schools.  There has been a 3% increase in unemployment in Dublin West in the past six months and David will campaign on the need to create and defend IDA jobs in the constituency.Until recent times Dublin West was one of the fastest growing suburbs in Europe and even today the population of the constituency is far younger than the national average.  These demographics tell their own story in the context of a harsh recession in which many young families are grappling with unemployment, mortgage debt and negative equity.  Commuters are also suffering as Dublin West is far above the national average for the time residents spend in getting to and from work or school.  This is not helped by the recent illogical move to upgrade Chesterfield Avenue during the busiest traffic months of the year and the inexplicable decision by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to block the shovel ready status of metro west, a project for which he had vehemently campaigned when on this side of the House.With two Ministers immersed in Departments, Dublin West needs sensible and hard-working representation at local level.  David McGuinness is that candidate.  The problems the people of Dublin West are experiencing will not be solved by the parties of the hard left which offer nothing but the politics of protest, empty rhetoric and, in the final analysis, no credible solutions.  Dublin West also does not need another voiceless Government backbench Deputy whose election would serve no purpose but to bolster an already massive majority.  What Dublin West needs is a hard-working, enthusiastic local representative who is committed to holding the Government to account and delivering sane and sensible solutions to the problems and issues of concern to the people of the constituency.  David McGuinness is that candidate and Fianna Fáil will be making the case for his election on 27 October.  We believe he is the best candidate and will be doing our level best to ensure he follows in the footsteps of Brian Lenihan, a politician and friend whom we all miss greatly.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	243	When the people voted for change in February, it was not change as a buzzword or empty rhetoric but as meaningful root and branch reform and a new departure from the old corrupt and unsustainable way Governments have operated in the State for generations.  Unfortunately, the political class sold them empty rhetoric and buzzwords and a people crying out for hope bought the line.  Eight months on, they can see what change means for Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  Nearly 500,000 people are still on the dole and we are facing a regime of austerity not seen in a lifetime.  The Government is subservient to the EU-IMF bank bailout schemes which are not about economic sense or living up to responsibilities but about foisting the burden of a European banking crisis on the people of the State.The people have been reminded of the old adage of the new boss being the same as the old one, but they will not go back to the old days of believing nothing better is possible.  The imagination and hope of the people have been ignited and they will look past the Government and seek a better way forward.  Sinn Féin is that better way.  We have shown in opposition here and government in the North that we have the drive, capability and conscience to lead from the front to deliver for the people.  In the North we have stood fast when faced with Tory cuts, in stark contrast to the capitulation by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.  We have fought the cuts and saved services and jobs.  We have made job creation a priority.  Mr. Martin McGuinness has travelled to America to meet CEOs and business people and results and investment have followed.In the South we have been the voice of those struggling against a Government more concerned with meeting the targets of the European Union and IMF than the needs of the people.  We have stood up for local hospital services, distressed mortgage holders, children with special needs and struggling families and low paid workers.  Deputies Adams, McDonald, Doherty and others have held the Government parties to account and shown them up as uninspired opportunists implementing Fianna Fáil's failed policies while bringing very little to the table.  Thus far we have seen the continuation of the bailout and further moneys being thrown on the bonfire that is Anglo Irish Bank.  Prior to the general election we were told by the parties now in government that Anglo Irish Bank would not receive another red cent.  They were barely in the door when they handed over billions of euro of the people's money for nothing.  They spoke about burning bondholders, but all they have burned are the fingers of those who chose to believe them.In this context, I am glad to commend to the people of Dublin West an opportunity for change and a voice for ordinary working families.  That opportunity is presented by Mr. Paul Donnelly, the Sinn Féin candidate in the Dublin West by-election.  Aged 42 years, Paul Donnelly is chairperson of Sinn Féin in Dublin and a member of the party's ruling ard chomhairle.  He is the father of four children and has been living in Clonsilla in west Dublin for over 15 years.  He is a project worker with the school completion programme in Coolock and also works in Bonnybrook Youthreach, a second chance education centre for young people.  His involvement with Sinn Féin can be traced back many years to election campaigns in the north inner city where he was born.  He joined Sinn Féin in Blanchardstown in 1995, became the party's public representative in the area in 1996 and has stood in various local and general elections.  He polled 2,597 first preferences in this year's general election.Paul Donnelly is extremely active in the community, having served as a community representative in numerous projects.  He is chairperson of the Mountview-Blakestown community drugs team, a project in which he has been involved since its inception in 1996.  He was also a founding member of the Blanchardstown local drugs task force and the Mountview-Blakestown youth initiative.  He is also a community representative in the safer Blanchardstown forum, a community policing project which tackles crime and anti-social behaviour in significant parts of Clonsilla, Hartstown, Huntstown, Corduff and Mulhuddart.  An ardent Dublin GAA supporter, he is involved with his local St. Peregrine's GAA club as a juvenile mentor.Paul Donnelly is acutely aware of the challenges the people of Dublin 15 will face in the coming years, most notably the deteriorating economic situation, spiralling unemployment, the escalating drugs problem, the disgraceful waste of funds spent in renting portacabins in local schools while millions of euro are sent back to the Exchequer by the Department of Education and Skills, the shameful lack of purpose built youth facilities and the fear of closure of existing community centres.  Paul is committed to working hard to represent the whole community and will continue to fight to ensure the people's voices are heard.  He is determined to fight for all those who feel they have been let down by the politics of corruption, greed and self-interest.Paul Donnelly and I have been involved in the Save Connolly Hospital campaign and have campaigned regularly on the issue.  He will put people first.  He shares Sinn Féin's vision of treating everyone on the basis of equality rather than wealth.  He got involved in politics to make a difference and challenge injustice and inequality in his country.  He will work to create jobs, a fair and equitable taxation system that ensures those who can afford to pay the most pay their fair share and a health system that treats people as human beings when they are ill and need treatment rather than as customers to be sold health care packages.  He will continue to strive to ensure policing is focused on the problems the community faces, in particular, anti-social behaviour, drug dealing and intimidation, and that the justice system is reformed to focus on rehabilitation in order to address the revolving door prison system.Paul Donnelly stands for reform of the political system.  As a former councillor, he saw at first hand how much power was in the hands of a very small group of powerful council officials.  He recognises that the political system needs root and branch reform at local and national level if citizens are to have more of a say in what happens in their communities.  Mr. Paul Donnelly pledged to only take the average industrial wage from the disgracefully huge salary awarded by previous administrations to themselves, including Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party and the Green Party.  The surplus will be shared out between local community groups in Dublin West and will also be used to build Sinn Féin across the constituency.I have known Mr. Paul Donnelly for more than 20 years.  I commend him to the people of Dublin West and call on them to look at the Government's record, the inaction on jobs and the continued adherence to the deflationary cuts and the bank bailout started by Fianna Fáil.  They should look to the real candidate for change and progress, that is Mr. Paul Donnelly.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	We understand that this is a difficult time and that the by-election will be a difficult time for the family and close personal friends of the late Deputy, Brian Lenihan.  The Socialist Party and the United Left Alliance, our candidate, Councillor Ruth Coppinger, and me as director of elections understand that and pledge that this will not be a personalised campaign with the type of abuse and vitriol now filling the air and airwaves in the presidential election.  It will be a campaign on the real issues affecting the ordinary people of Dublin West and putting forward the left and socialist alternative to the problems we face in society and in the constituency.The Dublin West by-election gives an invaluable opportunity to the people of Dublin West to speak not only on their own behalf but on behalf of the entire country to pass judgment on this Fine Gael and Labour Party coalition and its record since it assumed power almost seven months ago.  The Socialist Party and the United Left Alliance and our candidate, Councillor Ruth Coppinger, will highlight the serious breach of promises by Fine Gael and the Labour Party made prior to the general election campaign and contrast that with their record since then.The Labour Party and Fine Gael promised change from the clapped-out policies of the Fianna Fáil Administration and its Green Party appendage that preceded them.  However, the Labour Party and Fine Gael have utterly embraced the savage austerity initiated by Fianna Fáil in conjunction with and at the behest of the EU-IMF and the ECB — the establishment institutions of Europe which had one agenda only, not the interests of the Irish people but to bail out the major European financial institutions, speculators and gamblers from their reckless dealings in Irish property.  Not only is it immoral and unjust but it is causing an economic disaster, with mass unemployment, cuts to the education and health services and tens of thousands of people, especially young people, being forced out of the country.The Labour Party and Fine Gael promised that they would make the bondholders and gamblers take severe cuts but what we have now is an abject U-turn.  For example, the €3.5 billion in payments to unsecured Anglo Irish Bank bondholders that the Minister for Finance said some months ago would be severely cut is to be paid in full between now and June 2012.  It is almost a similar figure to the savage €3.6 billion in cuts that this Government intends to implement in the budget in December.  After promising that it would not introduce water charges, the Labour Party with Fine Gael now propose to impose a household tax and a water tax that will quickly go from €100 to €1,000.  Those are impossible new burdens for many households and increasing strata of society.The people of Dublin West can take a stand against this austerity with its disastrous economic consequences, immorality and injustice.  The people of Dublin West can take a stand in the by-election in favour of and to support their crucial local health facility, Blanchardstown hospital, which is enduring savage cuts — €104 million in its budget two years ago and €84 million this year — leading to ward closures and serious problems to the extent that doctors are even concerned about whether they can continue to provide a safe service.  That is a betrayal by the Labour Party and Fine Gael of the people of Dublin West and what they said previously.It is ironic that the leader of Fianna Fáil would attack the left in Dublin West in the context of the by-election.  Fianna Fáil is the party that has reduced our society through its 14 years in government and consequent disastrous austerity policies to the crisis we have at the present time.  The Socialist Party and the United Left Alliance will fight for the alternative in this regard.  We will resist austerity.  We will campaign with people power and invite the people of Dublin West to stand with us.  We will advocate the economic alternative, to stop paying the gambling bondholders and to invest instead significantly in public ownership of financial institutions, introduce democratic control and, in terms of the euro zone crisis, to bring the catastrophic financial markets to heel with a democratic and socialist alternative to how they should be run.Councillor Ruth Coppinger has been a public representative for the past eight years.  She is an outstanding activist with a record second to none in fighting for proper planning and development in the area, in opposition to unjust charges, water taxes, bin taxes and the privatisation of services, education cuts and in support of her local hospital and many other issues.  As a Deputy she would use her position as a lever of power for the people of Dublin West.  What is the point in sending another backbencher to join the 113 that are already slashing the living standards of people?  She will be a representative on the average industrial wage.  Her election will be a signal that the United Left Alliance, the Socialist Party, and the left generally will begin and continue the process for a new political party of ordinary working people that will represent an alternative to the failed policies of austerity and those parties that implement them.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	245	This by-election is an opportunity for the people of Dublin West to hold the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government to account for the raft of false promises made before the election and the rapid series of betrayals that have occurred since then.In the typically cynical fashion of the political establishment here, Fine Gael and the Labour Party exploited the despair and anger felt by ordinary people who have been devastated by the economic crisis created by the greed of bankers, speculators and developers.  People have been devastated by the brutal austerity imposed in the aftermath of the crisis to protect those self-same bankers, speculators and developers.  They exploited the despair and anger to hoist themselves into power and into office promising change from the policies of the Fianna Fáil Government, but no sooner had they achieved office than they moved quickly to give us more of the same failed policies of protecting the super wealthy, bondholders and bankers, and doing the bidding of the EU-IMF at the expense of ordinary working people and the vulnerable in society.Fine Gael promised on every election poster to get Ireland working.  Since then what has it done?  It has continued the massacre of jobs in the public sector.It, along with the Labour Party, incredibly, is now promising to privatise vital State assets to corporate vultures to pay off the gambling debts of bondholders, something everyone knows will lead to more job losses for ordinary workers in this country.  The parties in Government promised before the election to protect public services and the vulnerable.  Instead, they have closed down hospital accident and emergency units and cut resources for those with special needs.  They talked about fairness before the election, and instead they have moved to attack the few protections for low-paid workers and raided the pensions of ordinary workers in this country to pay off the gambling bondholders.This election is a chance for the people of Dublin West to pass verdict on the Government's betrayals and false promises, and to point in a different direction of saying that the needs of ordinary people and the vulnerable sectors of society, and the priority of getting people back to work should be the first priority of any government that claims to represent the people.  Councillor Ruth Coppinger, standing in opposition to the Government, is someone who has a track record of standing with working people as they fight for justice and fair play.  It would be a tremendous message for the Government to elect Councillor Coppinger.  The people of Dublin West can be sure if they do that, she will stand with them in the battles ahead as the Government continues its reign of betrayal and austerity on the innocent people in this country who bear no responsibility for the crisis created by the corporate and political class in this country and in Europe.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	246	This by-election is an opportunity for the people in Dublin West to send a clear message that they want action, not empty promises, from the Government to tackle the mortgage crisis.  This is an area, ranging from Swords in north Dublin to Clonee on the Meath border, where over the past decade there have been huge developments of housing and apartments during the property boom.  Many of the 10,000 unemployed in Dublin West bought their homes in this period.  There was a deliberately inflated bubble, bringing significant profits for developers, builders and banks which forced people to take out huge mortgages on massively over-valued houses and apartments.  The United Left Alliance and Councillor Ruth Coppinger reject any notion that there is a moral hazard in assisting people who are victims of a bubble deliberately inflated by bankers and developers with the assistance of the Fianna Fáil-led Governments.Four key groups need assistance and Councillor Ruth Coppinger will fight tooth and nail on these issues.  People in their family homes, who are in arrears and who need short to medium-term assistance cannot be left to the banks.  We need an independent agency to assess their ability to pay.  Those who want out of the huge debt they cannot pay should have an option to be tenants in their own homes.  Those who, unfortunately, have already been evicted from their homes should have outstanding debt after sale written off.  This is a huge noose around the necks of ordinary people.  The problem of negative equity means we will have to bring mortgages into line with the value of property.  The banks have already been bailed out in this regard and we must bail out the people in the case of their homes.  The bankruptcy laws must be changed in order that no person in his or her family home is affected by bankruptcy laws and no person in a family home will see himself or herself caught up in the bankruptcy laws for up to 12 years.I call on the people in Dublin West to use this opportunity to use their vote to send a strong message to the Government, especially the Labour Party, that they want change, not broken promises of change.  They want real change to put people's needs before profits and greed.  Bail out the people, not the bankers.  The Socialist Party and United Left Alliance candidate, Councillor Ruth Coppinger, will make this issue one of the key issues in this by-election and, if elected, will bring that fight into the Dáil as a strong Opposition United Left Alliance TD.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I sympathise with the family and friends of the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.  The next couple of weeks will be a difficult time for them.This by-election has given a unique opportunity to the people of Dublin West to reject the false promises made by those in the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government in the run-up to and during the last general election.  I refer to the politics of the big lie that stated during the course of that election that the vulnerable would be protected and that there would be no austerity for those who were already poor or were under pressure on low and middle incomes.  Of course, the opposite happened.  Ordinary people now find themselves being ruled by a Government which has simply changed its clothes.  The same failed policies and austerity of Fianna Fáil are now being imposed by Fine Gael and the Labour Party.There are 10,000 unemployed in Dublin West and we need an emergency job creation programme for them.  Money can and should be made available to create emergency jobs for thousands of people in public works programmes right across the city and throughout the country.Another area where significant promises were made was social welfare.  Deputy Burton's so-called Department of Social Protection is cutting off people regularly.  It is taking 20 and 26 weeks for people to get a decision, for instance, on carer's allowance.  Home help services and the provision of special needs assistants are being cut.  These certainly were not the actions we were led to believe the Labour Party would pursue in this Government.Ordinary people on middle and low incomes are being hugely pressurised, not by one tax but by three.  There is the household utility charge, starting, we believe, at €100 and which will probably end up at a minimum of €500, the refuse tax, and now the water charge as well.  Ordinary families under huge pressure to pay their way will soon face a minimum bill of €1,000 a year, if not €1,500.This is a unique opportunity for the people of Dublin West to send a clear message to the Government to stop the austerity and put people back to work.  Councillor Ruth Coppinger of the Socialist Party and United Left Alliance is the candidate to do that.  I ask the people of Dublin West to support her and elect her to the Dáil, where she will stand up for them.  They can be assured that what she says before and during the election will be exactly what she says after her election to this House.  She will show that elected politicians can be truthful and honest in their campaigning.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	248	With the permission of the Acting Chairman, Deputy McConalogue, I wish to share my time with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar.It hardly seems like months have elapsed since Brian Lenihan so sadly died.  I again offer my condolences to his wife, Patricia, and his children, Clare and Tom, for whom I am sure this has been a difficult and painful period.  I had many political arguments with Brian.  We disagreed over the bank guarantee — he managed to persuade everyone else in the House to vote for it — but we still had a very friendly relationship and we worked together at all times for the best for the people in Dublin West.  We remember him.It is a reform of the Government that, unlike with the previous Government, by-election vacancies will be filled within six months of the vacancy arising.  That is good.  It gives the people of Dublin West an opportunity to fill the seat which was filled by someone as distinguished and as thoughtful in relation to his constituency as the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.The Labour Party has nominated my colleague, Councillor Patrick Nulty, to contest the by-election.  Councillor Nulty is a young councillor.  He was elected at the head of the poll at the last local elections.  He stood with me in this year's general election.  Mr. Pat Nulty comes from a family that has lived in Blakestown and Clonsilla for many generations.  He was brought up in Corduff and went to school in St. Patrick's national school in Corduff and Riversdale community college.  He studied at Trinity College before doing a master's degree at UCD.  His family and the local community can be very proud of the contribution this young politician has sought to make as a public representative of integrity, hard work and commitment to the people of Dublin West.When all the rhetoric is put aside, it cannot be denied that Dublin West has been the home of developers, as Deputy Joan Collins alluded to.  The Labour Party has been to the fore in ensuring the precious green belt in Dublin West has been maintained to some degree.  We inherited a terrible problem when we took office.  Good individuals throughout Dublin West have lost their employment through no fault of their own, but as a result of the greed of bankers and developers.  I agree with the analysis of some Opposition Deputies in this regard.  This Government is facing a difficult uphill task.  I am determined that we will turn the country around.  We will get people back into employment and decrease their dependence on social welfare.  Contrary to what some Members of this House think, people want to be financially independent, to work in jobs and to own their own businesses.  That is what most families and individuals want.  People do not particularly want to be on social welfare.  That is why the introduction of the jobs initiative was one of this Government's first acts when it took office in May.  Slowly but surely, the initiative is bearing fruit.Deputy Higgins referred to the issue of the debts owed by Anglo Irish Bank.  I remind him that during its short period in office, the Government has successfully concluded a renegotiation of the interest rate.  I said during the general election campaign that such a renegotiation was possible.  On the night the IMF deal was negotiated, I said that it was very onerous for Ireland and that the interest rate would have to be renegotiated.  I am glad to say that a Government comprising the Labour Party and Fine Gael has renegotiated the interest rate down from just under 6% to approximately 3%.  Fianna Fáil said it could not be done.  Others thought it could not be done, but it was done.  We now have to do some work on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  I suggest, with due respect to Deputy Higgins, that this is the most significant issue in relation to Anglo Irish Bank.  The arrangement that was made regarding promissory notes involves a charge of €3 billion, plus interest, on the budget of this country every year for ten years.  Fianna Fáil took a two-year interest holiday on the promissory notes, which currently attract an interest rate of 8.5%.A great deal of ingenuity and effort will be required from every member of this Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.  The recovery is slowly beginning to happen.  More than 900 people have taken up internships under the JobBridge scheme.  A further 500 people have transferred from the work placement programme to the internship scheme.  I am sure many Deputies feel it is not enough.  We have to try to nurture the process of recovery and reform.  We are reforming the social welfare system at a time when money is tight.  That is always difficult.  It is important that we reform the social welfare system.  It is not good enough to leave people on social welfare indefinitely, without hope of being able to work and look after their families independently.  Some people have such a patronising attitude to those who have unfortunately lost their jobs.  There has to be a key focus on getting people back into employment.  As a country, we will be better off when fewer people are on social welfare and more people are back in employment or starting businesses.  That is the formula this Government has adopted with regard to Ireland's economic recovery.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service, which is funded by the Department of Social Protection, is assisting tens of thousands of people throughout the country who are experiencing difficulty with mortgages and other debt.  The Department is spending €77 million a year on rent supplement for approximately 18,000 families that are in trouble with their mortgages.  The Deputies opposite may suggest that these measures are not sufficient, but they are important for the families that benefit from them.  When people cast their votes in Dublin West, I am sure they will consider thoughtfully the achievements this Government has chalked up in six short months as part of its reform agenda.  The country is now facing forward.  Slowly but surely, we are emerging from the disastrous bank guarantee, which was introduced by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and supported by many parties and individuals in the Opposition.  Unfortunately, Sinn Féin voted in favour of the guarantee on the night we voted on it.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	249	That is not true.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	250	I welcome moving of the writ for the Dublin West by-election.  Before I say anything else, it is important and appropriate to for me speak about Mr. Brian Lenihan, whose sad departure gave rise to this by-election.  He was a very good constituency colleague.  He always wanted to solve problems locally.  He often solved them quietly rather than running to the media or the barricades as others tend to do.  He was always willing to share information and to give the secret story of what was going on in government, even if that might not have been in his interests much of the time.  We had some very interesting chats.  He was very generous to the Opposition Deputies in his constituency.  He will be sadly missed by Fianna Fáil supporters and everyone in the Dublin West constituency, including those who did not vote for him.One of Brian Lenihan's last achievements was to obtain €3 million in funding from the Vote of the Office of Public Works for the upgrading of Chesterfield Avenue, which runs through the Phoenix Park.  In the very last leaflet he dropped in Castleknock, he claimed credit for securing the funds for the work in question.  It is happening in the winter rather than the summer because the tender was delayed.  I am pleased that Mr. Brian Lenihan's final achievement is being delivered on now, even if Deputy Martin and Councillor McGuinness think it is a terrible thing to do.  I agree with Mr. Brian Lenihan on that one.  The work needs to be done, even if it causes disruption in the Phoenix Park over the next few weeks.  Given that the money might not be there next year, it is important that the work is done this year.  At least the road will not fall apart altogether if we have a very cold winter.  I am grateful to my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Brian Hayes, for ensuring this money is being spent.  Of course, the Minister of State is Fine Gael's director of elections for the Dublin West by-election.  I hope the success he enjoyed as director of elections for the Dublin South by-election two years ago will be repeated on this occasion.This vacancy is being filled within a six-month period. That is a good change.  When we were in opposition, we promised that if we got into government, Dáil vacancies would be filled within six months.  We passed legislation in this House to facilitate that.  It is welcome that by-elections will be held to fill vacancies within six months from now on.The Leader of the Opposition mentioned metro west.  I assure him it was nowhere near shovel ready.  It was planned to proceed with an oral hearing in a few weeks' time.  That would have cost the State and the many local interests who were objecting to the project a great deal of money.  We all understand that even if a railway order had been secured, the project would not have gone ahead during the period of the order.  We would have had to go through the entire process again after several years, by which time the planning and environmental laws and railway technology may have changed.  On the advice of the National Transport Authority, I decided it was prudent to save the taxpayer at least €500,000 by not proceeding with the oral hearing.  When it appears that we have the money to fund the project, we will go ahead with the oral hearing.  I am very glad the decision has been welcomed by An Taisce and by some of the community groups, particularly in the Lucan area.What we had under the previous Government was denial.  Three years ago, the economy collapsed and it was very clear at that stage to anyone who could add and subtract that many of the major capital projects could not be afforded.  The last Government could not face up to this so it spent hundreds of millions of euros on planning, design, consultants and all the rest for projects it knew it could not fund.  It is my job as Minister responsible for transport to put a stop to this and to ensure our limited funds go, first, into maintenance and, after that, into improving existing infrastructure.  Only then will we put money into new projects.  It is important that instead of spending money planning ten or 15 projects we cannot afford to build, we would perhaps go ahead with one we can build.  In that way, we can at least improve people's lives.I visited James Connolly Memorial Hospital yesterday with the Ministers, Deputies Burton and Reilly, for the opening of the new endoscopy suite, which is a major part of the investment in the hospital.  I am very pleased the Minister, Deputy Reilly, confirmed that there is no question of the hospital being closed and that there are no plans to end the 24-hour accident and emergency service.  That is not even in the back of his mind and would not make sense in any case.  I thought it was very important that he made those statements publicly.  I call on members of Sinn Féin and the Socialist Party to stop scaring people and trying to scare up votes by peddling mistruths on the issue of accident and emergency services.The hospital is 5% over budget.  As a result, there will have to be some cutbacks in services between now and the end of the year.  This is what has to happen if people go over budget.  For example, I have to bring my Department in on budget and one of the measures I have taken to achieve that is to reduce the size of my office by 25%.  I would expect people in the health service to co-operate with whatever is necessary to bring hospitals in on budget.  The era when people overspend, knowing they will get extra money at the end of the year, is over.  Hospitals get their budget at the start of the year and they stick to it.  That is the way proper government works.I referred earlier to Deputy Martin's comments on Chesterfield Avenue in the Phoenix Park.  I watched the Socialist Party candidate last night belittling and mocking the fact that the Government has provided money for all-weather pitches in Hartstown and Clonee, and she suggested that, somehow, these would not be built following the by-election.  I can assure the House they will be as I will make sure they are.  I look forward to greeting Councillor Coppinger when I open those pitches in the new year and I look forward to providing many other all-weather pitches throughout the Mulhuddart electoral area and other areas where they will be very much needed in coming years.I commend Councillor Eithne Loftus, the Fine Gael candidate.  What Dublin West desperately needs is a local TD, working hard on the ground, one who is a member of a Government party and will actually have an influence on what happens, rather than one who just complains and knocks the area in the way other politicians do.  Councillor Loftus is originally from Mayo but has lived in Castleknock for more than 30 years.  She is a true community activist, who campaigned for a secondary school when there was none, who served on the board of her children's primary school and who gave so much voluntary time and effort for so long.  I commend her to the House and to the people of Dublin West.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Bill I am introducing today will act as another key element in the transformation of road user culture in Ireland.  It is more than 50 years since the first road death statistics were compiled here and, in that period, we have witnessed huge social, political and cultural change.  Road safety has not been isolated in this regard.  We have taken on new practices and made them inherent in our daily lives.  The majority of us now wear seat-belts, we put children into car seats and we ensure our vehicles are roadworthy.  We continue to accept and endorse the measures that keep us and our families safe.Such willingness to change has provided certain rewards.  While it is hard to celebrate statistics that relate to death, it must be recognised there has been considerable progress in such terms, particularly in the past ten years.  This must be considered against the backdrop of unprecedented numbers of vehicles on the roads.  Vehicle numbers have increased by 44% in the past ten years, with more than 2.4 million registered vehicles now using our roads whereas, in that period, the number of people dying on our roads has fallen by 48%.  Last year had the lowest recorded number of deaths — 212 — since records began back in 1959 and we are on target to improve further on these figures in 2011.However, we cannot become complacent and we need that transformation in the culture of driving to continue.  In the Seanad last week, Senator Barrett stated that if we were starting from scratch and knew that an activity would entail the death of 200 people every year, we might not proceed with its introduction.  In that context, I find it somewhat surreal to talk about 200 fatalities in a positive sense.  However, put in a historical context, this is a good news story.  In 1972, an incredible 640 people died on our roads, an average of some 50 deaths a month, many more than died in the Troubles that year.  By 2001, ten years ago, the numbers dying were still significant at 411.  Major changes in many areas have, thankfully, helped in halving that figure over the past decade.What, therefore, are the factors that contributed to this reduction?  First, the standard of vehicles being produced is far higher and far safer than before.  Items such as seat-belts, air bags and improved braking systems have ensured that even when collisions occur, the chances of death or serious injury is reduced.  We have also introduced the NCT system that carries out regular checks on vehicles to make sure they are fit for use.  The road network has been upgraded and motorway and dual carriageway driving has been proven to enhance safety.  We have seen the introduction of deterrents such as penalty points, fixed penalty notices and charges and, most recently, the GoSafe safety camera network.The Garda Traffic Corps was established and has played its part in making our roads safer and, in 2006, the Road Safety Authority began its work.  The dedication and commitment of the board, CEO and staff of the RSA has played a huge part in raising public awareness of the everyday dangers that motorists, cyclists and pedestrians face and the strategies it has pursued have led to a safer environment for all road users.Perhaps the most important change that has taken place over those ten years has been the attitude of the general public to road safety matters.  We have witnessed a significant culture change.  No longer is it acceptable to a majority to drink and drive, the wearing of seat-belts has become the norm, both in the back and the front of cars, there is greater awareness of the dangers and consequences of speeding, and responsible people do not use hand-held mobile phones while driving.While the last Government gets a great deal of criticism for its management of the economy, which is well deserved, it is important to recognise that it made a priority of road safety and that many of the measures it introduced have saved thousands of lives.  At the same time, it is also important to recognise that this was done with cross-party Oireachtas support.  The Oireachtas too has been instrumental in adopting legislation to put in place greater safeguards and penalties in regard to the continued threats to life and limb on the roads.  Over the years, road safety measures and initiatives have been one of the few areas that has enjoyed all-party support in this House, and I am sure this will continue.A major contribution to road safety in recent years has been the enactment of robust road safety legislation that has concentrated on delivering targeted road safety measures.  Last year, we made considerable changes to the intoxicated driving legislation under the provisions of the Road Traffic Act 2010 and this year those provisions relating to mandatory breath testing were strengthened under the Road Traffic Act 2011, the first legislation enacted under the new Government.This No. 2 Bill is the eighth legislative initiative that has been taken on traffic law in the past decade, which truly reflects the commitment by all parties and stakeholders to road safety.  While the provisions in the Bill are not new, they will allow us to implement and strengthen the initiatives we have already agreed through the passing of the Road Traffic Acts 2010 and 2011.  The 2010 Act provides for the lowering of the current drink driving limits for all drivers, with a particular focus on learner, novice and professional drivers.  While the new limits have been subject to much media debate, there is now a general awareness and acceptance that these measures will be, and should be, implemented without delay.The necessary breath testing instruments for the lower limits are being provided and the administrative and operational systems to support the measures are being finalised.  The Bill will make key amendments to strengthen and improve the related legislative provisions before the new limits come into force.  The Road Traffic Act 2011, which was enacted earlier this year, amended the mandatory alcohol testing provision of the 2010Act and was commenced in June.  The commencement of that provision made breath testing of drivers for alcohol mandatory in situations where a person has been injured in a collision, or where a driver is suspected of consuming alcohol when driving or being in charge of a vehicle.  My commitment to endorsing mandatory breath testing is again being represented in this Bill where the same mandatory testing provisions will now be applied at the new lower drink driving limits.  The Bill reflects the changes made in the 2011 Act and further clarifies some of the related intoxicated driving provisions of the 2010 Act.  In essence, this Bill will bring greater cohesiveness and strength to the intoxicated driving legislation, thus making it more resistant to legal challenge and more effective as a deterrent to bad driving choices.In terms of the timescale involved, Members will be aware that it was necessary to procure new evidential breath testing instruments to measure the lower blood alcohol concentration levels.  The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is well advanced in the testing and installation of these instruments and a detailed training programme for An Garda Síochána in the use of the instruments has been provided by the bureau.  All stakeholders are on schedule for commencing the new limits in the coming weeks.  As Members can appreciate, I want this legislation in place as quickly as possible in order that drivers will receive a strong message before the October bank holiday and the Christmas period that drink driving is not an option and cannot be tolerated.  When operational, drivers can expect to be tested in more circumstances than before with more stringent limits being applied.  For learner, novice and professional drivers, the lower limits will effectively mean a policy of zero tolerance.In line with the Government's new proposals relating to the introduction of legislation, I held preliminary discussions on the general scheme of the Bill with members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Transport, Culture and the Gaeltacht.  I found the engagement very useful and its Chairman has since written to me with the joint committee's proposals and recommendations, to which I will give careful consideration.  Following discussion with the joint committee and the Attorney General, I decided to divide the provisions of the general scheme into two separate Bills.  I seek to introduce mandatory breath testing at the lower limits as quickly as possible and consequently this No. 2 Bill is concentrated in the main on these provisions.  I intend to publish another Bill before the end of the year to address the other issues discussed with the joint committee.At this juncture, I wish to provide more detail on the provisions of this Bill.  Most of the amendments proposed in this Bill are technical and some are minor.  The Bill is largely a tidying-up exercise with a view to bringing greater cohesiveness to intoxicated driving legislation.  The aim of the amendments in section 2 is simply to bring clarity to the type of information a garda can demand from a person who does not produce a driving licence.  A garda can ask for a person's name, address and date of birth and failure to provide any or all of this information will be viewed as an offence.  This level of information is vital to following up on an offence and for obtaining successful prosecutions.  The 2010 Act already allows the Garda to ask for this information but the amendments in section 2 will make the provisions easier to interpret and should minimise any confusion when commenced.Section 3, which was inserted following the agreement of the Seanad, makes similar amendments to section 107 of the Principal Act relating to the duties of a person to give certain information on demand by a member of the Garda Síochána.  Again, this section is a clarifying provision.  Section 4 restates through substitution certain sections of the principal Act.  However, amendments also are being made to bring clarity to the offence of knowingly driving a dangerously defective vehicle.  I do not want there to be any doubt about who could be prosecuted for an offence under section 54.  The amended wording more closely resembles the original wording in the principal Act.One of the more significant amendments arises in section 6 and relates to failure or refusal to produce a driving licence.  While the overall policy remains the same as in the 2010 Act, the wording in this section has been altered substantially.  The amendments are on foot of legal advice relating to the 2010 Act and recommendations by the Attorney General's office.  Section 6 amends, by substitution, section 8 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 to bring clarity to the obligations related to the production of a driving licence where a person is required to provide a specimen under sections 9, 10, 12 or 14 of the 2010 Act.  This section was amended in the Seanad to include sections 12 and 14.  If a person fails or refuses to produce a licence, it shall be presumed that the person does not hold a licence until the contrary is shown and he or she can prove otherwise.  As it currently stands, the legislation immediately designated the person to be a "specified person" in the same circumstances, and it is this designation that was considered to require legal enhancement.  A specified person is a learner, novice or professional driver.  Section 6 also inserts a new section 8A into the 2010 Act to bring clarity to the options available to the courts with regard to offences.Section 7 amends the Road Traffic Act 2010 by substituting section 9 to reflect the obligations on drivers to provide a preliminary breath test as set out in the Road Traffic Act 2011.  Section 9, as amended, provides for the mandatory preliminary breath testing of drivers where a member of the Garda Síochána is of the opinion that a driver has consumed alcohol or where a driver has been involved in a collision in which a death or injury that requires medical attention has occurred.  The reference to "death" in the section is a new provision simply to ensure there are no loopholes in the mandatory testing element.Section 8 amends the 2010 Act by substituting section 14 to reflect the adjusted policy of the Road Traffic Act 2011.  The section provides for an obligation on a driver to provide a blood or urine specimen while in hospital when that person has been involved in a road traffic collision and appears or claims to have been injured.  There is nothing new in this section, which simply combines existing legislation into a more appropriate legal location.Section 9 provides for a number of technical and minor amendments to the Road Traffic Act 2010.  There are a couple of amendments under this section, however, that I wish to highlight.  Section 9(a) substitutes new text for the definition of “specified person” in section 3 of the Road Traffic Act 2010.  Section 3 is being amended to provide that a person who does not hold a current licence for the vehicle concerned will be categorised as a specified person when prosecuting for intoxicated driving.  This amendment reflects and reinforces existing legislation that all drivers must hold a current licence at all times.  Section 9(d) amends section 12 of the Act to provide that a person can also be tested at a hospital subsequent to arrest and not just at a Garda station.In essence, that summarises the Bill.  While Members are aware that road traffic legislation is complicated, convoluted and heavily litigated, I hope I have explained the provisions clearly and look forward to hearing their contributions.Although this Bill is not about amending the drink driving limits, I anticipate that some of the debate will revolve around these limits, given that the provisions in the Bill relate to intoxicated driving.  I reiterate that the issue of the limits was dealt with adequately in the Road Traffic Act 2010 and the levels set out are appropriate.  In determining what the limits should be, in the context of the 2010 Act, advice and expertise were sought from the Road Safety Authority.  This advice was informed by a number of issues, including known driver behaviour, past offending rates, enforcement practicality, best international practice and research, as well as analysis of data held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.The message not to drink and drive is clear and lower limits undoubtedly will strengthen that message.  People no longer tolerate drink driving, as was evident in a recent study conducted by the Automobile Association.  This study found that 87% of motorists in Ireland believe that drink driving is shameful.  This viewpoint may seem harsh but statistics show that alcohol plays a contributory role in one out of every three fatal accidents.  It is important, therefore, that we reach the remaining cohort of people, that is, the 13% who do not share these strong views.  Perhaps these drivers think the risk is worth taking but Members of this House do not.  The measures being implemented over the coming months will reflect what the majority believes about intoxicated driving.  Hopefully, a more stringent regulatory regime will convince those who still engage in drink driving to reconsider and evaluate their choices.  A car, in certain circumstances, can be a lethal weapon.  If used without due care and responsibility, it can cause untold devastation for families and communities.  I look forward to Members' co-operation in facilitating the passage of this Bill and commend it to the House.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill which gives effect to policy decisions taken in the Road Traffic Acts of 2010 and 2011.  Although the previous Government was responsible for them, I acknowledge that a strong cross-party approach was taken on all sides of the House and across the political divide.  The Minister may rest assured that from my perspective, this will continue while he continues to introduce appropriate legislation to continue the efforts to save lives on the roads.  I share with the Minister the sense that it is not acceptable that 200 people still die on the roads.  However, in an historical context, the performance over the past ten years has been exceptional when one takes into account the increased number of vehicles on the road, as well as some of the challenges encountered on foot of the influx during that period of drivers from outside the region in which people are familiar with driving on the left side of the road.  This posed a challenge and certainly was responsible for some of the patterns of death on the road.  Nevertheless, the numbers have borne up well and continue to move in the right direction.We cannot be and the Minister will not be complacent.  This process certainly will become more difficult because as with any aspect of life, the principle of a diminishing return for the investment one makes holds true.  Consequently, it will be harder to achieve further incremental reductions in the number of road deaths and will take much greater effort and a more sustained approach right across the various different heads.The Minister has set out clearly the measures, both legislative and in terms of investment, that have taken place over the past ten years.  As I believe they have been supported by virtually all Members, I will not go back over them.  However, we need to continue our work on the motorway network, an issue I have raised in the House in the past.  There is a deficiency in terms of the rest stops, which I have discussed with the NRA.  We will need to be more imaginative in how we can develop the truck and car rest stops along motorways.  There is evidence that people's habits require them to keep moving to the next point at which they can stop, effectively at a service stop on the road.  People show resistance to exiting the motorway even though the services are available 50 yards beyond the end of the off-ramp.  Unfortunately we need to work on driver behaviour to convince people that if they are tired or feeling slightly sleepy they should take the appropriate stop.  Some of the work has been done.  Since we raised it here before, we have seen some of the rest areas without services that are now available and open but sadly we need to do much more to ensure services and facilities are available.  It does not need to be the full gambit of services and does not need to be a €3 million facility but something very small that can provide coffee and tea, and an appropriate rest area with the appropriate lighting so that people feel secure and safe particularly at night if they decide to come off the motorway.Obviously there will be great challenges in terms of the Minister's capacity to invest in the road network.  He spoke about the economic situation in which he finds himself, for which I have some sympathy.  We all would have liked to have seen the road network developed in line with the National Roads Authority projections, but that will not happen and will impact on the Minister's ability to continue the effort to reduce death on the road.  It will be necessary to take that into account when decisions are taken regarding resolving some particularly bad stretches of road.  Priority should be given to the ones that have the best chance of delivering a reduction of deaths on the road.It is important not to be complacent.  I regard the three pillars of road safety policy being legislation, enforcement and education — notwithstanding investment in the road network.  It will become more difficult to identify legislative matters that will require primary legislation.  Obviously some of that will be dictated depending on how challenges appear in court.  As we are reaching a point where enough legislation will be in place, we need to look at the other two areas.  Enforcement is critical and it is obviously a challenge particularly following the Government's decision to reduce the number of gardaí by up to 2,000 which will impact on the capacity to enforce existing legislation.  I hope the Minister uses his good offices to put pressure on bringing Garda numbers back to where they were because without that level of staffing it will not be possible to enforce the legislation we pass here and ensure offenders do not avoid detection.  The threat or risk of getting caught is a far greater incentive than the knowledge that a driver is breaking the law.  Some people will still take a chance regardless if they feel they will not get caught.  On the one hand the Minister is doing good work by adding to the volume of legislation, but on the other hand if it is obvious to the patron of the local establishment that he or she can get away at night or whenever without detection we are sending out the wrong message and will not be helpful in the quest to reduce deaths on the road.The Minister has seen the statistics and knows the phenomenal cost of each death on the road, not just in monetary terms but also to individual families' lives and the pressure it puts on the health service, which also has challenges as a result of the economic situation in which we find ourselves.  We need a more aggressive approach to enforcement, which is not to suggest that the gardaí are not doing their jobs — they certainly are.  However, with reduced numbers we have a problem.The third pillar is the education of drivers.  The Road Safety Authority is doing much more to ensure that young people start by understanding that driving is a privilege that brings with it responsibilities and the necessity to understand the destruction that can be caused if they decide to drink and drive.  While relatively good work is being done in that regard, I am not sure we are communicating in the way we did in the past.  The national broadcaster was very helpful at a stage when on a monthly basis it produced the statistics of those who had died during that month.  That was at a time when approximately 30 people were dying per month.  That was very chilling and was very helpful.  Surveys at the time indicated it assisted people in taking the decision not to drink and drive.  Anything that can be done in that education and communication area will back up the body of legislation.As the focus shifts from legislation and as the pressure comes on enforcement there is a greater requirement to put more effort into educating and communicating the message, not just in terms of driver behaviour and culture, but bringing home to people that they are putting their own lives at risk.  Many people do not see it that way and the Minister can make considerable progress even in a financially constrained environment.The next item is the elephant in the room to a certain extent.  While we all want to share in the positive progress made in reducing deaths on the road, there is a rural dimension to this which has been echoed by people in the Minister's party and mine during debates on previous Bills which made it more difficult for certain people in rural areas who believe very much part of their social existence is the capacity to drink a pint or two and be able to get home.  It is not about driving, but about being able to get home.  It is about being able to have that social interaction in a rural environment where there is not access to public transport, footpaths and lighting which would be available to those living in an urban setting.  I know discussions took place under the previous Government, led by the former Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, who had responsibility for rural development.  I ask the Minister to give further consideration to the rural transport initiative to find a way to give support to communities through expanding the existing transport network through the RTI which represents very good value for money.Failing that, some particularly responsible publicans have made efforts to purchase vehicles and have set up schemes to assist them in maintaining their business by providing that service.  While I am not sure what further measures could be taken, perhaps some taxation changes could be made in the budget.  The Minister might consider introducing appropriate assistance by way of either tax deduction or changes to allow such people to provide that transport service.  The bigger ones clearly can do so because they have the turnover and see it as an investment in the community.  In the more isolated rural areas it is more difficult to provide such a facility to get people home.I assure the Minister of our continued support for his work.  I wish him well with this legislation which we will not oppose and we will not delay its passage.  While we look forward to its introduction, I ask the Minister to consider introducing appropriate measures to assist those in rural areas to have access to the social engagement to which they have become accustomed and which is very much part of their lives.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	254	We all know people who have lost someone on our country's roads.  We have come a long way, but the reminder of the huge loss of life is on the sides of the road in every county, on the crosses which dot the State due to road deaths.  One of the few positive aspects of the previous Government's record over the past ten to 15 years is that there was success in reducing the number of road fatalities.  This was done through a mix of public awareness, education, and adjustments to enforcement and licensing.  The number of road deaths has fallen dramatically as a result of these measures, which brought home the realities to people of the potential danger of car travel and the responsibility of all people to keep safe and to be considerate towards others.Road safety advertisements are vivid and graphic, but they have caused people to rethink actions and attitudes to driving, taking in drink driving, driving while on a phone call, or the recent phenomenon of texting while driving.  Those advertisements have increased awareness, in spite of being very graphic.  They represent the horrible reality to which we must all face up when we turn the key in the ignition.  Driving is dangerous, and caution and care are essential.I welcome the Bill.  It promotes road safety in a sensible and proper manner.  I particularly welcome recent proposals by a Minister in the North, Mr. Alex Attwood, MLA, that there will be harmonising of limits across the island, which is common sense policy and which will aid drivers, pedestrians and law enforcement officials in keeping the roads as safe as possible.  This is critical for communities along the Border.  A good next step would be for the Minister to work through the North-South Ministerial Council to develop a harmonised road safety policy and enforcement across the whole island to ensure the safety of pedestrians and motorists North and South.  I encourage the Minister to continue this work.In welcoming the Bill, I draw attention to the fact that early figures for 2011 show a slight spike in deaths.  I hope this will not become a trend.  I am concerned about a possible contradiction between this Bill to enhance road safety and other Government policies and actions that result from budget cuts.  Planned and already implemented cuts to public services are very likely to have a direct impact on front line services.  It would be wrong for budget cuts to have an impact on the ability of the Garda to enforce this Bill.  It would also be wrong if budget cuts had an impact on the ability of the Garda to reduce the number of intoxicated and dangerous drivers on our roads, and remove unsafe vehicles.  It would be wrong for such cuts to affect the ability of emergency services to respond to accidents and the ability of accident and emergency units to deal with major road traffic trauma.  There is a possibility that the good work of this Bill could be undone by spending cuts.Drink driving is a major issue and it clearly impairs drivers.  There has been a massive cultural shift in how people view drink driving, and great work has been done to discourage people from engaging in this grossly irresponsible behaviour, but additional measures must be explored.  Examples include providing options for rural areas which do not have public transport and which have already faced cuts to the rural transport programme.I take this opportunity to highlight briefly an issue raised by Senator Kathryn Reilly, namely, emergency responses.  Ambulances have to be first at the scene of an accident, and if the fire brigade is required, it will be sent out.  This could lead to problems if a car goes on fire, as the fire brigade will not be at hand as a first response to deal with the fire.  There are many cases across the State where an ambulance was helpless until the fire brigade arrived.  The idea of an automatic call to the fire service as well as the ambulance service must be examined.My party supports the measures in the Bill to ensure continued safety on our roads, with the objective of continuing to lower the number of road deaths.  We cannot afford to cut the front line services or driver testing services.  The Garda needs to be adequately funded to deal with this problem, including the provision of new breath testing equipment, as well as equipment to deal with drug testing, which I believe the Minister is examining.  We cannot undo the good work of this Bill by under funding other vital aspects of road safety.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	255	I welcome the Bill and I cannot imagine there will be any resistance to it passing swiftly through the Dáil.  It adds to the already large body of legislation that has been enacted over the years.  There has been such a cultural shift in the past 30 years.  I remember car parks outside pubs that were absolutely choc-a-block 20 or 30 years ago.  I am thinking of The Hitching Post in Leixlip, which is now a supermarket.  There used to be cars parked out on the road because the pub's very large car park was full.  There has been such a change in culture and attitude since then, and we need to continue that.I welcome the clarity that has been brought to the Bill in respect of categories such as a person with a driving permit and a professional driver.  I would have thought it was a given that somebody who was involved in a serious vehicle accident would have been tested, but it is welcome that this Bill makes that very clear.  There are provisos to that whereby it will not be done if it is injurious to the individual.The Road Safety Authority has done some excellent work on the road safety strategy, but I do not think we should look exclusively at fatalities.  A programme was recently broadcast about rehabilitation and the life changing injuries that are just as significant when we consider how to factor in the importance of continuing to change that culture and make sure that there is compliance.There are different elements to road safety, and one of those is the issue of penalty points.  I did a bit of analysis on penalty points about 18 months ago.  My own constituency had the highest penalty point count, yet the number of fatalities and accidents did not warrant that.  I got a big print out from the Department of Transport, and I was able to narrow it down to the locations where more than 100 penalty points had been issued.  I found 56 such hot spots and obviously the people who got those points could be from any part of the country.  However, when I examined it further, there was one location where 3,269 penalty points were issued since the penalty points system began.  Ironically, that location is the widest and safest road in the country.  It is a three lane carriageway — a segregated road — between the Red Cow roundabout and the Kildare county boundary.  I remember being at council meetings in Kildare when officials argued that segregating traffic creates a much safer environment, yet that was the location where the largest number of penalty points were issued.  I intend to look at these figures again because I know the regime has changed, but this is about shooting fish in a barrel rather than road safety.We must be serious about placing Garda and other speed checks at appropriate locations.  It is interesting to note there is insufficient space for a speed check vehicle at some of the most dangerous locations on the roads.  People know full well there will not be a speed check on windy roads because in many cases there is insufficient space for a speed check vehicle to pull in.  I could draw attention to a number of specific locations where there is a high accident rate and one does not see speed checks.  The figures in this regard need to be closely scrutinised.Section 3 deals with persons who knowingly drive a dangerous vehicle.  I presume, perhaps wrongly, that the inclusion of this section may have been influenced by a "Prime Time" programme broadcast a number of months ago.  It is unacceptable for a person who decides to leave his or her car at home to discover that the taxi in which he or she is travelling is unsafe.  I have doubts about the roadworthiness of some vehicles on the road, including some of the taxis in which I have travelled in recent months.  The Taxi Regulator and the Garda Síochána must ensure enforcement is tight in this area.While road design and upkeep are important factors, speeding is a very serious aspect of road safety.  It is essential that regulations on drink driving, speeding and other aspects of road safety are enforced because without enforcement, it is pointless to enact legislation.Since my re-election to the Dáil, I have continually raised with the Minister for Justice and Equality the issue of the distribution of Garda personnel.  It is clear that the gardaí in training in Templemore will be the last recruits for some time.  There is no doubt that no new gardaí will be recruited to augment Garda numbers in areas in which numbers are low relative to the size of the population.  As a result, areas that are weak in terms of Garda numbers will pay a price for the lack of recruitment.  The worst county in terms of Garda personnel relative to the size of the population is Kildare.  Other counties with low numbers of gardaí include Meath, Wexford, Kilkenny, Carlow, Laois and Offaly.  The Kildare Garda division had 328 gardaí serving a population of 209,000 in September 2010, despite the county having the fourth highest population in the State, having overtaken, in population terms, the county and city of Limerick in the census before last.  This means each garda in the county is responsible for 640 people.  The position at other locations is dramatically different.  For example, the Sligo-Leitrim Garda division has 331 gardaí serving a population of 97,000.  In other words, counties Sligo and Leitrim, with a population 110,000 lower than that of County Kildare, have more gardaí.If Garda numbers are low in terms of the size of the population, it will have an impact on the quality of the service provided, including enforcement.  There is no point in having excellent laws in place on drink driving and speeding if it is not possible to carry out Garda checks.  Having spoken to the Minister for Justice and Equality about this issue, it is his view that Garda deployment is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  It appears, however, that the approach adopted to deployment is "what one has one holds" and that it is not possible to transfer gardaí between divisions.  We have the additional problem of the moratorium on recruitment.  These are major issues which will have a significant impact on the ability of the Garda to enforce the legislation before us.As I stated, some of the initiatives taken in the Bill are very welcome in that they provide for a degree of clarity where there was none previously.  The legislation also ensures there will be a better chance of enforcing the law where transgressions are detected and cases brought before the courts.  The decision to differentiate between classes of drivers is an important and welcome one.  I hope the Bill which I support will contribute to improving road safety.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I will share time with Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick.I welcome this important Bill.  We must send a message regarding the abuse of alcohol in society, whether from a social or cultural point of view or while driving.  Ireland, as a nation, has a problem with alcohol which needs to be addressed.  Action is required before it is too late and, as law makers, it is our job to legislate for the common good and the safety of all citizens.  The culture of alcohol consumption and misuse must change.I welcome the Minister's comprehensive and enlightened speech.  It should be used across our educational establishments in which we are trying to promulgate a message not only of road safety but also of showing care and respect for others and taking responsibility.  It is time that we recognised that we have a responsibility when we are behind the wheel of a car.  Not only are we going on an excursion, but we are also taking to the public highway and we must share it with and show respect towards other road users.As the Minister noted, it is no longer acceptable to drink and drive, which is a welcome development.  In rural areas people used to go to the pub for one or two social drinks before driving home.  However, recent changes in the drink drive limit have had an impact on this practice.  I hope the Minister will consider the possibility of working with vintners, rural agencies and others to provide some form of public transport for those affected.We have engaged in a great process regarding road safety and I compliment the previous Government on its efforts in this regard.  We have changed mindsets and driving behaviour and opened people's eyes to the dangers of bad driving and consuming alcohol while driving.  We must now do similar work on the taking of illegal drugs while driving.  I hope this will be a platform in the future.The Road Safety Authority deserves great praise for the work it has done in pushing out boundaries by encouraging people to examine their own behaviour.  Its road safety advertisements have left a lasting impression.  The testimony and narrative of the parents and siblings of people who have died in road traffic accidents resonate because their stories are human.  In her very good speech Deputy Catherine Murphy gave us statistics and different representations from throughout the country.  We are talking about human lives, the sons, daughters, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives of people.  If this Bill does nothing else but open the minds of a generation aged between 16 and 35, it will have been worthwhile.  This is not about Government or politicians taking on the vintners, the pub trade or the alcohol industry but about human lives being saved and transformed as a consequence of good legislation.I return to the three E's of education, enforcement, engineering.  I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Catherine Murphy.  In some of the areas where we need to have law enforcement such as speed cameras and vans, we have none.  In my naivety I cannot comprehend why there can be two or three Garda checkpoints on the Cork-Dublin motorway, on a straight stretch of road capable of accommodating cars at speeds of 120 km/h, when on certain parts of our public highways there is no enforcement.  That needs to be examined.  There must be joined-up thinking.I return to the issue of education.  It is very important we use the transition year module in secondary schools as a medium for reaching towards young people.  Teenagers are impressionable.  They are in their formative years and need to be taught.  They see some of their peers learning to drive and driving.  They see certain behaviour as thrill seeking and try to imitate it.  They see some of us, who perhaps drive slowly, as boring.  I hope we can have a cross-party approach with the VEC, the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments, and go into schools.  In my school in Ballincollig there was a very good driving module as part of transition year which I hope could be used throughout the country.  It is important people of that age understand that when they are driving, they have a responsibility to themselves as well as to others on the road.  We need to strengthen our educational message and communicate it to that 18-30 age group.  I do not know whether they get the message.  In spite of the good work being done, we need to reach out more and take a prolonged approach to the subject.In his remarks the Minister stated that one in three fatal accidents occur as a consequence of alcohol.  As one who, as a student, worked as a porter in Cork University Hospital, I saw for myself at first hand the impact of road traffic accidents, some linked to alcohol.  I saw at first hand the injuries and fatalities and the impact on the families.  It taught me a valuable lesson that our life is precious.  It is a gift given to us and we must protect and preserve it as much as we can.I am also concerned about the use of mobile telephones.  Some of us have bought mobile telephone car kits or have had Bluetooth services installed.  We stopped the habit of texting because it is illegal and wrong, and we lead by example.  We no longer put the handset up to our ear.  On my journeys from Cork to Dublin, I look at some of the cars and lorries and see people using their mobile telephones.  I cannot comprehend how a driver of an articulated lorry on the bend of a road can have a mobile telephone in one hand and steer the lorry around.  I do not intend to pick on articulated lorry drivers because they do a tremendous amount of work and are very skilled drivers.  I cannot comprehend how one can manage to drive a car at speed on the Cork-Dublin road while using a mobile telephone.  One cannot do it.  One cannot be in charge of a car travelling at 115 km/h or 120 km/h and have a mobile telephone to the ear with the radio on too, perhaps at half mast.  If we are talking about the culture of alcohol, as we must and as is right, we must also talk about how we can change the culture of the use of mobile telephones in cars.  I do not want a prohibition on mobile telephones in cars but we need to get serious.  I would love to see the statistics for the enforcement of penalty points on people who use mobile telephones and who text while driving.  I cannot comprehend how one can do that.I pay tribute to our first responders who do an excellent job.  They are the people who go out in the dead of night, when it is wet or cold, and respond to accidents.  Along with the Garda, they ensure there is safety on our roads.I notice that section 3 deals with the issue of defective vehicles.  There is now a group of people who, through no fault of their own, are in financial difficulty and are failing to maintain their cars, perhaps the wipers or the tyres, or perhaps do not have their car insured or taxed.  They are a danger to themselves and to others on the road.  I very much hope we will go after some of these people and, if necessary, reach a payment plan with them regarding car insurance and car tax.  There was a series of television programmes about the NCT test and we must change our mindset about it in order that it can continue to be a proper car test.  It is about car roadworthiness.This is very important legislation because it deals with human lives and preserving and protecting fellow road users.  All of us use cars.  Some of us do not have the luxury of having a driver in a ministerial or a Leas-Cheann Comhairle's car but we——

We must ensure that when we use the roads, we all play a part in ensuring the safety of our fellow road users.  This Bill goes a way towards achieving that.  There must be a joined-up approach between Departments, the Road Safety Authority and the vintners to ensure there is no loss of life on our roads.  If only that may happen.
#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Last year was the safest year since records commenced in 1959, with 212 deaths.  Those are still 212 deaths too many.  We want to improve on that number this year.  Approximately 135 people have died on the roads so far this year, still too many but a big improvement on last year's figure and even greater than on the figure for 2000, when 415 were killed on our roads.The Road Traffic Act 2010 was introduced in order that the mandatory testing of drivers could be carried out if a garda had a suspicion that a driver was under the influence of intoxicating liquor or for a number of other reasons.  Before that Act, a garda could only require a breath sample if he or she was suspicious about a driver at a Garda checkpoint.  The 2010 Act also brought in low blood-alcohol levels for all drivers.  The legal blood-alcohol level was reduced, from 80 mg per 100 ml of blood to 50 mg for any person who had a full driving licence for more than two years, with a reduction to 20 mg per 100 ml of blood for learners or professional drivers.  The equipment needed to record these lower blood-alcohol levels was not available which meant that the provision in regard to the lower levels could not be enacted.  Mandatory testing and the lower blood-alcohol level provision was linked in this Act and it would have been difficult to have introduced one without the other.The Road Traffic Act 2011 was bridging legislation to address the problem in the previous Act.  This allowed mandatory testing but at a higher level until the proper equipment to test at lower levels was available.  The Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill allows for the mandatory testing of drivers at the lower levels that were set out in the Road Traffic Act 2010.  The mandatory alcohol tests at the lower level will be in operation by the end of this month.  The legal blood-alcohol limit for those holding a full driving licence for more than two years will be reduced from 80 mg to 50 mg per 100 ml of blood.  The legal blood-alcohol limit for learners and professional drivers will reduce to 20 mg per 100 ml of blood.  These low rates can now be introduced as the equipment needed to register them will be available from the end of this month.  In line with the new lower blood-alcohol levels, we are also introducing graduated penalties.People's attitudes have changed dramatically during the past decade and this is very welcome.  In a recent survey carried out by the Automobile Association, 87% of motorists believed that drink driving is shameful.  We have still to reach the remaining 13%.  Section 6 amends the 2010 Act by setting out where alcohol testing is mandatory and where it is not.  Mandatory breath testing will take place when a garda is of the opinion that a driver has consumed intoxicating liquor or a driver is, or has been, involved in a collision where death or injury that requires medical attention has occurred.  The Bill also amends the 2010 Act in order to introduce mandatory testing where a driver is or has been involved in a collision which as resulted in a death occurring.  A garda may ask a driver to take a breath test where he or she is of the opinion that the driver is committing or has committed an offence under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2011 or where that driver is or has been with a vehicle involved in a collision.Section 9 of the 2010 Act, which is being amended, provides for mandatory testing where a driver has been involved in a road traffic collision that has resulted in a death or an injury and is subsequently removed to a hospital.  A garda must test that driver in the hospital except in circumstances where he or she, having consulted the attending doctor, is of the view that such a test would be prejudicial to the driver's health.  The garda involved will be obliged to require the driver to permit a designated doctor or nurse to take a specimen or his or her blood or a urine sample.  This will not be required if the garda is of the view that the driver should be arrested.  The officer must consult the attending doctor to ensure that the taking of such samples from the driver would not cause any adverse affect to the driver/patient.  If such an effect might occur, then the garda will not request a blood or urine sample.  If either the doctor or nurse attending refuse to take a blood or urine sample on medical grounds, then the driver will not be deemed to have committed the offence of refusing to provide a sample.  Under section 8 of the Bill, a garda may enter, without warrant, where a person of interest is in order to obtain a sample.Section 3 of the Bill deals with the offence of knowingly driving a dangerously defective vehicle.  This is an offence which can apply to either the driver or the owner of the vehicle or both.  Where the driver is not the owner, the latter may use the defence that someone else was driving the vehicle without his or her permission on a particular occasion.  However, the driver of a dangerously defective vehicle cannot use the defence that he or she is just the driver rather than the owner of such a vehicle.  The Bill provides that a garda who is of the opinion that a person has committed the offence of driving a dangerously defective vehicle may arrest that individual without a warrant.Prosecutions in respect of certain offences under the Road Traffic Acts depend on the type of driving licence or permit a person holds because permissible blood alcohol levels are different for those who hold full driving licences than they are for people with driving permits.  As a result, section 5 will help to ensure that a mistaken presumption in respect of the type of licence held by a driver will not affect a prosecution relating to a drink driving offence because an alternative verdict will be permissible.The Bill aims to clarify the existing legislation relating to drink driving and reflects policy decisions already taken during the development of the Road Traffic Acts 2010 and 2011.  It also clarifies the position relating to preliminary and mandatory breath-testing requirements and alternative verdicts, as well as dealing with other matters.  It will allow for mandatory alcohol testing in respect of drink driving limits which are lower than those set out in the Road Traffic Act 2010.  These measures were debated extensively in the context of the legislation approved, with cross-party support, by the previous Dáil.  The Bill confirms the Government's commitment to improving Ireland's record on road safety.  Almost any amount of alcohol will impair a person's driving or driving-related skills and statistics show that it plays a contributing part in one of every three fatal road accidents.  Drink driving is not acceptable.

I wish Deputy Buttimer all the best in respect of becoming a Minister and obtaining the services of a driver.  I am sure that will happen one day.The Road Traffic (No. 2) Bill 2011 amends the mandatory alcohol testing provision of the Road Traffic Act 2010 to ensure that mandatory testing will be carried out at the lower drink driving limits when the necessary equipment is introduced later this month.  The latter Act, which lowered the drink driving limits and introduced mandatory roadside testing for drivers involved in collisions, is extremely important legislation brought forward by the previous Government.  It passed into law in July of last year.During the past 20 years a great deal of legislation relating to road safety has been introduced.  The Road Safety Authority, which was established under one of the relevant Acts, is doing a tremendous job in promoting safe driving and ensuring compliance.  Some of the messages the authority is trying to get across are aimed at young people in particular.  Part of its campaign involves the broadcasting of a number of television advertisements which are extremely stark in nature but which emphasise to young people the real dangers of speeding, drink driving etc.  It is important that the Road Safety Authority should continue to enjoy the Minister's support.  It should also continue to receive the financial support it requires in order that it might persevere with its campaigns relating to road safety and education.Deputy Buttimer and others referred to the importance of education.  It is important that the education of young people in respect of road safety should remain a central plank of any enforcement policies into the future.  The policy of providing lessons on road use and road safety in schools has lapsed over the years.  Perhaps it might be possible to put in place a scheme to promote road safety education either through the vocational system or via ordinary second level schools.  Like many others, I am involved with a GAA club.  The club of which I am a member has run programmes in respect of drug awareness and suicide awareness.  I wonder whether it might be possible to use sporting clubs and organisations to a greater degree in order to highlight the dangers of drink driving and speeding to young people.  Perhaps we could encourage the IRFU, the FAI and the GAA to engage, in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority and the Minister, in a promotional campaign to highlight this matter.In recent years, people have become far more responsible.  Many of them leave their cars behind at pubs and clubs if they have consumed alcohol — a few pints, a number of shorts or whatever — and do not take the chance of driving them home.  This is a good development.Insurance companies, the Vintners Federation of Ireland and the alcohol companies are making some contribution but I am of the opinion that they should make a larger financial contribution in the context of the promotion of education on road safety.  The Minister has not been in office for very long and I have no intention of criticising him.  When he is replying, perhaps he might comment on this matter.  Insurance and alcohol companies are making huge profits.  This year, the cost of motor and home insurance has gone through the roof and insurance companies will make massive amounts of money as a result.  Perhaps the Minister will outline the financial contribution the companies to which I refer are making in the area of promoting road safety.  I am of the opinion that their contribution in this regard is not sufficient.Those of us who represent rural areas have argued the case in respect of a more lenient code of conduct for those who live in such areas.  I accept that it would probably be impossible to put such a code in place.  As Deputy Calleary will attest, many members and former members of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party engaged in arguments with the previous Minister for Transport, former Deputy Noel Dempsey, regarding the problems that exist in rural areas and the lack of transport for people who live there.  This is a matter to which consideration must be given.  There are some publicans who provide transport home at night for their customers.  However, it is difficult for them to have taxi services on standby because people go home from the pub at different times.  Perhaps this matter might be examined in the context of the rural transport initiative.  I accept that difficulties could arise if it came to implementing a scheme to have people transported home from pubs at night.  I have been informed by some individuals involved in operating the rural transport system that on many occasions their vehicles are not in use late at night.  In such circumstances, it might be possible to introduce a scheme which would involve the Department, publicans and rural transport operators in order that people in rural areas might be transported home safely from their local pubs at night.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises that, through supporting local businesses and services, Army barracks are an integral part of the local economy in the towns in which they are based;affirms and supports the crucial role that soldiers and their families play in the fabric of the local communities where they are stationed;further recognises that towns throughout the country are under immense pressure due to the current economic climate and need to be supported;acknowledges the consolidation of Army barracks in recent years due to the changed security situation in Northern Ireland and the consequent reinvestment of funds to fully modernise the Defence Forces;further acknowledges investment into the infrastructure of Army barracks across Ireland in recent years;confirms that as a result of previous consolidation and investment no further Army barrack closures are necessary;notes with deep concern reports of the imminent closure of a number of barracks across Ireland such as the Dún Uí Néill Barracks, Cavan, Columb Barracks, Mullingar, Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny and the Military Barracks, Castlebar;condemns the Minister for Defence's refusal to rule out the closure of any Army barracks throughout the country, regardless of its integral role in the local area;opposes the closure of Dún Uí Néill Barracks, Cavan, Columb Barracks, Mullingar, Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, Stephens Barracks, Kilkenny, the Military Barracks, Castlebar, and any further Army barracks across the country;opposes the gradual closure of further Army barracks through a reduction of personnel numbers stationed in them; andcalls on the Government to develop a rational strategy to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces that encompasses their role in the towns in which they are based.With the agreement of the House I will share time with Deputies Ó Cuív and Brendan Smith.  I, the Minister and our respective parties agree that this country and the Members of the Oireachtas owe a great debt of gratitude to the members of the Irish Defence Forces for their commitment to their country and to their jobs.  Over the years they have faced down many threats internally within the State and externally across the world in pursuit of peace and security for the State.  They continue to serve at home and abroad fearlessly.  The Minister will visit the troops next week along with President McAleese.  We wish the Minister well for that trip.  The troops have brought and continue to bring great distinction to our country.What we disagree on is the future organisation of those fine men and women and the impact potential changes may have on communities across the island.  This is why we are here tonight.  Along with my colleagues Deputies Brendan Smith and Robert Troy, Senator Diarmuid Wilson and Councillor Siobhán Ambrose — then mayor of Clonmel — I have sought since April information on proposed barracks closures.  However, the standard reply from the Minister on every occasion here and in the other House is that no decision has been made.  Yet, within the Army community and its higher levels, and within local communities like Cavan, Clonmel and Mullingar, there is a widely held belief that the barracks closure is imminent.This belief is based on internal briefings from within the Army.  It is based on comments by several Government Deputies, including comments such as "The gloves are off" and "I have no cause for optimism despite putting up a very strong case for the future of the barracks".  There was also a lengthy release from one Deputy outlining the options for Army members who are moved and indicating that while the physical barracks may close, it will be made available to community groups immediately on closure.  So the words in the Government amendment that "condemns mischievous attempts to exaggerate the impact of these necessary decisions and create unnecessary fears among local communities" are relevant to the Government benches as much as any.  This motion is about the 500 families that are being left in limbo by this lack of decision.  This is why we have chosen to put this motion down this evening and offer the Government the chance to bring clarity once and for all.The Government amendment congratulates the Government on taking "resolute action in facing the economic crisis" and yet it states further on that decisions relating to Estimates and the troika have been taken by the previous Government.  It is those Estimates that the Minister is congratulating himself for implementing.  That is indicative of the approach of the Government; on the one hand it blames us for everything from the economy to the rain but on the other it is happy to run around the world taking international plaudits.  The Department of Defence is no different.In Government we closed Army barracks and we did so in the face of strenuous and hostile opposition from the parties in Government.  We are not hiding from this and it is mentioned in our motion.  There is nothing "inconsistent" about the approach we are taking.  We closed Army barracks because of the transformed security position on this island as a result of the peace process, a process in which every Member of these Houses has played a role.  That process transformed not just the economic prospects of our island but its social chances.  I often wonder if people forget the sacrifices made to get us to where we are today.When we closed those barracks we ensured that €85 million of investment from the sale of those closed barracks was put back into the Army, ensuring that it is one of the most modern in Europe.  I pay tribute to successive Ministers responsible for defence, including former Deputy Michael Smith, Deputy Willie O'Dea, former Deputy Tony Killeen and Deputy Ó Cuív.  They ensured the policy of investment would continue, and the fruits are evident in barracks around the country, and particularly in the quality of the equipment with which our armed services serve across the world as we speak.As a result of that work and commitment which went into the barracks programme, we know that we cannot afford, as a nation, to close any more barracks.  There are 18 barracks in operation, which is optimal for a force of 10,000 or so.  That number reflects a suitable geographical dispersal highlighting different specialties within the Army.  Those specialties are instanced in Mullingar, which is the only artillery barracks left in the country; in Clonmel, which is a vital base for the Reserve Defence Force; and Cavan, which has a state of the art purpose-built barracks, one of the finest of its kind in Europe.  It was only opened in 1990, and it is the only new barracks to be commissioned since the foundation of the State.These three barracks are collectively home to just over 500 soldiers and their families and are worth about €15 million per annum to the three local economies.  How will the withdrawal of that spend from these three economies impact on the "public finances" about which the Government proclaims to be so worried in the amendment?  The amendment speaks of "unnecessary" fears but there is nothing unnecessary about the fear in these communities this evening.  They are afraid because they are hearing from Army management that these barracks are to be closed while getting uncomfortable vibes from the Government Deputies that the barracks are to be closed.  Nobody doubts that the Deputies opposite are trying but their efforts are falling on deaf ears.  On every occasion in this and the other House, where we have offered the Minister the opportunity to clarify the issue he has not done so.  That is why people are afraid this evening.  These fears are genuine and should not be dismissed as otherwise.Tonight is the Minister's chance to detail in the House his exact plans.  I know from his amendment and his form in these occasions that he will not deal with the fears.  We will have the usual broken record of blaming this party for everything from the collapse of the economy to stealing the Minister's sweets when he was a child.  I would like him to deal with the following issues.Where will the savings be made by closing these barracks?  He should answer that question in the following context.  If we close these barracks he will not be laying off any soldiers and will pay extra travelling allowances to approximately 600 people for up to nine months.  He will have to make substantial capital investments in other barracks to accommodate those who are dislocated and discommoded.  He will continue to have a very substantial security and maintenance bill for the closed sites.  The Minister will be unable to realise any capital from the sale of a barracks or a closed barracks in the current property market and will be unable to do so for some time.  Even if he continues the trend of transferring premises to other organisations, as is happening in County Monaghan as part of a deal and project facilitated by our former colleague, former Deputy Margaret Conlon, he will not realise any value for the Department of Defence in the way we realised €85 million to reinvest in the Army.  The gain to the Army and the local spend will not be equivalent to what has been taken out of those economies.How will the defence priorities of the State be served by the closing of barracks?  The Minister should await publication of the new White Paper on Defence, on which he is working, before proceeding with further closures.  Closing Dún Uí Néill in Cavan will leave only two barracks on the Border.  If we need any reminder that we still need maximum security on the Border, the seizures of illicit fuel and the continuing activity of dissident republicans in recent days are that sharp reminder.  Closing Columb Barracks in Mullingar will leave us without the last artillery barracks and an important UNIFIL staging post.  The closure of Kickham Barracks in Clonmel will be a serious setback to the operations and organisation of the Reserve Defence Force.  Proceeding to undermine three of these functions will undermine the integrity of the preparation of the White Paper on Defence.There is a danger that in debating the physical existence of a barracks and its value to a local economy we will forget the most important element, the people involved.  Hundreds of Army personnel do not know where they will be stationed or working in possibly six weeks.  They do not know how their working and commuting day will look.  They are being told by Government Deputies that they will be given travelling allowances and, depending on the part of the county in which they live, that they might be able to go to Dublin.  Some of them are tonight serving with the United Nations in Lebanon and do not know to which barracks they will be returning.  Will the Minister be able to tell them next week when he will be over there with them?  Their families do not know where their children will be in school this time next year.  If they are in separate employment in the towns in which they currently live, they do not know if they will be able to maintain that employment.As for the communities involved, if 500 jobs in three centres were under threat tonight, there would be topical issue debates on the issue proposed by Members on all sides of the House and Adjournment debates in the Seanad calling for IDA and various other task forces to assist.  We can bring clarity to the matter and give assurances to the communities involved.  On the basis that there will be no saving, unless the Minister can state otherwise, and in view of the importance of the Army to local communities, as is recognised on all sides of the House, it is of paramount importance that the Minister give some details on the matter.I started by paying tribute to the Defence Forces.  This is not the way to treat them, their families and communities.  The Minister is effectively the commander in chief of the Defence Forces.  This is not a matter that can be passed off as an operational issue for the military.  The Minister retains the power to clarify the position.  I urge him to take that chance.

San achar gairid go raibh mise mar Aire Cosanta, cuireadh ar mo shúile dom, ní ag an Arm féin ná ag an Roinn ach ag daoine atá san Arm, go raibh i gceist laghdú mór millteanach a dhéanamh ar líon na saighdiúirí atá lonnaithe i nDun Uí Mhaoilíosa i nGaillimh.  Tá an Chéad Chath lonnaithe ansin agus b'iad Cumann na nGael a chuir an Chéad Chath ar bun.  Go bhfios domsa bhí baint ag Eoin Mac Néill le bunú an Chéad Chath.  Bhí scéal ag dul thart go raibh laghdú mór le déanamh ar an gCéad Chath agus go bhfágfaí Arm na hÉireann gan cathlán lán ghaelach.  Ag an am, chuir mé go mór in aghaidh sin.  Thug mé treoir don Arm, le tacaíocht iomlán an Rialtais, nach ndéanfaí aon laghdú suntasach ar an gCéad Chath, atá lonnaithe ar an Rinn Mhór i nGaillimh, an bheairic is giorra do Ghaeltacht ar bith sa tír.Tógadh an cinneadh sin agus cuireadh in iúl é don Aire.  Ina dhiaidh sin, ar 28 Meitheamh 2011, chuir mé ceist ar an Aire Cosanta, an Teachta Alan Shatter, an raibh an cinneadh sin fós ag seasamh.  Dúirt an t-Aire nach raibh, go raibh sé tar éis tarraingt siar as cinneadh an Rialtais, nár sheas cinneadh an Rialtais níos mó go ndéanfaí cosaint ar an gCéad Chathlán Ghaelach san Arm.Ba mhaith liom a fháil amach ón Aire anocht céard atá i gceist aige a dhéanamh.  An bhfuil i gceist aige scrios a dhéanamh ar an gCéad Chathlán Ghaelach agus an bhfuil i gceist aige athrú bunúsach a dhéanamh ar an stádas a bhaineann leis an mbeairic ar an Rinn Mhór i nGaillimh?Má tharlaíonn sé sin deir sé go leor faoi luachanna an Rialtais agus faoin dearcadh atá aige faoin Arm Éireannach.  Nach gceapann an Rialtas go mb'fhiú go mbunófaí, ar a laghad, cathlán amháin a bheadh bunaithe ar mhaithe le deis a thabhairt do shaighdiúirí ón nGaeltacht agus do dhaoine eile a bhfuil Gaeilge acu a bheith ina saighdiúirí Éireannacha agus an teanga Gaeilge a úsáid gach uile lá?I support the motion brought forward by my colleague, Deputy Calleary.  I am very concerned about the rumours circulating.  It appears to have become a habit of the Government to fly plenty of kites at the same time.  Now that this kite has been flown, we hope the Government will listen to the very strong pleas not only from us but also from Government colleagues on the issue of barracks closures.  We can agree that the Minister of State, Deputy Willie Penrose, has put the matter very well in the various statements he has issued.  He has made it absolutely clear that he believes it would be wrong to close the barracks in Mullingar.  He said the closure of Columb Barracks would be "crass stupidity" and "economic lunacy".  He also said: "I have no intention of supporting stupid decisions."  I am sure the Minister would hate to see a Minister of State go overboard and that he will listen carefully to what he has to say about barracks closures.  The Minister of State said: "I cannot believe that a sovereign government would ever contemplate closing such a major and integral part of the Defence Forces' facilities."  He also pointed out, in support of what Deputy Calleary said, that, "From an economic perspective it is foolhardy to contemplate closing Columb Barracks.  Apart from being unable to dispose of it in the current climate, all personnel would have to be paid disturbance money.  No money will be saved, therefore."  That is what he said in 2009 and I am sure the Minister will listen carefully to his colleague who sits at the Cabinet table and realise that he was right in his statements about this barracks and that no money would be saved.There is no comparison between the closure of barracks now and what happened under previous Governments when the considerable amount of money received from the sale of barracks was used to re-arm the Army and provide it with badly needed equipment and better conditions.  There comes a point when one has done enough closing and we believe that point has been reached.  The Minister believed that point had been reached when he was in opposition also.  We believe the number of barracks is at the optimum level.  It gives a geographic spread throughout the country which is convenient for both the Reserve Defence Force and the deployment of the Army, if necessary, be it for a weather-related or other emergency.  Its services are available.It is time the Minister told us the truth and outlined exactly what the Government will do on this issue.  It is important to remember that he is in absolute control and that in his role as Minister for Defence, he cannot hide behind the argument that operational matters are beyond his control, because absolute responsibility rests with him.  The day-to-day command of the Defence Forces rests with the Minister for Defence.  I have no doubt the Minister, no more than I when I came into the Department, was briefed that there is no equivalence between being Minister for Justice and Equality and Minister for Defence and, therefore, this is his direct responsibility and he will be answerable to this House for the decisions he and the Government may take.Tá go leor le plé againn agus le hoibriú amach.  Rud amháin atá ag teastáil ná Fórsaí Cosanta atá scaipthe ar fud na tíre, atá ag freastal ar an bpobal agus atá mar chuid den phobal.  Níl aon amhras faoi ach gur fhulaing cuid des na bailte atá i gceist anseo go leor de bharr an ghéarchéim eacnamaíochta.  Má dúnfar na beairicí ar fud na tíre, mar shampla an bheairic i gCluain Meala, a bhfuil caint ar iad a laghdú go mór, níl aon amhras faoi ach go ndéanfaidh sé an-dochar do eacnamaíocht na mbailtíe sin, bailte nach bhfuil ag tarraingt tionscail nua isteach iontu i láthair na huaire.Céard a bheidh againn dá bharr?  Glacaim leis nach bhfuil i gceist ag an Rialtas aon laghdú mór a dhéanamh ar líon na saighdiúirí san Arm.  Mar sin, níl aon sábháilt le déanamh ar an mbealach sin.  Níl mórán costais ag baint — €17 milliún — le ríocht na mbeairicí i rith na bliana.  Mar sin, níl aon sábháilt ansin.  Cá bhfuil an sábhailt nó an buntáiste?  Beidh costas ag baint leis.  Breathnaigh an scrios a déanfar ar na bailte éagsúla sa Chabhán, i gCluain Meala, ar an Mhuileann Cearr agus ins na bailte éagsúla ar fud na tíre más rud é go ndúnfar na bearicí seo.  Breathnaigh an scrios a déanfar ar theaghlaigh a mbeidh orthu dul agus cónaí in áiteanna eile.  Mar mhalairt air sin beidh ar na saighdiúirí go leor taistil a dhéanamh.  Cén tairbhe a bheidh ann?  An bhfuil aon daonnacht ag baint leis na cinnithe atá an Rialtas ag dul a dhéanamh?  An dtógann an Rialtas san áireamh na ceisteanna sin, na hathraithe scoileanna a bheadh i gceist do ghasúir agus an dochar a dhéanfadh sé sin?Bhí gá le hathraithe san Arm, mar laghdaigh an t-Arm ó 18,000 duine síos go thart ar 10,000 duine.  Anois, tá daoine ag éirí as an Arm go luath, ní hé go bhfuil siad á gcur amach as.  Ag tógáil sin san áireamh, cén mhaith nó cén buntáiste a bheidh ann má athraítear daoine ó áit go háit?  Tá mé cinnte go gcuirfear argóintí breátha ar aghaidh go mba cheart comhdhlúthú a dhéanamh agus go bhfuil daoine ann a chreideann go mba cheart go mbeadh an t-Arm i mbunáit nó dhó ar fud na tíre.  Creidim féin nach mbeadh sé sin go maith, go mbainfeadh sé an ceangal a bhí ann ariamh le pobail áirthe agus an t-Arm agus go gcuirfeadh sé ó mhaith é.  Feicimid ar fad an chaoi go dtéann daoine isteach san Arm sa cheantar ar as iad.  Daoine ó Mhaigh Eo agus Gaillimh atá ins na beairicí sa taobh sin tíre.  Daoine ó lár tíre atá lonnaithe in Áth Luain.  Daoine ó lár tíre thoir atá lonnaithe ar an Mhuileann Cearr. Tá baint ag teaghlaigh, ag dul i bhfad siar, leis an Arm.  Tá sean-aithreacha, aithreacha, máithreacha agus iníonacha istigh san Arm anois, agus ceangal idir na pobail agus an t-Arm.  Is rud sláintiúil é sin. Le ró-fhada níor mhothaigh go leor den phobal go raibh aon cheangal acu leis an Arm a bhí i láthair sa tír.  Nuair a fuair muid ár saoirse rud amháin ar éirigh linn a dhéanamh ná ceangal breá a bhunú idir ghnáth phobail na tíre agus an t-Arm.  Más rud é go mbainfear an t-Arm amach as na pobail agus larnú a dhéanamh air i gcúpla bunáit ar fud na tíre — is cuma cén comhairle a gcuirfear ar an Rialtas —  is é an toradh a bheidh air sin ná go mbrisfear an ceangal dlúth atá idir na pobail agus an t-Arm mar atá sé leagtha amach i láthair na huaire.  Ocht mbunáit déag atá ag an Arm i láthair na huaire.  Úsáideann Cúltaca an Airm cuid des na bunáiteanna sin.  Níl údar ar bith nach bhfágfaí na beairicí mar atá siad agus nach bhfágfaí na saighdiúirí mar atá siad ins na beairicí ar fud na tíre.Ta súil agam gur tháinig an t-Aire isteach sa Dáil anocht, ní le dul ag súgradh leis an bhfón ach chun éisteacht linn.  Tá súil agam go bhfuil sé ag éisteacht linn, go bhfuil sé ag tógáil dáiríre an méid atá le rá againn agus, le cúnamh Dé, nach raibh anseo ach scéal scéil.  Más fíor é sin agus más rud é go bhfágann an t-Aire na beairicí ar fad ar oscailt ní bheidh éinne níos sásta ná mé féin.  Muna ndéanann sé athrú nó laghdú suntasach ar líon na saighdiúirí ins na beairicí éagsúla ní bheidh éinne níos sásta ná mé féin.Tá sé faoin Aire anois déanamh cinnte, is cuma cén moladh a cuirfear faoina bhráid, go mbreathnóidh sé do leas na tíre, leas an phobail agus leas na bpobal ina bhfuil na beairicí suite.  Tá súil agam nach nglacfaidh sé díreach le plean a cuirfear ós a chomhair agus nach ndéarfaidh sé go gcaithfidh sé glacadh leis an bplean os rud é gur cuireadh faoina bhráid é.  Is é an t-Aire, ag deireadh an lae.  Is é atá i gceannas agus freagrach.  Tá daoine ann le comhairle a chur air agus le moltaí a chur faoina bhráid.  Tá cuid acu sa Stát Seirbhís agus cuid eile san Arm, ach níl an fhreagracht orthu na cinntí a dhéanamh.  Is faoin Aire agus ag an Rialtas amháin atá sé na cinntí a dhéanamh.  Tá an t-Aire in ann na cinntí cearta nó na cinntí míchearta a dhéanamh.  Fágaimid sin faoi.  Bíodh sé cinnte de rud amháin.  Más é an cinnedh mícheart a dhéanann an Rialtas beidh go leor le rá ag gnáth phobal na tíre faoi na geallúintí a tugadh agus iad sa bhFreasúra maidir le beairicí Airm.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important motion.  I commend my party colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, our justice and defence spokesperson, on putting this very comprehensive motion before the House.  It quite rightly affirms and supports the critical role of the Permanent Defence Force throughout our country and in local communities.  We note the substantial consolidation of barracks that has occurred over the past number of years.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Fianna Fáil closed them down.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	If Deputy Jerry Buttimer reads the Minister's amendment to the motion, he will note the progress made with the consolidation of barracks even though Fine Gael people railed against it as usual.  That consolidation of barracks has been made possible by the very considerable political progress which has been made on this island.Deputy Dara Calleary's motion is in stark contrast to the amendment proposed by the Minister in which he condemns public representatives who represent the views and concerns of their local communities.  In the amendment, the Minister is obviously condemning the concerns expressed by some of his Government colleagues, some of whom are in the Chamber.  I note the Minister commends the consolidation of barracks which has occurred and which enabled major investment across the infrastructure of our Permanent Defence Force.  That programme of rationalisation was effective, realistic and left in place the network of military installations needed in our State.I understand that traditionally there has been higher recruitment to the Defence Forces from areas where barracks are located.  We have a long Army tradition in my county of Cavan, as my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe O'Reilly, will know, and I am very glad to have the opportunity to once again commend the work of members of the Defence Forces throughout the country but, in particular, those members who I personally know and who are stationed in Dún Uí Néill in Cavan.  I also commend the work of retired and deceased personnel and take the opportunity to pay tribute to so many of those personnel who, in different decades, served overseas on overseas missions acting as great ambassadors for our country.Coming from a Border area, one is probably more conscious of the vital role of our Army and particularly the work that was carried out by those personnel in very difficult times during the late 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and in to the early 1990s.  The changed circumstances in the north of my province of Ulster enabled the consolidation of barracks.  Barracks have been closed in the three southern Ulster counties of Donegal, Monaghan and Cavan but three key military installations, all strategically placed, have been left in place.  It was probably in 1987 or 1988 that the Fianna Fáil Government approved the provision of a new barracks in Cavan town and sourced the site on the Dublin Road.That barracks, subsequently named Dún Uí Néill, replaced an old and inadequate barracks on Barrack Hill in the town.  As a result of that major investment during a time of great economic difficulties, soldiers based in Cavan were able to move into the most modern barracks in Europe in 1990.  It is the only operational barracks that has been provided by our own State and all of us are proud of the modern facilities it offers.  It is run in an efficient manner and provides good value for money.  It is the most economical barracks in the country, with running costs of €200,000 per annum when one includes maintenance, utilities, electricity, heating and transport fuels.  It is also a major Reserve Defence Forces training centre.  Other FCA centres throughout counties Cavan and Leitrim were merged into Dún Uí Néill to provide better training facilities and benefits of scale from the larger numbers involved.For towns like Cavan, the Army barracks is an integral part of the community and local economy.  The recent reports on the Government's plans to shut this facility have caused great distress not only to the Army and civilian personnel directly affected but also among the wider community.  There is no avoiding the fact that the closure of the barracks will cost jobs and hurt local businesses.  Some 120 personnel from A company, sixth battalion of the western command are based in Cavan and an additional 22 personnel are currently serving on the United Nations mission in southern Lebanon.The facilities of the barracks have been made available to the local community and a state-of-the-art gymnasium and other sporting facilities have been used by our county teams and local sports clubs.  Senior citizen organisations also regularly use the facilities.  The provision of public facilities on a practical basis to local community organisations has been a welcome development.  Deputy O'Reilly and I have been invited to the gym on numerous occasions but work has precluded us from attending.  It is very ecumenical to invite all sides.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The importance of the Reserve Defence Force is often underestimated.  The 6,000 members of the Reserve use several barracks for training purposes, including Dún Uí Néill.  The convenient location of barracks is an important part of the recruitment process.  In the years commonly referred to as the Troubles, many young people were fortunate to have been recruited to the FCA rather than becoming involved with undesirable organisations.  We should not undervalue the training and discipline that was imparted to young people through the FCA.Last night approximately 500 people attended a public meeting in Cavan to voice their deep concern about the future of our barracks.  They recognise that it is a hub of economic activity and are worried about the effect of its closure on their town.  The barracks provides both direct and indirect employment by generating a demand for local goods and services.  The soldiers and their families are an integral part of the fabric of life in Cavan.  The uncertainty which the Minister has allowed to develop is a cause of concern for the local community and, in particular, the personnel based in Dún Uí Néill.  Their families outlined to me at the public meeting, my clinics and by telephone their worries regarding relocation of the Cavan personnel and the additional financial burden that would ensue.  Deputy O'Reilly and Senator Wilson accompanied me to last night's meeting and Deputies Heather Humphreys and Conlan were also represented.The pivotal location of Dún Uí Néill is clear on maps of the Border area.  Three barracks are located along our long land Border, namely, Finner Camp in County Donegal in the north west, Dún Uí Néill in the centre and Aiken Barracks in Dundalk on the east coast.  It is clear that a barracks is needed in the central Border area.Apart from the difficulties associated with the Troubles, the Army also worked alongside officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Garda and other statutory agencies to limit the spread of foot and mouth disease and BSE.  We value the major contribution played by the Army in that national effort.  Our security forces ensured the successful implementation of a sophisticated and comprehensive programme that minimised disruption to the agriculture and food sector.  Stopping the spread of disease from the neighbouring jurisdiction was of the utmost importance to protect the hard earned and well deserved reputation of our food industry.  That reputation is key to our success in exporting food and drink products to 163 countries worldwide.It is simplistic to say that soldiers can be moved when operational needs arise.  That should only be necessary when the work undertaken is short in duration.  For longer undertakings accommodation and other facilities are needed.  If barracks are closed, which I hope will not happen, where will the relocated soldiers be accommodated?  My understanding from speaking to individuals closely associated with the Defence Forces is that alternative accommodation is lacking should the Government proceed with closing the facilities named in the motion.  I hope the Minister can assure us there will be no such closures.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"commends the Government's resolute action in facing the economic crisis and notes that this action is now bearing fruit;supports the Government in taking the further difficult and unpopular decisions that are necessary to restore the public finances;accepts that reform and reorganisation in the public service, including the redeployment of staff, are essential to maximise value for money for the taxpayer;accepts that, because of reductions in the budget and strength of the Defence Forces required by the 2011 Estimates decided by the previous Government and because of the constraints imposed by the EU/IMF agreement entered into by the previous Government, further savings are required;notes that these savings are being examined in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure currently underway;rejects the glaring inconsistency of the proponents of the motion who, when in Government, closed ten barracks and also caused the fiscal crisis that the current Government has to address;notes that the experience of the previous Government confirms that barrack closures deliver a substantial efficiency gain to the Defence Forces; andcondemns mischievous attempts to exaggerate the impact of these necessary decisions and create unnecessary fears among local communities."I wish to share time with Deputies Buttimer, Darragh Murphy, O'Reilly, Heather Humphreys and Conlan, by agreement.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I have to begin with an expression of admiration.  Courage was always in short supply when it came to taking tough decisions during the wasted years of the Celtic tiger boom.  However, there was one area where the Deputies opposite showed a modicum of decisiveness.  When in Government, they presided over the closure of no fewer than ten barracks, as Deputy Calleary boasted this evening.  Their justification was based on a perfectly logical and reasonable analysis.  The consolidation of barracks into a smaller number of locations was a key objective of the previous Government's White Paper on Defence and recommended in many reports.  It remains a key objective of the ongoing defence modernisation programme to maximise the effectiveness of the Defence Forces.  I accept the previous Government's analysis.  The facts remain the facts, regardless of who is in government.However, there is nothing admirable in the sheer brass neck entailed in putting this disingenuous motion before the House.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	279	That is not what the Minister's Cabinet colleague said.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	280	As everyone knows, Fianna Fáil led coalitions destroyed the public finances and led our country into receivership.  As a result, we have had to undertake a searching reappraisal of every aspect of public expenditure.  The legacy we inherited is so dreadful that no area of expenditure can be excluded from review.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	281	Say that to the Minister of State, Deputy Penrose.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The proposers of tonight's motion know this.  They also know that I cannot exclude barracks from this review.  I have said so plainly in reply to questions in this House.  I have never resorted to any sort of equivocation on the subject.  The Exchequer is under extreme pressure and no amount of bluff and bluster will bridge the yawning gap between the Government's income and current expenditure.  Unfortunately, more hard decisions will be needed.There are few opportunities to trim defence spending without impacting on front-line delivery.  It is self-evident that concentrating personnel in fewer locations provides the potential to protect essential collective training and reduce unnecessary overheads in terms of barrack management, administration, maintenance and security.  It also affords me, as Minister for Defence, the possibility of maintaining the Defence Forces at their current level of approximately 9,500.This Government has nothing to apologise for in seeking to effect further efficiencies.  To place the glaring inconsistency of the Fianna Fáil motion in perspective, I want to place on the record of the House the previous Government's record in this regard.  In July 1998, the then Government announced the closure of six barracks: Ballincollig, Fermoy, Devoy, Magee, Castleblayney and Clancy, with the relocation of 880 personnel.  In the context of the 2009 budget, the then Government also announced the closure of four barracks: Monaghan, Lifford, Longford and Rockhill House, Letterkenny, with the relocation of 595 personnel, and also St. Bricin's Hospital in Dublin.  The closure of the four barracks has been achieved.  The consolidation of St. Bricin's is linked to the provision of modern medical facilities within the existing departmental property portfolio and will take some time to implement.While the closure of the barracks and the sale of the properties has provided funding for investment, it was never the sole driving factor for the consolidation of defence infrastructure, as the Deputies opposite well know, including the two Deputies who spoke who are former Ministers for Defence.  The primary driver for barrack reorganisation and personnel redeployment is the efficient and effective delivery of military capabilities.  As I have said in response to many questions in this House, Defence Forces properties are kept under constant review in terms of addressing Defence Forces requirements and ensuring the most appropriate organisation of the Defence Forces, taking account of the operational requirements.The austerity measures initiated by the previous Government have meant the strength of the Permanent Defence Force has now reduced to 1970s levels and there is an urgent need to maximise efficiency to mitigate the effects of that reduction.  Releasing personnel for operational duties requires that the number of barracks be reviewed.  If it transpires that significant efficiencies in manpower usage can be gained by reducing the number of barracks, why should this Government use different criteria from its predecessor?  The double-think behind this motion verges on the embarrassing.  Do the Deputies opposite think the public has developed amnesia so quickly?

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	285	The opportunistic motion tabled by Fianna Fáil deserves no credibility coming from the party responsible for the economic cataclysm that has impacted on our people.  It starkly confirms that despite that party's unprecedented defeat in the general election and the passage of time, no lessons of any nature have been learned.  All the more perplexing is the party's failure to acknowledge that previous programmes of barrack rationalisation provided funding that, together with pay savings, provided essential resources required for infrastructure, training area development and equipment procurement.Since 1998, a total of €84.98 million has been realised from the disposal of six of the barracks closed by Fianna Fáil-led Governments.  Agreement in principle has been reached to dispose of two more of these.  Notwithstanding the extremely depressed state of the property market, it now appears that the round of barrack closures effected by Fianna Fáil in 2009 will ultimately yield more than €5 million.  It is contradictory for Fianna Fáil Deputies to claim the current barrack structure should be maintained given Ireland's commitment to the United Nations.  Mention was made of some members of the Defence Forces in southern Lebanon at present.  In practice, nothing could be further from the truth.  To support our UN contribution, we must avoid spreading our resources too thinly and starving the Defence Forces of the appropriate investment in equipment and training which will allow them to continue to meet the standards necessary to participate in overseas missions.  Let me be quite clear: unless we prioritise the resources available to the Defence Forces into the appropriate areas, we will not be able to send troops overseas in the future because they will not have the appropriate equipment and training.  We must do the best we can within the constrained resource envelope available.  We cannot have it both ways.  If everything is a priority, then nothing is a priority.  To try to pretend otherwise, as Deputies on the other side of the House are doing, is misleading and they know that.The standard of financial analysis underpinning the Opposition motion is depressingly familiar.  It is the type of analysis that brought us to the brink of financial disaster.  The Exchequer receipts have fallen by approximately a third.  What is the Opposition's prescription?  It is to reprimand the Government for daring to think about a measure that some of the Opposition applied widely when in government to effect efficiencies.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The implication of this motion is that we should conduct the comprehensive review of expenditure that is under way on the basis that the taxpayer should continue to invest in something that is not required.  Does that make any sense of any nature to anyone?What I want to achieve in the comprehensive review of expenditure is the concentration of our investment in those areas of the Defence Forces which are important to its operational and overseas capabilities to ensure it is properly equipped and trained and that we do not need to reduce its strength substantially below the current strength of 9,500.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	302	A previous Minister indicated:As Minister for Defence I am determined that this progress will continue.  It is therefore necessary to ensure that the implementation of the White Paper on Defence will proceed as planned.He also referred to:[M]arking the end of a long chapter in the history of Ballincollig.  This was an emotive occasion for the Defence Forces and in particular for the many personnel who had served in Murphy Barracks over the years.  But time moves on and without change there can be no renewal.Those quotes were from a previous Minister for Defence, Michael Smith, a member of the Fianna Fáil Party, a man who sat on the Government benches and who was, along with the Fianna Fáil Party leader, a member of Cabinet who closed a barracks in his own constituency and another one in the Ireland South European Parliament constituency.  No one from the Fianna Fáil benches at the time, Deputies Moynihan, O'Keeffe or Martin, voted against the closures.This is a nakedly political motion.  This is what Fianna Fáil said it would change.  I compliment Deputy Brendan Smith on the great argument he made as to why we must keep the barracks open, namely, that the Cavan football team can keep training there.  That is a very good argument.

They took the soul and the heart out of rural and urban Ireland.  He may well smile.  Today there are men and women in this country who are suffering as a consequence of the cheap politics Fianna Fáil played for 20 years, and he should never forget it.

#DaraMurphy	unknown-#DaraMurphy-party	unknown-#DaraMurphy-dob	unknown-#DaraMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, particularly to concur with the amendment as tabled by the Minister.I agree with Deputies Calleary, Ó Cuív and Smith about the fine work that our armed services continue to do in the country.  There is huge potential to develop the resource we have throughout the country.  As Deputy O'Brien may remember, when Cork flooded a couple of years ago, uniquely, in Ireland, the Army came to the assistance of the civil powers to provide significant relief, particularly on the northside of the city which we represent.  This is a difficult period for Army families, but there is a great future for our forces in this country.  Personally, I would like to see their role developed, both nationally and internationally.Over the past 20 years, many reports and commissions have identified barrack closure as a fundamental requirement towards improving military effectiveness and efficiency.  If we were to start from scratch, such a small country as ours would never contemplate a position of having 28 barracks, as we had in 1998.  Successive Fianna Fáil Governments over the past 12 years have closed ten of these and it is fair to say that these barracks were closed during a time of economic boom.More noteworthy still is why these barracks will have to be closed, if any are to be closed.  The deal entered into by Fianna Fáil with the troika, the people who are lending money to our country, commits us as a people to cost-cutting measures that are today unavoidable.  The closure of ten barracks under Fianna Fáil may have been prevented at the time if the Government had so wished.  Sadly, this Government does not have such a luxury.The Minister, Deputy Howlin, has correctly insisted that all Ministers and Departments share the burden of restoring Ireland's economic independence through prudent managing of the nation's finance.  This prudence is already reaping considerable rewards.  In the past two days, for the first time in a long time unemployment figures are falling.  These improvements are modest.  Nonetheless the light at the end of our economic tunnel that Fianna Fáil extinguished is flickering to life for the people of our country and for our unemployed.  For the first time in five years the Irish economy is experiencing growth.  It is modest growth, but growth nonetheless.The ambition of this Government is now very much not only to regain the sovereignty and financial independence that Fianna Fáil removed from this proud nation, but to be the first programme nation in Europe to do so.  In fact, from being one of the malignant tumours that threatened to kill the European vision, this country is now being seen as having the leadership, integrity and courage, not only to cure our own problems but to right the prescription for this Continent as a whole.  This reality makes the Fianna Fáil Party even sicker.  Their delusion that all Governments would be as incompetent and ineffective as their own, has already been proven to be complete nonsense.

#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I have been in dialogue over the past few weeks with representatives of PDFORRA, with the families involved and with the local community around the Dún Uí Néill in Cavan and as a consequence of that dialogue, I have been in regular consultation with the Minister and his senior officials in bringing the welfare issues and the general concerns of the personnel there to the Minister.  As Deputy Smith, my constituency colleague, made reference to, last night I attended and participated in an excellently run, fine public meeting in Cavan.  I propose to continue engaging in that dialogue with the personnel and the Minister.I want to put in context a couple of unavoidable issues that surround this debate.  When we agreed to the IMF-EU deal we sold out our economic sovereignty.  It is a legacy issue and it happened during the term of the previous Government.  That IMF-EU deal makes it mandatory for the State to achieve a budget deficit next year of 8.6% of GDP.  That, in practical terms, means — this is contingent on the Exchequer returns in November — that there will be no less than €3.6 billion in cuts in next year's budget.  That further means there must be up to €30 million in cuts in the Department of Defence, and that raises fundamental questions.  This is an unavoidable backdrop to the debate.  Everything that the Government is doing is predicated on the effort to restore our economic sovereignty, get our people working again and restore the fortunes of our country.The strength of the Defence Forces has been cut back to 1970 levels.  At the end of 2000, there were 10,726 personnel in the Defence Forces; today, there are 9,500.  That is another legacy issue.The Minister and the Department are determined to maintain the current strength of the Army, and there is a couple of compelling reasons to do this.  We have in excess of 800 personnel serving abroad, and we want to maintain that.  We have to deal with unforeseen events, such as storms.  My colleague, Deputy Smith, correctly alluded to the role of the Defence Forces in disease eradication.  We have to sustain the morale of the Defence Forces.  There is a constant need to be ready to assist in the event of disasters or emergencies.  For those reasons, the Minister and the Fine Gael Party in government are determined to preserve the strength of the Defence Forces.My personal hope is that people will be recruited into the Defence Forces over the coming months, if it is necessary to preserve the existing strength of the Defence Forces.  I commend that possibility to the Minister in the interests of maintaining the current personnel levels.  I will ask him to consider it every time I speak to him.Fine Gael values the role of the Defence Forces.  Our historic commitment to the Defence Forces goes back to the foundation of the State.  We will not be found wanting in defence of the Defence Forces and in consolidation of their numbers.Part of the backdrop to this debate is the fact that senior management personnel in the Army have consistently sought the consolidation of their barracks.  That has been recommended in report after report.  It is worth repeating that the Deputies opposite closed a plethora of barracks across this country in 1998 and 2009.  I will not list the barracks in question because I am facing time constraints.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	354	That is what the motion states.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	355	It is worth noting that, as alluded to earlier, significant savings of €85 million have been made on foot of these sales.  I emphasise that if any further closures were to take place, the money accruing from them would be used to acquire equipment for the Army.The final and critical point I would like to make as part of the backdrop to this debate is that in the event of closures, Government Departments would be advised immediately of the availability of these facilities.  I have been impressing strongly on the Minister the need for the Government to prioritise the ongoing occupation of these facilities in the interests of restoring economic activity and ensuring local economies are not adversely affected.

We have to recognise that it would not be taking place at all if it were not for the financial legacy the Government inherited.  We have to recognise that some of these decisions are being dictated to us under the EU-IMF deal.  We should bring honesty and integrity to the debate and recognise the truthful background to it.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I attended a public meeting in Cavan town last night regarding the possible closure of Dún Uí Néill Barracks.  Approximately 500 people were in attendance, which provides an insight into the significant concerns in Cavan town and its environs about the future of the barracks.  As someone who has worked in the Cavan area for many years, I fully acknowledge the substantial contribution the Defence Forces have made to Cavan and the entire Border region.  My Oireachtas colleagues and I listened carefully to the concerns of those who attended last night's meeting.  As an elected representative of the Cavan-Monaghan constituency, I believe it is important that those concerns are highlighted in the Dáil Chamber this evening.The location of the barracks in close proximity to the Border means the security situation must be taken into account.  There continues to be a threat from dissident activities in Border areas.  I want to pay tribute to the members of the Defence Forces who have served in the Border area.  They were under threat for many years.  They worked in under very difficult circumstances in the Border region, often in fear of losing their lives.  The barracks in Cavan represent an ideal location for accommodating troops in the event of the arrival of another agricultural disease like foot and mouth disease or BSE.  The Defence Forces previously played an important role in ensuring Ireland maintained its disease-free status.The potential closure of Dún Uí Néill barracks and the redeployment of troops to various other barracks would lead to social disruption for many families.  Young families might have no option other than to move away from Cavan.  This would result in hardship for young children if they had to change schools.  There are concerns that the barracks in Athlone and Dundalk do not have the necessary accommodation to cater for additional troops.  They have been overcrowded since other barracks were closed by the previous Government.  It is important to bear in mind that the Defence Forces often carry out duties which go beyond their remit.  The Defence Forces stepped in during last year's extremely inclement weather to ensure nurses and other workers could be brought to Cavan General Hospital.

#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The troops based at Dún Uí Néill barracks play a vital role for the local community in this and other respects.  Essentially, they are the last port of call in times of crisis.  Some 120 troops and a number of civilian workers are based at the barracks.  If the barracks were to close, it would result in a major loss to the local economy.  It has been pointed out that the loss of trade to local suppliers could further exacerbate unemployment problems in the Cavan area.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Deputy's time is up.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	362	That is okay.  I have outlined many of the concerns that have been raised with me and the other Deputies for the area.  I strongly believe I would be doing a disservice to the constituents I serve if I were to fail to express their views here.  As a Government Deputy, I would like to place on the record that I am extremely disappointed about the possible closure of Dún Uí Néill barracks.  However, I recognise that the task of the Government is to make many tough decisions of this nature.  The bottom line is that the negligence of the previous Administration has left us with no alternative other than to cut costs.  Fianna Fáil has been quick to berate the Government about the potential closure of Army barracks.  Its motion "condemns the Minister for Defence's refusal to rule out the closure of any Army barracks".  It is obvious that some Opposition Deputies have short memories.  Fianna Fáil was in power when the decision to close the Army barracks in Monaghan town was taken.

No Government Department is exempt from the imposition of cost-cutting measures.  The Department of Defence is no different.  The Minister, Deputy Shatter, has an unenviable task in seeking to do his utmost to retain the strength of the Defence Forces at its current level with limited resources at his disposal.  I ask him to take account of the concerns I have raised in relation to this matter and examine every possible alternative before a final decision is reached.

The reality is that we are not living in normal times.  I am sure the Minister would not consider doing this if it were not absolutely necessary.  The Government has been charged with turning around the legacy of the previous Government, which left us in an economic mess.  I do not need to remind the House that the eyes of the EU and IMF are on us constantly.  Whether we like it or not, we need to make difficult decisions if the savings needed to get us out of the economic hole in which we find ourselves are to be made.  We have a stark choice between rationalising our Army barracks infrastructure and reducing the number of soldiers in the Defence Forces.

If it does happen, at least Defence Forces personnel can be assured that they will be redeployed, unlike the private sector workers who have to find alternative employment when they lose their jobs.  That is the stark reality of the situation.  I note from the Minister's comments that any plan in this regard will be based on the previous Government's White Paper on Defence.  I am sure it will be discussed with the heads of the Army and the other branches of the Defence Forces.  They will make a rational decision about the operational capacity of the Army, and where best to locate Army barracks, on the basis of best practice.  I am concerned about the possibility of a barracks being closed in the Border region.  The Defence Forces did a sterling job along the Border to protect this country during the Troubles.  I pay tribute to everybody in our Defence Forces.

#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  At this time, it would be a retrograde step to contemplate further closures of barracks in towns that are already suffering from intense distress brought on by rising unemployment and emigration.  This is not the time to compound that suffering with closures which to all intents and purposes are the equivalent of closing medium sized factories.Before addressing the motion, I wish to point out a technical issue.  The Fianna Fáil motion refers to Defence Forces barracks across Ireland and calls on the Minister for Defence not to close any further barracks.  There are a number of barracks in the north east which I would not mind having closed but I do not believe even the Minister has the power to close them.  He might work on that.  We have been campaigning for years to have some of them closed in the Six Counties, which is part of Ireland, believe it or not, as it consists of all Thirty-two Counties, not Twenty-six Counties and certainly not Twenty-two.  That aside, we welcome the spirit of the motion, which we will support.Sinn Féin is opposed to any further closure or consolidation of Defence Forces barracks and any possible further reduction in personnel at this time.  The closure of these barracks would lead to a greater property portfolio for the State, which I am sure the Troika would be more than happy to see.  Given the distressed state of the market, however, we would be unable to sell any of this property and, even if we did, we would certainly not get value for money.I have already alluded to the detrimental consequences of removing Defence Forces personnel and their families from some of the areas referred to in the motion.  The vast majority of these personnel are an important and integral part of the local community as well as serving in the Defence Forces.  They and their families contribute millions of euro to the local economy each year and any closure or further consolidation would depress those local economies which are already suffering from this Government's failure to create jobs.The Defence Forces are a vital component of our emergency services, as was shown by their expert work during the recent weather conditions.  As Deputy Dara Murphy, my colleague in Cork North-Central, pointed out, during the recent flooding of Cork the Defence Forces came to the fore and the skill and expertise with which they handled that issue and the way they interacted with local communities was to be welcomed.  For that type of reason, it is an advantage to have a spread of such expertise throughout the State, in particular given the changing weather conditions and the possibility of further floods.While the Government stated that no decision has been made in regard to future closures or consolidation, everyone knows it is on the agenda and is being actively considered.  The Minister himself has repeatedly refused to rule out closures or further consolidation, although that is not a criticism as I would much prefer a Minister to at least say something is either in or out rather than say one thing and then do another, as previous Governments have done.As the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, is present, I note he recently said in regard to Columb Barracks in Mullingar that the dispersal of Defence Forces personnel over an extended number of locations continues to be a major impediment to essential collective training and the releasing of personnel for operational duties.  I have not seen any evidence to support this assertion.  If it exists, I ask the Minister of State or the Minister for Defence to furnish me with the information so we can make an informed decision when this matter comes before the House.Given the statement from the Minister earlier and the statements of some other Deputies, there is no doubt there is disquiet on all sides on this issue.  It is time clarity was brought to the matter.  A review of public expenditure is under way, which I am sure will form some basis in regard to reaching a decision.  However, it is important the Minister makes a decision on this issue as soon as possible to provide clarity for those families.

Is ceap magaidh sinn má leanfaimid leis an sórt seo polaitíochta.  Ní ró-fhada ó shin a bhí Rialtas Fhianna Fáil agus an Chomhaontais Ghlais ag déanamh an rud ceannann céanna atá siad ag cáineadh inniu ar Rialtas nua Fhine Gael agus Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre.  Is ait go bhfuil an Rialtas nua tar éis polasaí an sean-Rialtais a thógáil go huile is go hiomlán.I thought it was a joke that this motion was before us at all.  The arguments contained within the Fianna Fáil motion are the exact arguments I put to Deputy — or Corporal — Willie O'Dea when he was on the other side of the House, when he and his Government implemented a policy of closing down barracks the length and breadth of this country — of this State, in fact.At the time, the reason the Government did this was to sell off property to the highest bidder.  There was no benefit to local communities.  The Government would not even grant the local authorities the land to ensure they could use it for social housing purposes.  Instead, it sold it to them at a huge profit or, as in the case of Clancy Barracks in this city, it made local authorities bid against a private concern, as happened up and down the country.  This is something I do not want any future Government to repeat.  If the Government is contemplating closing down the barracks listed in the motion, I want an assurance that it will not sell off this land and will instead transfer it to the local authorities or organisations such as the IDA to use for proper purposes, rather than making a profit on the back of it.If anyone goes to Clancy Barracks in my constituency, they will find it is sitting under the umbrella of NAMA because one of the big developers, P. Elliott, has collapsed and is in receivership.  Most of the apartments are half built and sitting empty, and even those that are completed are sitting empty while half the site is derelict.  At the time, we had asked that this land be transferred to Dublin City Council in order to redevelop the area, but it did not happen.  Shame on the last Government and shame on this Government if it is contemplating doing exactly what the last Government intended to do, which is to close the barracks listed in the motion.  I remember not long ago a campaign to try to prevent the closures in Cavan, Mullingar and other areas which are listed here.  The new Government has just taken the clothes from the previous Fianna Fáil Government.  Shame on it.The Government amendment should give a commitment that none of this land or property will be used in any way that is detrimental to social good, and that it would be transferred to local authorities, which in many cases are in need of land to redevelop towns, for future social housing use or for social facilities such as sports facilities.  In the main, however, most of these barracks should not be closed and sold off in any shape or form.The fact this is even being contemplated, and the fact the strength and location of the Defence Forces is being dictated to us, in this State, by the IMF, proves the truth of what we said about both the Nice treaty and the Lisbon treaty, namely, that in the future our neutrality will be gone and the strength of our Defence Forces will be dictated by external forces.  This is again proven here.  It is even written in the Government amendment, because that ties each decision pertaining to the neutrality of this State and to what one of its backbenchers called the armed forces, that is, the Defence Forces, to dictation by an outside force, namely, the IMF and the European Union in this case.  I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment and to support the motion tabled by Fianna Fáil, even though it is disgraceful the latter party tabled it without any hint of the embarrassment it should have, given its previous history in respect of barracks closures.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I will focus on the threatened barracks closure in my constituency and I appeal to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to support the retention of Dún Uí Néill Barracks in Cavan, as well as its full complement of serving soldiers and civilian employees.  I believe Cavan to be an important location for the Defence Forces, allowing speedy response to any given situation arising right across the counties of Leitrim, Cavan and Monaghan.  On foot of the closure of the Monaghan barracks and the earlier closures of Cootehill and Castleblayney, Dún Uí Néill became home to many of those displaced members.  That they and their families would be obliged to face further displacement with all that entails, including housing mortgage renegotiations in the most difficult of times across this sector and resecuring the education needs of their children, is grossly unfair and may force some to leave.  Is the dole queue their only future?  Surely this is not the objective.Built in 1990, Dún Uí Néill is a purpose-built Irish Defence Forces barracks, not a vacated facility from another century.  I understand it is a fine facility that meets the needs of its complement of 150 serving soldiers and ten civilian staff.  For the wives and partners of those currently serving in Lebanon, of whom I am informed 22 are members attached to Dún Uí Néill, this period of great uncertainty is doubly difficult.  A new communications mast was installed in 2010, but at what cost?  What real financial gains were made from the earlier barracks closures in counties Monaghan and Donegal and elsewhere?  What are the prospects of getting a worthwhile return from such properties and sites in these straitened economic times?  What cost would be incurred if, God forbid, another farm related outbreak occurred north of the Border and it was necessary to deploy soldiers?  Where would they be billeted?  A local GP is medical officer at Dún Uí Néill.  This is an important relationship and is one that would not be quickly re-established elsewhere.  Moreover, the Reserve Defence Force unit in Cavan also is based at Dún Uí Néill.  What would be the cost of alternative premises or does the Minister propose its disbandment, severing finally a close and honoured relationship between the town and county of Cavan and the Defence Forces?  I have spoken to some family members of serving members attached to Dún Uí Néill who describe the atmosphere in their homes today as being akin to wake houses.  This is a dreadful position in which to place these families.  If Dún Uí Néill is to close, the financial advantages are far from clear.  This is the most economical barracks in the State and, if vacated, it would require expensive security until its future was determined.  Light and heat certainly would be a factor as the buildings surely would not be allowed to decline through the absence of heat in the ravages of our far from idyllic climate.The real pain, of course, will be borne by the serving soldiers, their wives and partners and especially by their children.  What will a serving member who is already in negative equity do?  How will he or she cope with a crippling debt to a bank or building society following the sale of his or her home?  How will such a member ever again hope to enter into home ownership?  No loans are being given out and certainly not to low to middle income earners who are already burdened by a carry-on debt.  Credit unions are working under even greater restrictions than previously and will be unable to step into the breach and meet the borrowing needs of dozens of displaced soldiers and their families.  Will the Department of Defence and the Exchequer bail out these men and women and their families?  What will be the loss to the economy of Cavan town and county?  It is estimated that a sum of approximately €3 million per annum, comprising wages spent and supplies secured across the Breifne county, will be taken out of circulation.  This will have a knock-on effect with more jobs lost, especially in the retail and services sectors.The serving soldiers attached to Dún Uí Néill have made an important contribution to the State, the county of Cavan and the wider region.  They have given service to individuals and whole communities struggling to deal with a variety of challenges.  They have helped to keep the emergency services in action in the worst of weather conditions, with last winter being a particular example when they presented day and night to assist with all needs.  I urge the Minister, Deputy Shatter, to visit Dún Uí Néill in the days ahead.  Nothing will impress on him more the importance of retaining Dún Uí Néill as a vibrant Defence Forces barracks than his own first-hand observation and experience, and I have no doubt that he would receive a warm welcome at this, one of only two surviving Ulster-based Defence Forces facilities.  I urge the Minister to so act.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I welcome the opportunity to speak briefly on this motion, particularly because it refers to Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, a barracks with which I obviously am very familiar.  Looking across at the Labour Party benches, I note not a single Labour Party member is present in the Chamber.  Regardless of their presence or otherwise, I remind Labour Party Ministers and Members that the Labour Party was founded in May 1912 in the town hall in Clonmel.  A Labour Party Minister of State already proposes to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the founding of that party in Clonmel with the closure of the town's acute psychiatric unit.  Does the Labour Party in government now propose to celebrate that 100th anniversary by desecrating the names of Connolly and Larkin through the closure of Kickham Barracks, Clonmel, a barracks and a tradition that has been in the town since 1650?  If Kickham Barracks has been closed by the time the Labour Party comes to celebrate its 100th anniversary in Clonmel next year, its members will get a very cold reception in the town, or perhaps it will be very hot.  The Labour Party members in south Tipperary, as well as Labour Party Oireachtas Members and MEPs, should ensure Kickham Barracks, Clonmel is retained.  They owe this to the people of Clonmel and south Tipperary.The final point in the Government amendment to the motion states it "condemns mischievous attempts to exaggerate the impact of these necessary decisions and create unnecessary fears among local communities".  That is choice, after a Minister of State talked of the closure of Mullingar barracks being crass stupidity and after a Government backbencher referred to the gloves being taken off.  The closure of barracks in the country, in Clonmel in particular, would be a huge blow to soldiers and their families.  It would be a huge blow to the town of Clonmel, as €4 million to €5 million per annum would be taken out of its local economy.  It has been suggested there would be no job losses as a result of such closures.  If one takes €4 million or €5 million out of the economy of Clonmel or any other town, be it Mullingar or Cavan or elsewhere, job losses will result.  One cannot take such a sum out of a town's economy without experiencing job losses.Members have heard many times in this debate that this is the fault of the previous Government.  Perhaps that is the case but the present Government was elected on the basis that it would change all that.  The Government parties made election promises and commitments to the people that what went on during the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government would change.  It also has been suggested that these measures must be taken to achieve savings.While someone on the Government benches mentioned patriotism, I have stated in this Chamber previously and reiterate now that it is time for some patriotism from the very wealthy people of Ireland.  I note that 5% of the wealthy people in this country own €250 billion in assets but do not pay a ha'penny in wealth tax.  Many European countries have a wealth tax and there has been debate in this regard in France recently.  Moreover, some states in the United States also have a wealth tax.  Why should Ireland not have a wealth tax to oblige those with huge incomes and who have huge assets pay their fair share?

I met with the Colombian Ambassador to Ireland in July and we discussed at length the human rights situation in the country. I welcomed the steps which the Santos administration has taken to bring an end to violence in Colombia, and I outlined the ongoing concerns of the Irish Government at reports of human rights abuses in Colombia, in particular the hardships reportedly being suffered by trade unionists.   At that meeting, I also welcomed the passage of the Victims' Rights and Land Restitution Law in June this year. This is an innovative piece of legislation and will, if fully implemented, represent a further important step in the efforts to push forward the peace process. Vice President Garzón has been tasked by President Santos to take forward the Government's human rights programme. Vice President Garzón has a trade union background himself and has shown his willingness to meet with a broad range of groups to discuss human rights issues, including the four members of the Oireachtas who travelled to Colombia in October 2010 [Deputy Breen, former Deputies Higgins and Kitt, and Senator Daly].The Colombian Ambassador reiterated to me President Santos's willingness to bring all stakeholders together in the efforts to reduce human rights violations against trade unionists, human rights defenders and journalists.It should be noted that, despite these very real concerns, Colombia is a safer place to live today, compared with the situation ten years ago. Dialogue with the Government of Colombia, bilaterally and with our EU partners, offers, I believe, the best way to further the objective of improving the human rights situation there. The most recent EU-Colombia human rights dialogue was held in Bogota on 30 June, where the EU voiced concerns at human rights violations against trade unionists in Colombia.The Government will continue to monitor human rights in Colombia through our Embassy in Mexico and together with the European Union.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	398	Each year my Department publishes a report on the activities supported by Irish Aid, the Government's development aid programme.  The focus of the 2010 Irish Aid Annual Report, which I launched two weeks ago, is on demonstrating the impact of Irish Aid funding on the lives of communities where we are working. The theme of the report is that development assistance works.  At a time when international aid budgets are under pressure, and every item of public expenditure is under scrutiny, it is vital that we can demonstrate the difference Irish Aid funding is making in the lives of communities in some of the poorest countries in the world.  In June, I visited Ireland's aid programmes in Malawi and Mozambique, and saw for myself how they are making a practical contribution to the fight against poverty and hunger.Important examples of how Irish Aid funding is saving and changing lives are included in the Annual Report.  For instance, with the assistance of Ireland's aid:Life expectancy at birth, increased by five years between 2000 and 2010, in Ethiopia.7 million children are in school in Mozambique, compared to just 400,000 twenty years ago.The rate of infection with the HIV virus in Uganda is now 6.4%, compared to 18% in the 1990s.Ireland's aid programme has a strong international reputation for its quality. It is recognised for its sharp focus on reducing poverty and hunger in some of the poorest countries, in particular in sub-Saharan Africa.The OECD has described our aid programme as cutting edge, and a champion in making aid more effective.  Just last week another report, the 2010 Evaluation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, ranked Ireland highest among EU Union Member States for the delivery of our commitments on aid quality.  These reports confirm that the high standards of Ireland's aid programme are being maintained.

I attended a high-level meeting on Libya in New York on 20 September, on the margins of the sixty-sixth session of the UN General Assembly. This meeting demonstrated the strong international support for the transition now underway in Libya and marked also the formal acceptance into the United Nations of the new Libya and its interim government, the National Transitional Council (NTC).At the high-level meeting, I warmly welcomed, on behalf of the Government and the Irish people, the fact that the NTC has now assumed power and will govern Libya as an interim administration during the period leading up to fair and free elections. I also offered the Libyan people all possible cooperation in the period ahead, building on the political support and humanitarian assistance, amounting to some €1.3 million, which we have extended since last February.  The interim authorities have identified many immediate challenges, including the provision of humanitarian assistance to those in need, removing unexploded ordinance, opening schools and repairing critical infrastructure such as electricity and water networks.  Capacity building in public administration and re-establishing the rule of law will also be critical.I have already had discussions with representatives of the NTC, including a meeting with the interim Prime Minister of Libya, Mahmoud Jibril, on the margins of the Foreign Affairs Council last April and an earlier meeting in Dublin with the NTC's representative to the UK and Ireland.  I look forward to further high-level contacts with the new Libyan authorities at the earliest opportunity.The Government believes that there is significant scope for strengthening bilateral cooperation between Ireland and Libya in many areas. Many Libyans have travelled to Ireland for educational or work reasons and have made it their home. There are also economic opportunities, not least the possibility of Irish companies assisting Libya in its re-construction.In relation to the bilateral issue raised by the Deputy, the Government remains in ongoing contact with the British Government and other relevant stakeholders in the context of efforts to address the legacy of the Troubles, in keeping with the principles of Good Friday Agreement.  This specific issue is one element of this legacy and is best addressed as part of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the legacy of the Troubles.

Elections took place almost exactly a year ago, on 3 October 2010.  The process of government formation has yet to be completed.  All main political party leaders met recently in Brcko to try to find a way forward, with a specific focus on the formation of the state level executive, the Council of Ministers.  While it appears that some of the parties have moved towards compromise positions, a number of obstacles to agreement remain, particularly in relation to the representation of the Bosnian-Croat community in the executive.  Ireland and its EU partners continue to urge all the parties in Bosnia and Herzegovina to overcome their differences and form a government so that the country can move forward on its path towards EU accession.Safeguarding the territorial integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the cornerstone of the EU's policy towards the country.  The EU has not hesitated to reject statements questioning the legitimacy of the country's post-Dayton institutions.In May of this year, High Representative Ashton secured a commitment from Milorad Dodik, the Republika Srspka President, that a decision by that entity's national assembly to hold a referendum calling into question the state-level judiciary would be repealed.  Subsequently, on 2 June 2011, the Republika Srpska national assembly voted to repeal the decision to hold the referendum.  I welcomed this development, which was a sign of the EU's commitment to protecting Bosnia and Herzegovina's state-level institutions.Ultimately, the EU perspective of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the most powerful tool at the disposal of the international community to help build and maintain stability in the country.  The EU is closely engaged in assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina to undertake the reforms necessary to move forward on its path to the EU.  Developments in the country are regularly discussed by the European Union at both official and political level, including in recent months.The EU is working to enhance its presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina.  This will help to make the prospect of EU accession more real to the people of the country, and strengthen the leverage of EU accession as a means to encourage the necessary reform.  In September, Peter Sorensen, who has broad experience of the Western Balkans, took up the double-hatted post of Head of EU Delegation and EU Special Representative in Sarajevo.In December 2010, the EU lifted visa requirements for Bosnian and Albanian visitors to the Schengen area.  In the lead-up to visa liberalisation, Bosnia and Herzegovina's political leaders and administration worked together effectively to implement wide-ranging reforms.  This development was a major boost for the country and proves that the Bosnian authorities are capable of working together when there is a tangible EU-related goal at stake.In terms of the EU's commitment to safeguarding stability in Bosnia and Herzegovina, I would also note the presence of EUFOR Althea, the EU military mission in the country.  The mission of Operation Althea, to which Ireland has made a significant contribution over the years, is to provide a military presence in order to contribute to a safe and secure environment, deny conditions for a resumption of violence, and help to implement the Dayton agreement.

The following tables set out, for both Votes, the details of external reports commissioned by the Department from 2008 to 2011 and the costs in each case.  The tables have been prepared by reference to directly contracted engagements in respect of which professional fees were paid and Professional Services Withholding Tax (PSWT) was deducted, where appropriate. The Department is very conscious of the need the achieve value for money and is in full compliance with national and EU procurement regulations concerning tendering requirements.The Department, through Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), occasionally commissions outside expertise where the effective management and evaluation of the programme necessitates the use of such skills. During the course of their engagements these consultants/experts may prepare reports and other documentation.  However, as they would not have been commissioned specifically to furnish a report, these details have not been included in the table.The Department commissions external reports only where specialised knowledge is not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid, where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required.  In-depth analysis of issues by external experts has informed — and continues to inform — my Department's policies, allowing for more targeted use of resources and greater accountability in the allocation of budgets.  I consider that these reports have been necessary, strategically beneficial and cost-effective.YearExperts/ConsultantsMatter Reported OnCost(€)2008Millward BrowneResearch Project to establish reasons underlying the result of the Referendum on the Lisbon Treaty.138,0612008Richard Sinnott, Johan A Elkink, Kevin O’Rourke and James McBrideReport on Attitudes and Behaviour in the Referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon11,8002008Communications ClinicThe preparation of a detailed Communication Action Plan to be used to direct spending under the Department’s Communicating Europe Initiative in 2009.48,0002008Jim O’LearyAssessment of Value for Money Review of the Passport Service.7,2602009Millward BrowneFieldwork for survey to investigate opinions and attitudes to the European Union30,2532009Richard Sinnott, Johan A Elkink and Stephen QuinlanReport on Attitudes and Behaviour in the Second Referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon11,3622010Aisling Swaine, University of UlsterReport of Cross-Learning Process on UN Security Council Resolution 132513,5252010Macaulay Associates NetworkPreparation of Stakeholder Feedback Report Analysing Impact of Reconciliation and Anti Sectarianism Funds7,1182011Nata Duvvury, NUI GalwayFirst draft of Ireland’s National Action Plan on UNSCR 132513,000YearExperts/ConsultantsMatter Reported OnCost(€)2008AGEMA — MozambiqueVulnerability & Agriculture Extension Study42,0002008Albert MalamaCopper Belt Government Programme Evaluation7,3432008Alicia da Silva Calane — MozambiqueAnalytic Study on process and indicators to address gender related obstacles to achieving PROAGRI goals10,0002008Catherine ButcherReview of HIVAIDS programme in Northern Province  (Zambia)18,6002008Copenhagen Development Consulting A/S.Evaluation of Irish Aid Support to Primary Education in the Rwenzori Region, Uganda96,6652008Debebe  — EthiopiaCivil Society Fund Audit3,0002008Desam International Consultants — UgandaEvaluation of Irish Aid Civil Society Programme — Uganda .19,5002008Development Research Training (DRT) — UgandaStatus of Chronic Poverty and Vulnerability in Karamoja2,8572008Dr Barry RyanReview of the role of the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) in the Partnership Programme for Eastern Europe and Central Asia (PPECA)15,0002008Dr. Henk J.W MustsaersReview Operational Research for Food Security and Capacity Building and Evaluate Joint Mekelle and Cork Universities MSc Degree in Rural Development30,6002008Dr. Joseph Oonyu — UgandaMid Term Review of Irish Aid Support to Human Resources Development for Increased Access to Primary Health Care.6,5542008Dr. Larry Adupa — UgandaDocumenting the process of establishing the civil society fund for HIV/AIDS response in Uganda11,2572008Economics for the Environment Consultancy Ltd (eftec)Review of Irish Aid’s Strategic Partnership’s Environment Programme 2006-2008:30,0002008Elim Serviços Lda-Evaluation of Irish support to Technoserve19,3692008FRR/ IDL GroupReview of Irish Aid Programme in Zimbabwe18,3512008FSG Social Impact AdvisorsEvaluation of International Partnership for Microbicides139,0002008Health Tech Consulting — MozambiqueEvaluation of the Provincial Investment Plan 2004-2008 (PIPS) in Niassa Province (Mozambique)25,0002008Helen O’NeillAssessment of United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) as potential partner for Irish Aid4,0002008Integra Economic Development Consultants LtdReport to Inter-Departmental Committee on Development (IDCD) on development of skill sets18,3002008Ishmaels K.

I had also been due to meet the Israeli Foreign Minister, but this did not prove possible due to scheduling difficulties on the Israeli side.These meetings provided a valuable opportunity to discuss a range of international issues, including developments in relation to the Middle East Peace Process, as well as bilateral issues and Ireland's candidacy for the UN Human Rights Council in 2012.I also held a bilateral meeting on 26 September with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon.  Among the issues we discussed were sustainable development, gender and the enhancement of women's rights, the Palestinian application for UN membership, and the Arab Spring.In view of Ireland's upcoming Chairmanship of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in January 2012, I participated in an OSCE Troika meeting with the Foreign Ministers of Lithuania and Kazakhstan, respectively, the current and previous Chairperson-in-Office of the OSCE.  I also attended an important Ministerial meeting on Mediation hosted by the Foreign Ministers of Turkey and Finland.I also participated in a number of High Level Meetings during the UNGA week, including on Libya, the Durban Declaration and the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty Article XIV Conference.  I was also honoured to address the High Level Meeting on Nutrition and Food Security on 21 September which US Secretary of State Clinton and UN Secretary General Ban also participated in and which builds on the successful Irish-US initiative on this issue launched at the United Nations in September 2010.  In addition, I also attended the traditional meetings of EU Foreign Ministers with their US and Russian counterparts as well as a Mini-Summit on the Horn of Africa on 24 September.Economic promotional work also formed an important part of my programme in New York where I met with both Irish and American business representatives, and conducted interviews with a wide range of important US media, including the Wall Street Journal, Bloomberg News and Fox News.  Another important aspect of my visit was meeting with local Irish community representatives in New York and presenting the first Certificate of Irish Heritage to the family of the late Joseph Hunter, a member of the New York Fire Department who died in the 9/11 attacks.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	403	The second Global Irish Economic Forum will be held in Dublin Castle on the 7th and 8th of October.  The primary purposes of the Forum will be to engage fully with the Irish Diaspora in developing Ireland's global business and trade relations; to discuss face-to-face the Government's priorities for economic renewal with key members of the international business community; and to strengthen ties with the Irish Diaspora as a key part of the Government's efforts to restore Ireland's international reputation abroad.  There has been an exceptional uptake on the Taoiseach's invitation and over 270 acceptances have been received from members of the Global Irish Network based in some 35 countries.The Forum is being organised and managed by my Department in close cooperation with other Government Departments and the State Agencies.  Over the course of the two days, I will make an address at the opening session and take part in the opening plenary debate which will discuss "Ireland: the road to recovery".  I will also be a panellist for other debates including “Ireland’s image abroad: communicating the message” and the closing plenary discussion, along with the Taoiseach and President Clinton.
In response to requests from participants at the 2009 Forum, a considerable amount of time has been devoted to small breakout working groups. Each working group will focus on a topic of relevance to the Programme for Government and will involve the participation of the relevant Minister.  I will take part in two working groups, the one dealing with "Ireland's reputation abroad" on 7 October and the "Job Creation" group on 8 October. I will also deliver the closing address to the Forum. A copy of the programme including details of the working groups and a list of those attending is available on the Forum's website, globalirishforum.ie.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I propose to take Questions Nos. 60 and 69 together.EU relations with Colombia and Peru are conducted in the framework of regional relations between the EU and the Andean Community, comprising Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.Negotiations commenced in 2009 on a Multiparty Free Trade Agreement between the EU and two member states of the Andean Community — Colombia and Peru.The FTA negotiations, which were conducted by the European Commission on the basis of a mandate from the Council, concluded in March 2010 and the Agreement was initialled by the parties on 13 April 2011. It is expected that it will be signed in the first half of 2012.The Agreement is ambitious and contains significant commitments by each party.  Under the terms of the proposed deal, the EU will open up its market to exporters from Peru and Colombia by committing to an immediate liberalisation in industrial and fisheries products as well as substantial tariff concessions in agriculture.  This will generate new opportunities and new market outlets for economic operators, including dairy and other farmers, at all levels in Colombia and Peru and will contribute significantly to the social and economic development of both countries.In order for small scale producers to reap the full benefits of the agreement, its implementation must go hand in hand with the development of an integrated set of rural development programmes which comprise education, public services and infrastructure. This is the responsibility of the Andean partner countries in the first place but the EU is providing support for these measures through its co-operation programmes.Nor is the Agreement limited to trade issues alone.  It also covers other important aspects such as human rights and sustainable development.  These include commitments to the implementation of key International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions and respect for environmental rules.  A monitoring system, which foresees the active involvement of civil society stakeholders, will ensure the effective implementation of these commitments.The Agreement will not undermine the rights of indigenous peoples in Peru and Colombia.  I am confident that the authorities in both countries will take full account of the consultation and participation provisions of ILO Convention 169 in their internal processes for approval of the Agreement.  In the case of Peru, the Government launched a dialogue process in 2009 to address a number of issues relating to indigenous rights.  Furthermore, the Government has committed to implement a development plan for the Amazonian populations.The EU is supportive of national efforts to ensure effective protection for, and promotion of the rights of indigenous communities.  It is also financing projects implemented by NGOs and non-state actors in the field of education, training, and sustainable management of natural resources which aim to reinforce indigenous organisations and promote their rights.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	405	My Department's current taxi policy provides that taxis may be used for official business only in cases when public transport is not available or feasible or when officers are required, because of work or official travel commitments to travel early in the morning or late at night either to or from HQ or to airports or train stations.  At other times, the use of taxis is not sanctioned.  I believe that this provides a reasonable balance between requirements to safeguard the exchequer to the greatest extent possible and a recognition that there are situations where the use of taxis will be necessary.The costs related to taxi use are monitored on a monthly basis with a view to identifying any use not in line with this policy.  While no such inappropriate use has been identified in recent years, if it were to be, the official would be asked to clarify the situation, instructed to ensure future compliance with the policy and would be required to reimburse the official account where necessary.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 67 together.I remain gravely concerned about the situation in Syria.  President Assad and his Government seem oblivious to the demands of the Syrian people for change and to the lessons of the "Arab Spring" elsewhere.  It is unconscionable that the Syrian government has for some seven months calculatedly and systematically persecuted its own citizens peacefully demanding democratic freedoms.  Despite the appeals of the international community, President Assad and his authorities have persisted in their violent repression, including firing at short-range into crowds of unarmed protestors and shelling Syrian towns.  To date, these actions have resulted in the deaths of over 2,700 men, women and children.  Thousands more have been detained and many of those have been appallingly tortured.As I stated when I addressed the UN General Assembly on 26 September, my basic message to President Assad is that no leader who refuses to listen to what his people are saying and to act on their clearly expressed desire for peace and reform can expect to remain in power.The international community is determined to bring utmost pressure to bear until there is a change in policy in Syria.  Ireland has fully supported, and enacted, actions taken at European Union level, including comprehensive sanctions against Syria.  I fully support the strong political messages which have been sent by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton, most recently on 23 September, calling for an end to the repression and the immediate start of an inclusive political dialogue.The EU has now extended its range of sanctions against the Syrian government, enacting an investment ban on the Syrian oil sector, as well as prohibiting the delivery of banknotes to the Syrian Central Bank, and listing additional persons and entities connected with the repression in Syria under the existing asset freeze and travel ban.  These measures are targeted to ensure that the impact on the general population in Syria is minimised.  The EU has also imposed a ban on the import of crude oil from Syria — the EU is by far the largest such importer — on 2 September.  Through these measures, the EU hopes to prompt a rethink on the part of a government that has so far failed to heed the international community's messages.Efforts are also continuing at UN level to increase pressure on Syria to bring about an end to the violence.  On 3 August, the UN Security Council issued a Presidential Statement which condemned widespread violations of human rights and the use of force against civilians by the Syrian authorities.  The Security Council also noted the lack of progress in the implementation of announced reforms by the Syrian authorities.  The UN Security Council is currently discussing a draft Resolution on the situation and Ireland strongly supports our EU partners on the Security Council who are working towards a robust Resolution on Syria, commensurate with the gravity of the situation there.  In addition, the UN Human Rights Council has formed an international Commission of Inquiry to examine and report on the human rights situation in Syria.In relation to the case raised by the Deputy, that of renowned Syrian psychoanalyst Dr Rafah Nashid, I understand that Dr Nashid was detained on 10 September at Damascus airport.  There have been reports that she is being held in solitary confinement and concerns are growing about her serious health condition.  Mrs. Nashid is well-known for treating victims of psychological trauma as well as for her active engagement in favour of dialogue between all Syrians.  I call for her immediate release, as well as the release of the many thousands who have been arbitrarily detained in Syria, many of whom are being subjected to torture in custody.  In this regard, I fully support the comments by EU High Representative Catherine Ashton in her statement of 23 September on the case of Dr Nashid.Ireland will, with its partners with the EU and the broader international community, maintain and indeed intensify its pressure until the violence perpetrated by the Assad regime in Syria comes to an end and the legitimate aspirations of the Syrian people begin to be realised.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	407	The 66th session of the United Nations General Assembly opened on 13 September 2011.   Plan International, a children's development organisation, is campaigning to have 22 September instituted as the International Day of the Girl Child.   The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through Irish Aid, has a long history of support to Plan Ireland, which is the national affiliate of Plan International in Ireland.In 2010, Irish Aid provided Plan Ireland with grants totalling €1,839,992.  Over €1million of this was allocated to support the work of Plan Ireland in responding to emergencies.  The balance of the grant supports long-term development work in West Africa which ensures that more children, especially girls, have access to well-constructed and equipped schools and better quality education.Protecting and empowering girls is critical to advancing gender equality, which is a fundamental human right and essential for the reduction of poverty.  Getting more girls into primary schools is a key objective of education programmes supported by Irish Aid in Lesotho, Mozambique, Uganda and Zambia.  For many girls, particularly at secondary school level, gender-based violence is a key obstacle to their attendance.  Irish Aid has supported Government and NGO child protection strategies and programmes in Mozambique and Zambia.In order to have an international day instituted, the United Nations General Assembly must support a draft resolution instituting the international day.I am aware that Canada is considering proposing a draft resolution on this issue. Ireland will consider the terms of the draft resolution when it is presented.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	408	Turkey and Israel have clear, strongly held and conflicting views on the circumstances surrounding the tragic deaths of nine Turkish citizens on the May 2010 Gaza flotilla, and attempts to resolve this issue between them have so far been unsuccessful.  The publication earlier this month of the UN Palmer Report on the incident, which it was hoped might begin a move towards reconciliation, has unfortunately led instead to further recriminations.Regardless of the position any observer might take on the flotillas or the 2010 events, this breakdown in relations between Israel and Turkey is an unwelcome development in the already tense and troubled region of the Eastern Mediterranean. It is very much to be hoped that they will actively seek to find common ground and work to restore good relations.I would not comment on the reported words of either side in this case.  It is not clear what was the basis for the reports of the ideas supposedly considered by Foreign Minister Liberman, and referred to in the Question.  Both the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister's Office stated in response to these reports that the policy of Israel was to seek to avoid heightening difficulties with Turkey.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65, 94, 95, 97, 107, 110 and 123 together.The Government is strongly committed to Ireland's overseas development programme, which is central to our foreign policy.  It is internationally recognised as one of the best development aid programmes in the world, is clearly focused on the fight against extreme poverty and hunger, and is concentrated in some of the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  Ireland's aid programme has a rigorous focus on achieving real and sustainable results and provides strong international leadership in making aid more effective.We were elected to restore growth to the Irish economy and rebuild our international reputation on the world stage.  Despite the good progress we have made, Ireland still faces considerable challenges in ensuring that our public finances are put back on a sound and sustainable footing.  However despite our current difficulties we are not willing to turn our backs on the world's poor and marginalised.The Programme for Government underlines our commitment to Ireland's development programme and the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on Overseas Development Assistance (ODA).  As recently as last week at the UN General Assembly, the Tánaiste clearly stated that we remain committed to this 0.7% target and that we will continue to work towards its attainment.Decisions on the annual allocations for the aid programme in the coming years will have to be taken within the overall budgetary framework and the fiscal constraints facing the Government.  We are currently engaged in the 2012 estimates process, and while I can give an assurance that, as Minister with responsibility for trade and development, I will make the strongest possible case for funding for development cooperation — the final budget allocation for next year will ultimately be a matter for the Minister for Finance.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	410	The inaugural Global Irish Economic Forum, held at Farmleigh in 2009, was an important milestone in Ireland's relationship with its Diaspora.A detailed update in respect of each of the 59 specific and medium term objectives identified in the Report of the Forum was published on my Department's website in April of this year.  That document demonstrates the significant number of proposals that have either been fully or substantively delivered by Government.  Some of the initiatives proposed at Farmleigh were general or thematic in nature and covered a range of sectors including: innovation; education; tourism; culture; diaspora engagement and network development.Among the specific initiatives that emerged from, or were influenced by, the 2009 Farmleigh Forum were:the establishment of the Global Irish Network of over 300 influential individuals drawn from 37 countries;a new focus on the promotion of Irish culture abroad;Tourism Ireland's ‘Come Home' campaign targeted at the Diaspora;the establishment of the Farmleigh Fellowship Programme in Singapore;the establishment of a Diaspora focussed website- www.worldirish.com- ;the expansion of the Irish Technology Leadership Group (with Irish Government support) and the establishment of the Irish Innovation Centre in Silicon Valley;increased access to genealogical records and the establishment of the Certificate of Irish Heritage;the provision of mentoring, introduction and advice for Irish companies;the appointment of a high profile spokesperson for the IFSC.In addition, since the 2009 Forum, Irish Missions and State Agencies overseas have worked with local communities to enhance existing or establish new business Networks.  For instance, our Ambassadors in Paris, Berlin and Abu Dhabi have worked with 2009 Forum participants to establish new Irish business networks in these locations.  A number of young Irish professional networks have also been established with the support of my Department since 2009.The second Global Irish Economic Forum will take place at Dublin Castle on 7 and 8 October and will have a number of objectives.   First, it is designed to maintain and further develop a structured engagement between the Government and leading business figures from our Diaspora and from among our friends abroad.  Secondly, it will play an important role in the Government's ongoing and increasingly successful work of rebuilding Ireland's international reputation by enabling us to outline our economic objectives and achievements to date and to seek the assistance of participants in projecting positive messages abroad.  Thirdly, a number of specific initiatives will be launched or showcased at the Forum.  Fourthly, participants will be tasked with proposing no more than two to three specific value added ideas from each of the fifteen working groups.The Government is deeply encouraged by the fact that over 300 people have accepted the invitation to participate and looks forward to a productive meeting.

Our funding has been utilised by the UN, the Red Cross and NGOs such as Concern and Trócaire, to provide vital food supplies, shelter, basic health care and clean water to many thousands of people.  In addition to financial help, Irish Aid has also carried out two airlifts of humanitarian supplies from its pre-positioned stockpiles in Dubai and has deployed 21 members of its highly skilled Rapid Response Corps to directly assist in humanitarian operations.  We are making a real and tangible difference on the ground.  Lives are being saved as a result.The Government is committed to continuing its support for the Horn of Africa region and at the recent international summit on the crisis, convened by the United Nations in New York, the Tánaiste pledged a further €10 million in emergency assistance to the poorest and most vulnerable in the region before the end of 2012.The Government is acutely conscious of the need to ensure that the emergency funding which we provide is used to save lives and target those most in need.  For this reason, we work closely with our humanitarian partners, including the key UN agencies, the Red Cross and the major NGOs, in deciding on funding allocations and in designing and implementing their programmes.  We also prioritise monitoring and evaluation as a means to ensure value for money in the use of public funds for the relief effort.To date in 2011, officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs have carried out three field visits to the Horn of Africa, including to Somalia, the Dollo Ado refugee camp in Ethiopia and the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya.  These visits have proven invaluable in allowing us to assess both the situation on the ground and the most effective means to provide assistance.At this stage, neither the Tánaiste nor I have advanced plans to visit the Horn of Africa region.  What is most important at this juncture is that we continue to respond as effectively as possible and we are continuing to keep in constant touch with our partners on the ground to ensure our assistance has maximum impact.  I can, however, assure the Deputy that the Government will continue to monitor the situation closely and will assess the possible benefits of a Ministerial visit in light of developments in the region and our ongoing discussions with our humanitarian partners.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	412	One of the most important international meetings on development issues this year will be the High Level Forum on Aid Effectiveness, to be held in Busan, in the Republic of Korea, in November.  The Forum will assess progress in implementing the commitments made under the 2005 Paris Declaration on making aid more effective.  It will also focus on new global development challenges, such as climate change and fragile states, and on strengthening partnerships with emerging economies.  I look forward to attending the Forum.  We have held discussions on our preparations with members of the Oireachtas, and I look forward to further consultations with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am pleased that the Chair of the Joint Committee will join the official delegation in Busan.  We are also consulting with the Irish development Non-Governmental Organisations on their priorities and plans for the meeting.When I visited Malawi and Mozambique in June, I was struck by how important it is for all international aid donors to co-ordinate their programmes and to work more closely with Governments and communities in developing countries so that aid is delivered effectively and makes a sustainable contribution to the ending of extreme poverty and hunger.  In the current economic climate, it is more important than ever to ensure that our development aid delivers value for money and achieves long term results.Ireland will play a strong role at the Forum.  Our development programme is already recognised internationally as a leader in making aid more effective.  Officials from Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, are engaging internationally with our partners in developing countries, the OECD, the EU and the UN on preparations for the discussions and the Outcome Document.  Ireland's approach has been to work to strengthen the focus on poverty reduction and on development results, particularly in fragile and conflict-affected states.  We are also ensuring that women and girls are prioritised in development plans.  Other priorities for Ireland include strengthening the transparency and accountability of development spending, ensuring civil society can play their legitimate role as partners in poverty reduction and reducing the bureaucracy of managing aid.I hope that the Forum in Busan will mark a decisive move in placing the effectiveness of aid at the heart of development policy and development programmes.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	413	The scale and presence of the Irish diplomatic network is currently being reviewed, along with all aspects of my Department's operations, as part of the Government's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure.  Given the current budgetary situation, and recognising the role that our diplomatic network is playing in Ireland's economic recovery, any adjustments to our diplomatic network will continue to be strategically focused.  In short, all our Missions abroad must continue to deliver benefits for Ireland and must do so in a manner that represents good value for money.Consideration of proposals to reduce our diplomatic network must balance any potential financial savings against the operational and reputational costs that would be incurred, including undermining our ability to influence the policies of the countries in question and writing off investments made over years in developing bilateral relationships with them.  At a time when Ireland needs as much international support and co-operation as possible, it is important to get these decisions right.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	414	I propose to take Questions Nos. 72, 77 and 114 together.The United States has a critical role to play in the search for peace in the Middle East.  Notwithstanding its long political and practical commitment to the security of Israel, successive US administrations have sought to encourage a political engagement between Israel and the Palestinians to reach a comprehensive peace, based on the two state solution.  The EU and the US, along with Russia and the UN, work together in the International Quartet to try and bring this about.I have referred earlier, in answer to a Priority Question, to the current state of the peace process, which has in recent years often been very frustrating.  But the strong personal commitment of President Obama and his administration has been evident and very welcome.  Both through the EU, and in my own discussions with Secretary Clinton, we have consistently sought to encourage the US to continue and push forward this involvement.  I believe there is a particular need for the friends of Israel to try to convince it of its own best interest in grasping the very real opportunity for long-term peace which now exists, but which may not last much longer. Clearly, this is not a responsibility of the United States alone.The question of a permanent structure, or secretariat, for the Middle East Peace Process has been raised from time to time. However, I am not aware that any of the parties has ever suggested that this might be a useful idea to them, and no such proposal is currently under consideration by the international community.  Frankly, it is difficult to see how it might operate in practice, and it might just become another matter to disagree on.The issues required to be settled in a comprehensive agreement are now well rehearsed.  There are full-time envoys working on the conflict on behalf of the individual Quartet members (the UN, the EU, the US and Russia) as well as on behalf of the Quartet itself, where this role is performed by former UK Prime Minister, Tony Blair.  The problem is not so much a lack of structures, as an absence of the political will necessary to forge an agreement.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The international community is facing a grave humanitarian crisis in the Horn of Africa, with an estimated thirteen million people in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti affected by a long-running drought.The situation is most critical in Somalia, where the United Nations estimates that 750,000 are at imminent risk of starvation and where the conflict and access issues have greatly exacerbated the situation.  Famine has been declared in six districts of the country and hundreds of thousands of people have moved to Mogadishu or across the border to Kenya or Ethiopia. Meanwhile, millions of people in Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti, continue to face severe difficulties of their own.Ireland has responded swiftly to the crisis, allocating more than €10 million for emergency assistance to UN agencies, the Red Cross movement and other humanitarian agencies working in the Horn of Africa.In addition, at a United Nations Ministerial Summit on the Horn of Africa in New York last week, the Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore TD, pledged a further €10 million in humanitarian assistance in 2011 and 2012.  Our emergency assistance combined with our longer term food security support to the region will amount to approximately €50 million in 2011 and 2012.  Ireland continues to be one of the most committed and generous donors to the region in per capita terms.Other donors have also contributed significantly to the relief operation, with pledges to date reaching €1.8 billion of the estimated €2.5 billion cost of the relief operation to the end of 2011.  The European Commission and EU Member States have provided more than half a billion euro, the United States has pledged more than $600 million and the UN's own Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF), to which Ireland is a major contributor, has also allocated over $117 million.  These funds have allowed the UN, the Red Cross and many NGOs to provide food, health care and other assistance to many hundreds of thousands of people.While many have given generously the UN has warned that the relief operation requires a further $700 million in 2011 if all of the needs in the region are to be met.  Under these circumstances there is an onus on national governments, including those which are not traditional aid donors, as well as the private sector, to step up their assistance.At EU level, Ireland has already been instrumental in pushing for a more intensive response and I used the recent meeting of EU Development Ministers in Sopot in Poland to call on the EU to respond quickly and generously. We will continue to call on the international community to increase its efforts in the period ahead.

This case is being dealt with as a bilateral matter between France and Mexico.  It is, however, being monitored by our Embassy which, together with the other EU diplomatic missions in Mexico, pays close attention to the situation regarding the administration of justice there.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	417	The Government recognises that trade is an engine for growth which offers a path to development for those most in need, wherever they live.  With increased trade, many developing countries have seen incomes and employment grow rapidly and this has resulted in significant reductions in poverty levels.  This understanding is clearly reflected in the EU's trade policy which seeks to promote inclusive growth in the European Union and abroad.To ensure that trade leads to positive development outcomes, the EU has employed a carefully differentiated approach to its engagement on trade with developing country partners.  EU trade policy is helping the poorest economies by providing generous unilateral trade preferences through the Generalised System of Preferences Scheme.  This includes the Everything but Arms Scheme which provides duty-free and quota-free access for goods from Least Developed Countries.  Other initiatives include the Economic Partnership Agreements, a series of new trade and development agreements which the EU has been negotiating with the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of States since 2002.   The goal is to foster development by promoting regional integration, creating opportunities for trade and investment and improving economic governance.EU trade agreements are designed to create opportunities by opening new markets for goods and services, increasing investment opportunities and making trade cheaper and faster.  It is, of course, essential that the EU adapts its strategy carefully to the situation of each partner country.As Minister of State for Trade and Development, I closely follow the negotiations of EU trade agreements with developing nations.  I believe it is essential that all such agreements clearly support the development needs of developing countries, and specifically their programmes to reduce poverty.  I am working with our partners to help ensure that the EU's negotiating approach is as flexible as possible under WTO law and that the negotiations, which are led by the European Commission, serve to strengthen the EU's partnership with developing countries.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	418	Ireland continues to support the right to self-determination of the people of Western Sahara, and the continuing engagement of the United Nations in the search for a political solution in the territory based on the principle of self-determination.  UN Secretary General Ban's Personal Envoy for Western Sahara, Christopher Ross, has convened several rounds of informal talks most recently in July this year.The major obstacle remains Morocco's refusal to allow a referendum in the territory which would include an option of independence for the people of the Western Sahara.  This has been provided for in a number of UN peace plans, and it is difficult to see that there can be any genuine self-determination without such a referendum.  The frustration of the Saharawi people at the impasse in the peace talks is understandable, particularly given the sweeping changes we have witnessed across the Arab world in recent months when their neighbours in the region have demanded a greater say in the governance of their countries.  However, as we know only too well on this island, the only solution to the conflict is through dialogue and negotiation, not through any other course of action.In his most recent report to the Security Council on the situation in Western Sahara, the UN Secretary General has suggested that the parties find a means to include respected representatives of a wide cross-section of the population of Western Sahara inside and outside the territory in the discussion of issues related to self-determination.  SG Ban also urged both parties to identify and discuss governance issues as many of these issues can be discussed without reference to the final status of the territory.  A resolution of some governance issues such as the structure of judiciary, the conduct of elections, or the design of education could help build trust between the two parties.  I would encourage both parties to implement the Secretary General's recommendations as a means of making progress as well as to continue to implement practical confidence building measures, such as family exchange visits.Ireland will continue its dialogue with both Morocco and the Polisario, through their representatives based here in Ireland, to encourage support for the UN Secretary General's good offices mission and the efforts of Personal Envoy Ross to achieve some measure of political progress and increased confidence between both sides.

The initiative provides that a former Taoiseach may employ two secretarial assistants for a period not exceeding five years from the date when s/he was last Taoiseach.  After the five year period has elapsed only one secretarial assistant may be employed.  The initiative also includes provision for purchase of computer equipment necessary for this type of service.While there are no guidelines in relation to the type of work for which secretarial assistants are employed by former Taoisigh, I understand that they carry out a normal range of secretarial duties to support the former Taoisigh in carrying out those aspects of work associated with their former roles which remain after their period in office has ceased.

Between 2004 and 2010 almost €81.5million was provided to organisations, the majority of which provide culturally sensitive, frontline welfare, information and advocacy services to Irish emigrants. In excess of €12 million is being made available to such organisations this year through the Emigrant Support Programme.  In addition to the funding provided to services abroad, the Emigrant Support Programme also funds a small number of projects in Ireland, one of whom, Crosscare Migrant Project in Dublin, works with intending, existing and returning Irish migrants to assist them in accessing information and services on opportunities and entitlements, before they travel, whilst they are abroad, and on return to Ireland.The priority of the ESP and of the organisations it supports is in assisting the most vulnerable members of Irish communities overseas.  These organisations have made a substantive difference to the lives of Irish people living abroad, including through tackling social isolation, and enabling Irish emigrants to access their local, statutory entitlements.Whilst the provision of education opportunities is not a core function of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, many of the organisations which receive funding through the Emigrant Support Programme assist Irish emigrants in accessing information on both educational and employment opportunities.  FÁS, the national training and employment authority, provides an online jobs vacancy service through its Jobs Ireland Website www.jobs.ie.

This appointment, and the establishment of a unified EU Division at the Department of the Taoiseach, will result in more effective coordination and promote a greater strategic direction of Ireland's engagement with the EU in all Departments and across the Government, including in our preparation for, and management of, Ireland's Presidency in 2013.Planning for Ireland's Presidency of the Council of the European Union in 2013 is coordinated by two interdepartmental groups; the first group leads on policy preparations (and is chaired by the Minister of State for European Affairs), while the second group is coordinating logistics planning.Ireland is a member of a Presidency ‘Trio' that also includes Lithuania (which will succeed Ireland as Presidency in the second half of 2013) and Greece (which will take over the Presidency in January 2014).  Last July I met the Lithuanian Prime Minister to discuss preparations for our Presidencies in 2013.  I have also met with the Lithuanian Foreign Minister on two occasions in recent months.  I also hope to meet my Greek counterpart shortly.The Taoiseach met Herman van Rompuy, President of the European Council, at Government Buildings in June and their discussions included the forthcoming Irish Presidency.  Similarly, during his visit to Ireland this summer the Taoiseach and I met Jerzy Buzek, President of the European Parliament, and the Irish Presidency was a significant topic in those meetingsThe Minister of State for European Affairs has met a number of her counterparts including the Greek European Affairs Minister, the Secretary General of the European Parliament and the Secretary General of the European Commission to discuss Ireland's Presidency and other issues.  Officials have also held meetings with representatives of the EU institutions and with Trio partners.  Contacts at all levels will become more frequent over the coming months as preparations for the Presidency intensify.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The St Andrews Agreement provided that, under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council (NSMC), a review group would be appointed objectively to examine (1) the efficiency and value for money of existing implementation bodies and (2) the case for additional bodies and areas of co-operation within the NSMC, where mutual benefit would be derived.  The group would also input into the work previously commissioned by the NSMC on the identification of a suitable substitute for the proposed Lights Agency of the Foyle, Carlingford and Irish Lights Commission.     At the meeting of the NSMC in plenary format on 10 June 2011 Ministers noted the proposals relating to Terms of Reference 1 and prepared by the St Andrews Agreement Review Group arising from consultation on recommendations in a report prepared by experts/advisers to the Review Group.  They agreed that these would be forwarded, along with a copy of the report, for consideration by Ministers in the new Executive and Irish government with responsibilities for North South Bodies, as well as the Finance Ministers.  It was further decided that, taking account of these considerations, the NSMC joint secretariat at Armagh will make recommendations to finalise this element of the review at the NSMC plenary in November 2011.  Ministers also agreed that terms of reference 2 and 3 of the Review will be discussed at the NSMC plenary in November 2011.

In addition, I met yesterday with the First Minister and deputy First Minister, in the context of an NSMC Institutional meeting, to take careful stock of issues in preparation for the Plenary meeting in November.

Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may issue an emergency passport to a person where (a) a passport that was issued to the person has been lost, stolen or damaged or is temporarily unavailable or the person does not hold a valid passport,  (b) the person provides evidence of his or her intention to undertake travel immediately for which a passport is required, and  (c) by reason of the circumstances of urgency in relation to the application, there is insufficient time in which to issue a passport other than an emergency passport to the person.The Act further provides that these facilities may only be offered where the person is an Irish citizen and upon receipt of a completed passport application form accompanied by information and documents to support the application.  These include proof of identity e.g. a copy of an old passport, drivers license etc; entitlement to an Irish passport — e.g. long form birth certificate, proof of residence e.g. address of permanent or hotel residence and proof of travel for a which a passport is required.The number of emergency passports issued between 2008 and 29 September 2011 is as follows.20082009201020112,6092,7753,5762,059
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I propose to take Questions Nos. 111 to 113, inclusive, together.As Minister of State with responsibility for Ireland's Official Development Assistance, I am very conscious of the need to ensure that development aid reaches its intended beneficiaries and that it makes a real difference in the lives of the poorest people.The overarching objective of the aid programme is to contribute to the eradication of extreme poverty and hunger in the world.  To ensure that our assistance is effectively delivered to those most in need in developing countries, we work in partnership with Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners such as the United Nations and European Union.  Our aid programme is strongly concentrated on some of the poorest countries and communities in sub-Saharan Africa.Of Ireland's total Official Development Assistance, about 70% is delivered bilaterally and 30% through multilateral systems.  The multilateral system, in particular the UN, has a number of key strengths, not least its global mandate and global representation. It is uniquely positioned to provide rapid response to emergencies, such as conflict and natural disasters, and operates in some 150 countries.  Channelling assistance through a multilateral organisation such as the UN can also help to avoid duplication of effort by donors and to avoid overwhelming already stretched national systems.On the other hand, where we have a bilateral programme such as in our nine Programme Countries, we have a stronger long term, strategic relationship with the host country and are in a position to engage directly with the Government and local communities. This allows us to have a much greater impact in a more focused area, such as agriculture, health or education.All proposals for funding, whether through multilateral or bilateral channels, are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff using clear criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources. An independent external Programme Appraisal and Evaluation Group is tasked to evaluate all major funding proposals for the bilateral aid programme.Programmes in receipt of funding are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being accomplished.  Irish Aid programmes are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Unit's work is regularly reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.The quality of our aid programme has been recognised in many independent reports.  The OECD has found that "improvements in the quality and accountability of public financial management together with rigorous oversight ensure that Irish funds are correctly used".  In the most recent international report on development assistance, the 2010 Evaluation of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, published just last week, Ireland ranks highest among EU Member States for the delivery of our commitments on aid quality.I believe that this focus on appraisal, regular monitoring, independent evaluations and audit provides assurance that all Irish Aid funds are very closely monitored and used for the purposes intended.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The humanitarian situation across the Horn of Africa is worsening, with over 13 million people now affected by drought and food shortages in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Djibouti.  The situation is at its worst in Somalia, where the United Nations has warned that 750,000 are at imminent risk of starvation and where ongoing conflict and access issues have greatly exacerbated the challenge of reaching those most in need.The Government has been following and responding to the increasingly dire situation across the region for many months and has already provided over €10 million in emergency assistance. On a per capita basis, Ireland's contribution is one of the most significant responses to the crisis.  Our funding has been used directly by the UN, the Red Cross and NGOs such as Concern and Trócaire, to provide vital food supplies, shelter, healthcare and clean water to many thousands of people.  In addition, at a United Nations Ministerial Summit on the Horn of Africa in New York last week, the Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore T.D., pledged a further €10 million in humanitarian assistance in 2011 and 2012.Many other donors, including the European Commission and a number of EU and other countries have also contributed significantly to the response, with pledges to date reaching $1.8 billion to the end of 2011.  Nevertheless, the UN has warned that the relief operation requires a further $700 million this year if all of the needs in the region are to be met.  There is therefore an onus on national governments, including those which are not traditional aid donors, as well as the private sector, to step up their assistance.Beyond the provision of immediate relief, it is clear that the dire situation across much of the region will require sustained political engagement by the international community over the months and years to come.  The effects of the famine have been exacerbated by the absence of effective governance in the country since 1991.  The UN-backed Transitional Federal Government (TFG) faces enormous challenges, not least the fact that it controls little of the country's territory and that significant armed groups remain opposed to its authority.  This has considerably hampered the ability of aid agencies to access many of those most in need.  Ireland and our EU partners strongly support the UN-facilitated Djibouti peace and reconciliation process, and welcomed the recent adoption of a Roadmap for Ending the Transition in Somalia.  We hope to see rapid progress toward achieving a representative and effective Government.The issue of coordination amongst international actors is critical and was a recurring theme at the recent mini-summit in New York.  Ireland has already been instrumental in pushing for a more intensive and coordinated response to this crisis and I used the recent meeting of EU Development Ministers in Sopot in Poland to call on the EU to respond quickly and generously.  The Government also supports measures which would strengthen the capacity of the EU and the UN to engage at a political level in Somalia and the wider region and remains actively engaged on these issues at official level in Brussels, Geneva and New York.  I can assure the Deputy that we will continue to call on the international community to increase its efforts in the period ahead.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	439	Studies by the United Nations have shown that the last ten years have represented one of the worst decades ever in terms of attacks on humanitarian workers.  The situation varies considerably from country to country however and within the Horn of Africa, aid workers can generally go about their business in a protected and unhindered manner across much of the region.The clear exception to this situation is to be found in Somalia, where after two decades of conflict, the country is now one of the most difficult and dangerous environments for aid workers anywhere in the world.  The security situation is such that access to many areas has been significantly affected, a scenario compounded by the decision by the 2009 decision by the Al Shabaab militant group to ban the UN World Food Programme (WFP) and several other Western aid agencies from regions of the country under its control.  While access within Mogadishu has now improved following Al Shabaab's decision to withdraw from the city, the highly insecure and volatile security situation in many other parts of southern Somalia continue to hamper relief efforts. Humanitarian agencies operating in these regions generally do so through local partners or counterparts given the level of risk to expatriate staff.The safety and well-being of humanitarian personnel is a priority for the Government.  Ireland is a strong advocate at international level for the full respect for the core humanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, and impartiality — principles which ultimately underpin acceptance by host communities and provide the basis for warring parties to accept humanitarian action in situations of armed conflict.  Domestically, the Government is taking steps to ensure the safety and security of personnel deployed to humanitarian crises, with the launch of a joint exercise in this area between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, through Irish Aid, and the Humanitarian Aid Working Group of Dochas — the umbrella group for Irish development and humanitarian NGOs.  The exercise will identify a common set of security management principles and training standards for application across the sector.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I propose to take Questions Nos. 117 and 122 together.The Government's decision to assign additional responsibilities in the trade promotion area to my Department has enhanced further the already close working relationship with Enterprise Ireland both at headquarters level and in the field throughout the Embassy network.  Enterprise Ireland clients are successfully exporting to major markets throughout Europe, Asia, the Americas and Australia. I have set out below a table which provides a breakdown of Enterprise Ireland client performance in those markets in 2010.The Deputy will be aware that the figures released for services trade recently show that Ireland's services exports in the first half of 2011 are up 8.4% from the same period last year. Merchandise trade is also performing strongly, up 6% in the first half of this year. Enterprise Ireland client companies increased exports by 10% between 2009 and 2010 from €12,643m to €13,930m.The fact that Irish companies are continuing to grow their exports in a challenging global economic environment is testament to the work that has been done by these companies, with the support of my Department and our Embassy network, other Government Departments and the State Agencies in developing new markets and opportunities for Irish products.While Ireland's Embassy network is modest, we do have an Embassy in each of the countries identified as priority markets under the Trading and Investing in a Smart Economy Strategy.  These Embassies give the highest priority to supporting State Agencies and their client companies to pursue market opportunities in their regions.  The local market teams chaired by the Ambassador in each of these markets report to the Export Trade Council which I chair and which held its inaugural meeting last week following the commitment to establish it in the Programme for Government.My Department and all the State agencies with responsibilities in the areas of economic growth, trade and investment have committed to keeping their resource allocations overseas under review to ensure the State achieves maximum benefit from its footprint abroad.  There are a number of additional markets, particularly those where there is an emerging demand for the high quality products which Ireland exports, where there would be benefits to be gained by opening an Embassy in the period ahead.  However, these benefits must be weighed against the very significant constraints on public expenditure that we are facing and will continue to face for some time to come.EI clients are successfully exporting throughout the world and are exporting to all major markets throughout Europe, Asia, the Americas and Australia.

As the Taoiseach has recently said, the Government does not believe further Treaty change is necessary in order to deal with current difficulties in the euro area.We are, however, pursuing the process of having the guarantees given to Ireland at the time of the Lisbon Treaty referendum enshrined in a protocol to the Treaties, in line with the commitment given to Ireland by the Member States in 2009.  The aim is to have this process completed at the time of the Croatian Accession Treaty.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The human rights situation in Iran is profoundly disturbing, and the period since the presidential election of 2009 has been characterised by an intensification of human rights abuses on many fronts. I am greatly concerned about the targeting of the academic community and educators in Iran, amid a widespread and intentional erosion of political and civil freedoms in Iran. Within this context, I am also concerned about the ongoing trials of the Bahá'ís associated with the Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education in Iran.   The ongoing persecution of academics in Iran is in breach of the international obligations that Iran has itself signed up to. The frequent accompanying lack of judicial transparency means that those detained are often unaware of why they are being detained. This has an insidious effect on the wider academic community, adding to the atmosphere of intimidation and harassment within which Iranian academics — and indeed students — increasingly operate.I call upon the government of Iran to respect its obligations to the academic community under international human rights instruments and fully support the statements of EU High Representatives Catherine Ashton on human rights violations in Iran, most recently on 15 September. The EU has repeatedly raised human rights issues in Iran with the Iranian authorities this year. In a further effort to increase the EU's impact on human rights in Iran, the Foreign Affairs Council in April adopted a travel ban and asset freeze against a number of serious human rights offenders in Iran. This sends an important political signal to those in the judicial system and elsewhere in the Iranian regime who perpetrate human rights abuses. The EU has also introduced measures to enable it to respond in a more timely fashion to serious violations of human rights in Iran while also trying to keep some basic channels of communications open with the Iranian authorities. I welcome these steps which demonstrate the depth of our concern. Ireland will continue to be active at EU level in pressing for stronger EU action in relation to the human rights situation in Iran.At UN level, Ireland was active in ensuring the successful adoption at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva in March of a decision providing for appointment of a Special Rapporteur to examine Iran's human rights situation. I welcome the appointment of Ahmed Shaheed as Special Rapporteur on 1 August and call upon the Government of Iran to extend the utmost cooperation, including facilitating immediate and unhindered access to Iran, to Mr Shaheed. I am disappointed that the Iranian government has still not yet — after two months — replied to Mr Shaheed's request to be permitted to visit Iran.At a bilateral level, my Department engages in ongoing dialogue with the Iranian Ambassador and his Embassy on these issues. My officials have already held a number of meetings with the Ambassador since the start of this year to convey our grave concerns at the human rights situation in Iran. Ireland will continue to raise human rights in Iran, including the rights of academics and other detainees, bilaterally and at the EU and UN, at all appropriate occasions.

Together with our EU partners, Ireland closely monitors the human rights situations in many countries throughout the world, on the basis of information obtained from a variety of sources including official channels, reports of the United Nations human rights Treaty Monitoring Bodies, reports of Independent Experts and Special Rapporteurs appointed by the United Nations and international and Irish non-governmental and civil society organisations.Ireland supports the use of the full UN human rights machinery in responding to human rights abuses, including supporting the role of UN Treaty Monitoring Bodies, Special Procedures and Mandate Holders and the convening, where appropriate, of Special Sessions of the UN Human Rights Council. At these UN bodies, the EU regularly makes statements on the human rights situations in a number of countries. Ireland is fully associated with these statements. The EU also introduces or supports resolutions dealing with specific countries, as circumstances require.Ireland has engaged proactively with the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic Review mechanism since its creation in March 2006. Ireland will be examined on Thursday, 6 October 2011 under this mechanism.The EU has adopted Common Positions on certain countries, which attach priority to promoting human rights, democracy, good governance and the rule of law. In addition, the EU conducts human rights dialogues with a number of countries and also raises human rights concerns as part of political dialogue meetings.Together with our EU partners, Ireland has been a consistent and strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, recognising it as an essential means of combating impunity for the most serious violations of international humanitarian law and human rights law. The Court's Prosecutor has opened investigations into a number of country situations and we will continue to monitor this work closely.While the Arab Spring has given much hope to the Middle East region, Ireland is concerned about the abuse of prisoners during this volatile period, particularly in Syria where there are reports of thousands of arbitrary detentions and the widespread torture and abuse of those detainees. The UN Human Rights Council has formed an international Commission of Inquiry to examine and report on the human rights situation in Syria, including the rights of prisoners, and I await its findings with great interest. In Libya, Ireland and the international community welcome the efforts of the National Transitional Council to establish the rule of law, and urge the interim authorities to ensure that the rights of prisoners are respected.Ireland is also concerned about the situation faced by detainees, and civilians facing charges in military courts, in Bahrain. Ireland is very concerned at the severity of the sentences handed down to medical professionals last week and urges that none of these individuals will be re-arrested, pending the outcome of their appeals. Ireland calls for the application of due process, respect for international human rights and the release of all political detainees in Bahrain.The Government will continue to avail of all the above-mentioned mechanisms and instruments as a means of highlighting violations of human rights and furthering their protection.

This is particularly the case in countries where Government-to-Government contacts are a prerequisite for doing business.  My Department and our Embassy network work closely with the agencies and other Government Departments regarding the organisation of such missions, whether led by the Taoiseach or other members of the Government.  The Export Trade Council, which I have established in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government and which held its inaugural meeting last week, will also provide a useful forum for discussion of issues relating to trade missions.I understand that the Taoiseach is planning to lead a trade mission to China in the period ahead once agreement is reached with the Chinese side on suitable dates. Contacts with the Chinese authorities are continuing through our Embassy in Beijing.  My Department will be engaged in the co-ordination of this visit with the Department of the Taoiseach, other Government Departments and the State Agencies once the dates are confirmed.

The possible introduction of a scheme to protect householders who cannot obtain flood insurance from regular insurance companies was examined in 2010.  However, the Government concluded at that time that such an approach was not financially viable.  In particular there were concerns that, over time, such a scheme could incentivise the insurance industry to discontinue the provision of flood cover in medium and high risk areas, thereby  making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive.  I am advised by the Minister of State, with responsibility for the Office of Public Works (OPW), that the OPW has engaged with the Irish Insurance Federation, detailing areas of the country which have benefited from flood protection measures put in place over several decades.  In addition, the recently published OPW Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment, as part of the Catchment Flood Risk Assessment Management Programme, has been forwarded to the Irish Insurance Federation for its information.  This interchange of data contributes to providing opportunities for the insurance industry to make informed decisions in relation to flood risk cover.

However, I am informed that the position is that Mr. Brian Hayes TD, Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently published the Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) of the Construction Contracts Bill.  The Regulatory Impact Analysis examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention.  It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation.  The Report is available in the Department of Public Expenditure & Reform website: www.per.gov.ie/reports.  I understand that a note on this issue was circulated to all Oireachtas members last week.  The RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and at a subsequent consultation with key stakeholders.  One of the issues examined was the impact of the €200,000 and €50,000 thresholds.In the context of considering the various issues raised in the consultation process and incorporating them into legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly for approval, Minister Hayes will carefully consider the issue of thresholds in light of what was said by key stakeholders at the consultation meeting and in particular with the number of contracts that would be excluded if the thresholds were not amended or removed.

Clearly there are NAMA debtors who own properties which are leased to state agencies and who derive income from them.  The properties are leased to the State by these debtors on an arms-length basis.  NAMA's primary concern is whether a property is generating cash flow that allows debt to be repaid by a debtor.  NAMA informs me that once the due diligence process is fully complete and its management information systems fully developed, it will be possible to extract data on tenancies attached to property under the control of its debtors but such information is not currently available.

An historical breakdown is available by tax rate of the tax relief claimed on contributions to personal pension plans — Retirement Annuity Contracts (RACs) and Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs) — by the self-employed and others, to the extent that the contributions have been included in the personal tax returns of those taxpayers.  There is, therefore, no statistical basis for providing definitive figures.  However, by making certain assumptions about the available information, the Revenue Commissioners inform me that the estimated overall full year yield to the Exchequer from confining tax relief to the standard rate of 20% in respect of individual contributions to occupational pension schemes, RACs and PRSAs would be about €500 million.Because of the limitations on available data however, as outlined above, it is not possible to disaggregate this estimated yield as between the public and private sector.

It currently has about 80 offices worldwide, including about a dozen in Europe, with offices in almost all countries where it provides financial support, together with offices serving regions or groups of countries.  The European Commission has adopted a similar approach, which began with the EU adjustment programmes for Hungary, Latvia and Romania.  Again, this is now a standard feature of support programmes where Community resources are involved.The resident representatives provide a liaison between the IMF and the EU Commission respectively and the country authorities, build relationships with non-officials, and help the EU and the IMF deepen their understanding of conditions on the ground.  They support the authorities by explaining the views of the IMF and the EU and by keeping the EU and IMF abreast of economic and social developments in the country.

The merger of AIB and EBS which concluded last week will enable costs saving through shared services and economies of scale.  By deleveraging non-core assets, the banks will be better placed to focus on supporting the domestic economy.The effects of these changes will bring about cost reductions which will improve operating margins and permit the banks to better absorb funding costs. The Government remains in consultation with the banks in connection with the more significant parts of these plans including a significant reduction of employee numbers.

Essentially the banks will be smaller operations than previously with the focus being on the creation of the two universal full-service pillar banks with a more domestic remit and a restructured Irish Life & Permanent.It is not possible, at this stage, to be precise on the expected number of jobs losses that will arise at the covered institutions consequent on the restructuring of the banking sector.  For example, the timing of the disposals of business operations which fall to be deleveraged as part of the respective institution's commitment to restructure are pivotal factors.  To date, AIB have indicated that some 2,000 plus jobs will have to go.  IBRC has recently announced plans to lose 130 jobs by voluntary redundancy.  Naturally, further job losses will arise at that institution.I am most anxious that, in this most sensitive of matters, all parties would be treated with the utmost consideration and respect.

This information is provided on an aggregate basis for the covered banks due to the commercial sensitivities of the data.  The information provided is the most up to date available from each of the covered institutions, with all data less than one month old.  The table below includes data for home loans and residential investment properties.The breakdown of properties is as follows:NumberRepossessed272Voluntarily surrendered323Secured by another means (abandoned/receiver appointed/other)212Total807AIB has informed me that all repossessed properties are managed by the property section in the Arrears Support Unit (ASU) pending sale and that the ASU uses external management companies for the security, upkeep and maintenance of these properties.BOI has informed me that once a property has been repossessed (either by Possession Order through the courts, voluntary surrender or abandonment by the customer), it:Obtains two independent valuations.Obtains buildings insurance cover.Carries out any essential works/repairs required to sell the property.Appoints an estate agent to sell the property on the Bank's behalf for the maximum realisable value.Manages the marketing strategy and maintain the property until the sale is completed.EBS has informed me that repossessed properties and voluntarily surrendered properties are secured, insured and then independently valued before being placed for sale on the open market.  For those properties that are secured by another means, which EBS refer to as abandoned property, these are firstly secured and insured, upon EBS being satisfied that the property has, in fact, been abandoned.  EBS will then progress via the courts to formally take ownership of the properties.  For those properties that are secured by means of the appointment of a Receiver, these properties are also secured and insured by the Receiver.  Where the properties are let, the Receiver takes over the management of the letting and arranges for the collection of rents etc.  These properties are ultimately independently valued and then sold.Anglo Irish Bank, on behalf of INBS, has informed me that properties in possession are currently managed within the Arrears Support Unit, the process of receiving a property into possession involves ensuring that the property is secure and having a property inspection report carried out which will identify any issues with the property that require attention/remedial work.  When a property is received into possession by the bank it is placed on the market for sale.  The bank is currently involved in a tender process the aim of which is to identify a single source supplier for this service which will further enhance the process in terms of sales and asset management.Irish Life & Permanent has informed me that it has a team of people managing the portfolio of Properties in Possession whose primary focus is to ensure that when a property is taken in to possession it is;securedprepared for sale (which entails ensuring clear marketable title)brought to market for sale as quickly as possible via an approved panel of Auctioneers

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	467	As Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions provided under the Credit Union Act 1997, with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability of credit unions generally.Within his independent regulatory discretion, the Registrar of Credit Unions acts to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  It is on this basis that the Registrar has put in place lending restrictions on a number of credit unions as their financial position has deteriorated.  Restrictions are imposed on a case-by-case basis and are reviewed regularly.  Before setting the level of restriction in each credit union the Registrar carries out an analysis of the credit union business and financial position and the restrictions are designed to allow these credit unions to continue to lend, albeit at a more prudent level, in order to protect the savings of their members.The Registrar advises me that the restrictions are structured to allow credit unions to lend a higher number of small value loans to the broader membership, thereby reducing concentration risk.  He also advises that initial analysis indicates that the credit unions which are restricted continue to have higher levels of arrears than those which are not and this remains a concern.  The Registrar closely monitors and interacts with those credit unions where lending restrictions have been imposed.The restriction on a credit union is determined taking account of its financial data including the level of its lending, average loan size, its arrears trends and bad debt provision levels.  Credit unions are able to continue to lend to members within their financial capacity to do so.  If a credit union can demonstrate an improved financial position then such restrictions can be reviewed.The imposition of these restrictions is not considered lightly and the type of lending restrictions imposed takes account of the particular business profile and financial position of each credit union concerned.  The type of lending restrictions can include maximum individual loan size and overall maximum monthly lending limits.  Where lending limits are specified for individual credit unions, this is communicated directly with the credit union.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The statutory instrument to which the Deputy refers sets out the rules made by the Registrar of Credit Unions at the Central Bank of Ireland which impose requirements on credit unions to keep a minimum amount of liquid assets to enable them to meet their liabilities as they arise.  Among other things, this is to ensure that credit union members can continue to access their savings on demand.Under section 85 of the Credit Union Act 1997, the Oireachtas expressly delegated to the Central Bank the power to impose such requirements.  The Central Bank, in exercise of the powers set out in Section 85(3) of the Credit Union Act 1997, set out rules in S.I. No. 515 of 2010 requiring that a credit union must maintain at all times a Liquidity Ratio of at least 20%.  Most credit unions hold liquidity significantly in excess of this regulatory minimum level.In terms of Central Bank accountability, section 32L(3) of the Central Bank Act 1942 (as amended by the Central Bank Reform Act 2010) provides that the Central Bank is accountable to the Oireachtas, through its annual regulatory performance statement, for the activities of the Registrar of Credit Unions.The Central Bank and Credit Institutions (Resolution).(No. 2) Bill is currently before Dáil Éireann and has been the subject of extensive debate.  The Central Bank powers in the Bill are necessary and proportionate given the seriousness of the problem that the Bill seeks to address.  Section 107 of the Bill, as amended, provides for a relationship framework to support the legal framework of the Bill by ensuring there is a clear identification of roles and responsibilities and providing guidance as to how and in what circumstances the Minister will use the powers provided to him/her in the Bill.  In formulating the relationship framework the Minister will draw on international best practice that may have relevance to the specific circumstances of this situation.  The Minister plays a central role in relation to the powers conferred upon the Central Bank by this Bill — for example, one of the intervention conditions is that the Central Bank must have consulted with the Minister.  This provision will facilitate the development of a relationship framework or protocol by which the powers and functions of the Central Bank and of the Minister can work in harmony in the public interest.In the Programme for Government 2011-2016, the Government stated that it recognises the important role of credit unions as a volunteer co-operative movement and the distinction between them and other types of financial institutions.  In line with the Government commitment, we established a Commission on Credit Unions to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.  The Commission has provided me with an interim report which I am currently examining.  It will have completed its work by end-March 2011.The Commission has a broad representation across the credit union sector, academic and management fields and wider interests.  Its members have extensive knowledge and expertise and I am confident that the review of credit union legislation which the Commission is carrying out will reflect a wide range of views.

Following the transfer of a debtor's loans to NAMA, the debtor is requested to complete a realistic and concise business plan. The viability of the business plan of each major borrower is then assessed by NAMA.  Where viability cannot be demonstrated or where a borrower is not co-operating with the process, NAMA takes enforcement action against the borrower concerned. By end-August 2011, NAMA had approved the appointment of receivers in 84 cases.  Furthermore, to date, NAMA has secured the reversal of a significant number of asset transfers as part of its business plan agreements with debtors. I understand from NAMA that only a minority of debtors engaged in asset transfers to spouses, relatives or other parties but, in cases where it did occur, the reversal of such transfers is a key requirement imposed by NAMA before it can agree to a debtor's business plan.The Chairman of NAMA has stated that, as the agency is charged with maximising the commercial return to the taxpayer, i.e., generating the maximum repayments on its acquired loans,  it is regularly faced with difficult choices to make between working with a developer on his loans or foreclosing through the appointment of a receiver. The option selected by NAMA is whichever is likely to generate the higher return for the taxpayer. It is not a question of conferring any advantage on the borrower relative to borrowers whose loans remain with the banks. NAMA assures me that developers who are NAMA debtors do not enjoy any advantage over developers whose loans are with non-participating institutions.

It is important that each lending institution is allowed to assess properly and independently the risks that it is considering when deciding whether or not to approve a mortgage. Mortgage lending must fully comply with the regulatory requirements both in relation to the financial institution itself and also the safeguarding of the borrower's interests. When providing a product or service to a customer, a financial institution must comply with the ‘Knowing the Customer’ and ‘Suitability Provisions’ of the Consumer Protection Code issued by the Central Bank. This process involves, inter alia, gathering relevant information from the customer about his/her financial situation, individual circumstances and needs.Based on this information, the financial institution is required to complete a ‘ Suitability Process’, where only products suitable to that particular customer are offered. While affordability is a prime component of suitability, a fuller consideration of a customer’s individual circumstances and needs would be required in order to comply with the suitability provisions of the Code.In this regard, when assessing suitability — in relation to mortgage products — the Central Bank is of the opinion that factors such as employment, income and repayment capacity, purpose of borrowing, type and length of loan, plans for early redemption, attitude to fixed/variable interest, age, savings track record should be considered.  As suitability is specific to the circumstances and needs of each individual customer, financial institutions should be satisfied that written statements reflect an assessment of each customer's specific circumstances and needs, thereby meeting the ‘ Knowing the Customer’ requirements of the Consumer Protection Code.The Consumer Protection Code may be accessed at www.centralbank.ie.

With regard to the international property, Mr. Sean Quinn is in litigation with the Bank across a number of geographies and the outcome of this litigation is uncertain. We have been informed by the bank that his actions appear to be designed to put the property beyond the reach of the Bank and thus taxpayers.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	476	I propose to take Questions Nos. 157 and 158 together.The intention of the Jobs Initiative 2011 is to focus our now more limited resources on measures that offer the greatest potential for expansion and employment creation in the domestic economy. The aim is to target key sectors of the economy that can assist in getting people back to work, providing opportunities for those who have lost their jobs to re-skill and building confidence in order to encourage consumer activity. The Jobs Initiative 2011   should be viewed as one element of a wider strategy to support economic activity.Given our commitments under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, and our current public finance difficulties, the Jobs Initiative 2011   is budgetary neutral over the period to 2014 and is being funded through the introduction of a temporary levy on pension funds.The measures introduced as part of the Jobs Initiative 2011   were expected to result in a net gain for the Exchequer of approximately €200 million in 2011. This is because the forecast €470 million yield from the temporary levy on pension funds more than offset the estimated cost of the other measures introduced. These included the new temporary second reduced rate of VAT of 9%, aimed primarily at the tourism sector, the halving of the lower rate of employers PRSI, the suspension of the Air Travel Tax and the small additional amounts of current and capital expenditure.In 2012, a net loss to the Exchequer of just over €200 million was projected. This is because in 2012, the full year cost of the measures introduced, including the new temporary second reduced rate of VAT of 9%, the halving of the lower rate of employers PRSI and the suspension of the Air Travel Tax were estimated to be greater than the forecast yield from the temporary levy on pension funds.The implementation and monitoring of expenditure measures is a matter for relevant Ministers and Departments. My Department, in conjunction with the Revenue Commissioners, will monitor the revenue measures.It should be noted that the proposed suspension of the Air Travel Tax, at an estimated cost of €15 million in 2011 and €90 million in 2012, was conditional on the airlines increasing passenger numbers in terms of restoring routes and capacity. Following discussions with the airlines in that regard, the Government decided to retain the Air Travel Tax in 2011, pending a further review next spring.The Jobs Initiative
2011 is designed to support a return to economic growth and strengthen its foundations. It is of course extremely difficult to separate out the increase in economic activity that is attributable to specific initiatives, particularly as the QNHS employment data only shows gross sectoral flows. Nonetheless, the Jobs Initiative 2011   is an important part of the Government’s overall strategy to establish the correct conditions to allow our economy to recover, while at the same time respecting the requirement to return our public finances to a sustainable position.

The negotiations on these proposals will decide on the maximum level of EU budget expenditure, the policy areas for expenditure and how this expenditure will be funded for the relevant seven year period.The negotiation of the next MFF will be one of the key engagements for the Government at EU level over the next few years. I met EU Budget Commissioner Janusz Lewandowski in advance of the publication of the Commission's proposals to outline Ireland's overall approach to the negotiations, which will be a constructive engagement based on ensuring the best outcome for the EU as a whole and for Ireland.Detailed discussions on the MFF are proceeding at official level and the Irish officials are playing an active role. At political level, the General Affairs Council has lead responsibility for the negotiation and will ensure overall coordination between the different sectoral Councils. The MFF was the sole topic of the Informal General Affairs Council in Poland in July. Ireland was represented by Minister of State Brian Hayes and the Irish position was outlined at the meeting. The ECOFIN Council will also be involved.The key elements of Ireland's approach to the negotiations will be:Ensuring that the overall size of the EU Budget as a percent of EU GNI reflects the agreed policy priorities of the Union, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, inclusive and sustainable growth, while keeping in mind the budgetary consolidation imperative faced by all Member States including Ireland;The need to maintain a strong and effective CAP with a commensurate budget which will support a vigorous consumer-focused agricultural production base in Europe. This is one of the areas where the Union continues to add real value and shows real and positive impacts both for consumers and producers.  There remains a pressing need for continued food security and safety which warrants only gradual changes to the Common Agriculture Policy;Regarding the funding of the Budget, Ireland's view has been that the Gross National Income (GNI) key provides the fairest and most effective base for calculating Member State contributions. We would need to be convinced that the Commission's proposals in this regard are an improvement before considering any change in our position.

These meetings were also attended by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., and senior officials from both Departments.The fourth quarterly review will take place from the 11th to the 21st October 2011. The majority of meetings will take place in my Department with a number of meetings also taking place in the Central Bank. Arrangements for these meetings are currently being put together by officials from my Department in consultation with the Department of Pubic Expenditure and Reform, the Troika, the Central Bank, the NTMA and the appropriate Government Departments. As has been the case with the previous quarterly reviews, the Troika may meet with officials from a number of financial institutions and other interested parties during the fourth quarterly review. These arrangements have yet to be finalised.It is my intention to meet again with the Troika delegation during the fourth quarterly review. The review will comprise of a series of meetings to evaluate all the elements of the programme including fiscal developments including the Comprehensive Spending Review, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments in the restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform. The meetings will range from technical to policy discussions and will be conducted, under my direction and that of the Minister of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Governor of the Central Bank as appropriate, by senior officials from my Department, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the National Treasury Management Agency and the Office of the Attorney General.    Other Departments and Ministers may also be involved where appropriate.Clearly, for the forthcoming review, the primary focus will be on our performance against the targets due by the end of the third quarter of 2011 and assessing progress on targets due in coming quarters. I have already signalled that notwithstanding the substantial consolidation already carried out, in particular the amount being delivered this year, difficult decisions in relation to future consolidation remain. There is no doubt that Budget 2012 will be another difficult Budget. Under the terms of the EU-IMF Programme Memorandum of Understanding, an adjustment of at least €3.6 billion is to be implemented next year. But as I have already signalled, consolidation above that amount may be required if we are to adhere to the General Government deficit target set for 2012. That will become clearer in the coming weeks in light of the continuing assessment of the most up-to-date information available.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	481	As I have previously stated, it is my intention to examine the approach to remuneration in the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) in more detail in the coming months following consultation with my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I have also sought the views of the NTMA and of the NTMA Advisory Committee in this regard.   In the meantime, I would point out that the overall remuneration of NTMA senior management has been reduced very substantially this year due to their waiving of the performance-related element of their remuneration in respect of 2010.The public sector pension deduction provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 applies to all NTMA staff. While the NTMA was not subject to the general reductions in salaries provided for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009, it secured a reduction of some 8% in overall payroll costs in 2010 on a like-for-like basis compared with the previous year through a reduction in the performance-related element of overall remuneration. In 2011, it secured a further reduction of almost 3% in overall payroll costs, again on a like-for-like basis.Staff recruited by the NTMA and assigned to the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) in 2010 and 2011 have been recruited on specified-purpose contracts — their term of employment lasts for as long as NAMA requires their particular function.Finally, taking all these issues into account, I will see what changes, if any, might be appropriate in relation to the remuneration of all staff in the NTMA, having regard to the changing economic circumstances of the State and the need for transparency in public expenditure.

In this regard, I will point out that the Taoiseach is in regular contact with his European counterparts on a wide range of issues.Having said this, I would point out that my fellow European Finance Ministers and I regularly discuss at Eurogroup and Ecofin meetings the economic situation in the EU, eurozone and in individual Member States.  This includes matters of common interest and any items which have the potential to negatively impact or delay economic recovery.  In these meetings I continue to make the Irish position known.I will remain in regular contact with EU colleagues to continue our ongoing work in pursuing the EU's, eurozone's and individual Member States economic recoveries.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	483	The Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform jointly published a discussion document entitled Reforming Ireland’s Budgetary Framework earlier this year.    At the end of May, the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform jointly hosted a seminar on the issue of reforming Ireland’s budgetary framework. The seminar was intended to allow for discussion and debate among all interested parties and experts with a view to arriving at the optimum set of proposals for fiscal reform. The seminar was well attended and the views expressed are currently being considered in the further development of these policy proposals. In addition, the Department of Finance has also received a number of written submissions from interested parties.The Discussion Document contained draft heads of a Fiscal Responsibility Bill. As well as the legal provisions of the changes to expenditure management structures and the legislation underpinning the fiscal rules, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill will also provide the statutory basis for the recently established Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.Under the terms of the EU/IMF Programme, the Fiscal Responsibility Bill must be published by the end of the year. Once published the opposition parties will be able to discuss and offer comment on the Bill during its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.The Fiscal Responsibility Bill and Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are being introduced as part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland's budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 185 together.I presume the Deputies are referring to the third review of the EU / IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland which took place from 6th to 14th July 2011.I met with the EU-IMF delegation during the third quarterly review on 8th and 14th July 2011. These meetings were also attended by my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Brendan Howlin T.D., and senior officials from both Departments.  The primary focus of this review was on our performance against the targets due by end June 2011 and assessing progress on targets due in subsequent quarters. The mission itself comprised of a series of meetings to evaluate all the elements of the programme including the fiscal developments, the macroeconomic outlook, progress on commitments in the restructuring of the financial sector and structural reform.The conclusion of the third review was that Ireland is meeting all of the conditions and targets of our programme, that the programme is on track and that Ireland is making progress. We have met the fiscal, banking and structural reform targets on time. Indeed, implementation of some of the financial sector reforms occurred ahead of schedule, including:the legal merger of Allied Irish Bank and EBS Building Society which was completed on 1st July 2011, well ahead of the end September 2011 deadline.the merger of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society to form the Irish Bank Resolution Company (IBRC) which was completed on 1st July 2011, well ahead of its scheduled  end December 2011 deadline.The third review was completed successfully on the 2nd of September when the IMF Executive Board and the ECOFIN Council approved the completion of the third quarterly review. This enables the next disbursement of the agreed funding by the IMF and the EU's funding mechanisms.The strong start we have made to delivering on Ireland's programme commitments has been maintained and it remains the Government's key priority. This performance and the Government's continuing commitment to keep the programme on track is the best way to ensure that we emerge successfully from this programme. That will mean that we can return safely to the financial markets for funding in as timely a manner as possible.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I am advised by Revenue that the company concerned has a significant tax debt. Revenue has worked with the company over the last 18 months to alleviate cash flow pressures that gave rise to tax payment delays. The company concerned has failed to put the payment of tax debts as they arise on a timely footing, despite being put on notice by Revenue of the importance of doing so.    I am advised by Revenue that it is not in a position to enter into any further arrangement with the company as regards payment of its tax debts and that the company needs to make appropriate alternative arrangements to address any cash flow issues impacting on the timeliness of its compliance with Revenue requirements.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	487	As I mentioned in my appearance before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform on 1 September last, I am aware that contagion of the property collapse spread beyond the property and construction industries and into small businesses that took the decision to invest their profits in property.  Notwithstanding the fact that some SMEs may have engaged in property speculation and subsequently suffered from the collapse in property prices, the restructuring of the domestic banking sector creates capacity for the pillar banks to lend in excess of €30 billion over the next three years in SME and other important sectors. This is in excess of Central Bank estimates of the likely demand for SME and mortgage credit over this period. Both pillar banks are concentrating on the Irish economy and need to issue credit to make profits and rebuild their balance sheets.As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks will be required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion this year, €3.5 billion next year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.Both pillar banks have provided me with their plans to ensure that the 2011 target is achieved. This is particularly relevant given the comments contained in the fifth quarterly report of the Credit Review Office, which stated that "it will be a challenge for each of the banks to reach their €3bn sanction target for new and restructured facilities in the current year."The Deputy will also be aware that the Credit Review Office (CRO) assists SME and farm borrowers who have had an application for credit to the pillar banks declined or reduced, and who feel that they have a viable business proposition. The CRO also look at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan, or a new loan offer, are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment. In increasing the ceiling on eligible loan applications from €250k to €500k recently I have significantly expanded the number of companies that can turn to the CRO to appeal the decision of their lending institution.It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.

Accordingly, the Deputy will be contacted directly on this issue at an early date.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	489	I am informed by AIB that gross new external hires in 2010 were 471 and in 2011 to date are 769. These figures are in respect of the bank overall across all geographies. On a net basis (including terminations and departures) the number of employees at the bank declined by 492 in 2010 and has fallen by 205 in 2011 year to date.  Additionally, AIB and officials from my Department have been discussing the introduction of a redundancy package for AIB employees. As those discussions have not yet been finalised, the figures shown above do not include any departures as a result of AIB's intended redundancy program.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	490	All State Savings money is placed directly with the Irish Government and repayment of all State Savings money, which includes principal, interest and bonus payments if due (or, in respect of Prize Bonds, cash prizes), is a direct, unconditional obligation of the Government of Ireland.  Ireland State Savings is the brand name used by the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) to describe the range of savings products offered by the NTMA to personal savers.The suite of Ireland State Savings products includes Savings Certificates, Savings Bonds, Prize Bonds, the National Solidarity Bond, Instalment Savings and Deposit Accounts such as the Ordinary Deposit Account and the Deposit Account Plus.An Post and the Prize Bond Company are agents of the NTMA for the operation of the Ireland State Savings schemes. However, neither An Post nor the Prize Bond Company retain or manage any Ireland State Savings money. All money invested in Ireland State Savings products is a part of the national debt which is under the management of the National Treasury Management Agency.Ireland has never contemplated the possibility of defaulting on its sovereign debt and this position has been restated on several occasions. The Government, without any question, will fully honour all its legal obligations to its creditors and has no intention whatsoever of allowing a default.In relation to our membership of the euro, I am happy to confirm that that is irreversible.The State Savings products have been an important and dependable component of Government borrowing for many years and make a valuable contribution to the national finances.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	491	The Programme for Government states that as part of the Government's fiscal strategy we will maintain the current rates of income tax together with bands and credits. However, the position is that all taxation measures will be considered in the context of the forthcoming Budget and Finance Bill.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2012 incomes, of the restricting or abolishing the main personal and employee tax credits as suggested in the question for income earners earning in excess of €100,000 would be of the order of €135 million.This figure is an estimate from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2012. It is therefore provisional and likely to be revised.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	492	I am informed by the Central Bank that it does not hold or require regulated firms to provide it with any information in respect of funds held in trust funds in this State.  Section 46(15) Capital Acquisition Tax Consolidation Act provides that the Revenue Commissioners must be informed when property becomes subject to a discretionary trust.  However, this information would only relate to a small proportion of trusts and Revenue does not maintain any data system from which the information sought on funds held in trust funds in the State could be derived.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	493	The Finance Act 2011 contains legislation that, subject to a Ministerial Commencement Order, provides for the extension of the 1% betting duty to remote bookmakers and a 15% gross profits tax on betting exchanges that offer their services to consumers within the State. The tax changes provided for in the Finance Act can only be implemented once the Betting (Amendment) Bill, which will provide for a regulatory and licensing regime, is enacted. The Betting (Amendment) Bill 2011 is currently at an advanced stage of drafting.  It is expected that by including this high-growth area of the betting sector, particularly given the increasing prevalence of smart phones, the tax base from betting will be boosted significantly.  In a full year it is expected that the tax yield could grow up to €20 million depending on the prevailing market conditions.Just as important is the positive signal this measure will convey to international betting operations that have expressed an interest in or have already invested in Ireland.  A location with an appropriate licensing framework coupled with relatively low taxes provides real investment and employment opportunities in this sector.It should be borne in mind that a 5% tax on turnover would equate to around a 50% tax on profits (based on a bookmaker operating on a 10% gross profit margin) and would be in addition to corporation tax etc. While such a tax rate may, in theory, increase the potential yield, it is very likely that the overall benefit to the Exchequer would be negative due to lack of investment by firms, a reduction in current employment levels and by potential tax avoidance by firms located outside the State. On the other hand, if the tax was to be placed on the punter, there would be a strong incentive to seek out unlicensed bookmakers thereby leading to tax leakage.Enforcement and compliance will be a critical area if the taxation of online betting is to be successful and that is why the tax levels provided for in the Finance Act 2011 are deemed appropriate together with providing for an environment that would attract future investment and employment opportunities.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	494	A provision for allowing losses to be offset against profits or gains is common to a number of taxes, including Income Tax and Corporation Tax as well as Capital Gains Tax (CGT); and there is no time limit for carrying forward losses under any of these taxheads. A chargeable loss arises if a taxpayer disposes of an asset for less than the cost of acquisition — in other words, if the asset has declined in value.  Therefore Capital losses are not being made to avoid CGT per se.  However, many assets have declined significantly in value and claims for capital losses have the potential to affect the CGT yield.The Deputy will be aware that the Memorandum of Understanding with the ECB, EU and IMF provides for a reform of CGT.  The level and timeframe of any changes will be determined in the context of the Budget following the comprehensive expenditure review.It is not possible to estimate the yield from limiting loss relief claims as suggested by the Deputy.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I assume the Deputy is referring to the imposition of a time limit on the carry forward of losses in circumstances where a business does not have sufficient profits against which to offset capital allowances.  In computing the trading profits of a business for tax purposes, deductions are not generally available for capital expenditure, whether in respect of the cost of capital assets purchased or by way of depreciation. However, deductions in the form of capital allowances may be made for certain types of capital expenditure as specified in the Tax Acts. In the case of companies, capital allowances are treated as a trading expense of the trade and, where the amount of capital allowances for an accounting period exceeds the trading profits against which they are to be deducted as a trading expense, the excess is treated as a trading loss for that period.Under existing loss relief provisions in the Tax Acts, any unrelieved trading losses of a company for an accounting period may be carried forward for offset against trading income of the same trade in future accounting periods. No distinction is made in this regard between losses incurred as part of normal trading and losses generated as a result of insufficient profits to absorb capital allowances in an accounting period.While trading losses carried forward may only be offset against future trading income of the same trade and not against any other profits, there is no time limit on the carry forward of such losses and any unused trading losses may be carried forward indefinitely until they are fully offset or the trade ceases. I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the potential saving to the Exchequer if a five year time limit were to be imposed on the carry forward of trading losses would depend on the future profitability of businesses carrying losses forward and their capacity to utilise such losses within a five year timeframe. As it is not possible to anticipate what this might be, an estimate of the potential saving is not available.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I have been advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, if the person concerned is still in employment, he should contact his employer in relation to any possible tax rebate.  If this person has ceased employment, he should submit a completed Form P50 with P45, parts 2 & 3 to the Revenue Commissioners and a review of his tax position will be undertaken. These forms should be submitted to the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, East & South East Region, PAYE Mail Centre, P.O. Box 1, Rosslare Harbour, Co.Wexford.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	497	The Programme for Government represents the Government's agreed policy agenda.  The policies set out in it are designed to facilitate economic growth, restore confidence, fix the banking system, bring order to our public finances, and support the creation of jobs.  The Programme for Government explicitly states its support for the objectives of the EU-IMF programme.  The EU-IMF Programme of financial support represents a three year programme aimed at restructuring and recapitalising the financial system, achieving fiscal sustainability and returning the Irish economy to growth.   It is providing a significant amount of funding — €67.5 billion of external funding — at rates which are considerably lower than those available to us in the financial markets.  This funding supports the objectives of the Programme for Government and without it the scope for Government policy actions would be considerably more constrained.The financial support is provided on the basis of policy conditionality relating to fiscal consolidation, financial sector restructuring, structural reform and structural fiscal reform.  An integral part of the EU — IMF programme is our commitment to consult with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF on the adoption of policies that are not consistent with the EU/IMF Programme.From my dealings to date, I have found the Programme partners are open to changes in the actions and conditions set out in the EU/IMF Programme provided any such changes are accompanied by compensatory measures of equal value or effect.  The primary forum for such consultation is the quarterly review missions with the Programme partners, the fourth of which takes place from the 11th to the 21st of October 2011.  These review missions provide an opportunity to consult with the Programme partners on the various measures set out in the Memorandum of Understanding and Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.  In this context, I would remind the Deputy that the Government has already successfully renegotiated elements of the Programme — for example the Jobs initiative, the ending of further asset transfers to NAMA, and reversal of the Minimum Wage cut.  More recently, we have successfully renegotiated the interest rate charged for the loans along with important changes and improvements to the EU's EFSF funding facility.  For the forthcoming review, the Government focus will be on issues such as the composition of fiscal policy both for Budget 2012 and for the medium terms along with issues such as asset disposals.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	498	The report to which the Deputy refers was published on 27 July this year by the Secretariat of the National Economic and Social Council. It was not published under the Council's name, and therefore the views expressed in it are those of the authors and do not represent the collective view of the Council. For this reason it was not subject to a Government decision prior to publication. However, in accordance with the usual practice for NESC papers, it has been disseminated within, and examined by, my Department.  The paper provides an account of how four years into the crisis, the Irish economy has begun to show tentative signs of recovery, before going on to set out the changing policy positions of both supporters and opponents of the EU/IMF programme of Financial Assistance. It is generally positive in tone, and is largely in line with the views of many commentators and analysts.In support of its argument that there are some signs of an economic recovery (albeit a fragile one) it cites rising exports, a recovery in investment, falling costs, a slowing of employment contraction and growth in the net financial worth of households (excluding household assets).The NESC Secretariat also outlines five related "elements" that it says are necessary for the EU/IMF programme to work. These are that Ireland should—(i) continue fiscal adjustment and reform, by achieving a balance between expenditure and revenue measures;(ii) "work relentlessly to revive sustainable growth";(iii) "make social solidarity a core concern to ensure fairness and unity of purpose";(iv) "address developmental constraints which have the potential to undermine the long term recovery of the economy and society"; and,(v) "work to promote a comprehensive EU and international financial resolution".I consider that the paper represents a fair assessment of Ireland's economic progress over the last four years and that it provides support for the Government's policies to secure recovery.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	499	The report referred to is the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook (WEO) published on 20 September 2011. The IMF considers that the recovery of the global economy has weakened considerably, and downside risks have increased sharply. The IMF forecasts world growth of about 4% in both 2011 and 2012 (revised down from 4.5% for both years in the April WEO forecast). However, they point to the recovery being very unbalanced — with growth of 6.4% forecast for emerging market countries for 2011, but only 1.6% for advanced economies. The European Commission in its Interim Forecast published on 15 September also revised down its forecast for global output to 4% in 2011.  Reflecting this weaker global outlook, the Fund revised down its growth projections for the Irish economy in 2011 and 2012. It now expects growth of 0.4% this year and 1.5% next year, representing downward revisions of 0.1% and 0.4%, respectively, from those published in the previous WEO in April. It is important to note, however, that these revisions were made prior to the release of second quarter national accounts data by the Central Statistics Office which confirmed that the Irish economy grew at a very strong pace in the first half of this year. Real GDP increased by 1.9% and 1.6% in the first and second quarters respectively (on a quarter-on-quarter basis). Furthermore, the Fund continues to anticipate average annual growth of around 3% in the Irish economy over the medium term (2013 to 2016).The IMF is forecasting GDP growth in the euro area of 1.6% in 2011 (unchanged from its April WEO) and 1.1% in 2012 (revised down from an April forecast of 1.8% in 2012). They consider that high public deficits and debt, lower potential output, and mounting market tensions are weighing on growth in much of advanced Europe. Their forecast is for a slowdown in activity for much of Europe, with risks to the downside. The EU Commission in their Interim Forecast showed that economic growth in the EU and the euro zone slowed down considerably in the second quarter of 2011 but said that, due to the stronger-than-expected first quarter, GDP growth in the euro area for 2011 as a whole is set to remain unchanged from their spring 2011 forecast at 1.6%. The Commission considers that, although risks to growth have increased in the EU, a double dip recession is not likely.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	500	NAMA has a commercial remit and a statutory objective to generate a return for the taxpayer.  However, within the context of its commercial remit and consistent with section 2 of the National Asset Management Agency Act 2009, NAMA is at all times open to considering proposals aimed at contributing to broader social and economic objectives.  Thus NAMA is open to facilitating the work of public and community bodies in the creation of vibrant sustainable communities where this is possible. The NAMA Board has committed to giving first option to State bodies on the purchase of property which may be suitable for their purposes where these bodies have requirements such as schools, hospitals, parks, and so on.  I understand that officials of NAMA have already had contact with officials of the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, Department of Education and Skills, the HSE, local authorities and other public bodies to explore the scope for such arrangements.Any local community organization such as the one mentioned by the Deputy, which has a proposal which it wishes to put to NAMA should contact the Portfolio Management unit within NAMA. The NAMA Chairman recently informed the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform that engagement with community groups with regard to land has happened and will continue to happen. He informed the Committee that NAMA would not give away land but should a community group have an interest in a particular piece of land or property or wishes to extend a sports pitch it should speak with NAMA.In the context of social objectives, I would add that NAMA concluded the sale of 58 social and affordable units to the Cluid Housing association in July. The agency has provided a list of over 1,000 other properties to the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government, which that Department is examining for suitability. I am informed by NAMA that an official from the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency is currently on an assignment in NAMA to review the suitability of available property with the NAMA portfolio team.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) clothing for children up to 10 years of age is liable to VAT at the zero rate in accordance with paragraph 10(1) of Schedule 2 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010.  The supply of PPE clothing for children older than 10 years and adults is liable to VAT at the standard rate of 21% as provided for in Section 46(1)(a) of the VAT Consolidation Act.  The application of a reduced rate of VAT in Ireland to the supply of PPE clothing to older children and adults is prohibited by the EU VAT Directive, with which Irish VAT law must comply.  Article 110 of that Directive provides that Member States which, at 1 January 1991, applied a zero rate or a reduced rate of VAT could continue to apply those rates.  The standard rate of VAT applied to older children and adult PPE clothing at 1 January 1991 so Ireland could not and cannot apply a VAT rate lower than the standard rate to these items.  I understand that in the UK, as in Ireland, all PPE clothing supplied to children up to 10 years is zero rated and that older children and adult helmets and boots only that meet recognised PPE standards are liable at the zero rate.  The UK can apply the zero rate to PPE helmets and boots as they applied such a rate to them on at 1 January 1991, as provided for under Article 110.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	502	The Deputy will appreciate that discussions in relation to the restructuring of Quinn Group debt are ongoing. We have been informed by the bank that details of the ongoing discussions with the senior creditors  are commercially sensitive.  Nonetheless, the bank has informed me that the proposed arrangements envisage the establishment of some new entities. The split, or tranching, of the debt has yet to be decided. We understand from the bank that it is not envisaged that any of this Quinn debt will be written off and that the bondholders will continue to have a call on the debt due from the Quinn Group. The Quinn debt will therefore remain as an obligation of the Quinn Group to the senior creditors and can, if appropriate, be carried by subsidiaries of the Quinn Group. The bank has made it clear that it has not taken on any of the Quinn Group's obligations to the senior creditors. The bank has also indicated that the valuation of the Quinn Group for the purposes of this proposed arrangement is commercially sensitive and cannot be disclosed. Finally, we understand from the bank that KPMG, as the Share Receivers appointed by Anglo Irish Bank, are paid in a manner customary with arrangements of this nature.The Deputy will be aware that this restructuring is very much a commercial decision for the bank and one to which I have no direct input and is intended to give the Quinn Group grounds for hope of a viable future.  It is important to state clearly to the House that a viable future however depends to a large degree on market conditions and a willingness by everybody to engage wholeheartedly with the new ownership arrangements, and to begin to put their energies into growing the business. Market conditions and cooperation  generally are critical to the performance of the Group and to the retention of jobs in the local communities on both sides of the border.

Since then, officials from my Department and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners have attended meetings on the subject matter of the CCCTB on five occasions. The first of those meetings was a meeting of the Council High Level Group on Taxation held on 28 April this year. The other four meetings were all meetings of the Council Working Party on Tax Questions which were held on 5 May, 31 May, 19 July and 6 September this year.

It is not possible to provide all this information in a short time frame.  I have however requested this information from the relevant bodies and will send it to the Deputy shortly.I can however inform the Deputy that my Department has made the following payments for professional services on the banking crisis since 2008.Consultant200820092010To August 2011Description of advice providedMercer (Ireland) Ltd.—€3,308——Advice to CIROCWatson (Wyatt) Ltd.—€7,290——Advice to CIROCHay Group Ireland Ltd.—€4,860——Advice to CIROCArthur Cox Solicitors€1,628,024€4,173,689€4,804,884.17€693,179.42Legal advice in relation to the Bank Guarantee Scheme; Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG), recapitalization and restructuring issues; general banking advice.PricewaterhouseCoopers€118,580Professional Fees in respect of accounting advice on promissory notes.The financial institutions covered by the State Guarantee use consultants in respect of many aspects of their operations.

This is in excess of Central Bank estimates of the likely demand for SME and mortgage credit over this period. Both pillar banks are concentrating on the Irish economy and need to issue credit to make profits and rebuild their balance sheets.   As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013. Both banks will be required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion this year, €3.5 billion next year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.Both pillar banks have provided me with their plans to ensure that the 2011 target is achieved. This is particularly relevant given the comments contained in the fifth quarterly report of the Credit Review Office, which stated that "it will be a challenge for each of the banks to reach their €3bn sanction target for new and restructured facilities in the current year."On the issue more generally of the demand for credit, my Department is in the process of commissioning an independent survey of the demand for credit within the SME sector. The outcome will provide the necessary information to better inform Government policy in this important sector of the Irish economy.It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery. However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.The Deputy should also be aware of the plans of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to introduce a temporary partial loan guarantee scheme, which is a commitment included in the Programme for Government, and work is advancing on the arrangements for the introduction of this scheme.

There are three key conditions for doing so:restoring order to the public finances,a functioning banking system, andimproving competitiveness.The Government is committed to restoring order to the public finances and to reducing the General Government deficit to less than 3% of GDP by 2015.  Significant budgetary adjustments have already been implemented, and while progress has been made in tackling and stabilising the deficit, further measures will be required to keep the corrective process on track.A functioning, well capitalised banking sector is a prerequisite for a sustainable economic recovery.  The Government has taken concrete steps to ensure that the Irish banking system is fit for purpose, right sized, adequately capitalised and with a focus on the Irish economy.As our recovery will be export led, it is crucial that the competitiveness gains made in the last number of years be sustained.  To this end, both the Programme for Government and the EU/IMF Programme outline a series of structural reforms, which will help to further restore competitiveness and support economic growth.  These include:a comprehensive review of the REA & EROs which has been completedlegislative changes to remove restrictions to trade and competition in sheltered sectors which is in processreview of the electricity and gas sectors which will be undertaken before year endAll of the above are having the desired effect — the latest figures from the CSO show that the economy is growing once again, led by exports.  Despite this, the Government is not complacent and is well aware that further improvements in our competitiveness are essential to ensure a sustained recovery.

A comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently underway following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government's key objectives for the renewal of the banking system, which are ahead of schedule, have been completed.  This assessment will include the strategic investment bank's relationship with the two pillar banks and the timeline for its establishment.As regards the support of small and medium enterprises in general, the restructuring of the domestic banking sector creates capacity for the pillar banks to lend in excess of €30 billion over the next three years in SME and other important sectors.  This is in excess of Central Bank estimates of the likely demand for SME and mortgage credit over this period.  Both pillar banks are concentrating on the Irish economy and need to issue credit to make profits and rebuild their balance sheets.As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.

For those Special Needs Assistants whose first appointment was on or after 1st January 2011, the salary scale ranges from €20,869 to €32,327 (full details in Circular 41/2011 hereunder).All Special Needs Assistants commence employment at the first point of the relevant salary scale and move up one point for each year of service.  After 3 years on the maximum of the scale, Special Needs Assistants receive a Long Service Increment of €1,420 if their first appointment was prior to 1st January 2011 or €1,278 if their first appointment was on or after 1st January 2011.It is not possible to accurately provide the net cost of salary for 226 Special Needs Assistants.  This is because the rate at which statutory deductions such as income tax, PRSI and Universal Social Charge are deducted are individual to each Special Needs Assistant depending on their individual circumstances.I am presuming the Deputy is referring to the posts which were absorbed within the cap for Special Needs Assistants following the successful transition of 13 pilot ABA schools (226 posts).  These posts operated outside of the Employment Control Framework limits set for the SNA post prior to being fully recognised special schools within the state education system.  In order to successfully accommodate these new schools, which are a welcome addition to the growing diversity of provision for children with special educational needs, it was necessary to absorb these 226 posts within the cap imposed by the EU/IMF Memorandum of Understanding.  The alternative would have been to not recognise these 13 pilot schools and to deny them the support and recognition which they deserve.Circular 0005/2010To the Management Authorities of Primary, Secondary, Community and Comprehensive Schools and the Chief Executive Officer of each Vocational Education Committee Revision of Salaries for Special Needs Assistants with effect from 1 January 20101. The Minister for Education and Science wishes to inform Vocational Education Committees, Management Authorities and Special Needs Assistants of the application of revised rates of salary with effect from 1 January 2010.2. The new rates of salary and allowances have been introduced as a result of the application in the education sector of pay reductions with effect from 1st January 2010 in accordance with the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 (No. 41 of 2009) (The "Act").3. In accordance with the Act, reductions in basic salary have been applied with effect from 1st January 2010 as follows:-a. 5% on the first €30,000 of salary;b. 7.5% on the next €40,000 of salary;c. 10% on the next €55,000 of salary;d. This formula produces overall reductions in salaries ranging from 5% to 8% in the case of salaries up to €125,000.4. The revised salary scales are set out in a schedule to this circular on this Department's website at www.education.ie under Education Personnel/Payroll.5.

The Minister for Education and Skills wishes to inform vocational education committees, management bodies and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) of the application of revised rates of salary for new appointees as SNAs from 1 January 2011 onwards.2. As part of Budget 2011 the Government has applied a 10% reduction in the pay of new entrants to the public service (referred to in this Circular as "new appointees") and all new appointees to the entry grades of the public service must start at the first point of the relevant pay scale with effect from 1 January 2011.Application of new pay rates3. The revised pay scale for SNAs is set out in an Appendix to this Circular and can be accessed by clicking here.New appointee to the SNA Grade4. The new pay rates apply to all SNAs who are new appointees appointed on or after 1 January 2011.5. Where a person gave service as an SNA before 1 January 2011 (including those currently on an approved leave of absence), s/he will not be regarded as a new appointee.  In addition, a person with a written offer of employment before 1 January 2011 will not be regarded as a new appointee.  In these cases, the person will be assigned to the appropriate pre-1 January 2011 scale and allowances, and incremental credit for previous SNA service and other experience which is deemed relevant will be awardable.6. Where an SNA who is retired and is in receipt of a pension returns to the position of an SNA on or after 1 January 2011, s/he will start on the first point of the post 1 January 2011 incremental salary scale.Incremental credit7. All new appointees to SNA positions will start on the first point of the incremental salary scale.  The Government has decided that all new appointees to entry grades (subject to the criteria set out above) will start at the minimum point of the new reduced scale.8. However, incremental credit may continue to apply for relevant recognised service.  Similarly, those who leave the system will be able to reckon such previous relevant service on re-entry.Circulation9.

Follow up contact has since been made with the school to secure this information.  As soon as a response is received from the school, the project can be progressed to the next stage of the architectural planning process.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	516	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.The NCSE has recently published statistical information in relation to the allocation of Special Needs Assistant posts and resource teaching hours to Primary Special and Post Primary Schools.  The information is provided on a county by county and school by school basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 1 SNA post and 5.9 Resource Teaching Hours.It is considered that, with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management.  SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated.  It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy.  The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Some 18,000 students qualifying for grant support are estimated to live between 24 kms and 45 kms from their colleges and it is estimated that some 6,900 mature students qualifying for grant support live 45 kilometres or less from their institution.Students qualifying for the maintenance element of the student grant in these cohorts will receive the adjacent rate of grant together with payment of their fees or student contribution.  Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of grant. In addition, third level students in difficult financial circumstances will have access to the Student Assistance Fund.The new qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant is expected to achieve a full year saving of €30 million and removing the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant is expected to achieve a full year saving of €13 million.As the previous Government had factored in the savings from these changes to the public expenditure programme for 2011, I regret that I am not in a position to reverse or vary them.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	518	I propose to take Questions Nos. 208 to 212, inclusive, and 214 together.The management of radioactive waste is the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government working in conjunction with the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII).Information available from the RPII regarding disused radioactive waste in the country's education sector indicates that there are 2,037 sources held at 17 institutions.  These sources are held in dedicated storage facilities.  Further information and details are available from the RPII directly.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that based on advice received from the RPII these disused sources do not represent a hazard.  The RPII is satisfied that all sources held under licence are stored safely and securely to meet licence requirements and to comply with national legislation.  Regular inspections are carried out by the RPII of all licensees in this sector.The stock of disused sources will not increase.  It is a licensing requirement that an application to acquire new sealed sources is accompanied by a take back agreement whereby the supplier agrees to take back the source when it is no longer required.  Funding the costs of returning material other than that used for research purposes rests with institutions.  Since disbursing research grants is the responsibility of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation the position in relation to returning material used for research purposes is a matter between that Department and institutions.Earlier this year my Department introduced a scheme in the higher education sector whereby specific funding is available for the disposal of legacy disused sources.  With the exception of stock at UCC, this scheme will remove all legacy disused sources through export by commercial operators.  While exact costs of implementing this scheme are not currently available due to ongoing tendering action, initial indications are that costs will not be significant.Concerning sources held at UCC, I am informed that the position is as follows: 1. Material in storage at UCC did not come from a nuclear reactor as has been suggested.  It was originally incorporated into a device called a sub critical assembly (SCA), designed to be safely used in an open laboratory. The SCA was incapable of generating either heat or power. 2. The SCA was disassembled in the early 1980s and its radioactive components were placed in secure storage.  UCC no longer has any use for this SCA and continues to endeavour to dispose of this material.  In this regard, UCC in consultation with the RPII has made significant progress and UCC is hopeful that a resolution can be achieved shortly.  It is too early to assess the costs that will be associated with disposal at this time.The components of the SCA were last inspected by the European Atomic Energy Community on 6th October, 2010.  The nuclear material is securely stored at UCC in a proprietary radioactive waste store built to a design approved by RPII.  The material is held at UCC under licence from the RPII whose Inspectors regularly inspect this store in addition to inspections by the EU and by the IAEA.  The radioactive material is stored under strict physical and electronic security including continuous CCTV monitoring.  The store is only entered save for the purposes of inspection.  I am assured by the RPII that radiation levels outside the store are negligible and pose no health hazard. 3. The RPII last inspected the waste store at UCC in June 2011 and was satisfied with the on-going security arrangements.  Furthermore, the storage facility has been the subject of several security audits undertaken by the National Crime Prevention Unit of An Garda Síochána since November 2008.

Such applications relate to schools that have less than 14 eligible pupils for language support.  Decisions on these applications were deferred until the Autumn, having regard to the overall level of demand for full-time language support and other upward pressures on teacher numbers within the context of operating under a fixed ceiling on teacher numbers.The Department is not in a position to approve applications for part-time language support posts and individual schools will be notified accordingly.

It also administers the retirement gratuities of civil servants who retire from my Department.Based on lump sums paid to those school staff referred to above for the 12 month period from June 2010 to June 2011, the estimated yield from applying rates of taxation of 20% and 41% to these lump sums, as set out in the question, would be of the order of €9 million.  In addition it is estimated that €0.09 million would have been yielded in respect of gratuities paid in the period to civil servants on retirement from my Department.It is estimated that in any twelve month period a broadly similar amount would be yielded where the numbers retiring remain constant.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.The NCSE has now advised all mainstream schools, including the school referred to by the Deputy, of their SNA allocation for the current school year, taking into account the care needs of qualifying pupils attending the school.The NCSE has recently published statistical information in relation to the allocation of Special Needs Assistant posts and resource teaching hours to Primary Special and Post Primary Schools. The information is provided on a county by county and school by school basis on its website at www.ncse.ie.The school referred to by the Deputy has an allocation of 10.15 SNA posts and 99.5 Resource Teaching Hours.It is considered that, with equitable and careful management and distribution of these resources, there should be sufficient posts to provide access to SNA support for all children who require such care support to attend school, in accordance with Departmental criteria.I wish to clarify that the recruitment and deployment of SNAs within schools are matters for the individual Principal/Board of Management. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required, and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy. The merits of individual allocation decisions will not be open to appeal under this mechanism.It will be expected that schools, before requesting a review, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.

Concerns have also been raised about curriculum overload, and rote learning.The Council is currently finalising its advice to me on the direction of reform, in consultation with the partners in education. I expect to receive the advice shortly.I am aware that teachers of geography have raised concerns that their subjects will no longer be compulsory.  The requirement to study geography in a secondary school but to have different options in vocational schools is a historical anomaly which is no longer appropriate. I believe that students should have as wide a choice as is feasible in their schools given the overall level of student demand and interest, the teaching resources available, and the qualifications profile of staff. The importance of geography in promoting critical analysis skills, interculturalism, an understanding of human development, democracy, past and current world issues, and the skills for an environmentally sustainable life are fully appreciated.

Firstly there is the provision of an additional 15,900 training and education places across a range of programmes with a special focus on the unemployed. This does not involve direct job creation.My Department is now funding the provision of over 116,000 training places this year for the unemployed through FÁS, Skillnets and the Labour Market Activation Fund. In addition, there are now 172,000 places available in the Further Education Sector and 162,000 places available in the Higher Education Sector which the unemployed may also access.   At the conclusion of these training and education programmes, participants will be better equipped to progress into further education, training, higher education or directly into employment.There is also a job creation facet to the Department's programme of school building projects. In relation to the estimated number of jobs generated in this area, I would refer the Deputy to Minister Quinn's answer of Tuesday 17th May 2011 to Questions 169 and 168.

The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement.Parents engage tutors directly and the grant is paid to the parent on a monthly basis in arrears. In such instances the payment is made to the parent, who is then responsible for payment to their selected tutor. This affords a degree of flexibility and choice for parents in selecting the most suitable tutor for the purposes of home tuition for their children.The position in relation to the case referred to by the Deputy is that the parent received the payment of the educational grant in advance for the approved period from the 7th February 2011 to the 3rd June 2011. However, the tuition provided only started in the week commencing the 28th March 2011, resulting in an over-issue of €527.25.The parent received written notification to refund this amount to my Department, on two occasions, in accordance with the terms of this Scheme.

These changes include the removal of the automatic entitlement of mature students to the non-adjacent rate of grant and an increase in the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant.However, it might be helpful for the student in question to know that she can apply for assistance under the Student Assistance Fund.

In this regard, the Board gives priority to those applicants who are over 70 years of age and those who are suffering from a life-threatening medical or psychiatric condition which has been confirmed by the applicant's regular medical adviser.

Special Needs Assistants are allocated to schools to cater for the care needs of children who have an assessed special educational need.Schools then manage and deploy the SNA resources which have been allocated to them to provide for the care needs of  designated pupils.In considering applications for SNA support, or any review of the level of SNA support which has been provided to schools, SENOs actively engage with both schools and parents to consider the level of SNA support which may be required to meet the care needs of the children concerned, taking into account the level of SNA support currently available to the school.In circumstances where parents obtain new medical reports or relevant information, they should submit this information through their school to the NCSE so that it might be considered as part of any review process.The NCSE expects to respond to emergency cases on hand within the coming weeks. The outcome of a review of special school SNA allocations is expected early in the school year. Other demands from mainstream schools will be responded to up to the end of the school year. Through these arrangements it is expected that the majority of the SNA posts which have yet to be allocated, will have been allocated by early in 2012.The NCSE will advise schools early in the new school year of a process to review allocation decisions to ensure that correct procedures were followed and that they comply with my Department's policy.

Decisions in relation to such funding matters are generally made as part of the annual Estimates process.Full medical card holders (in their own right and their dependent children), those eligible under the student grant scheme and those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance (BTEA) or Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) allowances are exempt from paying the contribution, which should ensure that those who are less well off will continue to access PLC courses.In relation to funding levels in higher education, future demand for participation growth needs to be reconciled with limitations on public resources and a need to protect and enhance core quality. The National Strategy for Higher Education to 2030 identifies the need for more detailed analysis and the Higher Education Authority has been asked to undertake further work on the sustainability of the existing funding framework, the intention of which is to assess the inter-relationship and tensions between three parameters of: growth in student numbers, funding constraints and quality. This work will inform consideration by Government of policy options in relation to future funding of the sector.

The student contribution replaces the Student Services Charge and applies to all students who benefit under the free fees scheme.In recognition of the financial pressures that the student contribution may place on families, my Department requested higher education institutions to consider putting in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the student contribution charge in two instalments in a given academic year. I have again asked the Higher Education Authority to request institutions to allow the payment of the charge in two moieties.I understand that a few institutions do not have this facility at present due to technical/systems limitations and administrative issues that make it impractical to allow for payment by instalments. However, all institutions have been requested to accommodate students who present with financial difficulties on a case by case basis and, from the academic year 2012/13 onwards, to have systems in place that allow for the payment of the student contribution in two instalments.

Work prioritisation across different functions, and how available staff are deployed to execute those functions are matters for the management of each VEC and local authority concerned.My Department is in constant contact with grant awarding authorities to monitor the situation in relation to the processing and payment of grants to ensure that applicants receive decisions on their grant applications as soon as possible.  In this regard, I understand that one of the grant awarding authorities in the Deputy's constituency commenced making payments in September and the other three will be making payments this month.The Deputy will be aware that the student grants system will be centralised from September 2012 and eliminate the need for 66 grant awarding bodies. I believe this will lead to improved efficiencies in the processing and payment of student grants and is evidence of innovative public service reform.

Students on particularly low incomes will also receive a top-up in the special rate of grant.Students in exceptional financial circumstances can apply for assistance under the Student Assistance Fund.

This facilitates access to individualised education programmes, fully qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants and the appropriate school curriculum with the option, in line with each child's ability, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils.My Department's policy is to provide for children with special educational needs, including autism, to be included in mainstream schools unless such a placement would not be in their best interests or the interests of the children with whom they are to be educated.  Some children may be supported in a special class attached to a mainstream school.  These students have the option, where appropriate, of full/partial integration and interaction with other pupils. Other children may have such complex needs that they are best placed in a special school. Students with special educational needs have access to a range of support services including additional teaching and/or care supports. In special schools and special classes, students are supported through lower pupil teacher ratios.  Special needs assistants may also be recruited specifically where pupils with disabilities and significant care needs are enrolled.The Deputy will be aware that the establishment of a network of autism-specific special classes in schools across the country to cater for children with autism has been a key educational priority in recent years. In excess of 450 classes have now been approved around the country at primary and post primary level, including many in special schools.My Department has put in place a training programme for teachers in autism-specific interventions including Treatment and Education of Autistic Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH), Picture Exchange Communications System (PECS) and Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) through the Special Education Support Service.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special needs resources to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  The NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers and special needs assistants will continue to be deployed to schools to meet children's needs in line with my Department's policy. SENOs with their local knowledge and expertise are a valuable resource to parents in sourcing an educational placement.My Department continues to fund special school transport arrangements for pupils with special educational needs.  Funding is also provided to schools to purchase assistive technology and/or specialist equipment.  In addition, funding can be provided for school buildings to be adapted where necessary.The Deputy will also be aware that my Department provides grant aid under the Home Tuition Scheme to provide early education intervention for pre-school children with a confirmed diagnosis of autism or to parents of children with autism who are awaiting an educational placement.The education of children with special educational needs remains a key Government priority and the Government will continue to provide for learning support and resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts in schools.

All applicants must be available for and actively seeking employment. While this is the reason the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance is not one of the eligible payments, a person transferring back to a Jobseeker's Benefit or Allowance Payment from the Back to Work Enterprise Allowance would qualify immediately to apply for a place on a Springboard programme.  There is no requirement to be in receipt of the Jobseeker's payment for a specific period of time before applying for a Springboard programme.People who do not fulfil the eligibility criteria for Springboard may also apply under the Department of Education and Skills Student Grant Scheme, for fee and maintenance cost support to pursue a higher education programme on a full-time basis.

However, a decision is expected shortly in this regard from the European Commission.A number of measures, for which EGF co-financing is being sought, are already being provided by the relevant service providers and funded from national sources.These measures include career guidance, full, part-time and evening further education and training courses, apprenticeship on- and off-the-job training, full and part-time third level education programmes, enterprise start-up advisory and financial supports and related training and education allowances where appropriate.The main service providers delivering these supports are FÁS, Vocational Education Committees, publicly funded higher education institutes and City and County Enterprise Boards.  Training is also provided through contracted private service providers and the technical employment support grant mechanism administered by FÁS.To date, it is estimated that at least 4,500 interventions for this cohort have been commenced in the area of guidance, training and third level education. Data are still being collated from a number of service providers.Subject to EU approval of the EGF applications, further measures will be provided or intensified as appropriate.  Upon approval of the EGF applications, I will make copies of same publicly available for information purposes.

The type of competitive process can vary depending on the size and characteristics of the contract to be awarded. For contracts or purchases below the EU threshold values less formal procedures may be appropriate.It is the responsibility of a Vocational Education Committee to satisfy itself that the requirements for public procurement are adhered to and to be fully conversant with the current value thresholds for the application of EU and national procurement rules.  VEC management, and ultimately the Committee, should ensure that there is an appropriate focus on good practice in purchasing and that procedures are in place to ensure compliance with procurement policy and guidelines.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	559	As I outlined in my reply to the Deputy's question in July of this year, the consideration of flooding matters in the River Shannon catchment falls within the national programme of Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management (CFRAM) studies being commissioned nationally throughout 2011.The Office of Public Works (OPW) appointed engineering consultants, Jacobs International, in January 2011 to undertake the Shannon CFRAM study. This work will identify and examine in detail the causes of flooding throughout the Shannon catchment, and produce an integrated plan of specific measures to address the significant flood risk factors in a pro-active and comprehensive way. Its output will be a flood risk management plan for the Shannon catchment, taking into account economic, social and environmental factors.The incidence of summer flooding of the Shannon Callows between Portumna and Athlone is an important part of the CFRAM study for the Shannon catchment. It is important to stress that the long-term resolution of significant areas of flooding risk in the Shannon catchment, and indeed on all national river catchments, must derive from the extensive range of CFRAM studies now being undertaken.Progress:Considerable progress has been made in progressing the Study, which will continue to 2015 and will meet the requirements of the EU Floods Directive.A number of meetings of both the CFRAM Advisory and Progress Groups, which includes representatives of the principal stakeholders, have taken place, early draft deliverables have been supplied and the Study programme remains firmly on track.The project website, www.ShannonCFRAMStudy.ie has been launched which allows all interested parties and members of the public to review progress on the Study and access regular electronic newsletters on the Study, outlining progress made and forthcoming consultation events and milestones.Consultation:In the context of the delivery of the first principal reporting stage of this study, the Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment, a public consultation process is underway for the River Shannon Catchment, as well as nationally for all other catchments.In parallel with this public consultation, I have engaged extensively with a series of meetings with local delegations and the Irish Farmers Association (IFA), in Athlone, Longford and East Galway, and arranged a stakeholder consultation forum held in Ballinasloe in July. This included the main stakeholder groups in the Shannon Catchment, and provided a structured opportunity for those groups too set out their concerns.Public consultation forms an integral part of the CFRAM Study process, and stakeholder group meetings and public, location-specific consultation days will be held throughout the Study period in addition to the formal consultation processes required under SI. No. 122 of 2010, which transposed the ‘Floods' Directive into Irish Law.

In addition, you may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and remaining stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011. It is now before the Dáil.My colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Quinn to develop the Bill into a robust piece of legislation. In this regard, Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn met relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28 June 2011.  This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration. These have been taken into account now in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the Bill which was completed recently and published on 27 September.  The Report is available in my Departments website: www.per.gov.ie/reports.  I understand that a note on this issue was circulated to all Oireachtas members last week.The RIA examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention.  It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation. In addition, the RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation.  It found that there were merits to considering amending the Bill in a number of respects e.g. to bring lower value contracts within its scope and to make the adjudicators award binding in payment dispute cases.  It concluded that any such amendments should be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.In addition to the issues dealt with in the RIA, Minister Hayes has asked the relevant officials to re-examine other issues raised during the consultation, including the time limit on suspension, to see if a more effective solution can be formulated in such a manner that would protect the taxpayer.Minister Hayes will reflect on the findings of the RIA and incorporate them into the legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly for approval.  It is essential that the solution to this issue needs to be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	562	The Valuation Act 2001 provides for the valuation of all commercial and industrial property and the Commissioner of Valuation is independent in the performance of his functions under the Act and the making of valuations for rating is his sole prerogative.The basis of rateable valuation for all property is net annual value, i.e. the rental value of the property and is set out in Part II of the Act.  Various methodologies may be used in estimating the net annual value (NAV)/rental value of a property. The most common methodology used is direct comparison with other similar properties but in some instances the receipts & expenditure method of valuation, where turnover is relevant, may be employed.Changing the basis of assessment from net annual value/rental value to turnover as such would most likely change individual ratepayer liabilities and would change rates from being a local commercial property charge to a local business tax based on turnover.The levying of rates on commercial property by reference to turnover rather than valuation would be a significant change and a departure from the long-standing practice of levying rates by reference to property values. There are already taxes in place which are levied on turnover, i.e. VAT and income/corporation taxes, and the adoption of such a system for rating purposes would not be suitable because turnover can vary significantly within and between the various business sectors, which would lead to an unstable and volatile valuation base.I should emphasise that while the list of rateable valuations produced and maintained by the Valuation Office is the basis on which rates are levied, the amount of rates to be collected is a matter for each local authority to decide.The legislation provides for a revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State. The revaluation programme began in November, 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. The process is now being rolled out in Dublin City.  The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency in the local authority rating system. Ideally, occupiers of properties of similar value in the same rating authority area should have a similar rates liability. Following a revaluation, there will be a much closer relationship between rental value and commercial rates liability.My Department is considering proposals to amend the Valuation Act to modernise and streamline the valuation process in the interests of both the ratepayers and the local authorities.

An option to purchase by periodic contributions may only be exercised where there is at least 2 years between the date of commencement of the purchase agreement and the relevant retirement age by reference to which the agreement is entered into.  Where a person is within 2 years of the relevant retirement age a periodic option is not available — service may only be purchased by lump sum.  A lump sum purchase option may be exercised at any time, subject to one such option generally per annum.While overall policy for the scheme is the responsibility of my Department, the day-to-day administration of the scheme is a matter for each Department/Public Service body in respect of their own employees.  Consequently, anyone wishing to purchase service must apply to their own Personnel Section.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The current superannuation scheme provisions for established civil servants, including the grades of Secretary General, Assistant Secretary, Principal, and Assistant Principal, are uniform across the Civil Service, and full details of this scheme are set out at the Government website www.cspensions.gov.ie.As the Deputy will be aware, the Single Public Service Pension Scheme, the bill for which has been published by the Government, includes the provisions set out below.  These will apply after commencement of the legislation to new recruits to the Civil/Public Service, and to those who are not existing civil/public servants within 6 months of taking up their employment:  a.  Raises the minimum public service pension age — it is proposed this be increased initially to 66 to bring it into line and link it henceforth with the social welfare state pension age, rising on a phased basis to 67 and 68; b. sets a maximum retirement age of 70 — at present for most new entrants to the public service, there is no maximum retirement age; and  c.  move to the calculation of pensions on the basis of "career average" earnings rather than final salary.The introduction of a career average rather than a final salary system is fairer and more equitable than a final salary system in that it affects the pension paid to those who have high earnings especially in late career [for example, a person promoted to top management later in their career] more than those who may have a relatively ‘flat' career progression [for example, nurses, teachers].There are special provisions for Secretaries General, whose terms of appointment included the Top-level Appointments Committee exit terms.  These terms are currently being reviewed by the Government.It should be noted that public service remuneration has been reduced which will affect pensions of those retiring after February 2012.  The salary of a Level-1 Secretary General has been reduced from €285,000 to €214,000, which has significant implications for retirees after February 2012.  Secretaries General have also taken a voluntary reduction of €14,000, which does not affect pension.  Those who retire before end-February 2012 will have their pensions reduced by the Public Service Pension Reduction, which in the case of a Secretary General is about 10%.Lump sums above €200,000 are now being taxed.There is an additional tax applied to those whose capitalised pension benefits exceed a threshold of €2.3 million, except for those who qualify for a Personal Fund Threshold in excess of their total pension benefits.

The Government expect that this will go beyond simply abolishing agencies and also consider issues such as how existing agencies might be reformed, how functions might be reallocated among them, and how different bodies — within and beyond individual Ministers' remit — might be brought together on a repurposed, streamlined basis.The question of rationalisation and the reduction in the number of state agencies will be considered in the context of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and the overall budgetary and estimates process for 2012 and later years.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	573	Recruitment to and promotion within the civil service is governed by the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act, 2004 and by the Civil Service Regulation Acts, 1956-2005. The 2004 Act provides for the establishment of the Commission for Public Service Appointments (CPSA) and of the Public Appointments Service (PAS). The PAS provides a centralised recruitment, assessment and selection body for the civil service.  Recruitment and promotion to posts within the civil service is on the basis of codes of practice developed by the CPSA. The codes of practice cover such areas as probity, merit, equity and fairness, selection on the basis of merit, protection of the public interest, implementation of best practice and good governance.The civil service operates a best practice model in relation to promotion procedures in selecting candidates for promotion in the civil service. This model involves the definition of competencies, skills experiences and requirements for the post and a fair and open assessment of candidates against these requirements. Competitive assessment takes place by a number of methods including competitive interview, competitive assessment by application form, assessment testing (e.g. aptitude test) or by a combination of these.  Access to recruitment competitions is open to all suitably qualified candidates, including those with professional and technical backgrounds.Arrangements in respect of the running of internal promotion competitions in the civil service are agreed between the Official and Staff Sides under the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for the civil service.  In general, there is currently no central agreement to allow technical and professional grades to compete for general service positions. Efforts have been made in earlier agreements such as Sustaining Progress and Towards 2016 to address the issue of cross-stream promotion but no progress was made.I am in favour of providing the widest possible candidate pool for posts in the civil service and it is my intention to seek progress in this area under the provisions of the Croke Park Agreement.

Additionally, the equivalent pay rates for Secretary General Level II were €226,937 ppc and €215,590 non-ppc and for Secretary General Level I, €240,286 ppc and €228,466 non-ppc.   However, I should point out that following the introduction by the Government in June last of a pay ceiling of €200,000 p.a. for senior public service posts, all current incumbents of Secretary General Level I and II posts, voluntarily waived their entitlement to any salary in excess of €200,000 p.a.

In addition, you may be aware that the Construction Contracts Bill 2010 was introduced by Senator Feargal Quinn and passed Committee and remaining stages in the Seanad on 8 March 2011. It is now before the Dáil.My colleague Minister of State Mr Brian Hayes has been working with Senator Quinn to develop the Bill into a robust piece of legislation. In this regard, Minister Hayes and Senator Quinn met relevant stakeholders and opposition spokespersons on 28 June 2011. This consultation highlighted a number of matters relating to the Bill that required further consideration. These have been taken into account now in the Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the Bill which was completed recently and published on 27 September. The Report is available on my Department's website: www.per.gov.ie/reports. I understand that a note on this issue was circulated to all Oireachtas members last week.The RIA examined issues relating to payment practices in the construction sector and assessed the need for legislative intervention. It found that legislation is desirable to improve payment practices and to allow swift resolution of payment disputes by way of adjudication, allowing projects to be completed without wasting time and money in litigation. In addition, the RIA examined the main proposals to amend the Bill that were raised during the Seanad debate and subsequent consultation.Minister Hayes will reflect on the findings of the RIA and incorporate them in to the legislative proposals which will be brought to Government shortly for approval. It is essential that the solution to this issue be balanced so as to avoid imposing regulatory or cost burdens on parties in dispute, the State or others.

In respect of the first officer referred to, in 2001 the organisation had need of a person with specific expertise to fill a vacant position.  A member of staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs had the requisite skills and experience and it was agreed that the staff member would be seconded to the organisation with effect from October 2001.  The cost of the salary is recouped from the organisation and there is no net cost to the Exchequer associated with this secondment.In respect of the second officer referred to, the officer in question went on secondment from 23/09/96.  The cost of the officer's salary was recouped from the organisation on a quarterly basis and there was no net cost to the Exchequer. He went on special leave without pay from 08/10/01 and he returned to the Department of Social Protection on 16/02/09.  The release of these staff to work for the organisation concerned was managed without any impact on the service delivery of their Departments.A moratorium on recruitment and promotion has been in place since in March 2009 and it is Government policy to reduce overall civil service numbers in order to consolidate the public finances.  This is being done in a manner which prioritises on protecting front-line services.

Individual Departments are responsible for the projects and programmes in their areas, within that overall framework.There are currently 36 PPP projects committed to by Government; these projects are listed in the table below. Of these 36 projects, 8 have been privately financed and the cost of the project will be paid by the State over a long period of time (usually 25 years) via annual unitary payments. Nine are concession projects which are financed via user charges (e.g. tolls). Of the remaining projects 18 are Design, Build and Operate (DBO) projects which are financed directly from the Exchequer and one project (a social housing project) was procured on the basis of a land swap with a developer. These latter projects are not considered PPPs in the classic sense due to the fact that they are not privately financed.No further projects have reached contract stage in 2011 to date; however, I understand that there are five PPP projects currently at various stages of the procurement process.

I would point out that contractors being awarded a public contract must provide a Tax Clearance Certificate issued by Revenue confirming that the firm's tax affairs are in order and that it has complied with its tax obligations.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	585	Capital allocations to Departments are announced in the Budget each year as part of the framework of rolling multi-annual capital envelopes and, early in the year, Departments publish their profile of expected monthly draw-downs.  These profiles reflect the business needs of Departments and their agencies, mapping when they need to access their capital allocations during the course of the year.Capital spending has general characteristics which influence the allocation drawdown pattern.  Expenditure on capital projects typically occurs in large tranches at fixed milestones, unlike current expenditure which is generally continuous throughout the year. Obviously, this affects the phasing and profile of capital expenditure.  In addition, public financial rules require that payments are only made on foot of matured liabilities, so payments made in the later parts of the year are made on foot of work that has already been satisfactorily completed.A major construction project may take a few years to complete but may, for example, only have a small number of points at which payments are made. Occasionally payments may be later than profiled if project works take longer than expected, if the contractor is delayed in submitting a claim, or if the contracting authority is not satisfied that what has been contracted for has been delivered.  Seasonal influences can affect when works are done.  Clearly, the appropriate time for school repairs, for example, is in the summer holidays in order to minimise disruption to school business, and thus, such works would likely fall for payment in the later part of the year, after the works are concluded.Finally, the drawdown of funds can be affected by public or private bodies not drawing down capital grants when scheduled.  The capital works in respect of which the grants were approved, may be completed and even paid for, but for a variety of reasons, there can be occasional delays in submission of recoupment claims.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Ensuring a more flexible and responsive public service is a key element of the Government's reform programme.  Measures to increase staff mobility and to ensure that resources are allocated to priority areas in a timely and strategic manner will form part of the reform programme implementation plan, which is currently being developed in my Department.  A significant instrument in that regard is the Public Service Agreement 2010-14 (Croke Park Agreement) which provides for agreed redeployment arrangements to apply in the Civil Service and in other parts of the public service. Redeployment allows staff to be moved from activities which are of lesser priority, or which have been rationalised, reconfigured, or restructured, to areas of greater need. In practical terms these arrangements represent a means of facilitating the targeted reduction in public service numbers in the period to 2014 while sustaining the ongoing delivery of services.The Public Appointments Service (PAS) has put in place a system of Resource Panels of Civil Service and State Agency staff to support redeployment.  Posts to be filled by redeployment are offered in the first instance the relevant panel or panels. My Department will prepare the legislation necessary to remove legal barriers to cross-sectoral redeployment and to address other issues that arise on changing employer.Where staff are not available for redeployment in a particular location, the post, if approved for filling by my Department, may be offered to staff who had already indicated an interest in transferring there, whether directly to the Department concerned or through the Central Applications Facility (CAF). Since 2003, the CAF has also facilitated the wishes of substantial numbers of public servants to transfer to alternative locations under the Decentralisation Programme. However, the possibilities to facilitate requests for such transfers are now more limited due to ongoing reductions in public service numbers and the necessity for redeployment to take precedence.The Senior Public Service (SPS) provides mobility opportunities for Assistant Secretaries to move to posts at equivalent level within the civil service.  As the SPS is extended to the wider public service, mobility will be extended on an incremental basis.

They are subject to the regulation of the Charities Regulatory Authority and answerable to their stakeholders, shareholders and funders.  Many charities, typically, charities which formed themselves as companies, do so as companies limited by guarantee (CLG).  Due to their public membership structure they cannot avail of an audit exemption.The Company Law Review Group (CLRG) 2009 Report examined the issue of extending audit exemption to companies limited by guarantee (CLG).  It made the following recommendations:"(i) Subject in each case to consultation with the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the charities regulator, the audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to such class or classes of CLG which are charitable organisations (within the meaning of the Charities Act 2009) so as to bring them into alignment with charitable organisations that are not companies, provided that 10% of the members with voting rights should be able to require an audit.(ii) The audit exemption regime contained in Part III of the 1999 (No. 2) Act be extended to all CLGs which are not charitable organisations, subject to a veto right, by any one member of the company, and further subject to the requirement that audit exemption in respect of the following year, shall be an item on the agenda of the annual general meeting."The recommendations of the CLRG in this matter will be considered in the context of the Companies Bill.  Drafting of the Bill by the Office of the Parliamentary Council is expected to be finalised in the next 12 months.  The CLRG recommendations contemplate that any proposals in this matter will be subject to consultation with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Charities Regulator.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21387	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	Forfás currently collects and analyses data on the performance of enterprises supported by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and Udarás na Gaeltachta.  Forfás works with these agencies on the completion of a number of annual surveys — most notably the Forfás Annual Employment Survey and the Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact.The agencies provide Forfás with annual updates, including information on company start-ups and closures, as part of the preparation for the Annual Employment Survey.  These data are built in to the Forfás Business Information System and Employment Survey System on a systematic basis.  Sectoral analysis of these data are produced for various Forfás reports and the data are also used for calculating metrics which the enterprise development agencies report on an annual basis (e.g. first-time jobs, cost per job sustained, etc.).The Forfás Business Information System draws data from enterprise agencies on company closures.  Survival rates are calculated from these data and are monitored by the agencies themselves.  Forfás data maintained on the Business Information System are longitudinal time-series, so multi-year tracking can be undertaken for all agency supported firms.  The individual agencies undertake their own in-house analysis on their client companies' progress.  All of Forfás's research reports contain policy conclusions and, as appropriate, recommendations focusing on ameliorating impediments to enterprise growth.The Forfás Annual Business Survey of Economic Impact tracks value-added performance of all agency client companies on an annual basis.  Acquisitions by US multinationals can be tracked using the Forfás Business Information System which contains information on the country of origin of the company in question.  Forfás, in conjunction with my Department, is currently finalising a report on the Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation (2006-13) which will contain the most recently available data on Ireland's science, technology and innovation performance, including company spin-offs from research and development.  It is anticipated that this report will be published on my Department's website and Forfás's website within the next month.Information in relation to supports and assistance provided by the County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) is not included on Forfás's databases.  This information is, however, entered by individual CEBs onto a common database which is managed centrally by the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland.  An annual client survey conducted by individual CEBs is used to verify the number of jobs created and sustained across all CEB clients.

Mentors are senior executives, drawn from the private sector, with a proven track record in business.  They act as a confidential sounding board, advising companies on key operational and strategic issues.The Network is regularly refreshed with CEOs and senior executives with high levels of achievement and with proven skills in a range of areas.  Every effort is made to match the Mentor to the specific needs of a company.A mentoring assignment consists of 10 visits from a Mentor over a 12 month period.Companies choose a Mentor from a short-list of Mentors with the experience to meet their stated needs.The goals and objectives are established by the client in agreement with the Mentor at the start of the assignment.All Mentors sign a strict confidentiality agreement with Enterprise Ireland.EI has 291 active mentors on its Mentor Network nationally; 15 of these mentors are located in the Dublin North West area.  Since 2008, EI mentors have been appointed to 43 assignments with EI and County Enterprise Board clients located in Dublin North West.  Twenty-four of these assignments have been completed and 19 are in progress.

The assistance provided includes a wide range of one-to-one mentoring, business advice and information services.  Nationally, there are approximately 950 business mentors available to the CEB network of who 45 provide assistance to DCEB clients.  In 2010, approximately 3,150 CEB clients availed of 6,750 mentoring sessions nationally and DCEB provided 247 of its own clients with 457 mentoring sessions.Dublin CEB offers three mentoring packages as follows:Developmental Stage Mentoring: This is aimed at those who cannot attend a Start Your Own Business Programme due to personal or work commitments and wish to gain expert advice on how to get started.  This package consists of 4 mentoring visits (3 hours per visit).Crisis Mentoring: This is aimed at businesses in difficulties financial or otherwise who cannot attend training courses but require immediate help with their business.  It allows micro-enterprises (i.e. businesses employing 1-10 employees) the opportunity to meet with a business mentor over a period of 1.5 hours to discuss the clients credit control, cash flow or other urgent issues.  Additional hours may be granted if necessary.Subsidised Mentoring: This is for client businesses operating within manufacturing and internationally traded service businesses, those who have been in receipt of a grant from the Board, or those who have the potential to be assisted by the Board, and are offered between 3 and 5 sessions each of 3 hours duration.  Mentors may be appointed, at the discretion of the Board, for those businesses operating in the services sector.

Dublin North and North West represents about one third of the region covered by Dublin City Enterprise Board.  Subject to eligibility criteria Dublin City Enterprise Board can provide both financial and non-financial support to a micro-enterprise.  The forms of financial assistance, which are available, include Priming Grants, Expansion/Development Grants and Feasibility/Innovation Study Grants.  The provision of non-financial assistance includes a wide range of Programmes such as Start Your Own Business, Mentoring, E-commerce, Enterprise Education and Women in Business networks as well as the delivery of management and capability development programmes that are aimed at improving the skills of owner managers so as to assist the survival rate amongst micro-businesses and to facilitate their future growth.An Exchequer allocation of over €800,000 has been made available to Dublin City Enterprise for expenditure in 2011 on supports to the micro-enterprise sector and an additional allocation of  €250,000 will be available to the Board for further expenditure before year-end.  The details of clients utilising the available supports from Dublin City Enterprise Board is primarily a matter for that Board.  At the end of this year the Board will compile data on grant aid approved and disbursed in 2011 and also on the levels, and types, of training supports availed of by clients throughout the year.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21387	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The Jobs Initiative, which the Government announced on 10 May last, was designed to restore confidence in the economy, stimulate demand, assist those who are unemployed to get back to work and support the maintenance of existing jobs and the creation of new ones.  The measures outlined in the Jobs Initiative will be delivered across a number of Government Departments.With regard to my own Department, the Jobs Initiative included commitments to:develop a temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme to improve access to credit for business;introduce a Microfinance Fund for small business start-ups;extend to the wider public sector — excluding commercial State bodies — the requirement to pay suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice;amend the treatment of R&D expenditure in the accounts of companies;improve access by SMEs to public procurement opportunities;introduce a scheme to incentivise people to attract new jobs to Ireland.I also undertook to improve competitiveness across the economy by reducing costs and administrative burdens on business and by reforming the statutory wage setting mechanisms.  Since May, my Department has been actively working on all of these measures.The requirement to pay suppliers within 15 days was extended beyond central Government to the wider public sector, including Local Authorities and the HSE, from 1 July.  This measure is designed to improve the cash-flow of companies — and particularly small companies — who supply goods and services to the public sector.  Considerable work has been carried out on developing the temporary Partial Credit Guarantee scheme.  I will shortly be considering the scheme design, which is near completion.  Full examination of the accompanying cost benefit analysis will indicate the number of jobs the scheme is expected to create and/or retain.Work on developing the Microfinance Fund for small business start-ups is also progressing well and has involved detailed discussions with key stakeholders.  I expect to be able to make an announcement about this scheme before the end of the year.  The R&D tax credit regime was amended under the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2011, to provide greater flexibility to companies to account for the benefit of the R&D tax credit.  This change will make Ireland a more competitive location for locating R&D activities, and could therefore have a substantial impact on job creation.  In relation to improving SME access to public procurement, my Department established a Steering Group, comprising key players, to identify actions which can be taken in this area.  I will be receiving an initial progress report from the Steering Group in the coming days.The scheme to incentivise people to attract new jobs to Ireland is being managed by IDA Ireland.  The IDA is working on a framework to give effect to the proposal within current Irish legislation and EU State Aid rules.  My Department has identified potential savings of approximately €187 million per annum for businesses in Ireland arising from measures taken to reduce the administrative burden in the areas of Company Law, Employment Law and Health and Safety Law.  My Department is also leading a cross-Government programme to further measure and reduce the administrative burden   across all areas of regulation affecting business.  A project to measure these burdens across seven Departments and the Offices of the Revenue Commissioners is due to be completed by mid-2012.I am continuing to work on actions to reform sectoral wage agreements, which will help to improve the competitiveness of businesses in certain areas.  Heads of a Bill to give effect to these reform proposals have been prepared by my Department and agreed by Government.  They have been communicated to the Attorney General who has agreed to give the highest priority to drafting this legislation.  The main purpose of the Bill is to implement comprehensive reform proposals designed to strengthen the legal framework for the making of both Employment Regulation Orders (ERO) and Registered Employment Agreements (REA).All of these measures will create a more competitive environment for business and will help to maintain jobs and generate new ones.  I will continue to work with my Government colleagues to identify actions that can be taken to reduce costs in other areas to improve the competitiveness of the economy and support the creation of jobs.

These inspections arise:in response to complaints received of alleged non-compliance with relevant employment rights legislation;as part of NERA inspections focusing on compliance in sectors where there is an identifiable risk of non-compliance, andas routine inspections, as part of a control measure.Contractors working in the construction sector come within the terms of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Construction Industry where they are building or civil engineering undertakings the principal business of which is one or a combination of any of the activities set out in the Agreement.  Contractors may also come within the terms of the Registered Employment Agreement for the Electrical Contracting Industry where the main activity of the business is the performance of electrical work on a contract or sub-contract basis for a third party.The following table provides details of inspections carried out under both Agreements for the period 2010 and 2011 to date.LegislationCasesCompliance Level %Unpaid Wages Recovered2010Construction40756%213,297Electrical4060%51,946Totals44756%265,243To August 2011Construction31759%200,225Electrical3650%17,008Totals35358%217,233In the course of 2010 NERA established a dedicated team to carry out inspections on major capital public construction projects.  These included projects at T2 Dublin Airport, the extension to the M50, the M3 construction, and motorway upgrades such as the M6, M7 and M8.  Inspections were also carried out in relation to the Beaumont and St James' Hospital extensions.The T2 Dublin Airport project involved inspections on approximately 100 companies.  The results obtained indicated a high level of compliance with employment rights, with just under 10% of companies not compliant with the pay rates set out in the Registered Employment Agreement.  Arrears of unpaid wages totalling €97,358 were recovered for employees as a consequence of the inspections.NERA also carried out a major investigation into the pay and conditions of the employees of RAC Eire Partnership (a Portuguese employer, employing Portuguese workers) who were working on the high quality dual carriageway from Nenagh to Limerick.  The three companies which make up the RAC Eire Partnership were convicted of breaching Section 8(8)(c) of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 by knowingly producing false records.  They were each fined €1,000 and have lodged an appeal, due to be heard by the Circuit Court in February 2012.

Humanitarian Aid payments were made, both in the immediate aftermath of the flooding and subsequently to enable eligible households to resume living at their home.  Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation.  Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.  Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.The household of the persons concerned has been visited by an official from the Department and a report of their circumstances has been completed.  The Department has received a report from the Office of Public Works in relation to the house of the person concerned and expects to be in a position to make a decision on the case shortly.

An equivalent 1 percentage point increase in the rate of PRSI paid by employees from 4% to 5% would yield an additional €374m for the Fund.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	608	Under the supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) scheme, the Health Service Executive (HSE) may make a single payment to help meet essential, once-off, exceptional expenditure, which a person could not reasonably be expected to meet out of their weekly income.  Those who qualify are normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be ‘exceptional'.  Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice.  Thus, an exceptional needs payment (ENP) should be a single payment to meet an unforeseen and/or special need which cannot be met from a client's basic income.  The use of ENPs and every such decision must be based on the careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.However, it is not considered appropriate that ENPs should be paid towards the costs of furnishing private rented accommodation.  In this regard, my Department  has advised the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that local authorities should not seek to have long term leased properties furnished by way of ENPs.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The overall objective of the Pension system in Ireland is to provide an adequate basic standard of living through direct State supports and to encourage people to make supplementary pension provision so that they may have an adequate income in retirement.  The State already provides a funding mechanism to secure a basic income for all contributors through the PRSI system and the payment of the State Pension.  In addition the State provides significant supports to encourage people to provide for a supplementary pension income.  The cost of this tax relief is in the region of €3bn per annum.The recently published National Pensions Framework is the Government's plan for future pension reform.  It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.  Development of the framework was informed by the range of views raised during the comprehensive consultation process which followed publication of the Green Paper on Pensions.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that state support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.At present only 50% of workers have a private pension, with low levels of coverage among moderate to middle incomes a particular concern.  While the State Pension is expected to provide sufficient retirement income for the lowest paid workers, most people will have a significant income gap if they do not have some extra private pension provision.  A key element of the framework is the introduction of a new auto-enrolment system which provides a way of overcoming this problem.  It is intended that the auto-enrolment scheme will be introduced in 2014 but only if it would be prudent given the economic conditions prevailing at that time.

Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received.  Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 6 weeks from date of receipt to process claims.  Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 23 August 2011 and it is expected he will be notified of the outcome of the claim shortly.

The JobBridge scheme is an activation measure which facilitates this objective through allowing the participant to engage in a 6 or 9 month internship while maintaining their social welfare entitlements plus a €50 top up.The eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the live register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 of the previous 6 months.  In so construing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the live register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in exchequer costs over time.There are many other training, education and employment programmes that do not require participants to be on the live register such as the Work Placement Programme and the Community Employment Scheme.

This preserves the incentive to remain in employment in circumstances where the employee might only be marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming other social welfare payments.  To qualify for payment of FIS, a person must be engaged in full-time insurable employment which is expected to last for at least 3 months and be working for a minimum of 38 hours per fortnight or 19 hours per week.The applicant must also have at least one qualified child who normally resides with him/her or is supported by him/her.  Furthermore, the average family income must be below a specified amount which varies according to the number of qualified children in the family.  Current legislation provides that once FIS is awarded, it continues to be payable at the rate awarded for a period of 52 weeks provided that the person remains in employment.  The rate of payment may be increased if an additional child is born in the course of the 52 weeks.  Claimants must apply to have their payment renewed if they wish to receive payment for a further 52 weeks.At present, application forms for renewal of the payment of FIS for a further 52 weeks are issued one month in advance of the expiry of the current payment and are processed in order of the date of expiry of the current payment and not by the date of receipt of a completed renewal form.  This is designed to facilitate the collection of the most up-to-date customer information to ensure the fairest calculation of entitlement for the next 52 week payment period of FIS.  The waiting time for FIS claims being renewed is currently between 4 -5 weeks.In light of the current waiting times, the Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS.  These measures include giving priority to FIS claims being renewed in order to preserve continuity of payment, reviewing and monitoring existing processes and procedures and staffing requirements.  The position continues to be closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.While there are no immediate plans to reform FIS, the payment is one of the family and child income supports that are currently being examined by the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare, which was established in June this year.  The Group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment disincentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	638	There are no limits set by my staff or their managers in respect of the number of carer's allowance applications that are processed each day.  Staff are expected to work to the best of their ability at all times and productivity and output is managed and monitored closely.  The number of claims that can be processed in any given working day can vary as a result of a number of factors, including the relative complexity of the claims.  An appropriate balance is set between ensuring claims are dealt with as expeditiously as possible while ensuring that only those applicants who are entitled to the payment are paid.The annual number of new applications for carer's allowance received increased by almost 10% between 2009 and 2010 alone, whereas staffing resources assigned to the processing and maintenance of carer's allowance claims has not increased.  The average time taken from claim registration to award for carer's allowance from 1 January 2011 to 31 August 2011 (166 working days) was 13.4 weeks.   A total of 10,446 applications were registered in this period and 9,302 were processed in the same period.  At the end August 2011, there were 51,134 carer's allowance claims in payment.I acknowledge that the time taken to process carer's allowance claims is not satisfactory but I am satisfied that my Department is taking appropriate steps to resolve the situation.  In particular, a major service delivery modernisation project is underway to improve the efficiency of administration of the carer's allowance scheme.  This involves the development of IT functionality and associated business process re-organisation.  It is anticipated that the new system will introduce significant processing efficiencies and a quicker and more responsive service to the customer.  Accordingly, this project is being given high priority and involves a significant level of time and commitment from the relevant staff in the Department, which has had, however, a short-term negative impact on claim processing times.  The first tranche of new carer's allowance claims began to be processed under the new system in August 2011.While these new systems and processes will facilitate a significant improvement in overall processing times it should be noted that the intake of new carer's allowance applications continues to increase and that individual claims may still take some time to process.  Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.

I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that in the normal course, an appeal against the decision of a Deciding Officer must be made within 21 days of that decision being notified.  Appeals received outside of this time limit may be accepted at the discretion of the Chief Appeals Officer.  This limit is not rigidly enforced but in view of the length of time which has elapsed since the person concerned was notified of the decision of the Deciding Officer, it is considered that the acceptance of an appeal would not be warranted at this late stage.

For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers.  Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete an application form that is available for download from www.welfare.ie or by texting “Form BTSCFA”, followed by their name and address to 51909.  The timescale for determining applications for BSCFA claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant’s income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual’s application. In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  The section in the Department dealing with BSCFA claims have been in contact with the family regarding the provision of additional information which will enable them to make a decision regarding their entitlements. When the information has been provided a decision on their claim will be made.

However, from my Department's perspective the Jobs Initiative announced by the Government contains additional labour market activation measures that aim to provide unemployed people with enhanced opportunities to maintain and develop their skills and competencies while also offering the possibility of securing valuable work experience.  These measures will assist those seeking employment to maintain their links with the labour market while also improving their prospects of securing employment.A key element of that initiative was the introduction by my Department of JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme (NIS), which provides at any one time 5,000 places for internship opportunities of either 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors.  These opportunities will provide participants with valuable work experience that will develop their skills and enhance their career prospects.  As of Friday 30th September there were 1,587 interns participating on the JobBridge scheme.In addition, as announced in the Jobs Initiative, the rate of PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week is now halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.  It is hoped that this measure will create new employment opportunities and that it will also safeguard the existing jobs of low paid workers.  This measure came into effect on 2 July.  However, it is not possible to estimate the number of jobs directly attributable to this measure as the cost of employment is only one of the factors affecting job creation, albeit an important one.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I propose to take Questions Nos. 364 and 374 together.My Department operates a wide range of schemes under which a person may be entitled to receive a payment if they satisfy all of the various conditions for receipt of that payment.  The conditions for receipt of a primary weekly payment, such as Disability Allowance or State Pension, typically include experiencing a prescribed contingency, such as unemployment, disability or old age, and satisfying either a means test or social insurance contribution test.  In cases where a person satisfies the general conditions for more than one type of primary weekly payment in general they will be entitled to receive only one primary weekly payment.  For example if a person has a disability and is aged 66 years or more, they will not receive both a disability and an old-age payment. Increases in primary weekly payments may be paid in respect of a qualified adult dependant and any qualified child dependants.However, there are some exceptions to this, including the following examples:A person who has a Widow's Pension and who becomes ill may be entitled to receive a reduced rate of Illness Benefit in addition to her Widow's Pension, if she also satisfies the conditions for receipt of Illness Benefit.A person who is entitled to a State Pension Contributory may also be entitled to receive a half-rate payment of Carer's Allowance if they are caring for another person on a full time basis.In addition to primary weekly payments, a person may be entitled to a monthly child benefit payment, monthly domiciliary care allowance, an annual respite care grant and/or a weekly guardian's payment.  It should be noted that entitlement to these payments is not dependent on being in receipt of a primary weekly rate of payment and that these payments are also equally available to persons who are not dependent on welfare, provided the relevant conditions for receipt of these schemes is satisfied.  In the case of some couples, all payments may be made to one member of the couple while, in the case of others, each member may be personally in receipt some payments but not all (child benefit is normally paid to a mother).In the light of this and the fact that individual payments are delivered across a range of computer systems, it is not possible to extract the data requested in respect of total social welfare payments issued to individuals in the State.  In relation to payments at family level, unless the social welfare status of other family members, such as siblings or parents, is directly relevant to the particular social welfare claim being made by an individual, details of social welfare payments made to other family members are not associated with their claim.  For that reason, the information sought in relation to the level of payments made to families is also not available.The average payment varies across the various schemes operated by the Department.  The most typical rate paid to people of working age is €188 per week, while the most typical rate paid to people aged 66 years or more is €230.30 per week.In addition to their primary weekly payment, people may also receive secondary benefits, such as Rent Supplement or Fuel Allowance if they also satisfy the conditions for receipt of those payments.  For example, 12% of people on the Live Register also receive Rent Supplement and 16% receive Fuel Allowance.  The most typical rate of Rent Supplement is €100 per week, while Fuel Allowance is €20 per week from October to April.  The following tabular statement sets out the average weekly value of the most common social welfare payments.The majority of people receive a payment for themselves alone.  For example, 70% of people who receive Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit receive a personal rate only, the maximum rate of which is €188 per week, and 54% of these receive less than €188 per week. In general, the highest aggregate payments arise in cases where there is a large number of children and rent or mortgage interest supplement is in payment or where multiple disability and care payments are made.  These are relatively few in number.For example, there are currently 853 people in receipt of increases in their Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit in respect of 6 or more children.  These represent less than one fifth of 1% of the Live Register.  The maximum amount of Jobseeker's Allowance or Jobseeker's Benefit payable to a person with six children is less than €512 per week, while the maximum amount of Rent Supplement that could be in payment is an additional €230 per week.SchemeAverage value (€ weekly)State Pension (Contributory)245.05State Pension (Transition)243.59Widow(er)s Contributory Pension240.22Invalidity Pension227.84One Parent Family Payment224.43State Pension (Non-Contributory)213.31Illness Benefit208.29Jobseeker’s Allowance202.96Disability Allowance201.81Carer’s Allowance183.73Jobseeker’s Benefit176.75

In order for all applications from host organisations to be approved they must meet a number of criteria so as to ensure that the potential internships are of sufficient quality.  These include the following:that the internship does not allow the intern to work unsupervised;that the internship is not displacing an employee; andthat the intern accrues significant experience throughout the entire internship.In order for an internship to commence a Standard Internship Agreement must be signed by both the intern and the host organisation.  This Agreement clearly stipulates the terms of the internship and states the specific learning outcomes the intern will receive over the course of their internship.To ensure compliance with the scheme, the Department of Social Protection and the Employment Services Division of FÁS are monitoring internships to ensure that they are of sufficient quality and that both host organisations and interns are abiding by the spirit and the rules of the scheme.This involves the monitoring of monthly compliance reports that are required to be submitted by the host organisation verifying that the internship is proceeding as set out in the Standard Internship Agreement.  In addition, contact with the host organisations and interns including random site visits will begin shortly as part of this process.A ‘whistle blowing' feature has been introduced, where any individual who suspects that an internship may be in breach of the scheme's criteria, including in cases of suspected displacement or poor quality, may contact the National Call Centre. All such claims will be investigated.

The business venture must be deemed to be viable and sustainable and must not involve displacement of existing business in the same industry.  Approval normally involves an interview with the applicant to assess the viability of the proposed project, to provide advice on funding, on “Start Your Own Business” courses and other relevant aspects.  In assessing viability, cognisance is taken of the demand for, and supply of, the particular service at local level.All BTWEA applicants including those applying to commence business as an approved driving instructor will continue to be assessed on a case by case basis as outlined.

The period of secondment lasted for 9 months until the end of September 2011.  During this period these staff remained employees of the HSE but were subject to the general direction and control of the Minster for Social Protection.From 1 October 2011 these staff are transferred fully to the Department as civil servants and are accountable to the Minister in the same way as other civil servants.I have been advised that a number of staff in the CWS were employed in a temporary capacity by the HSE in 2010 for a period of six months, including some of the staff in the rent unit in question.  These contracts were subsequently extended to June 2011 from when they were gradually withdrawn.In the context of the transfer of functions from the HSE to the Department a number of Transition Managers were appointed from within the Community Welfare Service, to work with the Department of Social Protection to oversee the transfer of the service to the Department.  The relevant Transition Managers are currently in the process of examining the service implications arising from the loss of these temporary staff.The backlog of applications for rent supplement is currently being processed and it is expected that there will be no backlog by the middle of October.  Applications received up to the middle of September have been assessed for entitlement.

Relevant lands contained in Ballycroy National Park are included in the grazing package.  The package has delivered significant vegetative recovery to the SPA in this time.After the 31st October, farmers in many of the townlands in the Owenduff-Nephinbeg Complex will have the freedom to farm within an allocated sustainable stocking number range. Each farmer will be given both a minimum and maximum number of stock that can be held. For most farmers, this will result in an increase in the allowed grazing number. Column one of the following table, sets out the townlands to which this regime applies.There is a need for a continuing restriction for a further two years in identified areas of the Complex that have not recovered at the same rate as other areas. For farmers who farm in the restricted areas — whether at townland level or a part thereof — there will be a continuing requirement to off-winter and farm numbers below the undamaged sustainable stocking level.Farmers who are affected by the ongoing restriction are required to participate in an agri-environment scheme for a further two years. Columns two and three of the table outline the townlands, whether whole or in part, that will incur a continuing restriction.My Department will write to each farmer in the Owenduff-Nephinbeg Complex over the coming weeks, and in advance of the 31st October deadline, explaining the new stocking regime and informing each of them of the new stocking numbers that individually apply.Townland with sustainable stocking numbersTownland with a continuing restrictionTownland with a continuing restriction in targeted sectionsDoontruskCarheenbrackEssaunDrumminroe WestOghilleesSrahmoreBunmore WestGlendahurkBunnahownaUggoolGreenaunMallarannyOwenglassGlenthomasRosturkLetteraMeennacloughfinnyRosgallivCastlehillSrahacorickGlennamaddooDooreelTreelBellagarvaunClagganmountainTallagh (ED Ballycroy Sth)GlennamongSrahduggaunLettermaghera NorthMurreveaghLettermaghera SouthGortbrack SouthDerrycooldrinBunmore EastMaumarattaSheeanmoreSheeanKnockmoyleenTarsaghaun Beg NorthTarsaghaun Beg South

Foras na Gaeilge is an agency of the North/South Language Body, An Foras Teanga, which is jointly funded by my Department and by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland. Decisions regarding An Foras Teanga are made by both Sponsor Departments under the auspices of the North/South Ministerial Council.Following an external review completed on behalf of Foras na Gaeilge, the North/South Ministerial Council agreed that the core funding arrangements be reconfigured to ensure a more streamlined and cost effective approach. The reconfiguration consists of moving from core funding for 19 organisations to a competitive funding model based on a portfolio of schemes requiring the delivery of various strategic priorities.The present position is that the board of Foras na Gaeilge approved eight draft schemes at its meeting on 23 September 2011. These draft schemes are currently under consideration by the Sponsor Departments in preparation for the next meeting of the North/South Ministerial Council in language sectoral format on 12 October 2011.The draft schemes include a Youth Scheme with the objectives of providing a range of youth services on an all-island basis and supporting groups/clubs that provide opportunities for young people to regularly use Irish in a social environment outside the school system. It will of course be open to Cumann na bhFiann to seek funding under the proposed Youth Scheme to continue its work with Irish language youth clubs.It is important to note that pending the introduction of the schemes, it has been agreed that interim core funding will continue to be provided to the 19 Irish language organisations to 30 June 2012.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I propose to take Questions Nos. 389 and 393 together.I can inform the Deputy that there is a comprehensive regulatory framework in place that would apply in the case of any major onshore gas extraction project.  The development of such a project would require a number of statutory consents including a planning consent from An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006, an Integrated Pollution Prevention Control Licence from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), along with a Petroleum Lease, a Plan of Development consent and a Gas Pipeline consent from myself as Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  A core element of these consent processes would be to consider the potential environmental impact of any proposed development.In relation to the specific issue of the potential use of the technology known as hydraulic fracturing as part of a gas exploration or extraction project I can confirm that my Department has not received applications for nor licensed the use of hydraulic fracturing in the Irish onshore at this time.Earlier this year, onshore licensing options were awarded to three companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous (Lough Allen) and the Clare Basins.  The licensing options are preliminary authorisations and are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on desktop studies of existing data.  By the end of the option period in February 2013, the companies will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licence or relinquish the acreage.I have made it clear that in the event that any of the companies involved decide to apply for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing, the application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.  The application would then be the subject of an environmental impact assessment which would include a public consultation phase.  My Department would also consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the EPA and the National Parks and Wildlife Service before reaching any decision.In the event of a commercial discovery, any potential development for the onshore production of natural gas would require the authorisations that I have outlined above, including authorisations from An Bord Pleanála, the EPA and from me as Minister with responsibility for natural resources.It is too early to conclude whether or not these licensing options will proceed to the exploration licence stage and much too early to anticipate a commercial discovery that would potentially lead to a natural gas production project.  I am aware, however, that concerns have been expressed by some about the potential impact of the use of hydraulic fracturing and I take such concerns seriously.  In that regard I can confirm that my Department is engaging with a range of other State bodies with a view to ensuring that there is a joined up approach to regulation in this area.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	673	The licensing of radio microphones is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  I understand that channel 69 (854 - 862 MHz) is one of the channels available for radio microphone use in Ireland.  At the International Telecommunication Union World Radio-communication Conference in 2007 it was agreed that channels 61 to 69 would be made available for mobile services.  Subsequently, the European Commission in its Recommendation 2009/848/EC, recommended that analogue terrestrial TV services would be switched off in 2012, and that the above channels should be used for electronic communications services.  This switchover will facilitate the roll out of high speed mobile broadband to communities across Europe.  In complying with this Recommendation channel 69 will no longer be available for radio microphone use.  As the Deputy may be aware, Ireland's national digital switchover strategy provides for a move to all digital TV services by the end of 2012, with the existing services in the 800 MHz band (including channel 61-69) due to be switched off at that stage.I understand that radio microphone manufacturers and suppliers have been aware of the fact that channel 69 would no longer be available for wireless microphone use from the end of 2012.ComReg conducted a public consultation on this matter in April 2010.  The June 2009 decision of the UK Communications Regulator (Ofcom) to confirm Channel 38 (606 - 614 MHz) as a replacement for Channel 69 was raised during the consultation.  In light of the Ofcom decision, and noting that Ireland is a small and open economy and the potential for economies of scale of equipment manufacture and roaming of services, ComReg considered that spectrum for radio microphones should be aligned with spectrum available for radio microphones in larger European markets.Following consideration of responses received to its consultation, ComReg's view is that it would be appropriate to use a replacement channel aligned with the UK's channel for wireless microphones and it therefore announced in September 2010 that it would make Channel 38 available on an exclusive basis for radio microphone use in Ireland.  All appropriate steps for the orderly change in use of the relevant spectrum have been taken.Regarding the issue of costs for musical societies and others who use radio microphones, I am advised that while there will be a cost associated with the upgrade of radio microphone equipment, there will be no increase in the associated licence fees.  The current cost of a licence for the possession and use of programme making and special events equipment, including radio microphones, for an event is a €12 administration fee and €12 per piece of equipment.  This licence fee was established in 1986 and has remained unchanged since that time.  As the Deputy will be aware ComReg is obliged to recover its administrative costs for the management of such licensing schemes.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	674	The energy poverty strand of Better Energy aims to provide energy efficiency improvements to low-income homes unable to afford the cost of implementing such measures.  ‘Better Energy: Warmer Homes' delivers a range of energy efficiency measures to households that are vulnerable to energy poverty.  The scheme is managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and delivered through a range of Community Based Organisations (CBOs), augmented by a panel of private contractors.  Due to the mixed delivery model and variations across CBOs, the number of measures available to particular homes can vary from region to region.To date, energy efficiency improvements in over 73,000 homes have been made under Better Energy: Warmer Homes.  My Department and SEAI have a target of 20,000 homes this year of which 13,313 have been completed to the end of September, which equates to energy savings for recipients of approximately €9.4m.The measures installed include attic and cavity wall insulation, draught proofing, hot water cylinder lagging jacket and CFLs.  Homeowners are also given energy advice.In 2010, a total of 24,291 homes received works under the programme.  In 2011, 11,488 homes received attic insulation upgrades, 7,719 got cavity wall insulation upgrades and 8,913 received draught proofing upgrades.There has been a significant uptake in applications and interest in the scheme over the last three years.  The success of the scheme in 2010 led to increased awareness and demand, and a subsequent increase in waiting times.  This has resulted in SEAI having to prioritise lower cost measures in homes, in order to secure and address the maximum number of vulnerable homes this year.There are currently 11,223 homes on the Better Energy: Warmer Homes waiting list, spread across twenty-six counties.  While the waiting time for measures can vary, depending on demand and the CBOs/contractor capacity for that particular area, the typical waiting time for services would be six months.The SEAI is currently working with the CBOs and private contractors to prioritise delivery in the coming months to those homes which have been waiting for the longest period, subject to resource availability.During 2010, SEAI enhanced the IT system for capturing, scheduling and managing all applications under the Scheme.  In the original system, while homes were individually managed and tracked, the specific measures installed in particular homes were only recorded in paper files and so it is not possible within the timeframe/resources available in responding to the Deputy's Question to indicate the specific measures installed in those homes during 2010.  It is reasonable to assume however that the proportions would be broadly similar to the volumes in 2011.

The Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for RTÉ to rollout a digital TV network to the same extent as the analogue TV network.  RTÉ has informed my Department that the current analogue TV network covers 98% of the population and that its new digital TV network called Saorview will also cover 98% of the population.  RTÉ has developed a website providing information on the Saorview service including coverage information and this is available on its website www.saorview.ie.In addition, RTÉ is planning to launch a new satellite service to cover the remaining 2% of the population.  RTÉ is not obliged to provide a satellite service and is doing so as a commercial venture.  It is my understanding that, once the satellite service has launched, it will mean that Ireland will have a national TV network covering 100% of the population, for the first time.RTÉ is currently testing the satellite service to check, inter alia, coverage and other issues and to ensure the availability of satellite receivers, once it launches.  RTÉ considers that the service will be ready to launch in early 2012.

Better Energy: Homeshas  replaced the previous energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes: the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES), the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS) and the Greener Homes Scheme (GHS).  Better Energy: Workplaces is providing financial support for energy upgrade projects in the public, commercial and community sectors in 2011.  The new programme will significantly increase the scale and depth of energy efficient investments in existing buildings and facilities.One of the key objectives of the Better Energy programme is to support the construction sector and the delivery by the sector of quality installations in line with best practice.  The level of take-up and activity under the domestic retrofitting schemes to date is demonstrably supporting employment, given the labour intensive nature of energy efficiency upgrades.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) advises that over 5,800 full time jobs are being supported in 2011.  This represents an increase of some 2,000 jobs this year over the 3,800 jobs already being supported under the Schemes.Measures being supported under the Better Energy programme are those designed to deliver the greatest energy savings, thus maximising the value achieved from the Exchequer allocation.  The additional €30 million provided to the Programme for 2011 under the Jobs Initiative is being matched by a further €30 million in private sector investment.  The total capital allocation for Better Energy in 2011 is €91.4m.Recent analysis by the SEAI on the HES Scheme demonstrates that it supported over 3,000 jobs in the construction and related sectors in 2010.  With regard to the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Programme, which provides assessment, advice and training services to SMEs to reduce energy use, SEAI's analysis has found that the programme has since 2007 assisted over 1,470 companies employing the equivalent of approximately 130,000 full-time employees.

The second phase of the REFIT scheme is currently awaiting State Aid clearance.  The tariff provides a guaranteed floor price over 15 years for new renewable generators for metered electricity which is exported to the grid.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	684	I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 494 from him of the 14th   September 2011.  The position has not altered in the meantime.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	685	Ireland has been set a legally binding target for renewable energy as a proportion of all energy consumption that must be achieved by 2020. Ireland's 16% overall target as prescribed in the Renewable Energy Directive will be achieved through 40% consumption of renewables in the electricity sector, 10% in the transport sector and 12% in the heat sector.  These targets will be extremely challenging to achieve.The Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff (REFIT) is a support scheme for new renewable generation which guarantees a minimum price over 15 years.  The original REFIT scheme obtained State Aid clearance in 2007 and has been operating successfully since, with 1242MW of REFIT generation included in the 2011/2012 round as set out in the recent Public Service Obligation Decision.  Due in large measure to REFIT, the amount of renewables in electricity consumption has increased from 4.3% in 2003 to 14.6% at the end of 2010.By guaranteeing a minimum floor price, REFIT operates by ensuring that developers can pay off the debt they incur in financing a new renewable project.  New wind generation is capital intensive and the initial outlay is expensive running to millions of euro, even for small projects.  In order to be able to obtain finance from banks, a guaranteed minimum price over a period is required sufficient to finance the debt and allow a reasonable rate of return.Wind itself is free in so far as it faces no fuel costs and once the initial debt and capital investment is paid off, projects should be able to operate in the market on a competitive basis similar to any other generation in the market.  It is not intended that wind generation would be indefinitely supported.  The new generation can avail of a support scheme for a fixed period in order to be able to finance projects.  After that, they compete in the market.Any independent wind generation in the market would normally have been in a support scheme for 15 years unless they took a commercial decision themselves to voluntarily leave that scheme for the open market.  If they stayed in the support scheme for the available time, it can be assumed that their debt and the intense capital outlay on the project has been largely paid off and they should now compete in the market on a commercial basis.The scenario posed in the question is hypothetical at this stage.  At present the Single Electricity Market (SEM) is working effectively for participants.  The market price for the coming year is estimated in the 2011/2012 PSO decision at €72.72 MWh which is above the REFIT floor price for wind.  This would indicate that independent wind generation in the market should be operating satisfactorily.  All markets that have subsidies have to be continually monitored due to the potential for market distortion.  There is no indication of distortion but the Commission for Energy Regulation and the SEM Committee will continually monitor the evolving situation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I propose to take Questions Nos. 405 to 407, inclusive, together.The Digital Agenda for Europe (DAE) is one of seven flagship initiatives under the Europe 2020 strategy for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth.  The DAE focuses on the 21st   century technologies and online services that will enable Europe to boost job creation, promote economic prosperity and improve the daily lives of EU citizens and businesses in a variety of ways.  Successful delivery and implementation of the DAE in Ireland is therefore a priority of the Government.The DAE identifies seven areas for action and flowing from these are some 100 follow up actions for both the Commission and Member States.  Many of these actions cut across a number of Government Departments and my Department has taken a lead role in the coordination of reports and briefing on progress on the implementation of the DAE across Government.  There is regular contact between the relevant officials in the various Departments and plans relating to the Multi-annual Financial Framework for 2014-2020 form part of these discussions.Each of the seven areas for action has international dimensions and Ireland's progress in these areas is benchmarked against other countries' performances.  Progress is charted by the annual publication, in May each year, of a scoreboard including (i) socio-economic developments based on key performance indicators, selected on the basis of their relevance to the main policy issues, and (ii) an update of progress on the full set of policy actions identified in the DAE.  The scoreboard published in May 2011 focused on tracking individual Member State's progress on broadband take up, Internet usage and availability of eGovernment services and found that Ireland is performing reasonably well in respect of each of these areas.  The Commission also reported that progress in Ireland on the 101 actions indentified for both the Commission and Member States has been quite good with almost 10% of the actions having been completed, 80% on track and the remaining 10% delayed.As part of its monitoring of the DAE, the European Commission also undertakes annual visits to Member States.  This year's visit to Dublin is scheduled for later this month and will be led by the Head of Cabinet to Vice-President Neelie Kroes, who has special responsibility for the Digital Agenda.  The aim of the visit is to increase awareness of the Digital Agenda and to ensure that those with responsibility for its delivery, are aware of what is expected.  My officials are currently liaising with the European Commission in preparation for the visit and are making the necessary arrangements, including media coverage of the event.  Appropriate links to the EU Commission's DAE website (http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/index_en.htm) will be highlighted on my Department’s website.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	687	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) wind atlas published in 2003 provides wind data on a county by county basis for wind turbine hub heights of 50, 75 and 100m.  It was primarily intended as an information tool for local authorities in identifying areas suitable for renewable energy development within County Development Plans.  Local authorities have subsequently utilised the SEAI wind atlas as the basis for developing county wind energy strategies.SEAI is now engaged in the process of producing an updated wind atlas and has recently issued an invitation to tender based on a new technical ITT specification for an updated atlas.  This includes the minimum requirement of "Information at 20m, 30m, 40m, 50m, 75m, 100m, 125m and 150m above ground/sea level".  The choice of 150m as the maximum hub height for the exercise is in line with technology developments.  Currently commercially available wind turbine tower heights are below 150m.  Future commercially available wind turbine towers are deemed unlikely to exceed this height for some time.It is the case that both private and State owned companies, active in the commercial development and operation of wind farms hold wind speed data.  The extent to which such data can be obtained and deployed by SEAI and its consultants for the new wind atlas will depend on commercial considerations. I would however expect that all State bodies would, as far as is practicable, co-operate in the completion of this important public good piece of research.

I do not, however, have an estimate as to the energy savings/cost impact of this practice.  The issue of changing the clocks twice each year is a matter in the first instance for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.

I have no statutory function regarding the planning and construction of energy networks.The Government fully endorses the strategic national importance of investing in Ireland's electricity transmission infrastructure.  In that context the Meath-Tyrone 400KV Interconnector is a key strategic project for the economies and consumers both North and South.  It is also critical to ensuring energy supply adequacy on the island of Ireland.The Programme for Government committed to the establishment of an independent international expert commission to review within six months the case for, and cost of, undergrounding all or part of the Meath-Tyrone line.  The Commission was appointed in July and its work is underway.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	690	Connections to the electricity grid are a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation in the first instance and I have no direct role in the process.It is estimated that 4630MW of renewable generation would be required, depending on economic growth assumptions and demand projections, to ensure 40% of electricity consumption from renewable sources by 2020 and to meet Ireland's legally binding renewable energy targets under the EU Renewable Energy Directive.At the end of June 2011, there was 1459MW of wind connected to the grid in addition to 238MW of hydro generation and 30MW of other renewable generation.  A further 1000MW of new renewable generation from Gate 1 and Gate 2 have accepted grid connection offers and are awaiting grid connection.To date there have been 3 ‘Gates' providing grid connection to new renewable generation. Under Gate 1 and Gate 2, 1755MW of connection offers were made and accepted. Under Gate 3, 3900MW of offers issued to renewable generators. This amount of renewable generation is sufficient for the achievement of Ireland's target.EirGrid's GRID25 strategy sets out the high level plan for delivering upgraded electricity transmission network to 2025.  EirGrid is working to enhance the national network capacity between now and 2025 by reinforcing existing lines, deploying new grid technology and building new transmission lines.All Gate 3 grid offers have now issued.  This is an important milestone for the industry and is a fundamental on the road towards meeting the 40% renewable electricity target.  A Gate 3 Liaison Group involving the CER, EirGrid and ESB Networks, along with industry representatives, was established to assist in communication on issues relating to the Gate among key stakeholders.  The next phases of Gate 3 including project delivery of accepted offers and offer modifications are underway.The Programme for Government states that a future Gate 4 if required will be plan-led, i.e. future wind farms are to be built in locations where wind regime is best and built in numbers or in clusters to reduce cost of connection to grid.  In the event that a Gate 4 process is contemplated in due course, my Department will be engaging with the Commission for Energy Regulation, EirGrid, ESB networks and the industry on its design in light, inter alia, of the Programme for Government.

Commercial rates arrears at the year end in 2009 accounted for approximately 15% of the total collectable rates. The total collectable rates for 2009 comprised accumulated rates arrears carried forward from 2008 plus rates accrued during 2009 minus any rates write-offs or waivers for 2009. Audited information is not yet available for 2010 or 2011. The audit of the 2010 Annual Financial Statements (AFS) is scheduled for completion in March 2012.Local authorities are under a statutory obligation to levy rates on any property used for commercial purposes, in accordance with the details entered in the valuation lists prepared by the independent Commissioner of Valuation under the Valuation Act 2001.

The 457,137 tonnes of household waste collected from the kerbside by local authorities in 2009 comprised 307,185 tonnes of residual waste, 108,189 tonnes of dry recyclables and 41,763 tonnes of organics.  The comparable breakdown of the 688,350 tonnes of household waste collected by the private sector from the kerbside indicates that it was comprised of 509,530 tonnes of residual waste, 158,135 tonnes of dry recyclables and 20,685 tonnes of organics.Table F-5 of the 2009 Report provides details of a survey of the character and composition of commercial waste, which, after household waste, is the next largest component of municipal waste.Recently concluded public consultation processes concerning, respectively, a new national waste policy and the introduction of competitive tendering for household waste collection are of relevance to the issue of segregated collections of waste. The responses to the public consultation processes are being examined and I intend to bring policy proposals to Government before the end of the year.

The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by whole-time members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda Síochána, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses/civil partners. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996); electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day and full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State (the Electoral Act 1997); certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001); and electors who  because of the circumstances of their detention in prison pursuant to an order of a court are likely to be unable to go in person on polling day to vote (the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2006).The Programme for Government sets out a comprehensive range of constitutional reform measures including the review by a Constitutional Convention of the Dáil electoral system and giving citizens the right to vote at Irish embassies in presidential elections. I will bring forward proposals for change to electoral law in light of the decisions for change which may arise from these processes.

The charge is set at €200 and is being collected by local authorities.  The Act places the onus on an owner of residential property to assess his or her liability to the charge on the liability date and, if liable, to declare that liability and to pay the charge in respect of that property by the due date.The Act also provides for the application of late payment fees of €20 in respect of each month or part of a month for which the charge remains unpaid after the due period.  In addition, both the €200 charge and any accumulated late payment fees remain as a charge against the property concerned.  In this way, any charge or late payment fees due would have to be discharged in the event of the sale of the property concerned.Nationwide advertising has taken place in each year since the introduction of the charge in 2009 to ensure general awareness of the charge and the liability dates.  In tandem, local authorities have undertaken their own advertising campaigns locally.I understand that reminder notifications have also been issued to those who paid the charge last year in respect of their possible liability for 2011.Significant efforts have been made to ensure that property owners are aware of the charge and the liability dates.  However, the charge is based on self assessment principles and it is a matter for persons with a liability in respect of a residential property to declare their liability and to pay the charge by the due date in order to avoid the imposition of late payment fees and charges on the property concerned.The charge is under the care and management of local authorities and it would be a matter for each individual local authority to utilise the provisions of the legislation in the context of any undeclared properties that may be identified.

The fee in relation to candidates who apply for registration under the Technical Assessment route has now been set at €4,500.  This is a significant reduction on the figure originally proposed.I have no plans to review or amend the arrangements for the registration of Architects, as set down under Part 3 of the Building Control Act 2007, along the lines suggested in the correspondence.  The Act sought to provide for the registration of the title of Architect in order to protect consumers.  There is no question of persons who fail to register through one of the routes to registration provided for in Part 3 of the Act being allowed to use the title of Architect.

The Act sets out the obligations of tenants and landlords in the sector and the Private Residential Tenancies Board (PRTB) is the independent statutory body charged with the administration of the Act and the enforcement of those obligations, as necessary.While action to deal with anti-social behaviour is primarily a matter for An Garda Síochána, in the case of private rented dwellings landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Act.The Act, in this regard, prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies and allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only 7 days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.The Residential Tenancies Act also provides that a third party directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.  A specific condition is that the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned.Breaches of tenants' or landlords' obligations may be referred to the PRTB in the context of applications to it for its dispute resolution services.  The PRTB may then issue directions regarding those obligations in its Determination Orders and, in the event of non-compliance with the Orders, it may pursue enforcement via Court proceedings.

The Committee is meeting on a regular basis with the aim of publishing a report on progress achieved within the next 12 months. In the meantime, work is ongoing on implementation of the Report of the Advisory Group and real progress is already being made with regard to the public safety works required to improve the living conditions of existing residents on some unfinished estates.To date, my Department has made allocations totalling some €2.16 million to fifteen local authorities from the €5 million funding allocation made available to address immediate safety issues. The types of works that have been approved to date include the fencing off of unsecured and hazardous areas, capping of pipes, installation of street lighting, and other works to secure sites. My Department will be making further allocations as applications are received from local authorities and assessed.Planning authorities are also making progress in securing the co-operation of developers, financial institutions, both domestic and foreign owned, and/or bond holders, thereby obviating the need to use Exchequer resources to fund such work.

The Guidelines also state that it is not lawful to require by condition a transfer of an interest in land to the local authority or other person/body and that while elements of "planning gain" — not strictly required as part of the development, but of benefit to the public (e.g. transfer of specified land or buildings for public use) — may be accepted as part of a permitted development it is important to ensure that the decision whether to grant or refuse planning permission is not contingent on an offer of planning gain.  The Guidelines also refer to the Supreme Court ruling on planning gain in the case of Ashbourne Holdings Ltd. V.An Bord Pleanála.
I have no plans to amend the guidelines in this regard at present.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	721	The Government's new housing policy statement, launched in June 2011, will serve as the framework for a sequence of legislative and policy initiatives in the short to medium term providing a range of housing supports to those in need. Based on a number of fundamental principles and goals that will form the foundation of a substantial reform programme, the new framework for housing policy responds to current and emerging conditions in the housing sector, taking account of the dramatic cycle of rapid growth and sudden collapse in the residential property market. It will place greater emphasis on:choice;equity across housing tenures; anddelivering quality outcomes for the resources invested.In terms of the delivery of social housing, the policy statement clearly identifies that the main focus in terms of supports provided by Government will be on meeting the most acute needs — the housing support needs of those unable to provide for their accommodation from their own resources.  The financial parameters the coming years rule out a return to very large capital funded construction programmes by local authorities.  Nevertheless, the Government is committed to responding more quickly and on a larger scale to social housing support needs through a variety of mechanisms, including through increased provision of social housing.Delivery of social housing will be significantly facilitated through more flexible funding models such as RAS and leasing, but the Government is also committed to developing other funding mechanisms that will increase the supply of permanent new social housing. Such mechanisms will include options to purchase, build to lease and the sourcing of loan finance by approved housing bodies for construction and acquisition. There is also obvious potential, across a range of housing programmes, for the Government's objective of sourcing and providing suitable residential units, for use as social housing to be aligned with the commercial objectives of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA). A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  A report on this year's national assessment of the need for social housing support was published recently by the Housing Agency.  The overall results indicate that at 31 March 2011 just over 98,000 households were in need, compared with over 56,000 in 2008.   Detailed information on both assessments is available on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.

Under section 60(3) of the Waste Management Act 1996, the Minister is precluded from exercising any power or control in relation to the performance in particular circumstances by the Agency of a statutory function given to it under the Act.Major waste facilities are subject to stringent environmental standards set out in national and EU environmental and waste-specific legislation. The Agency has significant oversight and enforcement powers in order to safeguard the environment and to ensure compliance with waste licence conditions. I am satisfied that a rigorous and risk based enforcement regime, including emissions monitoring, inspections and audits, is actively pursued by the Agency. The classification of waste as hazardous, or otherwise, is a matter for the Agency.As regards the disposal of bottom ash at the landfill facility concerned, I note that Louth County Council has stated that such material will be accepted only with the approval of the Agency, which will conduct rigorous testing and monitoring to ensure the material is suitable.

Section 15 of the Act provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. These conditions are that the applicant must -be of full agebe of good characterhave had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four yearsintend in good faith to continue to reside in the State after naturalisationhave, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows—(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include—periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the Stateperiods granted for the purposes of studyperiods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act, 1996.The matters raised by the Deputy come under the umbrella of the Minister's absolute discretion. Each application for a certificate of naturalisation is examined on its own merits and the Minister decides, at his discretion, whether to grant or refuse the application based on all the information provided.A foreign national who satisfies the conditions for naturalisation may make an application for a certificate of naturalisation at any time. There is no provision that disqualifies a person from lodging an application.

There are presently no plans to extend its brief beyond those institutions.As the working arrangements of the committee are a matter for its chairperson, Senator Martin McAleese, and he is independent in this matter,  I am not in a position to report on what progress is being made.  I am aware however that they have held meetings with the religious congregations, representative groups of the women who resided there, and other interested parties.

However, I would point the Deputy to the website of the Office of the Refugee applications Commissioner (www.orac.ie) where detailed statistical information of the type requested is available in PDF format, allowing for easy download and printing.I would alert the Deputy to the fact that the number of recommendations in any year refers to the year in which the recommendation was made and not necessarily the year in which the application was received.

I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

In some instances the information is not readily available (such as in the number of civilians working in each Garda Station over the last 15 years) and its retrieval would involve an unjustifiable expenditure of resources.  The total number of civilian staff employed in An Garda Síochána from 2003 to 31 August 2011 is as set out in the following table:DateNo of Civilians (WTE)31/12/20031,06231/12/20041,11931/12/20051,16131/12/20061,28231/12/20071,68831/12/20082,09931/12/20092,10431/12/20102,09831/08/20112,096

The court also ordered compensation to be paid to the injured party, and I understand this was done.  I am also informed that subsequently civil proceedings were settled before coming to court.  In the circumstances, there is no action open to me in relation to this matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	740	In my reply to the Deputy's earlier question on 14 September 2011 (Question No. 613) I summarised how the administrative arrangements for this category of migration operate.  Those administrative arrangements are set out on the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service website, www.inis.gov.ie.  The rules are quite generous. For example,  my Department understands from a perusal of the UK website of the organisation referred to in the Deputy’s question that in the UK non-EEA volunteers fall under the category of “charity workers” and can stay for only a maximum period of 12 months.  As I pointed out in my previous reply the three year rule applies only to those volunteers who entered the State on or after 1 January 2011.  Volunteers already lawfully in the State up to 31 December 2010 may have their immigration permission renewed annually subject to certain conditions.  I have no plans to make an exception to the general rules applicable to lay volunteers.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the area referred to by the Deputy is within the Clontarf Garda Sub-District.  Local Garda management is unaware of any specific complaints regarding speeding in the area.  Any such offences coming to the attention of An Garda Síochána will be investigated and dealt with appropriately.  The area is the subject of regular patrols by uniform and plain clothes personnel, including the Community Policing Unit, Mountain Bike Unit and local Detective and Drug Unit personnel, supplemented as required by the Divisional Crime Task Force and Traffic Corps personnel.  A member of the local Community Policing Unit is designated for the area.Local Garda management closely monitors and keeps under review patrols and other operational strategies in place, in conjunction with crime trends and policing needs of the communities in the area, to ensure optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible Garda service is provided to the public.  Current policing plans in the area are designed to address issues of crime and public order offences.  Community policing is a central feature and core value of policing policy, and current policing strategies are predicated on the prevention of crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	742	I propose to take Questions Nos. 470, 479 and 485 together.I wish to make it clear at this juncture that no decisions have been made in relation to the closure of Garda stations.  The Commissioner is currently carrying out a review of the entire Garda organisation in the context of ensuring that the Force will be in a position to match the deployment of resources to its policing commitments as effectively as possible.  Clearly, an examination of the opening hours and in some cases the viability of Garda stations will form part of this review.  The Commissioner may have to consider in appropriate cases whether a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Gardaí out on patrol instead of in a station.  I look forward to receiving the Commissioner's proposals, which will be aimed at maximising the efficiency of the Garda Síochána, and prioritising the resources available to operational front-line policing services.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	743	Lotteries (other than the National Lottery) are regulated under Part IV of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956 to 2003. Various types of lottery are catered for, two of which require, in the case of section 27, a permit from a Garda Superintendent or, in the case of section 28, a licence from the district court. The remainder, in sections 23, 24 and 25, are subject to the provisions in those sections and to Part IV generally but do not require permits or licences.  The Act specifies certain matters to be satisfied in relation to each lottery, including matters of good character. In addition, Section 50 provides for regulations on the keeping of accounts for lotteries and related issues. Two sets of regulations have been made, SI No. 212 / 1961 and SI  No. 32 / 1966. The regulations do not address, nor are they required to, the issue raised by the Deputy, namely the winding up of a lottery organised by a community group.I think it appropriate to distinguish between a lottery, which must be conducted in accordance with the 1956 Act, and the internal arrangements of the organisation organising it, including arrangements about the winding up of the organisation.  Those arrangements are more likely to be dealt with in the organisation's Rules or similar instrument or by consensus among the membership.On the question of updating the current law on gaming, including lotteries, the Deputy may be aware that   I recently announced my intention to prepare new legislation to modernise our laws on gambling; that term covers both gaming and betting. I hope to be in a position to present a full draft of the legislation to the Government in the Spring of 2012, for its approval.

As the Deputy is no doubt aware, this Government reduced the number of staff in a Minister's Private and Constituency Offices from 16 to 12.  In the case of Ministers of State, staffing numbers were reduced from 12 to 8.

The Deputy may wish to note however that all contractors undertaking works, which are paid for out of public monies, are obliged to be tax compliant and have to produce a current tax clearance certificate before payment can be made for such work.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	749	I am informed by the Garda authorities that a number of court decisions have determined that there is a duty on An Garda Síochána to seek out, retain and preserve evidence, the purpose of which relates to the due administration of justice.  A number of provisions of the criminal law, including section 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 and section 35 of the Criminal Procedure Act 2010, also relate to the retaining or seizure of evidence.  Section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 provides for the detention, removal, storage and subsequent release or disposal of a mechanically propelled vehicle.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in November, 2009.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.Question No. 479 answered with Question No. 470.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	753	The Prison Education Service is delivered in partnership with the Department of Education and Skills which provides an allocation of 220 whole-time teacher equivalents through the Vocational Education Committees (VECs).  Other agencies also contribute including the Open University and the Arts Council.  The aim is to deliver a broad high quality flexible programme of education that helps prisoners cope with their sentence, achieve personal development, prepare for life after release, and establish an appetite and capacity for life-long learning.  Programmes are adapted to take account of the diversity of the prisoner population and the complex nature of prison life including segregation requirements and high levels of prisoner turnover.For example, educational courses and curricula which are based on individuals participating in one or more subject areas for an academic year and then sitting examinations are only appropriate for a small number of prisoners. The Junior and Leaving Certificate courses are available but increasing numbers of prisoners require a more flexible curriculum which has multiple entry and exit points that take account of prior educational attainment. FETAC accreditation is therefore widely used with assessment by portfolio compilation.  All Prison Education Centres meet the quality assurance standards demanded by FETAC.Courses and programmes can be broadly categorised as follows:—Basic Education, including literacy, numeracy, English as a second language and communications;Creative Arts, notably music, sound recording and production, drama, art, craft, stone work, creative writing, film production and photography;Technology, including woodwork, woodcarving,  computer-aided design, information technology and horticulture;General Subjects, incorporating history, languages, geography, home economics and English literature;Life Skills: personal development, interpersonal skills, anger management, parenting, child care, addiction studies, driver theory, food hygiene etc; andHealthy Living, notably physical education, sports, fitness and recreational activities, health education, diet and nutrition.Considerable attention is paid to co-ordinating courses with the Work and Training programme and every effort is made to engage prisoners in educational activities.  Each participating prisoner is assessed to identify particular educational strengths and areas where supports may be required and an individual educational plan is agreed.  During 2010, approximately 35% of the prison population attended classes.  The rates of participation in each prison is presented in the table below:Institution%Arbour Hill55Castlerea26Cloverhill18Cork45Dóchas50Limerick41Loughan House69Midlands41Mountjoy14Portlaoise53Shelton Abbey62St Patrick’s Institution40Training Unit36Wheatfield25Average all prisons35The Inspector of Prisons recommended in his 2010 Annual Report that an independent audit be commissioned by the Irish Prison Service examining the type of education being provided, the relevance of such education, the numbers being educated and the value for money being provided.  This audit is currently under way and focuses, among other things, on the capacity, range, level and type of education provision (including adult basic education), on participation levels, and on ways in which demand for education can be further developed and met.  When the review is completed, the findings will be assessed in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills and the relevant VECs.

Local Garda management is satisfied that an appropriate number of Gardaí is deployed to police the events.  Local Garda management will continue to liaise with the local authority and other stakeholders involved in these events.  The policing requirements considered appropriate for each event will remain under ongoing review.

An investigation file was submitted by An Garda Síochána to the Director of Public Prosecutions for directions.  The Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions directed no prosecution against the person concerned and his computer equipment was returned to him.  I am further informed that a complaint has been made by the person to An Garda Síochána and the matter is currently receiving attention.

I will communicate further with him when the information sought is to hand.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	757	I can inform the Deputy that every possible effort is made to allocate sufficient resources to the Legal Aid Board notwithstanding the current economic difficulties.  The assignment and allocation of staff and other resources is entirely a matter for the Board which is an independent entity.I am aware that the LAB has seen a very significant increase in demand for general legal aid services in the last number of years and particularly since the economic downturn.  While regrettably this has given rise to increased waiting times in many areas for matters that are not prioritised, I am advised that prioritised matters continue to receive an immediate or near immediate service.  Prioritised cases include those involving domestic violence, children at risk of going into care, child abduction and critical dates that are close to expiry.Notwithstanding the pressure on its resources in the current economic circumstances, the LAB is fully aware of the need to work more efficiently within existing resources and that further monies cannot be allocated without taking them from elsewhere.  To this end, the LAB has taken a range of innovative measures with a view to addressing the increasing demand for services in a such a resource constrained environment, including:—more use of the private practitioner schemean ‘advice only' service where applicants are likely to have to wait in excess of four months for a substantive appointmentan integration of the delivery of all services to ensure the effective deployment of resourcesthe introduction of a pilot integrated mediation initiative involving the LAB co-operating with the Family Mediation Service and the Courts Service.  This will offer alternatives to litigation in the Courts to applicants for legal services and is a better and more cost effective means of resolving family law disputesthe creation of specialist units for medical negligence and child-care services.the development of a new legal case management systemthe use of a very limited exemption from the moratorium in relation to a small number of temporary front-line service delivery positionsthe operation of a work placement scheme in co-operation with FÁS, and the utilisation of a small number of solicitors who have sought experience on a voluntary basisthe utilisation of the new National Internship SchemeThe allocation of further resources to the LAB is not under consideration given the many demands on my Department's Vote and the obligation to further reduce Government expenditure.  Due to budgetary constraints, there is a requirement for all Government Departments and Agencies to be more efficient, effective and innovative and to deliver services with fewer resources.  I am satisfied that the Legal Aid Board is making determined and intelligent efforts to allocate its resources in a manner designed to meet the increasing demands for front line services and I support their innovative approach to achieve these aims.

An investigation file was submitted to the Law Officers who directed no action against any third party.  During the course of the examination, certain shortcomings were identified and, while they did not affect the outcome of the original investigation, steps were taken to rectify these issues and ensure adherence to best practice in the future.The questions referred to by the Deputy, which were addressed to the Garda Commissioner in 2006, related to operational policing matters for which the Commissioner has responsibility.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	764	In 1997 agreement was reached with the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) on a new manpower policy for the Defence Forces. This policy, applying to personnel enlisted after 1 January 1994, provided that service for Private Soldiers would initially be for five years with the option to be extended to a maximum of twelve years. In 2004 PDFORRA submitted a claim under the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for a further review of the terms of service applying to personnel enlisting in the Permanent Defence Force after 1 January, 1994.   A set of criteria was agreed with PDFORRA to provide longer careers for those who enlisted post 1994 while continuing to address the Government's objective of having an appropriate age profile to meet the challenges of a modern defence forces.The criteria require that any person re-engaging after 12 years service must be able to continue to operate at their current level both at home and overseas on an ongoing basis. Re-engagement is subject to the individual soldier meeting specified criteria in regard to physical fitness, medical category, successful completion of military courses of instruction, service overseas and conduct ratings.The maximum service period for these personnel is as follows:—Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Corporal (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may not serve beyond 21 years service.Enlisted Personnel, in the rank of Sergeant (and equivalent Naval Service rank), may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of fifty years and to the age of fifty-six in all higher ranks.My Department does not have information in relation to the provisions applying to members of the British Armed Forces in this regard.

The following arrangements currently apply:Lump sum amounts up to €200,000 are paid free of tax. They are also paid free of the Universal Social Charge (USC).The portion of a lump sum between €200,001 and €575,000 is taxed on a ring-fenced basis at 20%. (This means that no tax credits or other tax reliefs can be set against this portion of the lump sum.) No USC is chargeable.Any amount of a lump sum in excess of €575,000 is taxed at the individual's marginal rate of tax (credits and other reliefs are available). In this instance, USC is chargeable on the excess.The threshold figures detailed above are lifetime limits with lump sums paid on or after 7 December 2005 aggregating with any later lump sums in counting towards those thresholds.  As with all taxation measures, these arrangements are subject to any review that might occur as part of the annual Budget and Finance Bill process and that is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Finance.

The issue of the closure of barracks no longer required for operational reasons to effect necessary savings will, however, be considered shortly by Government.  Various commissions, reports and studies back to the 1990s identified barrack closures as a fundamental requirement towards improving military effectiveness and efficiency. Since 1998 a total of ten barracks have been closed under two barrack consolidation programmes. A total of €84.98 million has been realised from the disposal of six of these barracks and part of another. The moneys received from the sales of such properties have been reinvested in equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.I wish to ensure that all decisions made and resources utilised are focused on maximizing the capabilities of the Defence Forces and ensuring their continued operational excellence. I am also anxious to ensure, in so far as is possible, that the Government is not compelled by fiscal and budgetary constraints to effect any substantial reduction in the current number of personnel in the Defence Forces.

As part of this process, prior to a contract being placed, various criteria must be fulfilled by prospective tenderers, including provision of audited accounts, evidence of compliance with the Revenue Commissioners, Security Clearance, etc.  Furthermore, payments to contractors are subject to a valid tax clearance certificate being in place, providing continued assurance that contracts for public works are carried out by tax compliant contractors.

This application was selected for a Cross Compliance inspection which was carried out on the 12th of December 2009.  During the course of the inspection breaches were recorded relating to 4 separate Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs). Issues were recorded in relation to Food Hygiene, specifically the maintenance and management of a dairy/milking parlour which led to a penalty of 5% being recorded under that SMR.There were breaches recorded relating to the Identification and Registration of Sheep involving the failure to maintain a flock register. Breaches involving the Identification and Registration of Cattle were sufficiently serious to be deemed intentional and resulted in a 20% penalty being recorded. These breaches concerned multiple animals and included breaches involving Passports, Tagging and failure to notify movements to the Cattle Movement and Monitoring System, in addition to the absence of a Bovine Herd Register.  Breaches were also recorded in relation to Nitrates, specifically the failure to minimise the creation of soiled water and the inadequate management of storage facilities for livestock manure.As the breaches of Nitrates were a repeat of similar offences reported to my Department following inspections in 2007 and 2008, which had resulted in penalties of 20% and 80% respectively, the breaches in 2009 were deemed intentional and a penalty of 100% was recorded meaning no direct payments would issue for that year. The person was informed of this decision on the 16th of February 2010. He was also informed of his right to request a review of the decision; no such request was made.  As payments under the 2009 Disadvantaged Area Scheme and Single Payment Scheme had already issued my Department initiated a process to recoup these payments and a letter issued from the Accounts Department of the Single Payment Unit informing the person of the overpayment and how it could be repaid.

During the course of the inspection breaches were recorded concerning 3 separate Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs). There were breaches recorded relating to the Identification and Registration of Sheep involving the failure to maintain a flock register and an incomplete Census return. As these were a repeat of breaches uncovered at the 2009 inspection they were deemed intentional and a penalty of 15% was recorded.Breaches involving the Identification and Registration of Cattle were also a repeat of breaches recorded during the 2009 inspection and a 15% penalty was recorded. These breaches concerned multiple animals and included breaches involving tagging, the failure to notify movements to the Cattle Movement and Monitoring System and the absence of a Bovine Herd Register. Further breaches were also recorded in relation to Nitrates, specifically the failure to minimise the creation of soiled water, the inadequate collection of livestock manure, the failure to adequately manage the storage facilities for livestock manure as well as the spreading or storage of farmyard manure on land during the prohibited period.As the breaches of Nitrates were a repeat of similar offences recorded following inspections in 2007, 2008 and 2009 they were deemed intentional and a penalty of N2 was recorded meaning no direct payments would issue for 2010 or 2011.  The person was informed of this decision on the 16th of February 2010. He was also informed of his right to request a review of this decision; no such request was made.As a result of the payments made to the person in 2008 and 2009, which have yet to be fully recouped, and the interest accrued on these overpayments, some €17,163.38 remains outstanding. Should the person choose not to repay this money it will be deducted from payments made to him from 2012.  In the meantime interest will continue to be charged on the amount owed at the rate of 3% per annum in accordance with Statutory Instruments (S.I. No 13 of 2006) European Communities (Recovery of Amounts) (Amendment) Regulations 2006.  The person named retains his right to seek a review of these decisions.

These measures apply to all herds in the country and there are no separate arrangements for dairy herds.My Department is satisfied that these measures constitute an effective eradication programme, as evidenced by the significant reduction in disease levels over the past decade. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.53% in 2000 to 4.65% last year and reactor numbers in 2010 were, at 20,211, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950's.  Reactor numbers and herd incidence have continued to fall in 2011.However, my Department monitors and reviews the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease from all herds in the country, including the dairy herd.  Ensuring that there is a robust testing regime in place and that disease is not spread from infected herds to clean herds are key factors in achieving the goal of eradication and my Department will continue to review and make changes to these elements of the programme as deemed necessary. Any changes will be made following consultation with the farming organisations.I am very pleased with the reduction in the incidence of TB in recent years. It is essential that this improvement continues.

I have discussed this with other EU Agriculture Ministers including most recently with my French counterpart in a bilateral meeting in Paris last week.Possible options include the front-loading of the remaining quota increases, a reduction in the super levy, a further reduction in butterfat correction levels, or a kind of EU flexi-milk arrangement which would operate provided EU production overall was within quota.However, I have to emphasise that the Commission has consistently resisted attempts to reconsider this issue, as it has resisted attempts to revisit the outcome of the 2008 CAP Health Check agreement in an overall sense. It is also the case that only a minority of Member states is likely to be adversely affected by the current quota restrictions, and therefore persuading a qualified majority to agree to an adjustment of the current regime represents a significant challenge.Irish dairy farmers must therefore continue to operate on the assumption that no further changes will be made to the milk quota arrangements agreed in the context of the CAP Health Check. This is extremely important, and I cannot emphasise the point strongly enough. Milk deliveries in the 2010/2011 milk quota year were only just below quota, and deliveries in 2011/2012 to date are significantly ahead of quota.With a super levy an increasing likelihood as we head towards quota abolition, all dairy farmers must carefully plan their production activities and pay close attention to the limitations imposed by the quota regime if they are to avoid potentially ruinous super levy fines.

The realisation of this target will be dependent on the achievement of maximum efficiency at production and processing levels. The report’s recommendations focus on changes needed in milk processing, in on-farm competitiveness, in the transfer of technology and knowledge to dairy farmers, and in R&D and marketing. I myself chair the High Level Implementation Committee, whose function is to direct and take whatever action is needed to successfully implement Food Harvest 2020. The Dairy Expansion Activation Group has got the implementation ball rolling in the dairy sector. Earlier this year it produced a Road Map setting out 55 actions that are required to achieve the 50% increase in milk production. These are broken into four categories, namely, on-farm production, efficiency in the milk processing sector, the development of market opportunities and general agriculture policy. Dr. Sean Brady, who chaired the Dairy Expansion Activation Group, is continuing to facilitate the process of implementation and to monitor progress. All of the stakeholders are being encouraged to discharge the responsibilities assigned to them, and the response is being monitored and reported upon.The Deputy will also be aware that "Milestones for Success", the first annual progress report on the implementation of Food Harvest 2020, was published in July. More than 90% of the 215 initiatives have been commenced. I know that a lot of effort has already been made by all stakeholders, and that there is a strong commitment to delivering results. I believe a good start has been made, and I am confident that the momentum generated by that good start will be carried forward.

Under the Directive each Action Programme must specify periods when the land application of chemical and organic fertilisers is prohibited.This issue was raised last year in submissions received during the public consultation process that formed part of the review of The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations, commonly known as the ‘Nitrates Regulations'.  A Nitrates Review Expert Advisory Group was established to assess the technical merits of all submissions received. In the light of the Expert Review Group Report and subsequent discussions with the European Commission, the existing regime of closed periods for land-spreading was not changed. The second Nitrates Action Programme runs until the end of 2013 and this issue will be looked at then in the context of a review of the Programme.I must stress that all counties have restrictions on the spreading of slurry under the Nitrates Action Programme. Under the Programme the national territory has been sub-divided into three regional zones by reference mainly to soil type, rainfall and length of growing season. All three zones have a period that prohibits the spreading of organic fertilisers starting on 15th  October each year. The period for Zone A extends to 12 January, Zone B to 15 January and Zone C, which includes Cavan and Monaghan, to 31 January. The situation is similar in Northern Ireland with the land application of organic fertilisers, excluding farmyard manure and dirty water, prohibited from 15 October in any year to 31 January of the following year.These restrictions have been included in the Regulations following a review of the previous provisions, submissions from the public and examination by the Nitrates Review Expert Advisory Group. I believe that the overall nitrates package of measures, including the renewal of the derogation, is the best package available to allow for the further development of the farming sector while also protecting our valuable water resource.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	801	As part of the reform of the EU sugar regime in 2006, a temporary scheme for the restructuring of the sugar industry, was introduced with the aim of reducing EU sugar production in order to comply with WTO and other international obligations. The scheme provided an incentive for sugar processors to renounce sugar quota and dismantle the associated sugar processing plant and it provided compensation for affected stakeholders.Greencore, the sole Irish sugar processor and holder of the Irish sugar quota, decided to avail of this scheme and accordingly the company renounced the quota and dismantled the last remaining sugar factory at Mallow in compliance with the conditions of the scheme.The total compensation package negotiated in November 2005 in the context of the reform of the EU sugar regime, as modified in 2007, was worth €353m to Ireland. All elements of the package have now been implemented.There is no mechanism under the present Regulations which are in force until 30 September 2015 which would allow for the re-instatment of the sugar quota for the growing of sugar beet in Ireland for the production of sugar. The EU Commission's forthcoming proposals, due to be unveiled later this month should provide a clearer view of the prospects for the future direction of this regime after 2015.I and my officials have met with two separate groups who have conducted feasibility studies into the possibility of establishing a sugar/bioethanol facility. Any venture to develop a combined sugar/bioethanol production facility would have to be a commercial proposition financed in total by investors and interested parties.I am prepared to support any endeavour which would enable this country to again grow sugar beet for sugar/bioethanol production, provided it is based on solid commercial criteria and makes sound economic sense.

This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility and Cross Compliance inspection.During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection discrepancies were found which resulted in the claimed area for the Single Payment Scheme of 75.46ha being reduced to a payable area of 37.7ha.  As the total entitlements held are 93.29 and the difference between the area claimed and the area found is greater than 50% no payment was to issue for 2010.  In addition an administrative fine equivalent to the difference between the number of hectares determined (found) and the number of hectares declared for the crop group concerned will be offset against any EU payment due to the applicant made during the course of the three calendar years following the year in which the determination was made.The person named was informed of this decision on the 26th of November 2010. He was also advised of his right to seek a review of this decision and to have the outcome of any such review appealed to the Agriculture Appeals Office.

All other foreshore licensing functions are now the responsibility of the Minister for Environment, Community and Local Government.All applications received are referred to my Department's scientific/technical advisors in the first instance.  Waiting times for applications for foreshore licences vary depending on issues such as the nature and complexity of the proposal which is the subject of the application which in turn impacts on the duration of this assessment process. The number and complexity of submissions received on foot of the public consultation process is another factor which can affect the waiting time.  Applications received can range from applications for site investigations to, for example, construction of large piers intended wholly or primarily for fishery related activity.  Given the diverse nature of applications received it is not considered that an overall average waiting time for applications would be particularly relevant.   While applications are not formally categorised, applications are examined on a case by case basis, and priority is given to proposals which are of significant economic, or social importance.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	822	The live export trade provides alternative market outlets for cattle producers. There are two main components to the live export trade; calf shipments to the Continent and the movement of forward stores and finished cattle to the UK. Data for the period from January to 24 September 2011 shows that overall live exports are almost 112,000 head or 39% below the levels achieved during the corresponding period in 2010. Exports to Great Britain decreased by 43% on those for the same period in 2010 while those to Northern Ireland are down by 46% and those to all other destinations fell by 37%. Italy, the Netherlands and Spain — the main Continental markets — recorded decreases of 27%, 44% and 53% respectively. With regard to the categories of cattle exported, calves which account for around half of the total decreased by over 67,000 head or 43% on 2010.The main reason underlying the current decline in live exports is the ongoing strength of domestic cattle prices. As part of its remit to support the agri-food industry, Bord Bia is working to facilitate the live export trade as customer demand and economic conditions allow. In this regard, it provides up-to-date market information to exporters in the form of weekly livestock reports and bi-monthly updates from each of the major markets, as well as regular communication with market offices. In addition, Bord Bia's market offices promote contact with new customers, organise promotional events for Irish livestock, arrange inward buyer visits, attend livestock trade fairs and forecasting meetings, commission market research and organise credit rating and language interpretation services as appropriate on behalf of the sector.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	826	The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 as the statutory body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving. The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.As the Deputy may be aware a number of children focused services, including the National Educational Welfare Board, have been brought together under the responsibility of my Department. The rationale for incorporating the NEWB under the new Department's responsibility is to improve engagement with other agencies and services working with children and families and to deliver a consistent approach in the development of policy and services aimed at children, including those who have difficulties participating and benefiting from the education system.Each year all schools in Ireland receive guidance from the NEWB on reporting of student absences and expulsions. In addition, NEWB provides guidance to schools as required under Section 22 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 to assist schools to develop appropriate local strategies and measures for the purposes of fostering an appreciation of learning among students and encouraging regular attendance at school. Schools are required to submit four Student Absence Reports at intervals during the school year and one Annual Attendance Report at the end of the academic year. The Annual Attendance Report is submitted by each school when it closes for the summer and gives overall absence information for the entire school population for that school year. This report is also available to parents. As part of this report, schools are asked to give the total number of students who were suspended during the school year.The 2003/2004 school year is the first school year for which validated annual attendance data is available from the Board. This data is a benchmark for school attendance and now constitutes a national data base which can be used to monitor non-attendance, expulsion and suspension in all of the country's primary and post-primary schools.Schools are also obliged to report absences to the Educational Welfare Officer (EWO) in specific circumstances such as where a child is absent for 20 days or more, where a child is expelled or suspended for six days or more cumulatively, or where the school generally has concerns about the educational welfare of a child. This obligation exists to protect children's educational welfare as evidence shows that poor school attendance is linked to early school leaving.Data for the school year 2010/11 is in the final stages of collection from schools. Analysis of attendance data in respect of the 2009/10 school year is currently being carried out by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of the NEWB. All data gathered needs to be checked for accuracy before publication and data for the year 2009/10 is currently undergoing this detailed verification process. I am advised by the Board that it anticipates the report for 2009/10 will be available in the coming weeks.Tables (i) to (iii), inclusive, set out the relevant data for the period 2003 to 2009. As the Deputy will note the data has remained relatively stable for the last number of years.  Policy interventions and supports take time to positively modify behaviours and alter patterns so a significant change in overall attendance between any one year and the next would not be expected. I have requested the NEWB to forward the 09/10 data directly to the deputy when available.The question relating to the total number of pupils in the primary school system for 2010/11 is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills. However, his Department advises that there are 509,652 young people enrolled at Primary level for the 2010/2011 school year.

The amount of revenue that could be collected in any 12 month period would  depend on a number of varying factors, such as retiring salary and qualifying service. As such it is not possible to give a definitive answer. However, an indicative figure for a civil servant at my Department earning  €54,000 per annum with 40 years qualifying service would suggest a tax payment of €1,200 from their lump sum payment on retirement based on the Deputy's scenario.

The Group was established in March 2010.  The Group is composed of Ms Norah Gibbons and Mr. Geoffrey Shannon.The Group commenced its work in March 2010 and it is intended that the Group's Report will be presented to the Minister who will lay the document before the Houses of the Oireachtas and publish it.  The Group is being asked to examine existing information in respect of deaths of children over the period of 1 January 2000 to 30 April 2010. It should be noted that the terms of reference of the Group require that:In relation to children other than those who died from natural causes, examine existing reviews/reports completed by the HSE (or by others on behalf of the HSE) and, based upon this information, provide an overall report for publication which:i. Provides on an anonymised basis key summary information regarding each  child and the circumstances leading up to their death;The IRGCD has indicated that it will finalise its report in the near future.

The group referred to by the Deputy applied for capital grant funding in 2008 but, due to the economic downturn, and following a review of capital expenditure, the previous Government decided to close the programme to new grant applications.  The group were informed of this outcome in early 2009.Capital funding continues to be available to my Department in 2011 but this is required to meet existing NCIP capital grant commitments. I am aware that the group recently raised the issue of funding with Pobal, who assist my Department with the administration of the capital funding programme, and they were advised that there is no funding available to my Department for new applications.  You will be aware that all programme funding is considered in the context of the annual estimates and budgetary process and it is not possible in advance of these discussions to determine when funding will become available.

These are the Special Projects for Youth Scheme (SPY), Young People's Facilities and Services Fund Rounds 1 and 2 (YPFSF) and the Local Drug Task Force (LDTF).Having visited the Sphere 17 Regional Youth Service last month I am very much aware of the valuable services provided by it to young people aged between 10 and 21 years in such areas as Bonnybrook, Darndale and Priorswood across Dublin 17. Sphere 17 RYS provides young people with a wide range of programmes and activities, seven days a week which reflect their needs, interests, capacity and age profile.In light of budgetary constraints, the youth budget requires careful management with a focus on prioritising front-line services and protecting jobs and pay in so far as is possible. Officials from my Department have met with representatives of the youth sector on an ongoing basis to ascertain the sector's views on how best to minimise the impact of budgetary constraints with a view to consolidating, in so far as is practicable, the progress made in previous years. Every effort will be made to notify the various youth work organisations and administering agencies of their 2012 allocations as speedily as possible. My Department has also exhorted all the national youth organisations and vocational education committees to revisit their level of expenditure to determine where cost savings can be achieved.

The latest Annual Report published by the HRB on Activities in Irish Psychiatric Hospitals and Units is for 2009.  However, the HRB has indicated that of the 19,619 admissions to psychiatric hospitals and units in 2010, 966 had a diagnosis of Other Drug Disorders.  There were 6,266 first admissions and of these 412 had a diagnosis of Other Drug Disorders.  There were 176 first admissions under 25 years of age, 26 of which had a psychotic disorder occurring during or immediately after drug use (usually within 48 hours).  This does not include late-onset psychotic disorders (with onset more than 2 weeks after substance use).  There were no first admissions under 25 years of age reported for residual or late-onset psychotic disorder associated with psychoactive substance use.

It is expected that the pilot phase will conclude later this year with the expectation that it will collect live data for analysis from early 2012.It should be noted that the adult mental health services ensure an immediate response to cases identified by GPs as requiring emergency assessments.  Arrangements are also in place to liaise with the mental health services where such an emergency arises out of hours and a patient presents to a hospital Emergency Department.

The facility has evolved in that time and continues to provide valued support to a vulnerable group of people living with HIV or AIDS including substance misusers.  There are currently 18 beds in Rowan Ward; 3 of which have over time become long stay.  There is no intention to reduce the current number of beds at this time.The HSE have undertaken a review of the purpose and function of Rowan Ward to ensure that the service is being delivered in accordance with sound clinical governance.  The families of those who are long stay in the ward are being communicated with in respect of the review.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	849	The Health Service Executive has operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as the one referred to the Deputy in Westmeath.  I understand from the question that the HSE has responded to the Deputy on the issue raised and I am not able to say when these restrictions will be lifted.From a national perspective the Deputy will appreciate that all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures and any decisions taken by the Executive must have regard to this and the current moratorium on the recruitment of nursing and non-nursing staff.  Each HSE area, including the Local Health Office for Longford-Westmeath, has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be re-allocated to ensure maximum service provision.  In particular we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment.The Department is currently reviewing the provision of public residential care in the light of the need to meet national standards and regulations, local demographic pressures and public and private provision.  The review will serve for a platform for discussion and will inform the development of an overall strategy on how the HSE should continue to provide this service in future in view of current budgetary and other pressures.  The review must also be seen in the light of the wider health reform programme to which the Government is committed, and the position of social care services in a future health service.  I should make it clear, however, that, providing quality and safe care for our long stay residents will have to remain at the heart of these considerations.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	850	In relation to the case referred to by the Deputy I understand that on 25 July an application was received, on behalf of the person in question, in the offices of HSE West for treatment under the E112 Treatment Abroad Scheme.A report has been obtained from the HSE on the application for funding, and the subsequent appeal of the initial decision.  Unfortunately the decision of the Executive, which the appeals officer has upheld, is that the application does not meet the conditions of the scheme and funding cannot therefore be provided.I understand that the application was not approved due to the fact that a treatment plan is available locally in Galway and the view of the treating Consultant Psychiatrist is that this treatment plan should be availed of in the first instance. I have been informed that the person in question was admitted to the Psychiatric Unit in her area on 26 August 2011 following self presentation and is now under the care of a Consultant Psychiatrist.  It is the Consultant Psychiatrist's view that while the person in question could benefit from admission to the therapeutic service in the UK, there are treatment services available here from which the patient would benefit and these should be used in the first instance.  The Consultant Psychiatrist will continue to consider the request for treatment abroad whilst the person in question is under the care of their team.

There is, by agreement, a long standing arrangement whereby Dublin City Council provides emergency ambulance services in Dublin.The development of pre-hospital emergency care in both Ireland and the UK has involved forging closer links with the wider health service, given the benefits that such services can bring to communities in terms synergistic opportunities with primary care, e.g. treat and refer to GPs and treat and discharge at scene. From a strategic perspective, such an approach can make a positive contribution to reducing attendances at emergency departments, improved bed management and reduced ED waiting times.The HSE is aware of the potential benefits of closer working relationships with Local Authority fire services. Initial discussions have taken place with a view to progressing this agenda.

Alternatively the HSE, if the client so wishes, applies the notional rate of interest earned to determine the income.

This change is to be viewed as a temporary measure and will be reviewed in 2012.The change in the opening times of the Monaghan MIU is the direct result of the current budgetary and financial position facing the health system.  The HSE has reviewed other possible options to save money and/or increased revenue, but has concluded that they would not generate sufficient savings in the short term. Following a detailed analysis of this issue, the HSE has estimated that total full year savings of almost €400,000 would be generated with this alteration of opening hours.I have emphasised to the HSE the need to ensure that the impact of such changes to patients is minimised and that all changes are fully communicated.  I understand that arrangements, which include staff redeployments and a communications plan, are being put in place by the HSE in relation to this change.The HSE does not anticipate that this change will have an effect upon the number of patients awaiting admission to an in-patient bed in Cavan General Hospital as the patients treated in the MIU are patients with minor injuries only and would not require admission to an in-patient bed.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	859	In relation to the De Puy ASR recall, the HSE has identified approx 3,500 patients who have received the affected implants — across 16 public and 14 private Hospital sites nationally.  All patients were invited for a recall assessment to clinically assess their current medical status with regard to their implant.For the vast majority of patients, this was a precautionary assessment, and in a small percentage of cases, there was a requirement for further treatment and possibly surgery.13 revision surgeries have been carried out, with a further 22 scheduled at this point in time.Given the nature of hip replacement care, revisions will continue to be carried out over the coming years, based on individual clinical status and need.  Patients who are experiencing pain are prioritised as a matter of course.Any required care is being provided to patients without cost to them. De Puy has committed to cover the reasonable and customary costs of testing and treatment associated with the recall.With regard to the case referred to in the Deputies question, the person has co-existing medical conditions which required attention.  Whilst the treating surgeon is currently on annual leave, the treating site has confirmed that a date has been scheduled for the person's surgery and the patient will be contacted shortly in this regard.The HSE is anxious to liaise with any affected patient with regard to any queries arising, to ensure that any emerging issues are promptly addressed.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	861	The 2006 National Cancer Control Strategy set out the rationale for the restructuring of cancer services in our hospitals. It recommended that cancer centres which each serve a minimum population of 500,000 should be designated by the HSE, and that Ireland required about eight such centres. Accordingly, in 2007, the HSE designated eight hospitals as cancer centres, University Hospital Galway being one, and established the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP) to implement the Strategy.Since then, the NCCP has put significant additional resources into cancer service provision at Galway. Rapid Access Clinics for both lung and prostate cancers have opened at the hospital, as part of a national initiative to improve access to diagnosis and multidisciplinary care for these common cancers. Galway's symptomatic breast unit has expanded in recent years and latest data available from the HSE confirms that the hospital is fully compliant with the target two-week waiting time for urgent referrals to its breast unit and also with the 12-week target waiting time for non-urgent referrals. Radiotherapy services are also provided at Galway since 2005.Should the Deputy wish to raise a specific issue concerning the provision of cancer services at Galway, my Department will arrange for it to be investigated by the HSE-NCCP.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	867	I propose to take Questions Nos. 608 and 609 together. The future of the hospital at Mullingar is assured in the context of the HSE's Clinical Care programmes and there is no proposal to change the current arrangements of services. The priority for the HSE, the hospital and myself is to continue to provide appropriate, safe and high quality care for patients.The Emergency Department of the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar is an extremely busy department with 32,000 attendances in 2010 and an average of 95 presentations each day since the beginning of this year.  The hospital is part of the Ambulance By Pass Protocol for Navan Hospital. The hospital has taken steps to manage the increase in attendances within existing resources by utilising the "Use the Right Door" campaign which focuses on the various "doors" of access to health advice and services and to GPs and out of hours services, ensuring that patients obtain the most appropriate treatment in the most appropriate setting and in a timely manner.Activity targets have been set within the context of controlling elective workloads and conversion of further inpatient work to day case work.  The hospital also continues to focus on maintaining their patient "length of stay" which is one of the most efficient in the country.  This is achieved by hospital and community staff working in a multi-disciplinary way.Although emergency presentations and admissions are demand driven the hospital is concentrating on reducing emergency admissions by increasing access to specialist skills and senior clinical decision making available in its Medical Assessment Unit, ensuring patients are treated in the most appropriate location and avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions.The hospital is addressing the issue of cost reduction through restructuring programmes to enable the maintenance of agreed service levels within its budget allocation for 2011.  The Hospital has identified and is working on delivering efficiencies in both clinical and non clinical areas in order to maximise service levels.

A new community nursing unit is under construction on the St. Mary's care centre site.  It is expected that patients from St. Marie Goretti and St. Bridget's wards will transfer to the new facility by the end of March 2012.  Work has started on the renovation of the existing admission unit at St. Loman's Hospital, which will provide for a 20-bed replacement unit for St. Enda's ward.  These works are due for completion towards the end of 2012.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	872	Medical card applications for persons in the 16 to 25 age group are subject to the provisions of the Health Services (No. 3) Regulations, 1983 (S.I. No. 381 of 1983), in particular, the following:The services provided under section 58(1), 59(1) and 67(1) of the Health Act, 1970 shall not extend to persons between the ages of 16 and 25 who are dependants of persons who do not have full eligibility for the services under Part IV of the Health Act, 1970, save where it is considered by the Chief Executive Officer of the appropriate health board that such a service should be made available to such a person in order to avoid undue hardship to that person.These regulations set out the statutory basis for the assessment of applications in respect of persons in this age category   under the Medical Card/GP Visit Card National Assessment Guidelines 2009.  Persons aged 16 to 25 years who are eligible for Medical Cards or GP Visit Cards are:Persons who are dependant on holders of a Medical Card or GP Visit Card;Financially independent persons whose means are within the income guidelines; andCases of undue hardship where it would be unduly burdensome to provide general practitioner or Medical and surgical services.Applicants aged 16 to 25 are deemed to be financially independent if they are in receipt of income equivalent to or greater than the current rate of Supplementary Welfare Allowance. Financial independence may be achieved through student loans, education grants, employment, self-employment, part-time employment, savings or social welfare payments.  Persons aged 16 to 25 years who are ineligible for Medical Cards or GP Visit Cards are:Persons who are financial dependents of persons who are not holders of a Medical Card or a GP Visit Card; andFinancially independent persons whose income does not fall within the Medical Card/GP Visit Card guidelines.The following additional information was provided under Standing Order 40AWhere the applicant for a medical card considers that the HSE has acted incorrectly in assessing their income, it is open to that person to appeal that assessment.  The applicant is notified in the decision letter from the HSE of the right of appeal, and is provided with the contact details for the Appeals Office.  The appeals system is independent of the original decision maker.  It is open to the applicant to make an appeal in writing or by email.  In making an appeal, an applicant may provide the HSE with any additional information which will assist in the re-appraisal of the case.With regard to the issue of hardship, it is open to the HSE to issue a medical card to any person, including persons in the 16 to 25 years age range, where the HSE is satisfied that it would cause undue hardship, or be unduly burdensome, for a person to provide for the costs of services covered by a medical card.  In assessing hardship, the HSE will consider all the circumstances of an applicant's case, including the nature and extent of their personal, medical or social circumstances.With regard to the reference to the HSE's "practice", as noted in my reply, the HSE is obliged, in assessing applications for medical cards in respect of persons in the 16 to 25 years age range, to comply with the legislative requirements of Statutory Instrument No. 381 of 1983.Finally, in relation to the presumption of other income, I raised this issue some weeks ago with the HSE following a similar case that was brought to my attention. The HSE replied on Wednesday of this week by outlining the assessment criteria. I intend engaging further with them on this issue.In that context, if the Deputy has a specific case in mind I would be grateful if he could provide me with details and I will ensure that the decision is examined.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	880	The Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has responsibility for investigation of adverse reactions to medicines. Since the first authorisation of Gardasil, the Irish Medicines Board (IMB) has continuously monitored its safety. This monitoring includes review of global safety data in addition to national experience with use of Gardasil. Continuous monitoring of medicines and vaccines involves evaluation of potential safety issues in relation to reported adverse reactions and from all other sources including periodic safety update reports, clinical trials, published literature, epidemiological and non-clinical studies conducted anywhere in the world. This monitoring by the IMB adheres to the relevant European guidance and legislation, Directive 2001/83/EC, Regulation (EC) 726/2004, Volume 9A of the Rules Governing Medicinal Products in the EU and European Medicines Agency (EMA) guidance on the Conduct of Pharmacovigilance for Vaccine.The IMB has received a total of 458 reports of adverse events associated with use of Gardasil up to 30 September 2011.  The majority of the reports have been consistent with the expected pattern of adverse effects for the vaccine, as described in the product information and include cases of malaise, headache, dizziness, syncope (fainting), fatigue, skin and injection site reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms. Anaphylaxis is a very rare known adverse event following immunisation (AEFI) which can occur following any immunisation. The adverse events observed are within the acceptable limits for AEFI as outlined in the Gardasil Summary of Product Characteristics. The EMA in conjunction with its European partners including the IMB recently reviewed Gardasil and has confirmed that there are no safety concerns regarding the vaccine.

Given the size of the health sector, it was agreed that it would benefit from its own sectoral implementation body.  There are similar implementation bodies, each with their own independent chair, in place for each of the sectors (defence, justice, local authority, education and the civil service).Mr. Pat Harvey was nominated to the position of independent Chair of the Health Sector Implementation Body, on an agreed basis between the staff representative bodies and management.  This nomination was ratified by the national level Implementation Body.  Mr. Harvey was selected on the basis of his considerable experience in health sector management and industrial relations.  His fee in respect of this role is paid by my Department.I have asked the HSE to provide the Deputy with the information sought in relation to the other five individuals referred to in the question.

The configuration of services in the area has been under continued review and reorganisation for some time in the interest of improving access and quality of service to the local population.The HSE is currently carrying out a collaborative study and consultation process across the three sites.  The work of this study will feed into the current development of a framework for smaller hospitals that initially encompasses St Colmcille's Hospital.  It is my intention that details of this framework will be published, when it is complete, in order to reassure the public that the future of smaller hospitals is secure and to set out clearly what services can and should be delivered safely by these hospital in the interest of better outcomes for patients.  The issues raised by the Deputy will be considered within this context.

However, the terms of the scheme will be reviewed in the context of the Government's proposals for Universal Health Insurance and free GP care at the point of delivery.Under the Drug Payment Scheme no individual or family pays more than €120 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines.  The scheme significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.In addition, people who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card.  In the assessment process, the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family.   Those who are not eligible for a medical card may still be able to avail of a GP visit card, which covers the cost of general practice consultations.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	891	The VHI is accountable to me under the terms of the Voluntary Health Insurance Acts. As Minister for Health I have statutory responsibility for governance matters relating to the VHI, such as Board appointments and the receipt of its annual report and accounts.  While owned by the State, the VHI is a not-for-profit company operating in a competitive market.  It would be inappropriate for me to interfere in the day to day operations of, or the commercial decisions of any health insurance provider, including the VHI, which is required to compete fairly within the market.I understand the Deputy has in mind the provision of services for individuals with eating disorders.  However, each private health insurance provider in the Irish market has the right to determine how much capacity in any particular area is purchased by them to deliver the services required by their customers.  Health insurance contracts must provide a certain minimum level of cover prescribed in the relevant regulations.  Beyond that, it is not the role of the Minister for Health to direct private health insurers as to which services or facilities they cover.  This is a commercial decision for the insurers themselves.Section 2 of the 1996 VHI act (amended in 2008 to remove the requirement for the consent of the Minister) allows the VHI to ‘make and carry out health insurance related schemes as it may think fit' and other provisions relating to entering agreements with service providers.   The Health Insurance Authority (HIA) is the statutory regulator of the private health insurance market and insurers must comply with the HIA in terms of registration, compliance with minimum benefits, risk equalisation returns and open enrolment.In relation to the provision of services for individuals with eating disorders, the national policy document for mental health ‘A Vision for Change' sets out the framework for the development of mental health services generally.  HSE services for people with eating disorders are embedded in the Community Mental Health Teams and with Primary Care.The HSE has developed a Mental Health in Primary Care accredited training programme for primary care practitioners with Dublin City University. The skills included in this programme are designed to enhance the capacity of primary care to recognise, assess and treat a range of mental illnesses within the primary care setting. As individuals with eating disorders frequently present to the primary care practitioner with complications of their condition, early intervention at this level greatly improves outcomes.Community based Adult Mental Health Services receive referrals from Primary Care and provide assessment and treatment to individuals with eating disorders.  Child and Adolescent Mental Health Teams provide a similar role for their cohort of referrals.  Where the individual's psychiatric or medical needs are more acute, in-patient admission is offered within the local psychiatric services or acute medical care where necessary.Following the recommendation of the Consultant Psychiatrist, the HSE can and has worked with service providers in the independent sector to provide specialised care, on an in-patient and/or an out-patient basis.  In a limited number of cases, referrals to specialised eating disorder services in Dublin or the UK can be clinically recommended and supported in appropriate circumstances subject of course to the necessary resources being available.

Such arrangements were unique to the greater Dublin area. In all other former Health Board Areas, patients used either their medical card or Drug Payment Scheme card to access psychiatric medicines.In 2009, the HSE decided to bring the arrangements for the supply of medicines to patients attending mental health outpatient clinics in the greater Dublin area into line with those operating in the rest of the country. These changes were introduced on a phased basis, starting on 1 October 2010 when medical card holders in the HSE Dublin North East area requiring psychiatric medicines were referred to their own GP for a GMS prescription. This arrangement is being extended to the Dublin Mid Leinster area from 1 November 2011. At the same time, Drug Payment Scheme cardholders will be required to pay for their prescription up to the co-payment threshold of €120 per month. Medical card holders will continue to receive their medication free of charge, subject to any applicable prescription charge.  These arrangements will be kept under review.There is no provision in the Mental Health Act 2001 concerning the reimbursement of medicines for patients availing of mental health services.

The Road Traffic Act 2010 will change the permissible blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limits by providing for a reduction from 80 mg of alcohol (per 100 ml of blood) to 20 mg for learner, novice and professional drivers and a reduction from 80 mg of alcohol (per 100 ml of blood) to 50 mg for all other drivers. The equivalent levels in urine and breath will apply. I propose to commence the relevant sections of the 2010 Act shortly.In determining the appropriate BAC limits, in the context of the 2010 Act, advice and expertise was sought from the Road Safety Authority. That advice was informed by a number of issues, including known driver behaviour, past offending rates, enforcement practicalities, best international practice and research as well as analysis of data held by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety.  I am satisfied that these limits and the associated penalties are appropriate to the category of drivers concerned. However the limits are being under review and can be changed in the future if appropriate.

I am informed that the proposed Regulations relate only to vehicle standards, not to the vehicle's use or the driver, and specify the standards to be applied to new motorcycles. It presents a legal framework for the type approval and market surveillance of mopeds, motorcycles and quads, which will replace the existing Framework Directive 2002/24/EC.Contrary to suggestions that have been made, the proposed Regulations do not in fact include provisions for mandatory wearing of high visibility clothing by motorcyclists, banning older motorcycles from urban areas or changes to driver licensing.The proposed Regulations are designed to improve the safety of those riders who belong to a vulnerable road user group and who account for the highest fatality and injury rates among all road users. The Regulations also are anticipated to result in reduced vehicle emissions for these types of vehicles, which currently are not reducing in line with other road vehicles such as cars, buses and goods vehicles. The Regulations should not result in any significant cost implications for motorcyclists.The Road Safety Authority has recently published information on the proposals on their website and is inviting feedback before the end of October.

This expenditure is broken down as follows:€ millionSurveys, Studies & Route Selection2.97Design, Railway Order/Oral Hearing Preparation13.86PPP - Legal, Financial, Commercial & Insurance Advisors0.97Restructuring Costs0.10Total17.90This expenditure relates solely to that incurred by the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) since I am not in a position to provide information on expenditure by agencies outside the remit of my Department.Acting on the advice of the National Transport Authority (NTA), last month I instructed the RPA to withdraw its application for a Railway Order from An Bord Pleanála as funding for the project will not be available for the foreseeable future. All planning works for the project have now been cancelled.This does not mean, however, that construction of Metro West has been cancelled indefinitely.  Its implementation will be examined again at a future date when the country's finances have improved.

This Study assessed a range of corridors in the Cork Metropolitan Area and found that only one corridor, a west-east corridor from Ballincollig to Mahon, via the City Centre, has the potential passenger flows of sufficient magnitude to justify a rapid transit public transport solution.The report stated that the "BRT Preliminary Capital Development Costs” would be in the order of €306 million. However, that stated figure excluded some key elements such as land acquisition, legal and planning & development costs.  Given the constraints in available funding, sufficient funding will not be available to permit the development of the proposed BRT system in Cork during the period of the new national development plan 2012 -2016 which is currently being prepared.However, as an initial step, it is intended that the National Transport Authority, which acts on behalf of my Department in relation to the provision of public transport infrastructure in the regional cities, will examine the potential for developing this corridor as a high quality bus-based transport route in conjunction with the local authorities. This could, subject to funding availability, facilitate its possible transition to a BRT corridor at a later stage.

Its primary functions are the development of quality tourism product, domestic tourism marketing, tourism standards, enterprise support, capability building and human resource development for the tourism industry.Tourism Ireland Limited, was incorporated in December 2000 and is accountable to the North South Ministerial Council. The primary remit of the company is to promote the island of Ireland as a tourist destination in overseas markets.The close working relationship between the organisations is strengthened by the CEO of Fáilte Ireland sitting on the Board of Tourism Ireland.  The CEO of Tourism Ireland regularly attends the meetings of the Fáilte Ireland board on an observer basis.  The Fáilte Ireland Authority also meets the Board of Tourism Ireland to discuss issues of mutual interest. Furthermore, the CEOs and senior management teams in Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland work hard to foster closer working relationships between the agencies.The State agencies concerned constantly review and monitor their operations to avoid any duplication and explore opportunities for synergies and sharing of services. I am aware that they are already working to share services, where possible, with a view to driving economies.Shannon Development serves as the Regional Tourism body for the Shannon Region. Dublin Tourism, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fáilte Ireland, is the regional tourism body for the Dublin region. Its structure, together with the structure of regional bodies for the other tourism regions, is an operational matter for Fáilte Ireland. I have referred this aspect of the Deputy's Question to Fáilte Ireland for direct reply.  Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	912	In May 2011, I announced a €75 million boost for Transport related projects under the Governments jobs Initiative. This included €60 million to maintain and repair regional and local roads across Ireland damaged in the last two severe winters and €15 million for traffic management & improvements to rail stations, pedestrian crossings, footpaths, bus networks and sustainable transport projects. In addition since May's announcement, I have provided an additional €3.9 million for the Jobs Initiative Smarter Travel package from savings identified on other measures within my Department.It is estimated that this level of funding would support employment for at least 1,000 people.The Jobs Initiative also introduced a 9% VAT rate (from July 1st  ) in support of the Tourism sector, on a range of services including hotels and restaurants. In addition the Government halved employers' PRSI for those on modest wages. These measures are of considerable benefit to tourism businesses, lowering their cost base, and allowing them to offer a more competitive product. The industry continues to play its part in passing on these cost reductions and boost both domestic and visitor business.At this stage it is too early to assess the impact of these measures on employment in the sector. The most recent figures from the CSO relate to Quarter 2 of 2011 and so do not measure the impact of the Jobs Initiative. It will be later this year/early next year before we can properly form a view on the effect of these measures on employment.The Jobs Initiative also included a number of other Tourism initiatives.  A three-pronged plan to promote tourism by increasing access capacity included abolishing the travel tax, significant rebates of passenger charges for extra passengers brought in by airlines, and more targeted co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, DAA and the airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland. While the abolition of the travel tax has been deferred pending a further review of the situation next spring, the Government is allocating a significant share of the monies raised from the travel tax to fund additional cooperative marketing.

It should be noted that this marks a considerable reduction from the levels of staffing permitted under the previous government where there were a maximum of six staff in each Minister of Government's office.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	914	The monetary value of capital funding awarded by my Department directly to companies outside the jurisdiction was: 2008 — €535,000; 2009 — €86,000; and 2010 — €1,260,000.In percentage terms this accounted for a very small element of the overall capital programme for my Department at less than one tenth of one per cent in all cases.I am not in a position to quantify the amount of capital funds that may ultimately have been received by companies outside the jurisdiction through awards made by agencies of my Department or, for example, as a result of sub-contracting arrangements in the case of construction projects. Therefore, I have referred the Deputy's question to those agencies for direct response. Please advise my office if you do not receive a response within the next ten working days.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	916	The power to decide the speed limit applying to individual roads within an area rests with the relevant road authority, i.e. City Council, County Council or County Borough Corporation, in consultation with the Garda Commissioner, and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in the case of national roads. Under Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act, 1994, the relevant road authority may make bye-laws in respect of the application of certain speed limits to specified public roads in their administrative areas. Road safety is a major consideration in the application of speed limits and enforcement is a matter for the Garda Síochána.My Department issued guidelines in January of this year to all local authorities and the onus is on local authorities to take them into account in relation to the speed limits to be set for all roads in their area of responsibility. The purpose of these guidelines is to provide advice and guidance in relation to the making of speed limit bye-laws by county and city councils for the purpose of applying special speed limits. After taking the guidelines into account it is considered best practice for local authority officials to advise the elected members of their respective councils on what a suitable speed limit regime should be for different roads in their areas of responsibility. For new roads the local authority will have the relevant information on the speed for which the road was designed.

The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual projects, including  the N71 Upgrade programme, is a matter in the first instance for the NRA in accordance with Section 19 of the Roads Act.Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-10-04 00:00:00	Prelude	918	I announced last June that I had secured Government approval for additional funding to be made available to all six regional airports in 2011, including Galway and Sligo, reversing the cut in funding made by the last Government. However, the Government also decided that it would not be able to provide operational or capital funding to Galway or Sligo airports from 2012 onwards.This decision is necessary to make best use of scarce Exchequer resources and to ensure the efficient use of taxpayers' money. The Government is aware of the implications for both Galway and Sligo Airports in making this decision. Clearly, in the current economic difficulties, it is not business as usual and unpopular decisions must be made. I believe that in continuing to support the other four regional airports beyond 2011, we will ensure that Ireland has a sufficient network of regional airports, while taking into account significant improvements in the road network, shorter journey times by road and rail and the reduction in passengers flying domestically.Galway and Sligo Airports, as privately owned entities, were encouraged to use the opportunity provided by the additional funding in 2011 to engage with various parties, including business interests, investors and local authorities, to secure their ongoing viability in some form.  My Department is working with those airports ensure the close out of Exchequer support in an orderly way.
