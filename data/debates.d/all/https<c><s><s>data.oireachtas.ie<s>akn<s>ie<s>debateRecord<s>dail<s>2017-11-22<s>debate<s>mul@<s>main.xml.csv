#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	The Minister is aware that the new capital plan is scheduled to be published before the end of this year. A commitment was given by the previous Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, that the Minister would publish the Department's submission to the capital plan. It is very important that we have a debate in the House on the priorities and where the money will be invested in infrastructure over the coming years. I hope the Minister will enlighten the House this morning on what are his priorities.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	I thank the Deputy for the question, which is very important, particularly in view of the mid-term capital review and the ten year capital plan. The Deputy is aware that following the completion of the mid-term review of the capital plan, my Department secured the largest increase in capital funding of all Departments out to 2021 and the end of the current capital plan. Total capital funding over the next four years will now be €7 billion for transport, €200 million for sport and €169 million for tourism, and those funding levels represent an increase of €1.2 billion, or 20%. This allows for a significant acceleration of previous plans and makes a great number of projects possible across the country. In public transport, the priorities are to address congestion and the emerging capacity constraints in our public transport system across our cities. The additional funding secured will allow for the roll-out of projects such as BusConnects, which will overhaul and improve our bus infrastructure; the city centre rail re-signalling project, which will improve speeds on mainline rail in the greater Dublin area; a new central traffic control centre for the national rail network; infrastructure maintenance across the national rail network; additional Luas capacity with additional trams and longer trams on the Luas network; and continued planning and design for the new metro north. Our roads development programme will see a total of €2.4 billion invested over the next four years. The bulk of the expenditure in the programme will be directed towards road maintenance and renewal and meeting contractual commitments under the road public private partnership programme. As regards regional and local roads, there will be a significant number of additional road upgrade schemes aimed at addressing safety, employment generation and support and urban regeneration to be advanced. The improved funding levels will also allow for greater investment in cycling and walking routes in our main cities. The threefold increase in funding I secured will allow for planning and design work with commencement of an intensive construction programme in 2019. In terms of climate change, I am setting aside €35 million over the next four years to back new ideas that will help decarbonise the transport sector, including pilot initiatives for low emission technologies. As part of a package of measures and incentives to accelerate the take-up of electric vehicles, I have secured funding for the National Transport Authority to allow it to introduce an electric vehicle taxi grant In the area of tourism, I was pleased to announce a €30 million increase in funding available to support greenways development, while an additional €2 million is being allocated to promote digital investment in tourism marketing, which is important in the context of Brexit and the decline in visitors from Britain.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I thank the Minister. He failed to acknowledge that in 2010 Ireland recorded the lowest proportional capital spend in the EU on infrastructure. In fact, in 2015 only 53% of the necessary maintenance was carried out. He spoke about increased capital secured in the 2018 budget, but this is still 31% below what is needed just to keep our infrastructure in a steady state condition. We need to be far more ambitious than talking about keeping our infrastructure in a steady state condition. We need to plan to ensure the right investment is put into the right infrastructure. We do not know, for instance, the status of the DART underground. The Minister spoke about new projects that will be carbon friendly. What is the status of the DART underground? It is critical infrastructure which will enable us to connect all of our rail lines. Only two weeks ago, the chairperson of Irish Rail came before the committee. He outlined the gaping need for additional funding if Irish Rail is to make the necessary investment in infrastructure to ensure we encourage more people to use public transport such as Irish Rail. When will the Minister publish his submission to the capital plan so we can have a real and meaningful debate in the House on the issue and not just six minutes on a priority question?

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	I thank Deputy Troy for his response. He is right in all the facts which he has given. We had the lowest proportion in 2010, but the infrastructure was in a very precarious state.As the Deputy said, we first need to tackle the business of the steady state. There is no point in introducing new and extravagant infrastructure when the roads are not up to par. I have spelled out very clearly some of the formidable and ambitious projects. We not just have ambition but will also deliver. The Deputy has seen what we said about BusConnects, which is a very imaginative programme. That programme will stretch over a number of years because of the amount of money we secured in the capital plan. The programme will revolutionise traffic in Dublin. I have spelled out clearly the additional Luas capacity that is being introduced. That will sort out to a great extent the problem of the Luas on that route in Dublin. We are simultaneously addressing the legacy issues of the recession and the legacy issues of the steady state being inadequate, which will take until at least 2021, while at the same time initiating new imaginative capital projects which will go a long way to sorting out the problems, which are mostly problems of prosperity.

#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	While I may have said the figure I quoted related to 2010, it was in 2015 that Ireland recorded the lowest proportional capital spend in the EU. The Government is not being ambitious. When the European Commissioner for Transport, Ms Bulc, appeared before the Oireachtas committee she criticised the lack of engagement by the Government in seeking funding from the EU to make the necessary investment in infrastructure. Someone stuck in the car coming in this morning, stuck in a crowded bus or having to stand on a train that is not on time, will not be too enamoured by the response the Minister has given me this morning. A six-minute dialogue and debate on this matter is not sufficient. In advance of the publication of the new capital plan, will the Minister secure sufficient time in this House to have a real debate on how we can access funding from the EU to ensure we make the investments needed in our public infrastructure today?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	I constantly answer questions on this, not just here but in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport. I think the Deputy will find that no other Minister has attended so often to answer questions specifically on the transport budget and other ancillary issues. I am willing to do so at any time. I am willing to converse with the Deputy, to receive delegations and engage about it at any stage. If the Deputy does not believe it is ambitious, he should say so. I have said that in both the tourism and transport sectors we will spend large sums of money on infrastructure in the coming years. We have seriously ambitious plans. The Deputy should tell me if there is no imagination in the BusConnects project. There is imagination along with €800 million in funds to be spent there. The Deputy should tell me if there is no ambition in the tourism area and we can then address issues that are dear to the Deputy's heart. Additional money will not only be spent on the greenways, but also on new brands on tourism as well as going into well-established projects there.

#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	Is the Minister in favour of on working towards a policy of full accessibility on public transport including private companies that provide public transport services? Will he consider putting such a policy on a statutory footing? Is a policy of an increased number of unmanned train stations and DART stations is to be introduced? Does he favour the introduction of a policy whereby disabled passengers are not required to make travel arrangements up to 24 hours in advance of travel?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I will try to keep to the time. The Acting Chair might interrupt me because it is quite difficult to keep an eye on the clock at the same time.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	Yes, I will.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	My Department's high-level policy goal for accessible public transport is embodied in the concept of Transport Access for All. This policy is based on the provisions of the Disability Act 2005 and related Government strategies, in particular the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, NDIS, launched by Minister of State with responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, in July last. The NDIS includes a number of transport-related actions, for which my Department, the National Transport Authority, NTA, and-or passenger transport operators have lead responsibility for implementing. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for policy on and overall funding of public transport. The four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost €28 million for the accessibility retrofit programme for the period 2018 to 2021. This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation for accessibility under the capital plan. It relates to accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure and is additional to the investment in new infrastructure which, as a matter of course, is now designed to facilitate accessibility. The additional funding will facilitate the continued roll-out of the programmes to install accessible bus stops, upgrade train stations to make them accessible to wheelchair users and provide grant support for the introduction of more wheelchair accessible vehicles into the taxi fleet. The NTA, which has functional responsibility for promoting the development of an integrated accessible public transport network, and passenger transport operators are working to progress the transport actions under the NDIS. These actions are aimed at addressing the issues that the Deputy has raised. Irish Rail hopes to commence a pilot project on the DART early in the new year aimed at reducing the period of advance notice for disabled passengers from 24 to four hours by guaranteeing staffing across grouped stations and ensuring flexibility to enable staff to move between stations to provide assistance. The NTA has also commenced a tender competition for medium-distance bus/coach-type vehicles which would allow unbooked wheelchairs to board with normal ramp access on Bus Éireann PSO services.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The Minister did not say whether he would favour putting a policy of full accessibility on a statutory footing. Of 144 Iarnród Éireann stations, 34 are unmanned and there are plans to increase that number. While I got a response to a parliamentary question on the matter yesterday, the company had stated it would review its staffing arrangements. There is no indication in its response and certainly none in the Minister's on the additional supports that will be made available for people with disabilities as a result of the change. There are no specifics; it is very vague. Does the Minister have or has he requested details on specific commitments so that people, particularly wheelchair users are not left sitting on platforms?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	It is disingenuous for Deputy Munster to suggest we do not have commitment in this area. I respect that she has a commitment to it and she should acknowledge that we have allocated a greatly increased amount to disabilities in the plan. Trebling the amount is no mean achievement and shows no lack of commitment. It would be helpful if the Deputy acknowledged that. That money is very necessary. I, as Minister, am completely and utterly committed to this area. The issue of unstaffed stations is a matter for the NTA and the company. If we find that the unstaffed stations are having a detrimental effect on people with disabilities, we should look at it very seriously. As the Deputy knows, plans are in place for the Iarnród Éireann pilot scheme to reduce the notice hours from 24 to four.
#ImeldaMunster	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-party	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-dob	unknown-#ImeldaMunster-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	I ask the Minister a second time if he is in favour of a policy to put full accessibility on a statutory footing? I had asked if the Minister favoured a transport service with 100% accessibility for disabled passengers. When I talk about accessibility, I am not talking about something that is technically accessible on paper, but rather something that is actually accessible in a practical way. Does the Minister believe the current 24-hour notification is acceptable? I maintain that it is totally unacceptable. Will the Minister confirm if coaches are required to comply with disability access regulations? Many disability groups are of the opinion that they are not, yet many private companies have been awarded State contracts. Will the Minister clarify those issues? 
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	To answer to the Deputy's first question about the 24-hour notification, I believe that is unacceptable. I am delighted the NTA has approved a pilot project and that Iarnród Éireann is doing that. I hope it works and that it is followed by all the other companies. A 24-hour notification period is far too long. I want to see a transport system which treats and facilitates disabled people in exactly the same way that it treats people who are not disabled. That is the ambition we should be seeking to achieve. We do not currently have the infrastructure or the buses but we are moving in that direction. As the Deputy will probably know, the NTA currently has plans to purchase new buses, smaller to medium-sized single decker buses, which will facilitate people in wheelchairs whereby they will no longer have to register or queue in advance in that way. They will be available and accessible at the bus stops.

#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	Under Standing Orders, I am not allowed to. I will move on to Question No. 30.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	We had the devastating loss of the crew of Rescue 116 earlier this year and I am aware an investigation into that is currently ongoing. Therefore, it would be wholly inappropriate and insensitive of me to comment on that. Will the Minister indicate who has ultimate responsibility for the search and rescue helicopter service?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	Under the Irish National Maritime Search and Rescue Framework, SAR framework, which was published in March 2010 by the then Minister for Transport, the Irish Coast Guard, as a division of the my Department, has responsibility for the co-ordination of maritime search and rescue, SAR, emergency response at sea and along the coasts and cliffs of Ireland, and on major inland lakes. Under the framework, the safety regulation division of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, has been assigned responsibility for the regulation and oversight of aircraft operations, including aeronautical search and rescue, within the State. In this context, the IAA issues a national SAR approval to CHCI DAC, that is the company, which is the operator contracted by the Irish Coast Guard to deliver this service. Through this practice, there is a system in place to validate the suitability of the CHCI SAR helicopters, crew, training and operational standards for SAR operations. The IAA has legal responsibility for validating and approving aeronautical charts for publication, as defined by international standards agreed under the International Civil Aviation Organisation. The authority is a hugely respected organisation within international aviation, and it is subject to regular independent, outside audit.  The authority has advised me that there is no reason whatsoever for the Irish aviation community or emergency services to have any concerns about aeronautical maps and charts. All maps and charts produced meet the highest international standards. I believe it is important to emphasise, and I know that the Deputy respects this from what he said in introducing his question, that there is an active investigation currently under way into the R116 accident off the Mayo coast which is being conducted by the Air Accident Investigation Unit, AAIU. The AAIU investigates on a wholly independent basis and is charged under domestic law and international obligations with examining all relevant issues it determines are pertinent to the incident it is investigating. While I understand the ongoing public interest in this matter, it is vital that the AAIU is given the time and space to do its work and report on its findings. As the investigation is still ongoing I can say no more about the issues surrounding it. Once the final report issues, all findings and recommendations will be pursued.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I will not refer to the devastating loss of Rescue 116 but the search and rescue service continues to operate. People continue to fly. It appears the Minister is saying that, under the legislation, it is his Department that has the legal responsibility for the search and rescue helicopter service. Will he confirm that by giving a "Yes" or "No" response to that question? Who has legal responsibility today for anybody currently working for the search and rescue service to ensure the equipment used by a crew meets and fulfils the safety needs? With respect to charts and maps, in the Seanad in July 2017, the Minister said that all maps and charts now meet the highest international standards. Is he satisfied that all maps being used, and which pilots are legally required to use when flying, are up to proper standards?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	I will answer the Deputy's second question first. The IAA carries out periodic comprehensive reviews of its NAV charts. The most recent comprehensive review was carried out between October 2016 and May 2017. It involved the Air Corps CHC pilot organisation and its associations. The review involved a series of technical workshops over a number of months attended by over 100 participants. There were 100 recommendations arising from the process and all were incorporated in the current charts which issued in June. On an ongoing basis, if pilots spot an error in a chart, it should be reported through a dedicated email address at the IAA. This reporting procedure is set out in the charts. The IAA has received no error reports through this system since the new charts issued in June. There is also a separate confidential reporting, separate from the email route. The IAA advises that there have been a couple of such reports since June. These were examined and they did not give rise to any changes. Where an error is reported and considered to represent a safety risk, the IAA immediately issues a note down, which pilots are obliged to check. The IAA has advised me that it has a high level of confidence in its systems around NAV charts, and I have that confidence too.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	I want to clear on this. The Minister is happy with the charts and the maps being used by our search and rescue personnel today. That is what he has said on the floor of the Dáil today. Regarding the search and rescue service, I asked, under the legislation, is it the responsibility of the Minister's Department to ensure that everything is right and proper with the search and rescue services? Is it his Department responsibility to ensure that all the equipment a crew uses meets international best standards? If that is the case, if volunteers or staff notice defects and deficiencies in the service, what is the channel for them to make a complaint and how can we have confidence that their complaint will be dealt with to ensure that all international standards are being adhered to and met?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	The position is very clear. The then Minister in 2010 signed off on a framework which was absolutely specific, namely, that the Coast Guard is responsible for all of the regulation around the coast and on the cliffs and the IAA oversees the aeronautical travel that is going on. That could not be clearer, and they are responsible for that. It is an organisation. That is the practice and that has been the practice ever since.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	Is that on a legal footing?
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	Allow the Minister to respond without interruption.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	That has been the accepted practice since 2010. The IAA is one of the most respected of the regulators of safety in the world. It was second in Europe last year and has been acknowledged by all the auditors. It is audited in the most stringent way, not only globally or nationally by my Department but also by the European Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, the European safety Organisation. To even question in any way what it is doing is dangerous and perhaps unhelpful in a situation which is extremely fragile and delicate.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	I am questioning the legality of it.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	I have asked the Minister about this issue before, but I am asking again given the recent results from the tender process in Waterford and the problems that have arisen in delivering a proper service in Bus Éireann since the strike ended.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	As the Deputy will be aware, it is the responsibility of the National Transport Authority, NTA, to conduct the current public procurement process relating to the tendering out of 10% of the public service obligation, PSO, bus network. The NTA is undertaking this by way of three separate competitions: Dublin metropolitan, Dublin commuter and Waterford. It is well recognised that good public transport is a key enabler of both social inclusion and economic progress, and the progression of these competitions forms part of the Government's commitment to improving our public transport system and services. One of the objectives of the public procurement process is to bring about improvements and enhancements in how bus services are provided. The NTA has made it clear that it expects improved punctuality and reliability in particular as well as improvements in the customer service. The NTA monitors all PSO services in Ireland and penalises operators if services fall below the contractual targets. This same approach will be taken with successful bidders in all three competitions. There are also incentives in the contract for beating punctuality targets. As quality of service is measurable, the NTA has set out in the contract the customer service levels expected, and the NTA will use the contract terms to drive up levels of customer service. All services operated under the new contracts will continue to be regulated by the NTA, as they are today. This means that Leap cards, the free travel pass, real-time information, the national journey planner etc. will all continue to operate on these services. The NTA has the statutory powers to determine fare levels, and will continue using its fares determination process to rationalise and improve the fare structure across all the different operators in the regulated bus market, including any new operators. As the Deputy is aware, the PSO programme represents a significant expenditure of taxpayers' money. PSO subvention increased last year, again this year, and will increase yet further next year. Over the three years, PSO subvention will have increased by 35% in total. Taxpayers' contribution toward funding our PSO services is substantial.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	Once again, I would love to have the job of whoever has the job of writing the Minister's scripts because it is always a fairy tale. It is probably done for children but it is certainly not done to address the questions I have asked. The Minister did not answer my question, just like he did not answer other Deputies' questions. The key point is that the Minister has said it is the responsibility of the NTA. Everything is the responsibility of somebody except the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. Since the ending of the tough strike action taken by Dublin Bus workers to protect their jobs and pay earlier this year, services have been depleted and many workers are leaving the jobs. Many of the workers are under severe stress and strain because of the rosters they are provided with in the shoddy deal that was pushed on them because the Minister and others threatened that the company may be made insolvent. This rotten deal means that drivers are going around Dublin city having to walk from Busáras up to the Broadstone depot with bags of money, putting themselves at risk and under pressure to meet routes and timetables that do not work, are anti-family, are anti-social and are not delivering a public service. Will the Minister answer that, please?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	Deputy Smith cannot expect me to agree with her and I do not. Putting these routes out to tender is not a wage deal at all. It is a matter of introducing competition into the market. It is not a wage deal, which is a separate issue that was discussed in a separate forum and where a settlement was reached to the satisfaction of all parties. That is not related to this particular issue. The point of competition in the market is for the benefit of customers and for the service to improve. The NTA will also regulate whoever wins the tender. This is to give more choice, to give a better service and to keep fares down. All services will continue to be regulated by the NTA under the new arrangements. The new arrangements will benefit the travelling public in a number of ways, which I do not have the time to go into now, but the Deputy knows them herself.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	Once again, the Minister has completely ignored my question. Does he believe that this process of tendering will deliver public transport in a way that will take cars off the road and that will not drive wages and conditions of workers to the very bottom of a pit? The Minister has refused to answer this. The reality is that the conditions and rosters under which workers have been forced to live are driving down their lives and working conditions so badly that many of the workers are leaving. There are not enough buses and not enough workers. Competition does not deliver good public services. This is not Bríd Smith saying this. This is not rocket science. If we want good public services, they must be delivered with proper funding. The Minister brags about the public service obligation, PSO, increases, over recent years. I remind the Minister that the PSO for Bus Éireann is still about €9 million below what it was when the recession hit in 2009. It has never been restored. I attended a conference recently on climate change. Ireland is appallingly bad at dealing with it. One of the key issues is that Ireland is not able to deliver decent public transport. In not doing so, we are breaching all of our commitments to dealing with climate change and our commitments to dealing with workers.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	I will answer the Deputy's question. Do I hope this will take cars off the road? The answer is yes. Do not say that I am not answering the question. The answer is Y-E-S. I do hope it will do that. Does this answer the Deputy's question? Is that plain enough for her?
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	The Minister has just answered it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	38	It is absolutely absurd for Deputy Smith to say that. The workers and staff are protected under this particular scheme. There will not be redundancies as a result of putting this out to tender. There will be none, so for the Deputy to suggest that the workers are in some way being laid off, they are not. They have options under these schemes. They have options to have similar terms of employment and options to move. There are no redundancies, so do not tell me that they are threatened by this. The conditions of these schemes are written specifically to protect the staff.

In that context I ask the Minister about this matter.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I thank Deputy Connolly for her question. I am sure that the Deputy is aware that the transport strategy for Galway city was prepared by the National Transport Authority in partnership with Galway City Council and Galway County Council in 2016. The strategy set out an overall framework for the development of transport infrastructure and services in Galway city and its environs over a 20 year period. It was included in the new city development plan which was adopted by the city council and came into force in January 2017. I understand that the issue of light rail was considered in the preparation of the transport strategy for Galway city, where it was concluded that there is insufficient demand to justify the significant additional cost of developing a light rail system and that bus-based public transport represents the most appropriate system for Galway over the period considered in this transport strategy. Accordingly, light rail was not taken forward for economic appraisal in the context of a cost-benefit analysis for this mode of transport. The transport strategy for Galway city also concluded that a high-quality bus-based public transport service will cater for the forecasted passenger demand and will provide significant flexibility in terms of network options and the ability to integrate with other modes. The implementation of this strategy is primarily a matter for the local authority to pursue. The national planning framework is being developed at present under the leadership of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.The framework is a long-term strategic planning framework which will guide national, regional and local planning and investment decisions over the period to 2040. In the context of the draft national planning framework and key future growth enablers for Galway, the plan recognises the need for provision of a citywide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre and third level institutions and the employment areas to the east of the city. The current transport strategy for Galway city and background supporting analysis aligns to this need with its successors being guided by the national planning framework. I am conscious, in light in particular of the representations made to me not only by Deputy Connolly but other Deputies from Galway, that Galway is a microcosm of what is happening in other areas and that it is suffering in the area of traffic. I intend to regard it is a priority and to ensure that, as implied by the Deputy, it is not omitted from any of the schemes we are introducing to improve traffic and public transport nationwide.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I thank the Minister for clarifying that the reason there is no light rail in Galway is, officially, insufficient demand and that no economic or cost appraisal has ever been carried out in this regard. I ask the Minister to step outside his script and to revert to his response to an earlier question in which he spoke about seriously ambitious plans and imagination to lift cars off our roads. I welcome the Minister's comment that Galway is a microcosm. Galway has a population of 80,000 and is one of the five cities destined to grow to a population of up to 120,000. In the words of Conor Faughnan, AA Ireland's director of consumer affairs, traffic congestion problems in a modestly sized city like Galway are embarrassingly bad. He has also spoken of the provision of light rail being an important part of the solution. Some 176 cities throughout Europe have embraced light rail or tram services. I ask the Minister to go back to his imagination and determination and to comment on the provision of a light rail service as the most sustainable solution to traffic congestion in Galway, while allowing us to comply with our commitments under climate change.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	I take the Deputy's point about imagination and ambition. The problem is that we do not have money. Light rail was found to be too ambitious in terms of a lack of market demand for it. If there is a business case for it, we will look at the issue again. The decision was made that there was not a good business case for light rail at the time. There is definitely an attempt to address the issues of Galway and to do so in the context of the national planning framework. The framework sets out the key future growth enablers for Galway in the area of public transport as follows: progressing the sustainable development of new greenfield areas for housing; development of supports for public transport and infrastructure; improving access and sustainable transport links through integration with existing employment areas to the east of Galway city and provision of citywide public transport network with enhanced accessibility between the existing and proposed residential areas and the city centre.

I refer the Minister to the position of management in Galway that there is no demand for park-and-ride facilities either, notwithstanding that the elected members included as an objective in the city development plan 2005 the provision of such facilities. Management believe we must wait for demand. I am asking Deputy Ross, as Minister with responsibility for this area, and as a man with imagination and determination, to consider the provision of light rail for Galway as the most imaginative and sustainable solution to the traffic mess there, in addition to park-and-ride facilities and an integrated public transport system. Unless he does this, he will be only paying lip-service to sustainable development, which is enshrined in the draft national planning framework, and lip-service to our commitments to reduce emissions and take cars off our roads. Earlier, the Minister forcibly told a Deputy that he wants to take cars off the roads. We have stale male - I use those words advisedly - in respect of leadership in Galway in terms of a solution. What we need is an imaginative green way forward that will put Galway on the map and on a level with all other European cities, some of them of equal size.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	44	If the Deputy can make a fresh case for light rail which makes economical commercial sense I will be very happy to discuss it with her. As the Deputy is aware, we have limited funds. If she can make a case that is convincing and stands up to scrutiny I will be delighted to review it with her. On the budget, regional cities and an environmentally-friendly solution, the Deputy knows the direction in which we are going. We are doing real things in this area. We do have ambition and we are putting it into effect. Our plans are not Dublin-centric. Budget 2018 provided a four-year capital envelope for public transport of more than €2.7 billion to 2021. This allows an investment of over €110 million over the next four years in cycling and walking infrastructure not only in the Dublin area but in Galway, Cork, Limerick and Waterford as well. Sustainable urban transport is the way forward in all of the cities of Ireland.

#ShaneCassells	unknown-#ShaneCassells-party	unknown-#ShaneCassells-dob	unknown-#ShaneCassells-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	46	First, what was said in the Seanad last Thursday about the Irish bid was disgraceful and wrong. It was an insult and disrespectful to the efforts of Kevin Potts, Philip Orr, Dick Spring, Brian O'Driscoll, Philip Browne, Páraic Duffy, the Minister, Deputy Ross and others. Rather than dismiss the decision last week by World Rugby as an opportunity lost, there is merit in discussing it given the Government spend of over €1 million of taxpayers' money. At the end of the day, this came down to pure old horse trading and a vote between lads and blazers - which are not my words but those of rugby men on the inside track, such as Jim Glennon. Last Sunday, he set out in writing how the votes went down in the background. He named those involved, such as Gareth Davies from Wales, and set out how in the two weeks prior to the vote it was all about canvassing.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	47	I thank the Deputy for his question and remarks. Before I respond to the question, I congratulate France on its win. I wish it every success as it turns its attention to delivering an outstanding tournament in 2023. Wednesday's result was disappointing, particularly after the years of work put into the bid. However, in our disappointment, we should not lose sight of the fact that the technical report found that Ireland would be an excellent host country for a Rugby World Cup. Although we were not successful, it is important to highlight that fact. The chairman of World Rugby, Bill Beaumont, noted that there were three outstanding host candidates who raised the bar and overwhelmingly demonstrated that they were all capable of hosting an exceptional Rugby World Cup and stated that there was very little to choose between the candidates and this was reflected in the independently-audited evaluation report.
 Ireland was up against two previous hosts and in the evaluation report we fell behind them based on the quality of their stadia, many of which are recently built as result of hosting Euro 2016 and the 2010 FIFA World Cup. We presented a different, more sustainable vision that involved investment in existing stadia to meet tournament standards. Unfortunately, the Rugby World Cup Limited evaluators did not agree. In any event, ultimately the voters did not support the recommendations. Ireland’s bid is one of which all involved can be extremely proud. I take this opportunity thank Fianna Fáil for ignoring the remarks in the Seanad and to thank that party, Sinn Féin and the Independents for their support for the bid. We had some very constructive debate on the Bill which I introduced in this House. We did have the support of the Opposition, which was critical.  I thank Deputy Cassells for the constructive remarks he makes today. Of course, we are not above criticism but it would be wrong not to acknowledge the fantastic and united support of this nation and virtually all parties behind the bid which was one of which we can all be proud. It should be remembered that according to the evaluation report all of the bidding countries could have produced a very good Rugby World Cup. 
#ShaneCassells	unknown-#ShaneCassells-party	unknown-#ShaneCassells-dob	unknown-#ShaneCassells-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	I thank the Minister for his reply. My question is in respect of the process. The Minister answered my question well in terms of his reference to Bill Beaumont, a rugby legend and member of the executive council, who defied the executive independent report because, as we know, the English backed Ireland.  I would like to speak about what those involved in rugby are saying, as opposed to what is stated in the report. Jim Glennon is a former Irish rugby forward and politician who knows the dark world of voting in both disciplines.He noted last weekend that after all the millions of euro invested in the bid, all the travel and hard work, Ireland's prospects of hosting the World Cup had come down to this, namely, that the outcome was in the hands of our Six Nations allies, Scotland and Wales. It was time to pull out all the stops and ensure every connection with anybody involved in rugby was exploited to the full. That is what it ultimately seems to have boiled down to: good old horse trading. If that was indeed the case, what exactly was our canvassing strategy? Did the Minister meet his counterpart in the Scottish Assembly, for example, to try to organise a quid pro quo whereby Ireland would assist the Scots on the next occasion? Was there any engagement in this vein with the Welsh Assembly Minister for Culture, Tourism and Sport, Dafydd Elis-Thomas? The Minister, Deputy Ross, might think I am being facetious but I urge him to consider the words of Brian O'Driscoll in the aftermath of the vote, "What goes around comes around." The former Ireland rugby captain was not holding back in pointing out what he considered to be the ramifications of this decision.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	The Deputy's comments probably are more controversial than mine will be. We did everything we possibly could to secure a successful bid. On the question of lobbying, the answer is that, yes, there was lobbying and plenty of it. We are not ashamed of the fact we lobbied and put our case. Politicians lobbied and the Irish Rugby Football Union lobbied. Members of the Opposition lobbied, and I thank them for it. It was a united effort. I would give a certain amount of credit to some of what the Deputy has said this morning. One must acknowledge that despite the evaluation report, two thirds of the people voting did not take any notice of that information and sent their votes elsewhere. In other words, decisions were not made on the basis of the evaluation report itself. I did get involved personally in the bid, from my first day as Minister. I met World Rugby on several occasions, I introduced legislation and I travelled at least twice to the United Kingdom to lobby my British counterpart.
#ShaneCassells	unknown-#ShaneCassells-party	unknown-#ShaneCassells-dob	unknown-#ShaneCassells-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	50	The expert review group looked at the question of deficiencies, including in transport and, in particular, in terms of our stadium infrastructure. Having worked as a sports journalist for more than a decade and having visited many stadiums throughout the country, I am well aware of the deficiencies we have but also the very positive gains there have been in the past ten years or so. There is no question, however, that investment is needed in stadiums throughout the country. When the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, responded to questions from me on the investment issue in the House last week, he spoke about sports capital grants. That funding is for helping clubs to get on their feet. We need to address the deficiencies in our major infrastructure with a view to implementing the municipal stadium model. That is the model in favour across Europe and it allows for the hosting of multitudes of sports. In a small country like ours, we will need to pool our scarce resources into the municipal stadium model if we are to ensure any future pitch for a major tournament in any sport is credible. That will require having infrastructure worthy of the European stage.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	A sum of €50 million has been allocated in the budget for large-scale projects, and stadium projects certainly could be considered eligible candidates for that funding. I do not know whether the Deputy is giving credit to the criticisms of our stadium infrastructure. Commitments were given in this regard and they were solid, bullet-proof and Government-sponsored. I remain of the view that it was utterly credible to give an undertaking that the infrastructure would be in place on time. However, World Rugby made a judgment that it was better to have a stadium in hand than one that is promised, and that is fair enough. All I can do now is wish good luck to the French and look forward to a very good Rugby World Cup. We are very proud of the work we did in bidding for the tournament.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	A traffic management plan for a particular area is primarily a matter for the relevant local authority, in this case Dublin City Council. There are, however, some supports designed at central government level that can assist both local authorities and local entities, including schools, in better managing traffic and its impact on their area. The sustainable transport measures grants, STMG, programme is administered on my behalf by the National Transport Authority, NTA. It provides Exchequer-funded support to the seven local authorities in the greater Dublin area, GDA, in implementing sustainable transport projects, including traffic management schemes in their areas. The NTA is responsible for deciding allocations to local authorities under this grant scheme. The sustainable travel policy Smarter Travel 2008-2020 encourages all schools to have a travel plan. Such plans can set out ways for encouraging students to take alternatives to the car. As part of that programme, local authorities offer support via the identification and implementation of safe walking and cycling routes to and from schools and other educational institutions as well as by providing better access for people with disabilities. Some local authorities provide helpful guidance for schools on the possible content of such plans. The Green Schools programme's travel element, known as GST, is an activity-based mobility management programme which, following a two-year pilot in the GDA, has been in operation nationally since 2008. This may be of interest to the 12 primary and post-primary schools in the Grace Park Road and Griffith Avenue area. It is rolled out in schools that have completed the first three themes of the Green Schools programme, which are litter and waste, energy, and water. Schools take two years to complete the travel programme. GST is funded by the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, with moneys provided through the NTA to An Taisce, which operates the programme. The NTA has also produced a toolkit for school travel which is designed, in particular, for use by schools that are currently not engaged with the Green Schools programme but are specifically interested in addressing travel planning for their location. The NTA's toolkit presents a set of possible measures for promoting a reduction in car usage on the trip to and from school. It also encompasses measures aimed at mitigating the impact of traffic on the community around the school.

Moreover, there are plans for one of the schools to increase its intake and, in addition, plans for increased housing in this already congested area. I am urging that the Minister's Department be the driver in bringing the various groups together, including the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, the Department of Education and Skills, the local authority and the NTA. While my question concerns a specific area, there are implications for other locations. How up to date and proactive are all these authorities when it comes to devising a traffic management plan involving schools in a particular area?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	As I said, the local authority should be the lead in this. I am not attempting to pass the buck in saying that I do not consider myself to have any great role in this. If I can play a constructive role in bringing people together, then I will do so. However, the first port of call probably should be the local authority when it comes to bringing stakeholders together. My guess, moreover, is that it is a matter for the local authority to make any decisions in this regard. What we can provide is certain environmentally friendly ways of controlling and managing traffic. Clearly, if there are plans to increase student intake, as the Deputy indicated, the traffic certainly will get worse. I will ask one of my officials to get in touch with the local authority to see whether there is anything we can do together, apart from promoting the programmes to which I referred in my reply.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	It really is about joining the dots and ensuring people talk to each other, and there is an awareness of changing demographics. For instance, traffic counts were done for the environmental impact statement that preceded the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel. How often are such assessments conducted before plans are done up for different types of infrastructure projects? We all agree it would be great to see more children walking or cycling to school instead of being dropped off by car. Where road transport cannot be avoided, it is much better to have 20 children in one bus, ideally an environmentally friendly bus, than one child in 20 separate cars. The problem is that when it comes to planning for and addressing these issues, people are operating in isolation to each other, whereas a coming together would be much more effective.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	Traffic plans are hopeless if one does not have an environmentally friendly way, which the Deputy addressed, of getting children to school which gets them out of cars. We have a larger role here, not just in Dublin or the Deputy's area but on a national level, to get children cycling and participating in walking, cycling and sustainable travel initiatives, which are in my Department's remit. In 2014, as the Deputy probably knows, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport engaged Cycling Ireland to develop a new national cycle training standard specifically for schools which would ensure a standardised level of cycle training around the country. The new standard, Cycle Right, which was launched in January 2017, has been rolled out since the start of 2017 to as many primary schools as funding allows. This new cycle training standard, which includes an on-road element, will result over time in an increase in the number of children choosing to cycle to and from school. It is expected that between 12,000 and 15,000 children will avail of the training in 2017. I will ask an official to contact the local authority and I will ask the school to look at the green schools programme and cycle right programme.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I recently asked about the make-up of the bus fleet and what powers its engines. I got a reply saying the Minister was strongly committed to facilitating the uptake of low emission technologies in the public transport sector, that his Department has established a green public transport fund to support the uptake of low carbon technologies within the public transport sector and that the BusConnects programme will have the entire Dublin fleet converted to low emissions technology by 2030. When will we see the first of these new cleaner vehicles and what will their power source be?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	As the Deputy is aware, BusConnects, which was launched earlier this year by the National Transport Authority, NTA, is a plan to transform Dublin's bus system fundamentally so that journeys for passengers by bus will be fast, reliable, punctual, convenient and affordable. It represents a reimagining of bus transport for the Dublin region. It encompasses the revamping of all aspects of the bus system, including the ticketing technology, the road infrastructure, the bus stops, the network of routes, the fare structure and vehicle emissions. In budget 2018, I secured a four year multi-annual capital envelope of over €770 million for the BusConnects programme. As part of the BusConnects project, a decision on the optimum fleet technology will be made very soon where either a single technology or a combination of technologies will be selected. A fleet acquisition plan will be developed to transition the bus fleet to low emission vehicle types, with the first vehicles under that strategy to go into service during 2018. By 2023 half of the bus fleet, approximately 500 buses, are expected to be converted to low emission vehicles with full conversion expected to be completed by 2030. The public transport fleet has a central role to play in promoting and normalising the use of alternative fuels - alternatives to petrol and diesel - within wider society, which is essential if we are to decarbonise the transport sector by 2050. Transitioning the public transport fleet is important for leadership and demonstration. However, according to the latest emission inventory estimates, public transport emissions accounted for only an estimated 4.6% of total land transport emissions. If the Deputy breaks that 4.6% down, approximately 3.5% is produced by buses and 1.1% is produced by rail services.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	Last week, the 2018 Climate Change Performance Index was published at the UN climate talks in Bonn. It contained the not-so-surprising claim that Ireland is now the single worst performer on climate change action in Europe. The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport is a central holder of responsibility for this shameful accolade. What have we been doing with the bus fleet all these years? Dublin Bus responded to one of my questions last week. It stated that of the 1,006 buses in operation, zero operated on electricity, zero were hybrids, 530 were purchased in the last six years and every single one of them runs on diesel. It is a crazy situation. The fumes from diesel engines are lethal to humans. The nitrogen dioxide that is produced forms tiny particulates that can lodge in the lungs and leads to dangerous outdoor air pollution that has become the biggest killer in the world at 3 million deaths per year. If there is any diesel in the make-up of low emissions engines, it would be a disaster. Has the health danger been taken into account by the Minister's Department?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	Much of what Deputy Wallace said is right. We are bad performers and we have missed our targets. We do not have a record about which we could hold our heads high. Public transport is a contributor to that. There is no point in denying it. We are making large strides, particularly in the bus area but also elsewhere, with ambitious and renewed targets to remedy the situation of which we cannot be proud. The NTA has published, as part of the overall BusConnects project, its proposals for transitioning the bus fleet in Dublin to low carbon emissions. It intends to seek funding from the green public transport funds for the incremental additional cost of buying environmentally friendly vehicles and envisages that similar vehicles will be purchased for use in the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	Paris, Madrid, Athens and Mexico have announced that they will ban diesel vehicles in their cities by 2025. We will fall even further behind those cities. Even if we convert to electric vehicles and trains, if the electricity that powers them is dirty and comes from peat, oil, coal and gas as it does at present, we will still have a problem. The burning of coal at Moneypoint will still be happening in 2025 and probably in 2030. We will have coal-powered buses, which is worse than them being diesel-powered. Scotland has increased its power generation from renewable sources from 20% in 2009 to 43% in 2015. In Ireland, in 2015, 8% of our energy was from renewable sources. We seem to be letting the private sector lead us on renewable energy. It is like expecting it to fix the housing crisis. It just will not happen. Unless the State takes a proactive role and gets serious and honest about dealing with climate change, we are not going to change things very quickly. Our record on climate change in Europe is going to get worse before it gets better.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The State takes climate change seriously, as does our Department. It was not taken seriously enough in the past and we had targets which may have been too ambitious but were there all the same. The green public transport fund was established to cover the difference in price between those buses which were diesel-fuelled, hybrids and other forms of environmentally friendly, low emissions vehicles. That fund is part of the carbon reduction programme, to support the uptake of low-carbon, energy efficient technologies within the public transport fleet. The fund is intended to address the price differential to which I referred. Funding will also be allocated from that fund to accelerate electric vehicle uptake rates, following a recent recommendation from the low emissions vehicles, LEV, task force, as part of the 2018 budgetary estimates process. This will include the introduction of a new tolling centre regime to incentivise ultra-low emitting cars. Further details will be finalised by the LEV task force. I acknowledge the Deputy's point and ask him to remember that buses only represent a small part of emissions.

The process could take much of a year, including putting it out for tender and assessing the details afterwards. It does not need to be held up with any of the other processes, such as land purchase, archaeological issues or fencing. It can be done at the same time.Will the Minister release it to tender for construction in the next year? What are his plans? What kind of works is he lining up to be carried out on the N22 over the next year?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in respect of the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned. Within its capital budget, the allocation of funding to individual projects is a matter in the first instance for TII in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. This road scheme involves the construction of 22 km of new carriageway from just east of Macroom to west of Ballyvourney, including a bypass of Macroom town. The scheme will address the inadequacies on the existing road layout in a variety of ways, including improving road safety, increasing the capacity of the road, improving journey times and relieving congestion in Macroom town. TII is responsible for implementation of the project within available budgets. The scheme has full statutory approval. TII has progressed land purchase and advance works on the project, including archaeology and site investigations. The tender documentation for the construction contract is also being prepared, and EirGrid and Cork County Council have sought procedural advice from An Bord Pleanála in respect of pylon relocation.  The Ballyvourney to Macroom upgrade scheme was included in the Building on Recovery capital plan, and TII has been progressing preparatory work related to the project. As the plan provides for the gradual build-up in capital funding for the road network, with funding backloaded towards the end of the plan period, the construction programme for the major national road improvement projects will ramp up from 2020. Construction of the Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme is scheduled to start in the first quarter of 2020. However, within this context, I understand that TII has progressed land purchase and advance works on the project, including archaeology and site investigations. I also understand that the tender documentation relating to the construction of the project is being prepared. TII allocated €4 million to this scheme in 2014, €5 million in 2015, €3.8 million in 2016 and €14 million this year.
#AindriasMoynihan	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-party	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-dob	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	The question is fairly specific. It is on the outline of works the Minister intends to see carried out on that much-needed project over the coming year. He has spoken about the archaeological work and the fencing work. These were part of the original contract, yet they were plucked out and presented as advance works while the substantive project was parked. These works are independent of the substantive project. They do not need to hold back the release of the tender for construction. The tender itself is clearly being prepared. Will the Minister release the project to tender for construction in the coming year? He Minister is talking about potentially beginning work in the first quarter of 2020, but a job of this scale could take much of a year to go through the tendering process. There is no need to wait for the other stages to be complete. It is something on which the Minister could start in order that it could be ready when the archaeological and fencing works are finished. From what I can see on the ground locally, much of the fencing work is in fact pretty much finished. The Minister has outlined various figures in respect of land purchase. This funding has been drip-fed over recent years. It does not need to hold up the works. It is independent and the tendering can take place in parallel with any of the other stages.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	I cannot give that commitment to the Deputy in this situation, and I do not think he expects me to. A lot of progress has been made. I will not say that it is ungrateful, because I do not expect gratitude from anybody for anything, but it should be recognised that TII has been allocated progressive and increasing amounts of money. I will repeat that €4 million was allocated to the scheme in 2014, €5 million in 2015, €3.8 million in 2016, and €14 million this year. The commitment is there. As far as I can see, and the Deputy can contradict me, we are only talking about the timing. He is talking about something happening almost immediately while I am talking about 2020. I cannot tell him that I will advance that at this stage, but I am not going to reduce the commitment we have made to this particular project in any way.
#AindriasMoynihan	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-party	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-dob	unknown-#AindriasMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	I do not believe the people of Macroom are ungrateful. They are frustrated and they are sick of waiting for the bypass. They have been waiting for many years and have seen the drip-feeding of funding for land purchase, funding which has decreased and increased over the years. We want to get to the stage where the project happens and we are able to drive on that road. There are ways in which the Minister can speed up the process. I have shown him one such way. The tender for construction can be run at the same time as other works are being carried out. These works do not need to hold the tendering back. There are ways in which the Minister can carry out the process much more quickly. We are offering him solutions. We are asking whether the Minister will take them, run with them and make the road happen more quickly than he has projected in his figures. It is possible.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	The road is happening and it is going to happen. It is not happening at the pace which the Deputy, understandably, would require. The considerable sums being spent on the project are proof of the commitment to it. The option of accelerating the construction of some of the Building on Recovery schemes, including the Ballyvourney to Macroom scheme, was considered. This was not possible within the overall funding envelope available, however, given the moneys needed to meet the Government's commitment to contribute £75 million sterling to the first phase of the A5. Unfortunately, there are other very expensive projects to which we have made commitments and we must keep those commitments as well.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	71	The National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017-2021, NDIS, was launched by my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for disability, Deputy Finian McGrath, last July. This is a whole-of-Government approach aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities. The NDIS contains precise and measurable actions and timescales for delivery, including in the areas of transport and sport. Monitoring of the implementation of the strategy is being overseen by the national disability inclusion strategy steering group which comprises key Departments, the National Disability Authority and the disability stakeholders group. My Department is represented on this body and works with relevant State agencies and public transport operators to progress the implementation of specific transport and sport actions under the strategy. My Department and its agencies also work closely with the other Departments and agencies to deliver on cross-sectoral or cross-departmental actions. My Department has in place an accessibility consultative committee, ACC. Its role is to monitor and review progress on the implementation of actions under the NDIS. Membership of the ACC is drawn from organisations representing people with disabilities, members of the disability stakeholders group, key agencies under the aegis of the Department, as well other relevant State agencies. Meetings of the ACC are scheduled to take place at least two weeks in advance of meetings of the steering group. The most recent meeting took place on 18 October. I can assure the Deputy that my Department and its agencies are committed to engaging actively with the strategy, including the continued development of accessible public transport in recognition of the importance of such services to the lives of people with disabilities. In this regard I should mention that the four-year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018 includes a multi-annual allocation of almost €28 million for the accessibility retro-fit programme for the period 2018 to 2021. This funding is a trebling of the previous allocation. It relates to accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure and is additional to the investment in new infrastructure which, as a matter of course, is nowadays designed to facilitate accessibility.

Bus Éireann provides a very good service in west Cork, yet if people with disabilities want to travel from any town in west Cork to the city, they must give 24 hours' notice. In an age in which we want everyone to be equal, I find this very hard to swallow. Even if the bus is disability-friendly, there are towns in which the bus stop is not. A lot of work needs to be done in this area. I also want to raise a few issues which affect people who are visually impaired.Those who are blind or visually impaired cannot drive and, therefore, public transport is their only means of transport. Accessible public transport is vital for their independence. Availability goes hand in hand with accessibility.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	The Deputy may have missed my earlier reply to Deputy Munster. The Government has trebled its commitment to disabilities in the recent capital plan in addition to what was already being spent. There is no doubt that my Department and the Government are fully committed to disabilities. The Deputy made a very good point in respect of Irish Rail. She would accept that a pilot scheme is now being operated by Iarnród Éireann on the DART to try to bring down the number of hours required for notice from 24 hours to four hours. I will report back to the House when a result is obtained in that regard. It is a very important development.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I did not miss any of the earlier debate; I do not do that. Does the Minister agree with the recommendation of the National Council for the Blind that a complete review and revamp of the transport service in Ireland should be undertaken in order to increase public transport availability for everyone, including those with impaired vision? The programme for Government pledged to: "invest to make public transport services more accessible for people with disabilities. Examples of such investment include increased wheelchair access to bus and train stations, bus fleet enhancement and audio announcements on train and bus services, to aid the visually impaired." I ask the Minister to comment on that commitment.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	75	I am happy to seriously consider that and discuss it with the National Transport Authority, NTA. Those who have sensory or visual difficulties have problems with public transport and those should be remedied. We are trying to approach this on a multi-faceted level. The commitment is there and it would be wrong if the Deputy did not acknowledge that and the progress the Government is making. It has made several commitments it intends to keep and some of which it is already keeping, as well as the commitment I referred to regarding timing. The NTA is continuing to roll out its accessible bus stop programme. It has launched a campaign in which I was recently involved to stop people putting buggies in the wheelchair zone. I have referred to the pilot project on the DART. It has also increased grants for taxis. We have introduced a series of measures backed up by investment and will continue to build on that.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	Has the Minister contacted his British counterpart regarding the ownership of Rosslare Europort; and will he make a statement on the matter?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	77	I thank the Deputy for his question. I have not specifically contacted my UK counterpart in relation to the ownership of Rosslare Europort. The Deputy is aware that Rosslare Europort is unique among State-owned ports as it is not a commercial company operating under the Harbours Acts but, rather, is operated as a division of Iarnród Éireann. Technically the port forms part of the Fishguard and Rosslare Railways and Harbours Company which is a 19th century joint venture company currently comprising Iarnród Éireann on the Irish side and Stena Line on the Fishguard side in Wales. Each partner is wholly responsible for its own area of operations and liable for financial liabilities and profits associated with its part of the company but the overarching company structure still exists. The status of the port and whether that potentially inhibits its development was most recently considered in a strategic review commissioned by my Department and carried out by Indecon economic consultants. The report concluded that the creation of an independent port authority would be extremely difficult because of the port's complex legal structure. Instead, it was recommended that the port remain in public ownership and that the possibilities for increased private sector involvement be investigated. Iarnród Éireann's engaged consultants to assess market interest in order to assist in its consideration of how best to move the matter forward. The assessment was largely positive in terms of the potential for increased private sector investment in the port but identified possible implementation issues due to the complicated legislative basis of the port. Following the assessment, my Department sought and received detailed advice from the Office of the Attorney General on the matter which identified a number of legal issues with any such proposal. Those issues remain under consideration by my Department.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	As the Minister rightly points out, the ownership situation of Rosslare Europort is historically complicated. Effective ownership is held by the British and Irish Governments, with two operators over the port. The Government should seek to engage with the British Government to decouple Fishguard from Rosslare Europort because the current ownership is significantly inhibiting the development of Rosslare Europort. It must be unique for a rail operator to control a port. In terms of the port management, some €2.34 million profit was made by Rosslare Europort in 2015 but that was funnelled out of the port and into Iarnród Éireann to subsidise other aspects of the company. Such profits should be retained by Rosslare Europort to develop the harbour and particularly so in light of Brexit. What are the Minister's thoughts on preparing ports such as Rosslare Europort for Brexit and also in terms of its ownership situation?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	It has been over four years since the Indecon review into Rosslare harbour was presented to the Minister's Department but it has only recently become available for public viewing, although it is mostly redacted. Nothing has changed during those four years in terms of how Rosslare Europort operates nor how the Department has approached its ownership and management. The key recommendation of the Indecon report was option five, which concerns the potential to develop a long-term concession agreement for the port. A steering committee was set up but four years later nothing has happened. Rosslare is the only port or airport in the country that is served by a rail link. More vessels arrive annually there than in any port in the country except Dublin. That is the situation prior to Brexit. However, the Department does not seem to have any idea how to develop the port or stop it from falling into disrepair.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I point out to Deputy Wallace that the most recent audited financial results from Iarnród Éireann for 2016 show the Rosslare Europort division made a surplus after tax of almost €2.5 million.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	In spite of the Government, not because of it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	That is what it managed to do.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	Where is that money going? Where is it being invested?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	Irish Ports operate as an independent commercial company and planning and preparation for Brexit are operational matters for the ports. I am planning to soon meet my British counterparts and I undertake to Deputy Browne that I will raise the issue with them. As the Deputy said, it is a complicated historic issue that might have to eventually be resolved by way of simultaneous legislation in Ireland and the UK. The situation is very complicated. It should not be so but is because of its historic nature. I will raise the matter because there are serious and historic matters involved. If Chris Grayling is there, I will raise it with him and otherwise I will raise it with whoever is at the December meeting of the Commission.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	I thank the Minister. He is correct that it will probably require legislation in both jurisdictions to resolve the matter. Seamus Brennan looked into the issue when he was Minister. The Minister might ask his officials to look back over the files in that regard. Rosslare Europort has massive potential. However, 80% of volume of goods currently going to the continent go over the UK land bridge and if there is a hard Brexit there will be tailbacks in the port. It needs to be developed to meet those demands. The profits being made by Rosslare Europort to which the Minister referred are being funnelled out of the port into Iarnród Éireann. At the very minimum, Irish Rail should develop a separate, stand-alone company to develop the port in order that profits are kept there and it can be developed as a stand-alone entity.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	86	I acknowledge the importance of the port. It is in Deputy Browne's constituency. It is the second biggest sea port in the State in terms of ship movements, tourist traffic and unitised freight.Despite what was said here, revenue is up 1% overall year on year at €10.6 million reflecting a 4.5% increase in passenger cars and a 4.3% increase in roll-on roll-off freight units, while the importation of trade vehicles and light commercial vehicles was up 8.3%. Obviously, the effect of Brexit could be very dramatic on this port and is something which is worthy of being addressed at the next meeting with the British Cabinet Secretary.

Will the Minister make a statement on the matter?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	89	As I have indicated previously, Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with the relevant road authority, is responsible for the implementation of individual road projects.  I acknowledge the Deputy has particular concerns about the section of the N24 near Piltown and has raised this issue with me on a regular basis. I also visited the area to see this section of road for myself. I understand that the Deputy was also able to raise his concerns directly with the chief executive of TII during the recent Committee of Public Accounts discussion on TII's 2016 financial statements. As the Deputy knows, TII has provided funding to Kilkenny County Council to implement some interim safety improvement measures at the Inkbottle junction and the Tower Road junction. I understand from TII that these safety works are substantially completed, with the exception of some additional signage that will be in place by the end of this month. As well as these short-term measures, the appraisal of long-term options relating to upgrading this section of road and the provision of an overbridge has been under way. TII has indicated that this work has progressed to the point where Kilkenny County Council has tendered for consultancy services relating to the proposed upgrade. It is understood that the Council received tenders on 10 November 2017 and that the council is carrying out a tender assessment with a view to submitting a recommendation to TII for approval before the end of the year.

We need an upgrade. The two-plus-one system is not exactly perfect. We objected to it when it was proposed by the National Roads Authority, NRA. We said it was not good enough and wanted a motorway system but instead it went for the two-pus-one system. It has not worked. Two dangerous junctions are involved, where ten lives have been lost. While improvement works have been undertaken at these junctions, that is not satisfactory and it is still dangerous. We want the process to go forward to amalgamate the two junctions and put in an overbridge. That will solve the whole problem. I thank the Minister for his interest. Will he make sure that TII pushes this forward without delay? At a recent Committee of Public Accounts meeting, I raised this matter with the TII and it gave a commitment to progressing this as fast as possible.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I acknowledge the Deputy's commitment to this. He has raised it on several occasions, with the chief executive of TII at the Committee of Public Accounts and as it is a safety issue I will continue to give it priority.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	94	Last evening the Tánaiste answered questions on her knowledge of the adversarial approach of An Garda Síochána against Sergeant Maurice McCabe at the O'Higgins commission of investigation. The Tánaiste also published the email of May 2015. That email is damning. The Tánaiste was notified by email in May 2015 of this adversarial legal strategy. That email should have rung alarm bells for the Tánaiste. She would have been aware of the allegations against Maurice McCabe referred to in the email and that the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, had directed that no action be taken, and that the independent review mechanism, which she established and to which this was referred, also decided that no further action be taken. She also had met Maurice and Lorraine McCabe in October 2014 where they detailed this allegation to her and the trauma it caused them. The Tánaiste was told, however, that this very case, of which she was well aware and which had no foundation, was going to be raised by An Garda Síochána before the O'Higgins commission to undermine this man's credibility and integrity. The O'Higgins commission was established to verify allegations in a dossier re Garda malpractice. It was never established to undermine a man's integrity, credibility or character. Furthermore, the Tánaiste had legal representation at the O'Higgins commission, which surely would have kept the Department and Minister informed of what was going on at the commission. It is simply not credible that the Tánaiste would forget about this email and its content, given the enormity of the McCabe issue up to then. Indeed the Tánaiste would have been appointed Minister for Justice and Equality because of this entire saga. It is interesting that when the adversarial nature of the O'Higgins commission became public knowledge the Tánaiste said to me, in answering questions in the House on 17 May, the hearings were not adversarial; they were inquisitorial. She was flatly denying its adversarial nature. The Tánaiste says she forgot the content of the email but it is far worse that she did not follow up on the email. By passively acquiescing she became a bystander to a legal strategy designed to undermine a man's motivation, credibility and ultimately his integrity. This has echoes of the Tusla file revelations, an episode that nearly brought down the Government at the time. The Tánaiste stayed silent on that occasion. There was no reference to this particular email. The Taoiseach inadvertently acknowledged – misled - the House last week because of the Tánaiste's actions. The email came to her attention last Thursday. It was kept quiet for four days. God only knows whether, had "Prime Time" not asked the questions, we ever would have known about this email. Would it ever have been sent to Mr. Justice Charleton if that did not happen? Does the Taoiseach accept that the Tánaiste failed Sergeant McCabe by not acting on this email and that by doing nothing, she allowed An Garda Síochána to seek to undermine his credibility as a person to whom she said she would offer the highest legal protection? She may not have thrown him to the wolves but she allowed them free reign and that is a fundamental failure to protect a man who, as the Taoiseach said yesterday, was wronged on several occasions by this State and again in this context. 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	All I can do at this stage is restate and remind the House of what I said previously, first, that the Tánaiste had no hand, act or part in the legal strategy pursued by the former Garda Commissioner. There is an attempt in some way to suggest in this House and other places that the State or State entities were acting in collusion or all acting together. That is not the case. The Garda has its own legal team and advice, as the Commissioner at the time did, and the Department has its legal team and advice. They are separate legal entities and particularly in the context of a tribunal or commission, they have to act separately and cannot interfere in one another's legal position. The Tánaiste, and we know this from the email of 15 May 2015, did not have any knowledge that such a legal strategy was being pursued until that email was sent on 15 May. That is after opening statements, after the fact, after the hearings were already under way. The question Deputy Martin may ask is why the Tánaiste did not intervene, why she did not contact the Garda Commissioner or the Garda or do so through officials. The reason this was not done is in the email. The answer is given to Deputy Martin in the last paragraph of that email of 15 May: the Attorney General and the Minister were advised by officials that they had no function in this. As Deputy Martin knows, under the rules of a commission of investigation, it is an offence to release evidence from a commission and to try to interfere in the work of a commission or tribunal of inquiry. I spoke to Sergeant McCabe last night. It was a relatively brief conversation. We spoke for perhaps 15 or 20 minutes. I felt, out of a courtesy to him, given that once again, through no fault of his own, he was at the centre of a major controversy, that he had a right to know what was in the email, at least before it was handed out in this House. I read the email out to him. He disputes its contents. He says these criminal allegations concerning sex abuse were not raised that day and not raised at all at the O'Higgins commission. He says the transcripts of the O'Higgins commission will show this. This leaves us all a little confused because we do not even know if the contents of the email were accurate. It was an email reporting a conversation between an official in the Department of Justice and Equality and the Attorney General's office. What was written in the email and sent to the Tánaiste was second-party or even third-party information. As Deputy Martin will know, Sergeant McCabe disputes that the issue that arose in the IRM, the criminal allegations, were ever raised at the O'Higgins commission. Why did the Tánaiste not act? She did not act for the reasons I have given the Deputy. However, she did act in other ways: she established the Policing Authority, one of the most major reforms to have occurred in Irish policing in recent years; she asked the Policing Authority to take an interest in bringing about new procedures and guidelines as to how whistleblowers could be listened to and protected within the Garda; she brought in Transparency International, the leading organisation dealing with corruption and the protection of whistleblowers; and she did what a Minister should do, that is, not to interfere in a commission or try to influence someone else's legal strategy, but to try to change things and put the right procedures and new practices in place.

No one has ever said the Tánaiste had a part in the legal strategy. We do not know who sent the email or to whom it was sent. Was it sent to the Secretary General? It only turned up last Thursday. Why the top of it was sheared off and why references to individuals were pulled from it I do not know. It states in the last paragraph "and I agreed". Who is the "I" who sent the email? I ask this rhetorically because I will make the point that the Tánaiste does not have to accept that straight away. She can engage with that person. What is going on here? There are all the public protestations from the Garda Commissioner and the Minister that they will offer the highest level of legal protection to this man, and here the Minister is being told that far from offering the highest legal protection, the individuals involved are going to go for him and undermine him via a case which we know the DPP is not pursuing - which no one is pursuing - and in respect of which the DPP said there was no case to answer. If this does not raise alarm bells in the Tánaiste's mind, I simply do not know what would. The Taoiseach mentioned the Attorney General and his conversation with Sergeant Maurice McCabe.

I referred to that yesterday. The content of what he is saying should alarm the Taoiseach even more because what is at the heart of this is a terrible vista: that an appalling set of actions were afoot to undermine this man's credibility and character. It is simply not good enough to say a Minister in charge of a portfolio relating to the most explosive issue to have hit the Dáil in the past three years merely stands by and allows the adversarial nature of the legal strategy to continue to undermine this man's credibility yet again.

I think the Deputy is confusing the role of legal counsel for the Garda Commissioner with that of legal counsel for the Department of Justice and Equality, which are two separate entities. I have nothing to hide. There is no one I am trying to protect. The email was sent by an assistant secretary in the Department of Justice and Equality to a number of people in the Department of Justice and Equality, including the Tánaiste's private secretary, who then passed it on to her for information, so she was informed that-----

There is nothing here to hide and there is no one here whom I or the Government is trying to protect. All we are interested in is the truth, and the best way we can get to the truth is to allow the tribunal to do its work. I ask anyone in this House or anywhere else who has information, and whose information has not yet been put in the public domain, information that I am not yet aware of, to put that information together and transmit it through the tribunal, which is the right thing to do. I have also asked the Department of Justice and Equality through my Department to do two things. First, I have asked it to go through a trawl of the documents again to see if there is anything that it has not yet come across, that it has not yet passed on to the tribunal and second, I have asked for a report on the implementation of the Toland report. The Deputy will be aware that a number of years ago, after the Tánaiste became Minister for Justice and Equality, she commissioned Kevin Toland to do a report on the functioning of the Department of Justice and Equality in order to set out a reform programme to modernise and improve that Department. I have sought a report on the extent to which that is being implemented.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	105	The fact that the Taoiseach says now that he has ordered a trawl of documentation and that he is revisiting the Toland report in respect of the dysfunctionality of the Department of Justice and Equality simply underscores yet again the seriousness of this matter and the fact that it is not an isolated incident. There are now serious questions over the judgment, competence and credibility of An Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I think her strategy has been precisely to protect her and her Government in this saga. The email, which the Tánaiste claims she forgets reading, plainly sets out a deliberate and cynical strategy on the part of the former Garda Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, to undermine and attack the credibility of Maurice McCabe. It is also clear that the Tánaiste was made aware that the Garda legal team intended using serious criminal allegations against Sergeant McCabe which they knew and, more to the point, she knew had been disproved. We now all know that the Tánaiste failed to act, despite the fact that the Garda Commissioner is immediately accountable to her as Minister for Justice and Equality. The Tánaiste parroted the line that the whistleblower would be given the highest level of protection by Government while at the same time allowing the leadership of An Garda Síochána to pursue such a malicious - not an adversarial, but a malicious - legal strategy. The Tánaiste was informed in May 2014 of the criminal complaint against McCabe. She knew that that complaint was disproved. How, then, when she opened and read the email a year later about the very same and disproved complaint, did she not grasp the importance of any plan to use this as material in the Commissioner's legal strategy, and how then did she forget ever having read it? The Taoiseach's position up to this point has been that the Tánaiste had no prior knowledge of the legal strategy before the fact. I take "before the fact" to mean before the cross-examination of Maurice McCabe by the commission. That cross-examination took place on 18 May 2015.I understand the date on the email conveying the malicious nature of the Garda legal strategy was sent to the Tánaiste on 15 May. That is three days prior to the cross-examination. Is that not correct? Does this mean that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald sat back and allowed Maurice McCabe to go before the commission in full knowledge of the Commissioner's vicious strategy? I do not think that would be a matter of forgetfulness; that would call into question the competence, judgment and honour of the second most senior member of the Taoiseach's Government. It raises very serious questions over the Tánaiste's fitness for office. She was given the opportunity last night to clarify her position. She chose not to do that. We did not get the answers we need. How did the Taoiseach come into the Dáil and misrepresent the truth - the truth - that the Tánaiste did have prior knowledge of the legal strategy prior to Maurice McCabe's cross-examination? Why did the Taoiseach persist with the "no prior knowledge" defence? Is that still the Taoiseach's position? Does he have confidence in the Tánaiste? How can she remain on as Tánaiste?

My role is to account for the Government to the House and it is not something I like to see happen. On one occasion it was with regard to the ODCE and it happened in part on another occasion when I got additional information after the fact. I am not satisfied with that. That is why I have asked for a full trawl of documents in the Department of Justice and Equality to occur. Any documents that are found should be transmitted to the tribunal. That is why I have asked for a progress report on the implementations of the Toland recommendations into the operation and modernisation of that particular Department.

We should point out the former Commissioner disputes some of this. That is also part of the tribunal. She has a story to tell, which I am sure she will tell in due course. What seems to be suggested here in the House today, certainly by Deputy McDonald and just now by Deputy Ryan, is that the Tánaiste should have had a hand, act and part in the Commissioner's legal strategy, that she should have ignored the advice of her officials and intervened in the work of a commission of investigation to tell a separate legal entity, the Garda and the Garda Commissioner, to change its legal strategy. If she had done that, we would be answering a whole different set of questions here today as to why the Tánaiste went against legal advice and the advice of her officials to interfere in somebody else's legal strategy.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	Last week was the week when the mask slipped and the honeymoon ended. We were told homelessness numbers were low, that homelessness was normal, that the homeless were to blame for being homeless. It was cold, calculated, to some extent co-ordinated, and deeply cynical. The people looked and saw the defenders of the system insulting the victims of the system and they did not like what they saw. Let us see how the Taoiseach does on the issue this week. If homelessness is a monster, this afternoon it is growling outside the doors of 23 households at the Leeside apartment complex in Cork city. The new owners of the apartments have issued them all with notices to quit. The new owner, Lugus Capital, does not attempt to hide its support for social cleansing. Its website boasts "On acquiring buildings, we completely refurbish them to a high standard, before re-letting with a focus on attracting young professional tenants." Sherry FitzGerald reckons this approach could increase rental income at Leeside apartments by €300,000 a year. Lugus Capital is the Irish manager for the Larea Fa Fund Li DAC which is ultimately owned by Bain Capital. Bain Capital, founded by former US Republican presidency candidate, Mitt Romney, mentioned more than once in the Paradise Papers, is one of the largest vulture funds on the planet. Residents who live in this apartment complex include many young families with kids going to local schools. One of them has received a notice to quit for 20 December. Another has received a notice to quit for 30 December. One of them had a notice to quit taped to their front door. Threshold reports that up and down the country profiteering landlords are using substantial refurbishment as the excuse to get rid of tenants, hike rents and get new tenants in. I have three questions for the Taoiseach. Will he ensure his Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government does not just address this loophole, but closes it in such a way that the residents of Leeside apartments and others like them are fully protected? When will this legislation be introduced? These families cannot afford to wait. Will he join with me and tell the House and the residents who are here in the Public Gallery that the actions of this vulture fund are completely and utterly unacceptable?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I appreciate the Deputy's concern about the duration of mine and the Government's honeymoon.I do not think there has been a honeymoon at all but I appreciate the Deputy's interest and concern in that regard. Homelessness is something the Government feels very deeply about and it is a matter we have prioritised. Since 2012 or so, the funding put into services for people who are homeless has doubled or even more than doubled. We are going to have an 18% or 20% increase in homelessness services spending next year and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government will either today or tomorrow announce a major increase in the number of beds available for rough sleepers so there can be a surplus number of beds available for them. That is particularly important over the winter. We have also put much work into developing family hubs to ensure there are no families or children on our streets and the numbers of those in bed and breakfasts and hotels falls. It has fallen since its peak in March. From there we will look to moving people from family hubs to new housing, and approximately 80 or 100 individuals and their families are every day being provided with housing by the State through different mechanisms. These are new tenancies. I read something about the Leeside apartments in the newspapers but I do not know all the details and I am loath to comment on something I am not fully informed about. The Minister has committed to changing or clarifying the rules around substantial refurbishment so they are not abused by landlords and they do not misuse this as a mechanism to evict people after carrying out minor refurbishments and increasing rents. The Minister intends, if not this week then next week, to clarify exactly what substantial refurbishment means. With landlords in general, it is particularly cruel to seek to give somebody a notice to quit or an eviction notice in the run-up to Christmas. I absolutely condemn that. At the very least, if the apartment block genuinely needs refurbishment, I am sure it could be left until the new year and the people living there could be given adequate and reasonable time to find new homes.

If substantial refurbishment is not genuinely required or urgent, those eviction notices should be withdrawn. The people living in that development should be given adequate time to find new accommodation if they can do so and they certainly should not be evicted before Christmas.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	134	That is not good enough. The Taoiseach has said he does not want people being evicted because of minor refurbishment but this is not a minor refurbishment. It is a €3 million refurbishment. If the Taoiseach changes the rule to outlaw evictions arising from minor refurbishment, these people will still get evicted. The Taoiseach has stated he does not want people being evicted in the run-up to Christmas, which I welcome, but does he have a problem with people being evicted in January, February, March, April or May? It seems he does not. Let us be clear about what is happening. This is a vulture fund that has gotten its claws into this building. They are putting 23 households, including young families, out on their ear in a market where if they look for a place, it will cost €1,000, €1,100, €1,200, €1,300 or €1,400, with queues of 50, 60 or 100 people going out the door and down the stairs. There are no homes to be had for these people. Is the Taoiseach prepared to say to his housing Minister that the loophole must be closed in such a way that the people in the Gallery and families like them around the country will not be evicted? They should be protected in the case of minor refurbishment and in general from the activities from profiteering vulture funds.

Sometimes houses, apartments and duplex buildings need refurbishment. Sometimes they are not safe as there are fire safety issues. Sometimes roofs need to be repaired. There are occasions on which houses and apartment buildings require substantial refurbishment. I do not know if it is the case in this instance and whether the substantial refurbishment is necessary and genuine. Either way, nobody should be evicted on such short notice in the run-up to Christmas. If it is the case that substantial refurbishment is not required, at the very least the people concerned should be given adequate time and many months to find alternative accommodation.

Is the Taoiseach, a former Minister for Health and a doctor, not mortified and embarrassed that on the show last night, Mr. Stephen Cussen from Limerick stated, "I pray every night that God will take me"? He says this because he is in so much pain. He has been waiting for three years for an outpatient appointment for a knee replacement and he is in severe pain. Stephen is waiting for a public appointment in Croom Hospital, which has a three-year waiting list. If a person pays for private treatment, he or she would be seen in six months. There are 2,700 consultants working in 47 acute hospitals across the country. A vast amount of doctors do great work, as the Taoiseach knows, and they would do more if the facilities were there to allow them do so. In 2008, a new consultant contract was introduced so anyone who signed up to this was limited in the amount of private work they could do. They were offered enhanced salaries to accept that contract. The aim of this contract was to control private practice in public hospitals and stop doctors going off-site to private hospitals. In this contract, a consultant was to do 80% public work and 20% private work in a public hospital to ensure private work was limited. The opposite seems to be happening in some cases and the public waiting lists are only getting longer. Mary, who is 75 years old, was on the programme last night and she had to sell her jewellery in order to have a cataract removed because she was blind in one eye and had ailing sight in the other. If she did not sell her jewellery she would have been on a two-year waiting list to have the cataract removed. Once she had the money to go for private treatment, she was seen within two months and paid €1,800 to be seen in the same hospital where she would have had to wait for two years. In the Limerick hospital where Mary was waiting, there are 1,272 people waiting for a cataract operation, with 407 people waiting more than 12 months. It was revealed last night that consultants in Limerick had a 30% private case load, which is way over the 20% level allowed in the contracts. In 2016, almost 24,000 private patients were seen in public hospitals in Ireland. That means in the past two years, almost 48,000 public patients have lost out to private patients in a public hospital system. There is something wrong with our health system if we are encouraging people to travel north to Belfast to have procedures carried out privately. Once they come home after the treatment with a receipt in their hands, the HSE will refund them the money. I have numerous constituents awaiting procedures, including knee, hip and cataract operations. One constituent is going blind waiting to be seen but the HSE has only said that the patient should travel to Belfast and the money will be refunded afterwards. Would any member of the Cabinet be happy for someone close to them having to sell their possessions in order to have a simple procedure like a cataract operation carried out?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	I saw the programme last night and it was a very interesting piece of high quality investigative journalism, examining statistics and following individual consultants in the course of their work. I would like to say I was surprised by the outcome but there has been anecdotal evidence for a long time in the health service of a minority - perhaps not a majority - of consultants not fulfilling their contractual obligations. They are not doing the public hours they are paid for and are seeing more private patients. The practice is deeply offensive and it must change. I remember when I was Minister for Health I asked for an audit to be carried out of accident and emergency department consultants to see how many patients they saw. This arose because of a tip-off from other department staff who were concerned that consultants were not seeing very many patients who came in the door. They were seeing patients in review clinics and private clinics relating to legal reports. They did not see the people coming in the door from ambulances in big numbers. To my knowledge, that was never done. In many ways, what we saw last night speaks to something I have raised on many occasions.That is something this Government now has to deal with. On the issue of waiting lists, the Deputy may not be aware that the waiting list for procedures for inpatients and day cases has now fallen for three months in a row. Part of that is down to the additional resources we are putting into our public hospitals. Much of it is down to additional funding for the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and I believe we will see waiting times falling for cataract and procedures such as hips and knees falling in the year ahead. Between April and now, the overall number of people waiting for an ophthalmology procedure fell from 13,552 to 11,863, and the cataract waiting list has fallen from over 10,000 to 8,667. We are starting to see results in terms of the additional money being given to the NTPF, and also the additional funding provided for insourcing, to do more work in our public hospitals. On the fundamental issue, the Sláintecare report and the all-party report on the reform of health, one of the recommendations was that we take private practice out of public hospitals. I agree with that; it is a good idea. The report recommends that a commission be established to examine how that would be brought about. It would be costly at approximately €700 million in a year and would involve changes to contracts. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, has already appointed that group, which is headed by Donal de Buitléir, to examine exactly how we can do that. It would be - if and when it happens - a game changer for our public health system. We would never allow what happens in our public hospitals to happen in our schools. Children could not come in to be taught in a private class with fewer pupils and a teacher who is paid more to teach them. We would never allow that, yet we allow it in our health service. I do not think we should. It means there are perverse incentives for hospitals to have more private patients because they can then generate additional revenues. Our public hospitals get about €700 million in additional revenues. In addition to that there is a perverse incentive for the individual consultant to make more money in that way. It has to change.

If that is a fact, surely now, in light of the information highlighted by "Prime Time", the Taoiseach will direct his Minister for Health to ensure an audit is carried out to find out what the consultants are doing to reduce the lists. Are they, in fact, working in a private capacity to the detriment of the people waiting on our public list? That is of paramount importance. The figures the Taoiseach quoted regarding the waiting lists shrinking are explained easily. The lists are shrinking because people have no choice but to go private. People are selling their possessions to go private. I have the figures for Cork and Kerry. Some 517 patients are waiting to be seen in Cork University Hospital outpatients clinic for ophthalmology review. Some 113 patients are waiting for cataract surgery in South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital. That is 630 people from the county of Kerry who have trouble with their eyes and nothing is being done to help them. What, in light of the programme last night, is the Taoiseach and the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, going to do about this very serious situation?

Perhaps it was done subsequently. I will check up on that. It is certainly something that I raised regularly in meetings with the Irish Hospital Consultants Association and the IMO. They would always deny it and say that it was a very rare practice. I do not think it can be denied any more. The Deputy will know that in this House there was huge controversy when we required Deputies to clock in to ensure that we knew that they were on the premises.

I do not think it would be a huge imposition on our hospital consultants to clock in so that we at least know they are on the premises and are not in private hospitals when they should not be. We are doing exactly what was recommended in the Sláintecare report. We have established a group under Donal de Buitléir to examine how we can separate and take private practice out of public hospitals, what it would cost, what the implications would be and how it would be done over a period of years. That is the fundamental action in terms of long-term reform. In the interim, for people waiting for cataract operations and hip and knee operations, we are giving additional funding to the NTPF to allow those patients to go privately. The NTPF does not just fund private hospitals. It also does insourcing as well in places such as the Eye and Ear Hospital, for example, and Cappagh. The number of people waiting for inpatient and day case procedures has fallen for three months in a row because of that. I will drive that forward and make sure it continues to fall throughout next year.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	About two years ago, after the general election of February 2016 there were many talks about different policy issues. The Independents were talking with various parties and we met with the officials in the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten's Department, to discuss the roll-out of broadband. That followed a general election in which Fine Gael made a commitment that broadband would be rolled out all over the country by 2021. I asked the officials not to promise something they could not deliver, but of course they proceeded to say that broadband would be rolled out by 2021. The tender document was to issue that autumn. The latest news is that it will be early 2018. There is no timeline for the award of the contract for bringing broadband to houses and businesses across the country. We are still in the procurement phase. Meanwhile, across the country businesses, SMEs and households are finding it impossible to grow. It is a huge hindrance to them and an inhibitor in terms of the capacity of business already in the regions of rural Ireland to grow and develop and indeed to attracting new business and investment into rural and regional Ireland. It really is farcical at this stage. I would like to know, in line with the programme for Government, when the procurement phase will end and when we can realistically have the extension of broadband by the State to homes and businesses across the country.

Currently 300 farms a week are getting fibre outside their door. We are passing two premises every minute of every working day with pure fibre. On the issue of the procurement process, it is a complicated process, as I have explained to the Deputy in the past. It is a 25 year contract. It is important that we get this contract right so that it does not end up like electronic voting machines-----

We need to make sure that this not only meets the needs of the current generation but the generations to come. It is a very complex procurement process. I accept that. However, what we are doing currently is putting the mechanisms in place so that as soon as the contract is signed the roll-out can begin as quickly as possible thereafter and that by 2020, 90% of premises in this country will have direct access to high speed broadband.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	The programme for Government contains a commitment to update the national eye care plan. The Taoiseach made some reference to it earlier this morning. Last night's "Prime Time Investigates - Public vs. Private: The Battle for Care", highlighted very serious issues and discrepancies regarding the time worked in public hospitals by a small number of consultants. I listened to 90 year old John Paul Harrington describe how he would have to wait four years for a cataract operation. The crux of the issue is the failure of the HSE to oversee adherence to consultants' private practice limits.As a result, some consultants are breaking their limits and spending a disproportionate amount of their publicly contracted time solely dealing with private lists. The Taoiseach is a former Minister for Health. Does he accept it is unacceptable for a consultant who is publicly contracted to do 39 hours' public work to get away with doing as little as 13 hours? Will the Taoiseach ensure that the Minister for Health and the HSE urgently address this issue?

The cataract waiting list has fallen from 10,300 to 867 and those waiting more than a year and a half have fallen from 1,694 to 421, which is a 75% fall in people waiting for ridiculously long periods of time. Our implementation model around eye care is starting to make a difference. Part of this is more primary care ophthalmology, which we think will also make a big difference. In response to Deputy Barry's earlier question, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, confirms that the new definition of substantial refurbishment will be out tomorrow and can be put on a statutory basis if needs be. He has also announced 200 additional beds, almost all single beds in rooms rather than cots, for rough sleepers in Dublin, which will be available over the winter period. The intention is that there be a surplus of beds available as a result.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	151	The programme for Government contains several commitments to support the self-employed. I want to ask about those forced into false self-employment. Thousands of people across the country are being forced into bogus self-employment rather than being given proper contracts of employment. This is happening in construction, in the media and in the growing gig economy in a variety of sectors. The problem is resulting in significant losses of employment contributions to the PRSI system, and workers are suffering loss of rights including sick pay, redundancy entitlements and so on. The taxpayer has been deprived of the PRSI payments employers should be paying and my colleague, Senator Ged Nash, published a Bill yesterday to outlaw false self-employment, a Bill which has garnered a great deal of support from across the trade union movement. When will the Government legislate in this area? When will the Government publish the report on bogus self-employment that was commissioned more than two years ago by the then Minister, Deputy Burton?

There is a section dealing with this area in my Department, known as Scope, and there will be a campaign around its activities in the new year to let people know exactly what their entitlements are and what avenues are available to them to self-determine or get an independent adjudicator to look at their case if they feel they are not really self-employed. I hope to issue the report sooner rather than later.

The Minister has since announced that he is withdrawing it but I understand that a statutory procedure has to come before the House for the House to decide to undo or remove the statutory instrument. There is only 30 days for it to be rejected by the Dáil but the tractors in question are necessary for our agricultural economy. We are running out of time, as the Chief Whip knows, as the end of the 30-day period is next week. When will the process to reject the statutory instrument be brought before the House?

In a tragic situation, another cyclist died last night bringing the number to 15 this year, a 50% increase on the previous year. I listened to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport answering questions earlier and whenever he is asked about sustainable transport his answer is always "I have no money". He only has billions and billions to spend on motorways and nothing to spend on cycling. What is going to change in the Government for it to live up to the commitment to promote sustainable transport and make cycling safe? Does A Programme for a Partnership Government mean anything? What is happening at the moment is not right and has to stop. Some 1,000 cyclists were outside the House yesterday, lying down on the ground because we are fed up with people ignoring the issue. What is the Government going to do about it?

We are all affected by road safety and by deaths on the road and most of us, or our families, would know somebody who lost their life on the road. There are more and more people cycling, to work and recreationally, and that is very encouraging. The bike to work scheme, which the Deputy was involved in initiating, has been very progressive. There is additional money for cycling facilities, reflected in greenways that have been built all over the country in recent years, including those for commuters along the Grand Canal. In the capital envelope for the next four years there will be more money for similar projects, for cycling priority in cities and for greenways and this will also be in the ten-year plan. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has tabled an amendment to the Finance Bill this week offering accelerated capital allowances, which are essentially tax incentives, to employers who put facilities in their workplace that are friendly for cyclists, such as bike racks to park their bikes and showers, in order to encourage more people to cycle.

The increase in the north west was 2.2%, compared with 11% nationally. During questions on promised legislation last week, Deputy McLoughlin stated that the Action Plan for Jobs in the north west was not working, something we have been saying for some time. The Taoiseach stated, "It will be a priority of Government in the months and years ahead to ensure that those parts of the country where the recovery has been slow will experience an acceleration in their recovery." I respectfully ask the Taoiseach to have a look at the national planning framework document for 2020 to 2040, which proposes five major economic zones, namely, Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Cork. There is nothing above the line from Dublin to Galway and no mention of Carrick-on-Shannon, Sligo, Donegal or Letterkenny. The plan is flawed. We do not want a fancy plan but balanced regional development where the north west has an equal chance of producing jobs.

Letterkenny, which is twinned with Derry, is indeed north of the Galway-Dublin line, as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will know. We want to avoid a repeat of the pointless, disastrous, unnecessary and useless national spatial strategy we had with Fianna Fáil in office. It started off quite well, with a number of growth centres and cities, but turned out to include 20 or 30 across the country and became a joke. That is not spatial planning at all.It is not a realistic objective to turn every town in Ireland into a city, it is neither realistic nor good planning and we will not produce such a plan. It is encouraging that unemployment has fallen in every county in Ireland. The number of jobs in every county has increased, but it is uneven and it is not merely a case of greater Dublin versus the rest of the country. It is much more uneven than people might think, for instance, there has been a large increase in employment in County Monaghan but not as much in County Sligo, as the Deputy is aware. The game-changer for Sligo will not be a planning framework but investment in very necessary infrastructure, particularly the N4 to connect that growing town to the motorway and road network, and also broadband. I anticipate these are the kinds of things that will be in the ten year capital plan.

Deputies across the House will be aware that respite care is a crisis for families across the country, and not least in County Louth. Following funding applications which have been made to the HSE for a unit for respite care in Louth which would provide for some 60 or 70 families in at 12 month period, premises have been identified and purchased by Praxis Care. The only thing that is preventing the project from happening is a commitment from the Government, through the HSE, to provide the funding. Will the Taoiseach ring-fence the money for this project immediately? There is no doubt that many families would benefit who are in serious crisis. I will continue to raise this issue until the Government realises that there is a major crisis in respite care, particularly in my own county.

It is something I am conscious of and it will be discussed at the Cabinet subcommittee on health tomorrow.

We have been waiting for this when last week, we read in the papers that the Government will means test the elderly to see if they will pay for some of the public home help they receive. I remind the Taoiseach that most of the elderly receive only a quarter of an hour each day, some of them half an hour daily, and occasionally two or two and a half hours in total weekly. Very few get any home help on Saturdays, Sundays or bank holidays.

I do not know if it would be possible to transfer funds from the fair deal scheme to home help. What is being considered, it may be at consultation stage or it may have completed that, is to set up a scheme similar to fair deal for home help and home care packages. The fair deal scheme works very well. People who need a nursing home and are assessed as such can get a place in about four weeks. Part of the reason it works well is that it is a statutory scheme with a standard assessment across the country and involves those who can afford to do so making a contribution. It may well be the model for a statutory home help and home care scheme which would guarantee people the home help and home care they need within weeks, but may include a contribution from those who can afford it.

In some cases, the homes are falling down and crumbling. I asked the Taoiseach two months ago had the report been discussed by Cabinet and he indicated that it had not. Has it been discussed since then? The deadline for the report's publication passed a year and a half ago, and what the homeowners have been waiting on since is a Government commitment that a funding scheme will be put in place to help remedy those homes in the same way it was done for the pyrite homes. Will the Taoiseach give us an update and a commitment on this today?

This is not happening. I am aware of two people who have been given serious cancer diagnoses who have applied for medical cards and are going through the rigours of the system to get them. It is difficult enough for a person who has received the serious diagnosis of cancer to cope with that without having to go through all the necessary paper work to get a medical card. I am not saying they should not be tested but there ought to be an emergency medical card given for the initial two or three months, at least, to allow them to start treatment. Earlier this week, a man who was beginning chemotherapy came to me. He had to pay out €600 for drugs, and he simply did not have the money. He was starting chemotherapy yesterday, on Tuesday. It is vitally important that a direction is given that when a letter goes in for a medical card from a GP or consultant in relation to a cancer diagnosis that it is given the urgency it requires, which gives space to the families to gather the necessary paper work, the P45s, P21s or P60s or whatever is required. In God's name, give the people that have received the diagnosis a medical card for a short period.

Professor Frank Keane undertook a detailed review on this matter and determined that it would be unfair to select some diagnoses and not others, that there could not be an automatic right to a medical card for cancer, for instance, but not for multiple sclerosis, that it would have to be done on other factors rather than diagnosis. On the cost of medicines, the maximum any household has to pay is €140 monthly and this will be reduced to €130 from January. We will continue to reduce this amount.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	189	The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016 is currently before the Dáil. It is a Private Members Bill sponsored by Deputy Gino Kenny.The Joint Committee on Health carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill and came to the unanimous decision that it should not proceed due to fundamental flaws in it. The committee's report was debated in the Dáil on 9 November and the Government chose to reject it, although it had been unanimously agreed by all members of the committee, including Fine Gael members. In his summing up in the debate, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, said he would not recommend that the report would be accepted by the Dáil, although he conceded that the Bill was fundamentally flawed. In fact, he recommended that the Bill should be redrafted rather than amended. The decision to disregard the committee's recommendation must have had the approval of the Minister for Health and the Taoiseach. I believe this has set a precedent for other committees that recommend Private Member's Bills should not proceed. Why did the Taoiseach adopt this stance, which effectively undermined the position of the committee as well as the Fine Gael members on the committee?

I did not find out about it until later that day or the day after. I cannot remember exactly when. However, there was no consultation with me on it at all. When I heard what had occurred, I was not happy. I felt Deputy Harty, as Chairman, was put in the invidious position of defending a report that had been agreed not only by the Government parties but, I think, by the main opposition party, only to have it unwind itself on the floor of the Dáil. I do not think that is the way for us to conduct our business and have advised Ministers that I do not want it to ever happen again.

This week Louth County Council's draft budget for 2018 was comprehensively defeated, with 75% of the elected members voting against it. This is a wake-up call that Louth County Council is dysfunctional. It is not able to provide a service to the community or local economy. There are poor public services and amenities and services are being removed. Above all, it is a lack of accountability and transparency which has led to this situation. For example, there is no proper assets register in Louth County Council. Houses were purchased four years ago but the audits that were carried out were not published. A lack of transparency has led to this situation. I know that the issue is currently on the Minister's desk. However, will the Taoiseach encourage the Minister to send in a strong team not just to listen to the concerns that were raised but also to examine the dysfunction in County Louth's local authorities?

He is examining the matter with the Attorney General and I am afraid I cannot give a further update at this stage.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	194	The programme for a partnership Government states that "we will commence the design of a new [emergency department] in Beaumont later this year with a view to funding for the construction being provided as part of the 2017 Capital Plan". By any stretch of the imagination, that timetable has now flipped somewhat. Budget 2018 provided just €100,000 to fund design team fees in this regard and the project will cost approximately €40 million, so we have a long way to go. There is talk of the project commencing in 2019 but I have my doubts about that. The HSE is still talking about preliminary design works, including appraisal, project brief, design feasibility studies and so on. To me, that sounds like we have a long way to go. This hospital was opened 30 years ago and is one of the busiest in the country. Its catchment area is rapidly expanding and it has an ageing population. There has been no major investment in the hospital since it opened. Therefore, when will construction of this long-promised emergency department commence?

Today I want to raise the issue of assessment of needs for children in Cavan-Monaghan. The reality on the ground for parents is stark. They are being told that it will take two to three years to get an assessment for a child they know has autism or another intellectual disability and needs intervention. Then, having got the assessment, in most cases they wait two to three years for the intervention, whether occupational therapy, speech and language therapy or physical therapy. The Taoiseach and I both know that early intervention is crucial and critical to the development of those children. Will the Taoiseach see to it that these services are delivered in a much speedier fashion?

This time last year, having raised this matter in the Dáil, I got a letter from the Taoiseach's predecessor stating that the Government would review the matter in the first quarter of 2017.

With regard to the programme for Government and phone coverage and the updated exempted development regulations for telecom companies, it is my understanding that a joint circular from the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the Minister for Rural and Community Development, Deputy Michael Ring, which includes the detail on the updated regulations and how recommendations should be interpreted by our local authorities has been shared with the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government. Those recommendations are scheduled to be discussed and reviewed in the Oireachtas before the end of the year. Their enactment would allow for the smoother deployment of telecommunications infrastructure, in keeping with proper planning, to ultimately enable better coverage of services for counties such as County Kerry. Does the Taoiseach have an update on the matter?

Only yesterday evening there was a preliminary meeting with a view to closer contact between the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and me on the specific question of the cybercrime Bill. That Bill is to give effect to certain aspects of a Council of Europe convention of some time ago. There are gaps in our law.

This historic Act truly embraced the notion that families are diverse and should be treated equally. Parts 2 and 3 of the Act provide for parentage through donor-assisted human reproduction and have yet to be commenced by the Minister. Numerous families are running into difficulty regarding birth certificates and passport registration. It leaves parents vulnerable when it comes to kinship rights and emergency decision powers. The Minister has gone on record to state that it is intended the sections in question will be commenced later this year. Could the Taoiseach confirm that this is still the case? If not, when will the sections be commenced?

On Brexit, I said that greater clarity and confidence regarding how a hard border is to be avoided was needed before we could say sufficient progress had been made to allow negotiations to move to phase 2. As I have said before, protecting the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process is a priority, not just for Ireland but also for all remaining 27 member states. Given that the UK Government has said the UK should leave the Single Market and the customs union, the onus is on it to indicate how the commitment to avoiding a hard border is to be realised within the parameters it has set. I engaged informally with Prime Minister Rajoy at the European Council in October and at the social summit in Gothenburg on 17 November. I have not yet had a formal bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister, but I look forward to having a chance to have more detailed engagement in the near future.  Ongoing political engagement with our EU and international partners remains crucial, especially as negotiations on Brexit proceed. I will, of course, see many of my EU counterparts in the margins of the EU-Africa summit next week. I attended my first British-Irish Council summit in Jersey on Friday, 10 November. It was hosted by Chief Minister of Jersey, Senator Ian Gorst. The summit provided a useful opportunity for me to engage with the Heads of the devolved Administrations across these islands. The summit focused on key political developments for all member Administrations, including the current political situation in Northern Ireland and the ongoing implications of Brexit. I expressed my regret that the Northern Ireland Executive was not represented at political level at the summit meeting. I briefed the council on our efforts in supporting and facilitating talks between the parties over many months and reaffirmed our commitment to continuing to work with the British Government and the parties to support the resumption of power-sharing in Northern Ireland as soon as possible.  We discussed the common travel area, border and customs arrangements, and the transition to a post-Brexit environment for all member Administrations. The discussions looked ahead to the next European Council meeting, in December. It will determine whether the Brexit discussions can progress to the next phase.  We touched briefly on the recent press coverage of the Paradise Papers. There was also a discussion on the creative industries, at which the Irish Government was represented by the Minister of State, Deputy Joe McHugh. The results of a data-sharing and measurement report produced by the British-Irish Council Creative Industries work sector indicates that this is an area that contributes approximately £98.8 billion per year to the economies of the eight Administrations.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	I agree. We met yesterday the British Prime Minister, Ms Theresa May. We raised with her a range of matters in respect of the current efforts to restore the political institutions. One matter in particular that we raised with her, and that I want to raise with the Taoiseach this afternoon, is the decision the British Government has taken to include a statute of limitations or a proposal for amnesty covering all Troubles-related incidents involving British Crown forces in a new section in its consultation document, to be published shortly, on the Stormont House Agreement Bill. We have lost count of the number of meetings we have had with British Government officials on matters pertaining to the Stormont House Agreement. At no stage was a statute of limitations or an amnesty mentioned by any of them as a possibility. Can the Taoiseach confirm that the Irish Government was also unaware of the British Government's intention to include this new section on legacy? This unilateral decision by the British Government is, I believe, in breach of the Good Friday Agreement and certainly of the Stormont House Agreement, which specifically dealt with legacy issues. It is worth recording for the House that, on reaching the latter agreement, it was possible for all parties to agree the mechanisms for truth recovery and legacy. That was a very important development. Does the Taoiseach share my view that the British Government's approach is unacceptable? It is evidence of bad faith in the midst of our efforts to restore the institutions. The Sinn Féin delegation also told Ms May that direct rule is not an option and that she needs to look to the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement for the establishment of the Intergovernmental Conference involving the Irish and British Governments. In this respect, I welcome the Taoiseach's statement yesterday that, in the absence of an agreement on the institutions, he will be seeking a convening of the Intergovernmental Conference in the new year. What was the British Prime Minister's response to this proposal when the Taoiseach spoke to her last week in Gothenburg?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	It is difficult to take three separate questions in one follow-up question. On the British-Irish Council and the division between Governments on core objectives, the mounting evidence is that we are in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. Over the past week, it has become absolutely clear that there is no effective working relationship between the two Governments. The extent to which they are talking at each other through the media is increasing by the day.I saw a bit more of that last evening at a function. In addition to a crisis with the Good Friday Agreement, we have the disaster of a chaotic Brexit process. Nearly a year and a half after the Brexit vote, nothing is clear and fears are increasing. On Saturday night Deputy Adams said Brexit was a unique and historic threat to Northern Ireland, yet he and his party still see no reason to allow the Remain majority in the North to have a voice in the debate. However, there is an even bigger concern, which is that it no longer seems as if the Government and the British Government have any sort of constructive relationship and are failing to engage properly with each other. I would like answers to the specific questions I pose. Legislation currently before the House of Commons has major implications for Ireland. Will the Taoiseach tell us whether he has made any submission to the British Government concerning the operations of the Good Friday Agreement post Brexit? For example, this week amendments concerning European human rights law are being debated, something which is directly relevant to the foundations of the agreement. What has the Taoiseach said to Prime Minister May about that? There has also been an attempt to introduce unilaterally what is being termed a security forces amnesty in other legislation. Has the Taoiseach been consulted on that? If so, what did he say? On the broader issue of the relationship, I get the sense that it is deteriorating week by week and that we are into a megaphone phase of engagement on Brexit, which ultimately and in the long term may not be to the benefit of anybody. We need to reflect on that and the Government needs to reflect on that. On Catalonia and the question on Mr. Rajoy, the fundamental point is that a de-escalation of that crisis is in everybody's interest. The idea that a partial referendum where 38% of the population voted is the final word or equally that the democratic leaders should be in prison are both unacceptable positions. We need respect for the fact that neither side has clear legitimacy in terms of the wishes of the people. Catalonian republicanism is not a violent republicanism. It has never had to suffer from any type of illegitimate campaign of violence inflicted, for example, on the Irish people by what I would consider a minority at that time. No one needs to waste years persuading people not to kill each other or to stop gangster-style enforcement of loyalty. The Catalonians, irrespective of the sides they take, have been very democratic. There is a need for dialogue and the Taoiseach should emphasise that when he meets the Spanish Prime Minister and urge a legitimate settlement between Catalonia and the rest of Spain through negotiated dialogue.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	The Taoiseach is in a very challenging period as we move to decisions potentially being made in respect of Britain's relationship with the EU and almost certain withdrawal in terms of the current Government, but I still hope the British people might ultimately be in a position to rethink that. At the end of the day this will come down to the Taoiseach being on his own in a room with 27 other Heads of Government and he will have choices to make. I think it would be the wish of everybody here in the Dáil to see those choices made as well as possible in the interests of the Irish people, the island as a whole, South as well as North, and also to move the country to a better place. I appreciate that it is a very difficult and in a way a lonely decision-making process that the Taoiseach approaches but he needs to share more with the Dáil about what his key elements are. The Belfast Agreement, as an international agreement, offers a great deal of flexibility. Does the Taoiseach see more opportunity at this point in both the North-South relationship but also in terms of the Intergovernmental Conference process and the east-west relationship. I read the remarks yesterday of the British Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. To be honest, his whole approach to Britain leaving the EU seems to have more to do with Bertie Wooster, Lord Peter Wimsey, “It’ll Be Alright on the Night”, and we are all good guys and girls and sure the Irish people are lovely.

He may well have been the inventor of it. Will the Taoiseach produce a paper on the options, choices and objectives the Government identifies in addressing the next stage of decision-making which is coming down the road? Has he given any thought to the Intergovernmental Conference? I know he is supportive of the Northern institutions recommencing. I hope Sinn Féin will reconsider its position in order that we can have a Northern Executive. Will the Taoiseach comment on those issues, please?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	223	My colleague, Deputy Burton, has given a fair character assessment of the British Foreign Secretary. My concern is that the general views of the British Government, as presented in terms of the solutions for Ireland when Britain exits the European Union, are completely unformed. That is profoundly worrying. Deputy Martin is correct. The necessity of demanding focus has caused strains between the Irish and British Governments. The Taoiseach was correct last weekend to be crystal clear on what is acceptable to Ireland. It is time now to require clarity from the British side. Generalisms will not suffice. I offer the Taoiseach the support of my party in pursuing that line of clarity. It is right for this country and it is right to demand that level of clarity. I have no doubt the Irish Government will come under pressure between now and the date of the next European Council meeting from people who are now all aligned with the Irish position in phase 1 but who will anxiously want to get into phase 2. I hope the Taoiseach will steadfastly maintain a position that it is impossible to move on to phase 2 without a definitive, clear, written understanding of how the Border issues on the island of Ireland are to be resolved. I wish to ask the Taoiseach a second question. It is an odd amalgam of questions. On the British-Irish Council meeting, the Taoiseach indicated that he discussed the Paradise Papers. The Isle of Man and Jersey in particular facilitate tax avoidance. Will the Taoiseach expand on the nature of those discussions? Some of the British dependencies have very peculiar legal structures. The Isle of Man, for example, is not part of the United Kingdom. Are the islands subject to the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process? Will they automatically share tax information, as 102 countries intend to do by next year with the revenue authorities of other countries? If they do not, could we have a process that would require them to do that?

Our party supports the Taoiseach in the approach he is taking with the British Government despite the kickback he is getting from that side. I would like to know the detail of what exactly we are looking for in terms of written commitment. What exactly is the Taoiseach seeking that would allow him to agree to move on to phase 2? I do not know if he can articulate that here. If not, he should be open to the possibility of using side meetings, as we did in the past, on the Brexit process in order that we maintain a well-informed, collective and committed agreement to the approach that is being taken. That would help us in Europe because we can keep our European colleagues briefed and supportive of the approach that is being taken. In the case of my party I refer to the European Green Party. That will not be easy. I was slightly confused by what was said last week because in the previous week the Taoiseach said he was confident the talks would move on to the second phase. How can we be so confident of that if, as it seems, we are so uncertain about the British position with regard to the Border?How does the Taoiseach explain the difference that has occurred in the past two weeks in terms of the sense of what is possible?

There are no amnesties from prosecution provided for in the Good Friday Agreement or any subsequent agreements, including the Stormont House Agreement. The Government has been clear that it would not look favourably on any proposal to introduce such a measure for State or non-State actors. Our position is and will remain that the rule of law, including the requirement under Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights for effective investigations of unlawful killings, must be upheld by all responsible authorities. The Government will continue to engage with the British Government and the political parties to seek an urgent move forward on legacy issues by establishing the Stormont House framework in a manner that will meet the legitimate needs and expectations of all victims and survivors as well as contribute to the broader societal reconciliation as an integral part of the peace process. The legacy process should not be about seeking to find an artificial balance or equivalence in investigations but rather about ensuring that we have a comprehensive approach. I was asked about the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. As I informed the House yesterday, in my meeting with the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, and her team on Friday morning in Gothenburg, I indicated that we would seek a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference in the new year should the DUP and Sinn Féin be unable to form an Executive before then. We did not agree a date for the meeting but it is fair to say that our request is in the context of an international agreement - the Good Friday Agreement or Belfast Agreement. I can see no reason it would be refused. It is simply going to be a case of setting a date. The view the Government is taking, which I imagine everyone in the House will support, is that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference deals with matters that are not devolved. If nothing is devolved, then the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, by definition, deals with all matters. That is the approach we are taking. Naturally, both governments would prefer if it was possible for the DUP and Sinn Féin to form an Executive. However, if that is not the case, then the governments will meet to implement the Good Friday Agreement in the absence of the political parties in Northern Ireland. Reference was made to the relationship between the British and Irish Governments. Personal relations are very good. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, has had any number of meetings with other Ministers, including the UK Foreign Secretary, Mr. Johnson, recently. It was a long meeting. I have met and spoken to the UK Prime Minister, Mrs. May, probably on more occasions than I can count in what has only been a six-month period in office. At official level there is deep engagement all the time. Often this goes on behind the scenes with those involved trying to understand each other's positions. The difficulty is not so much one of relations or relationships but rather the enormous policy gap that now exists between a United Kingdom Government that wants to leave the European Union - it seems to be pursuing a hard Brexit policy by leaving the Single Market and customs union - and an Irish Government that accepts the decision the UK people have made but wants to protect our national interests, not only those relating to trade between Britain and Ireland but our national interests in respect of Northern Ireland as well. We always explain in meetings that for many people in the European Union these talks might be about the financial settlement or economics, but for us it is about far more than that. Back 100 years ago our island was partitioned. We have spent the past 20 years trying to remove borders and bring people together in Northern Ireland as well as bringing Northern Ireland closer to Ireland while respecting the constitutional settlement. This is potentially a really major step backwards of historical significance. For us, this is about far more than trade, the economy and money. It is about far greater, deeper, bigger and historical issues. I think that is understood but I am surprised it was not understood from the outset by more people. I agree absolutely with Deputy Martin that we need de-escalation of tensions in Catalonia. There should be no violence either from people calling for independence or from state actors. I agree with Deputy Martin's sentiment that a referendum in which only 38% of the electorate voted for independence should not be the final say on the matter. We need dialogue. I understand that elections are now planned. I hope those elections proceed as normal. I wish to pick up on the questions from Deputies Burton and Howlin. We have a paper. It was published some months ago under the former Prime Minister, Deputy Kenny. We do not need to update it greatly because things have not moved on all that much from what was set out in that paper in terms of options, our priorities and the potential consequences. We have also set out clearly our objectives, including the objective to retain the common travel area and all the associated rights, in particular rights of British and Irish citizens to live, work, study as well as access welfare, housing and education in both countries as though we were citizens of both. We want the Good Friday Agreement to be honoured and implemented. A mapping exercise has been done on all the different areas of North-South co-operation. We want funding to be retained for PEACE and INTERREG programmes. We are seeking a transition period in order that business, individuals and families can adapt to any permanent changes that may arise. We want a deep and comprehensive free trade agreement between the European Union and the United Kingdom in order that our farmers, businesses and exporters can continue to trade as they do now. We also want the commitments that we have been given on the Border from the UK Government to the effect that there will not be a hard border, that there will not be any physical infrastructure on the Border and that any border will be frictionless and seamless, to be written down in such a way that we know the parameters for the phase 2 discussion. The way I have explained it in media interviews with the British press and, more important, in my conversations with the British Prime Minister and her team is that we accept that the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union. That is a decision of the British people. However, the British Government has made a further decision to take the Single Market and the customs union off the table before we enter phase 2 talks on the new relationship. The British Government has taken a political decision to narrow the parameters for the talks on trade and the new relationship. We want the parameters narrowed as well. What we want is to have the parameters narrowed in such a way that assures us that we will not have a return to the borders of the past, to use that particular language. Again, that is set out in the European Commission task force paper in respect of how we believe that can be achieved. The text is in the final paragraph. We think it can be best achieved if the United Kingdom, either on behalf of all of the UK or on behalf of Northern Ireland, commits to regulatory equivalence, that is to say, that we will operate the same rules and regulations. Without doing that, it is almost impossible to avoid some form of hard border. That is our position. It is the position not only of the Irish Government but of the EU 27. We are awaiting a response from the UK side, including an alternative proposal that we deem satisfactory. We have not received that yet. I wish to pick up on the comments of Deputies Eamon Ryan and Howlin. I very much appreciate their words of support for the position the Government is taking. We could be into a difficult few weeks and months ahead. This is potentially a historic decision for us. I appreciate the fact that the Deputies are supporting the Government decision to hold firm on this. We have the absolute support of the other European Union member states that are remaining. We have not come under any pressure as yet to soften our position. However, I am not so naive as to think that that may not occur. We will avoid at any cost being isolated. However, even if we are isolated, we have to hold to this position, in my view. I was asked about a meeting of the party leaders. I think that would be welcome as we reach decision points. Certainly, between now and the European Council on 14-15 December, that would be a very useful idea all around.However, I want to be at a decision point, not just at a point of ten different hypothetical scenarios, which is a little bit where we are now. I chose ten as a random figure by the way so there is no need to raise a query or ask a question as to what the ten scenarios are.  On the OECD and the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, I do not know if the Crown dependencies are part of the OECD or BEPS process. I learned all about the Crown dependencies when I was in Jersey. They are not in the United Kingdom or the European Union but they voluntarily adopt all EU acquis and law. As a result, they have access to the Single Market. It is an interesting model.

With the exception of politically appointed staff such as special advisers, all staff assignments, appointments and recruitment in my Department are the responsibility of the Secretary General and senior management of the Department. My Department uses workforce planning and succession planning to ensure there are sufficient staffing resources in place to deliver the Department's strategic goals. The number of vacancies in my Department fluctuates on an ongoing basis due to staff retirements, promotions and staff availing of mobility opportunities and career breaks. Where possible, my Department's human resources unit plans in advance for such vacancies and replacement staff are recruited.  My Department is a strong supporter of staff mobility initiatives across the civil and public service. Mobility opportunities are circulated to all staff in my Department as a matter of course and my Department also recruits staff using mobility initiatives, for example, senior public service, secondments, etc. In recent months, my Department has seconded staff at assistant secretary, principal officer and higher executive officer level to work in the communications unit; the international, European Union and Northern Ireland division; and the Government Press Office. A small number of vacant positions in my Department are in the process of being filled. These include vacancies for assistants and two vacancies at clerical officer grade. These vacancies are in the process of being filled through the Public Appointments Service's existing panels. The position of head of information and communications technology is due to become vacant shortly. The Public Appointments Service recently advertised for this position and the recruitment process is still under way.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. In June last, he informed the House that he intended to study staffing and roles in the Department before taking decisions about priorities. Will he indicate what happened to that process? When we discussed this topic last week, the Taoiseach indicated he did not know how many staff were assigned to specific policy areas. I hope it can be assumed that he dealt with the matter in the past week. Taking the contents of the Department's annual report as a guide, it appears more full-time staff will work in press and communications than on any other topic or issue in the Department. Is the Taoiseach happy with the message this sends regarding the fundamental role of his Department? Is he happy that as many staff will work in his new marketing unit as on running the Cabinet and more staff will work in the unit than on Northern Ireland, health, infrastructure and various other areas identified as the Department's core priorities? For clarity's sake, will he indicate what will be the position when the changes are finalised? Which specific areas will have more staff and which will have fewer staff? The Taoiseach pointed out that he does not appoint departmental staff. The exception was the head of the strategic communications unit because, as far as I can see, the Taoiseach asked for this appointment or indicated that the individual in question might be willing to take up the job. This was essentially a case of a nod being as good as a wink and he clearly had a significant influence on that appointment. However, other appointments are made by the Secretary General under the various departmental processes. The priorities are somewhat misplaced. 
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	230	The Taoiseach referred in some detail to the Brexit negotiations and the relationship between the Government and the government in London. He made the not unreasonable observation that he awaits a proposal from the British Government in respect of the Border issue on the island. I draw his attention to the utterly shambolic state of play in the British Government in respect of putting together anything that could be regarded as a coherent proposal. I direct him to a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee at Westminster on Monday, at which officials from the Home Office made it clear that no work had been done on this issue. When they were asked how many contingency plans they had drawn up for the Border, the reply of one civil servant, which merits direct recording, was, "That's contingent on what you call a contingency plan." This is what we are dealing with. I commend the Taoiseach on steering a steady course by insisting that matters in respect of Ireland, including the Good Friday Agreement and, in particular, the Border, must be dealt with. Will he rehearse for Deputies the capacity within his Department for dealing with Brexit? Will he provide some detail on the direct liaison he has with Downing Street and the British Prime Minister? Has anything additional been done or introduced to lock down that dialogue and try to get some kind of rhyme or reason from No. 10?

When I served as Tánaiste I was quite shocked to find that there were relatively few women at senior level - above assistant and principal officer level - in the Department of the Taoiseach. Given that the Taoiseach is the lead Minister, as it were, in the Department and has spoken of his desire to see women involved in equal numbers in many aspects of public life, has he taken any initiatives to address the gender divide? Off the top of his head, does he know how many departmental staff at assistant secretary level are men and women, respectively? As we know, the Department is expanding for the strategic communications unit. The gender breakdown of the Department at management level needs serious addressing.

I am staying out of it entirely. It is entirely a matter for the Secretary General to order the Department and decide how many staff are in each division and office, what they do and how roles are allocated. It is not correct that more people are working on communications than in other areas. The Department has more than 20 staff members working in the EU and international affairs division, for example. It is also important to recognise that the role of the Department is to support my work, as Taoiseach, and to co-ordinate the work of the Government and Cabinet. We have Departments of Health, Finance and Housing, Planning and Local Government. It is not necessary for my Department to replicate everything that is already in place across Departments. It is not necessary, therefore, to have a housing office with a housing adviser or an education office with an education adviser in my Department. That would be unnecessary, would duplicate work that is being done and would probably cause tension between my Department and other Departments if the latter were being second guessed all the time. We have extensive expertise across Departments and it does not need to be replicated in mine. My Department's role is to co-ordinate the work of Government, to run the Cabinet committees and drive the programme for Government forward, and to engage in troubleshooting and controversy management on a daily basis. The total budget for the Department of the Taoiseach will be lower in 2018 than it was in 2017. It is one of the few Departments where the total budget is being reduced. In terms of politically appointed staff, those appointed by me, the total number I have - this, of course, includes staff who are assigned to the Independents and includes civilian drivers - is 19, as against 23 for my predecessor. I have fewer staff than my forebear had politically appointed and he had many fewer, and they cost much less, than his forebears, the former taoisigh, Mr. Brian Cowen and Mr. Bertie Ahern. One is seeing a reduction in the number of politically appointed staff in the Department and a reduction in the cost to the taxpayer of politically appointed staff, which is something that is worth at least putting on the record of the Dáil. In terms of capacity, we have extended the capacity in the EU and international affairs section of the Department to deal with Brexit but we also have the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. More so than ever before, my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are working hand in glove. I am working with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, hand in glove. We have all the resources of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including all of the embassies and the Permanent Representation in Brussels, at our disposal. That amounts to hundreds of staff. We are not short-staffed when it comes to dealing with the enormous challenge presented by Brexit. In terms of the gender divide, it is certainly predominantly male at assistant secretary level and PO level.

I make a point of ensuring that I notice. There are a lot of meetings one goes to where it is all male or there is only one woman, and that is not optimum in terms of good decision-making. It is something that needs to change. In terms of my own staff, I have appointed a senior press person, Ms Sarah Meade, and Ms Angela Flanagan on the policy side. I am giving consideration to further appointments on my own side so that, at least when it comes to the staff who I can appoint and who are around me supporting my work, there will be greater gender balance than there is now. I do not have a role when it comes to the Civil Service end of the Department. It is definitely something that we need to have regard to, as vacancies arise and as people apply for positions in the Department, that we have greater gender parity and greater diversity because that means better decisions would be made, which is most important.

The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is a short-term interim solution for people who are looking for a permanent home. It is a support measure for those people who cannot afford to rent in their own right and who are on their local authority's housing list. I am from County Kildare and my constituency of Kildare North is in the commuter belt. Accommodation in the area is much sought after for positive reasons and there are currently approximately 8,000 people on the housing list in Kildare, which is a massive number. Those on the housing list need support and assistance in finding a permanent home, either through the local authority or by some other means. We all know that there is a shortage of supply and there is no point in me dwelling on that point because it has been dealt with extensively in this House. When one has a shortage of supply and a scarce commodity, the cost of that commodity will increase. In that context, we have a number of options if we want to prevent people from becoming homeless and to help those who are homeless to find a home. We can let them carry on as they are and do nothing while we wait for the supply to increase or we can review the current support mechanisms, which are not working in the case of County Kildare, and try to provide better support to people in order that they can access private rental accommodation. We must be honest and acknowledge that private rental accommodation is the only show in town for those who are on the housing list and seeking accommodation. In respect of those who show up to for viewings, for every family that has been approved for rental support there is another family that does not need such support, which is positive from the perspective of the latter. However, the people who have qualified for HAP and who are on the housing list are at a disadvantage. The Taoiseach acknowledged earlier today in the House that accommodation is very hard to come by. We have all acknowledged that but now we need to do something about it if we are serious about preventing people from becoming homeless.  The HAP scheme payment for a single parent or a couple with two children in County Kildare who are looking for a three-bedroom house is €1,260 with 20% discretion but the current rental price for such a house in any part of north County Kildare is approximately €1,450, so they are already around €200 behind the line. They also have to pay differential rent to the local authority based on their income. In these circumstances, they are at a severe disadvantage in terms of securing private rental accommodation they can afford. They are starting off way behind the line. This is leading to an increase in homelessness and the situation is getting worse. Even when the people who qualify for the HAP scheme view properties they know they will not be able to access them because the payments are inadequate. I ask that those payments be reviewed in the short term until supply increases.  There is also an issue with regard to the administration of the HAP scheme. It can take up to three months for a payment to come through after one applies for the HAP scheme. This also puts HAP applicants at a disadvantage vis-à-vis those who do not need rental support and who show up to viewings with a month's rent and a month's deposit in hand. Landlords or landladies are not going to wait for three months for a payment. If we are serious about dealing with homelessness we must help families to remain in their homes and we must also help families to get off the street. The Government must take this issue seriously and review the HAP scheme. We must do more to help homeless families to access homes. 
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	250	I thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this issue, which I am dealing with on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, who cannot be here today. I will begin by addressing the last point that the Deputy raised regarding the delay in the processing of applications for HAP. The point he makes in that regard is a fair one and I will certainly take up that issue because local government is in my remit. A reduction in the processing time is an objective that can be achieved. That would greatly help people who are trying to put a roof over their heads. The housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme plays a vital role in housing eligible families and individuals. There are currently more than 29,800 households having their housing needs met via HAP and more than 20,000 landlords and agents in receipt of HAP payments. A weekly average of 348 HAP tenancies have been set up during 2017 and over the past five weeks, the average rate has been more than 420 per week. As part of an A Programme for a Partnership Government commitment, the HAP rent limits were increased significantly by the Government in July 2016, and by up to 60% in some areas. The Government also provided local authorities with statutory flexibility to exceed the maximum rent limit by up to a maximum of 20% where necessary, and 50% in the case of eligible homeless households in the Dublin region. Both of these measures are allowing HAP households to find suitable accommodation and willing landlords. The local authority can determine, on a case-by-case basis, what level of support to provide, based on the tenant's current position and the needs of a household, as well as the market rents in that local area. It is also open to authorities to take a consistent approach in regard to the provision of discretion in particular high-demand areas or in regard to a particular household type that might be faced with a shortage of suitable property in the area in which they wish to live. From available data, at the end of the second quarter of 2017 - excluding the additional discretion available to eligible homeless households in the Dublin region - 12.6% of HAP households nationally were benefitting from the flexibility introduced by the Government in 2016 to exceed the rent limits and the average level of payment agreed stood at 14.9% beyond the rent limits. In the administrative area of County Kildare, 432 of the 1,128 households supported by HAP at that point, or approximately one in three households, were benefitting from the additional flexibility, with the average level of payment being agreed at approximately 13% beyond the rent limits. To address one of the particular difficulties in this area, local authorities are cognisant that increasing the HAP rent limits in particular areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support but are renting privately. In this respect, any changes to the HAP rent limits could have a significant knock-on effect on the other measures taken by the Government in regard to the wider rental market, such as the rent pressure zones that have been introduced to moderate rent increases in those parts of the country where rents are highest and rising, including Newbridge, Naas, the Deputy's area of Celbridge-Leixlip and Maynooth. In general, HAP applicants should be sourcing accommodation within the rent limits and the discretion available. The data reported by local authorities show this is happening, by and large, and people who can benefit from HAP are able to access accommodation within the support limits in place.

Everything the Minister of State has said in his statement is what I acknowledged in my opening presentation to him. If we are serious about dealing with the issue, we have to agree to reviewing it. It is just another issue. The Minister of State comes into the Chamber, as do his colleagues, including the Taoiseach, and say they are serious about dealing with the issues of homelessness. I will take him at face value-----

#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	253	He mentioned helping people find a home or a house. We can be flippant about it, if the Minister of State wants. I am asking him why people are homeless. Let us analyse that. The first reason people are homeless is that local authorities, through Government policy, are not providing them with a social house. Second, people cannot access private rental accommodation because the limits are less than market value. I am well aware of the consequences of doing it, but if we are not going to review this scheme and provide help to such families in the affected counties, rather than nationally, then we are saying to them that we are sorry but can do nothing. If the current market value is, for example, €1,450, and the discretion to which the Minister of State refers and which I have factored in is 20%, this brings it to approximately €1,250. We are saying the person is starting off over €200 behind the line. We know that and acknowledge it but we are not going to do anything about it for the moment, until stock comes into the market, which is at least two or three years away. I can see how seriously the Minister of State is taking this matter. Kildare County Council officials have raised this with the Department and have identified that this is a real problem for parts of County Kildare where HAP is not going far enough. This is adding to the homeless issue and adding to the number of people on the housing list who are not able to access the private rental market because it is unable to provide houses for them. The question we have to ask is whether we want to help these families. If we want to take them out of hotels and temporary accommodation or out of overcrowded family scenarios and provide them with some sort of short-term stable environment, I ask the Government to consider reviewing the points I have raised.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	254	The Deputy might learn some day that when he asks a direct question, he gets a script from the Department. In order to give accurate information, Ministers are requested to do this. The Chair will know that other Members, including Deputy O'Rourke, are not supposed to have scripts when they are speaking in the House but that is a Standing Order that is not observed by anybody. In regard to the seriousness of the matter, I have never had a discussion with the Deputy before and he clearly does not know anything about me. I know north Kildare very well and I know people who are involved in building in north Kildare. Before he entered the House, Deputy O'Rourke was involved in construction himself, as far as I remember. He knows the shortages that exist in north Kildare, despite the pure failure on his part to observe anything I said in my response. I opened my comments by saying that his point about the delay in processing applications was a valid one. He went on to completely ignore that acknowledgement and also the wider implications for those in private rented accommodation that could come if there was a significant change in the HAP scheme. I indicated all along, including at the start of my comments, that there will be a review of the HAP scheme. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has said many times that the housing options that are available to local authorities and individuals are under constant review. Deputy O'Rourke was a member of Kildare County Council and has not been a Member of this House for long. He might go back to Kildare County Council and look at the €6 billion in funding that is available from the central government to provide local authority houses. He might also reflect on the time before he entered politics, when he was building houses and when Fianna Fáil introduced legislation to privatise the building of public houses in this country - Part V and Noel Dempsey. Does he remember that fellow? I remember him. I used to come up against him when I was in the Seanad at the time. When the backside fell out of the private building sector in this country, there were no public houses that could be provided because Fianna Fáil had given the job to private sector people who were involved in construction, like the Deputy. I think there is plenty for the Deputy to reflect upon. I am one of the fairest people the Deputy will ever meet in this House but to accuse me of not being serious about my job and to have such a lack of understanding about responses to parliamentary questions and Topical Issues shows a degree of ignorance that ill suits somebody representing the people of north Kildare.

I have no doubt we are disappointed. Obviously, Ireland pulled out of its application for the European Medicines Agency in order to focus on the European Banking Authority but it is very disappointing. The European Medicines Agency had some 900 staff working for it but, more than that, tens of thousands of people come to it every year for meetings, conferences and so forth. The European Banking Authority is smaller, with only 167 staff, but it would have been a very useful signal to the world in terms of Ireland as a centre for financial services and as a centre of strong regulation in financial services, which is something we need. I was quite surprised to hear how it finally went. Dublin got down to the last three and then, in voting, actually did better than Frankfurt, which is a great testament to the diplomats and all of the effort involved.In the last round of voting, Ireland got more votes than Paris, which is where the authority ultimately went. Despite this, agreement was somehow reached that the location for the European Banking Authority, EBA, would be pulled out of a hat. Essentially, a coin was tossed. I am sure that the Minister of State shares my disappointment that Ireland felt that it had to pull out of the European Medicines Agency, EMA, bid and lost to Paris on a coin toss on the banking authority. For Ireland, Brexit is mainly bad news. We are in risk mitigation territory and the stakes are getting high in terms of Northern Ireland and border controls. As such, I acknowledge the diplomatic efforts that were made. The purpose of this debate is not to have a go politically, but it is a serious issue that we have lost out on this and it needs to be discussed by Parliament. I am most keen to try to understand what we can learn. I do not doubt that our diplomats did an excellent job, but we lost on both bodies. We should have won one, given that we have a decent centre for financial services and a considerable number of large pharmaceutical firms from across the world. There is a great deal of research and development and manufacturing taking place in Ireland. Our partners in Europe recognise that we are the most exposed to Brexit. While we withdrew our bid for the medicines agency, perhaps for good tactical reasons, we had a strong political and technical case for hosting it. I want to try to understand what we can learn from this. Many businesses, organisations, jobs and economic activities will leave the UK or are in the process of doing so. We must ensure that Ireland is placed as well as possible. My understanding is that, while jobs in financial services are coming over, they are not at the level that was expected. When I speak to financial services professionals in London and Brussels, they are surprised that many of the big names did not come to Ireland. Professionals in London told me that Dublin had been at the top of the list for many of these names, yet they decided not to come here for various reasons. Between the two agencies, how many jobs has Ireland lost out on? Will the Minister of State outline where we scored well and where we fell short in the evaluations? In terms of the banking authority, were Ireland's regulatory capabilities an issue? Was housing an issue, in that, if we had brought over 900 people from the medicines agency, would they have had somewhere to live? Was the cost of living an issue, specifically housing, rent and child care? Were locations in Ireland other than Dublin considered for these two bodies? What does the Government believe we can learn from having tried hard and failed in order that we can increase our chances of securing other economic activity as Brexit unfolds?

I have a script, but I will not read it. Instead, I will discuss what we went through for a few minutes and then answer the Deputy's questions. Approximately two months ago, I started what was effectively a road trip. In that time, I have been to 16 European countries. This was done to put boots on the ground, meet finance Ministers and try to put forward the best case that we could for the EBA. At the same time, the EMA was being pursued by officials from the Department of Health. Perhaps a month ago, we made the determination that we would not win the EMA. We had a choice between pursuing two bids or one. Had we pursued two, we were of the view that we would not get into the round of three on either. That calculation turned out to be correct. We put in place a strategy to try to win one of the bodies. A country could only win one; none could win two. If a country won one, it would be excluded from hosting the second. We withdrew from the bid for the EMA because we had always believed that we had a greater chance of winning the banking authority. That is why we prioritised it. We put boots on the ground. I thank the officials from the Department of Finance and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who put in a big shift, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, because the process was operated strongly for between four and six weeks. We did everything we could to win one of the authorities. I will try to answer as many questions as I can. The EMA and the EBA comprised approximately 900 and 200 jobs, respectively. One of my first visits was to the banking authority in Canary Wharf. Deputy Donnelly spoke about the bid, but this effectively turned out to be a political decision. The Commission carried out different types of assessment in respect of the EMA and EBA. It used a traffic light system for the former but not the latter, where it said that everyone was qualified. I never encountered questions about our regulatory capabilities when visiting the 16 capitals. Similar to the assessments performed by the Commission, issues of housing and the cost of living were not raised. No city in Ireland other than Dublin was considered. Primarily, the cities presented were capitals - Warsaw, Vienna, Paris, Brussels, Luxembourg, etc. As to what we have learned, I will not pretend. Along with officials, I spent a large amount of time travelling. I believed that we could get into the round of three and that, if we were up against Paris and Frankfurt, we could win. I turned out to be incorrect. We did not win, but we did not lose. It went to the toss of a coin. We have learned a major lesson. There has been reportage on it, some inappropriately negative. People have been saying that we have no friends. We went head to head against Germany and France. They are much larger countries than ours. We beat the Germans and, when their votes were distributed, we were level with the French. The French did not beat us. It was a hell of an achievement. I thank the officials in the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs and Trade. I will finish on one point. Our ambassadors and diplomatic corps on the ground have been superb. Their work probably goes unnoticed to some extent. They are professional and very capable. As such, I thank Deputy Donnelly for viewing this issue in a positive light. It is easy to take the Roy Keane view that, if we do not win, we lose. We were not beaten and we did not win. It went to the toss of a coin. I am disappointed that we did not win on the toss.

My understanding is that we were offering approximately €13.5 million in rental support and a further €1 million to help staff relocate. As such, some hard numbers were involved. Based on the scoring mechanism or the political considerations, might offering more money have tipped the balance? Has there been any ask of France? Maybe I am being naive in even asking this question, but France has a larger economy than Ireland and it is much less exposed to Brexit than we are. Were there diplomatic or senior political efforts to tell the French that, although they had been pulled out of the bag, this would have been ten times more important to us in relative terms and, in the spirit of egalité and fraternité, ask them to consider something else? Regarding the process of Paris being pulled out of a bag, which was essentially a coin toss, my understanding is that we scored better than Paris when Frankfurt was knocked out. The Minister of State is saying that is not the case.Was the Government okay with pulling it out of a bag? Should there have been more diplomatic efforts to make a case for Ireland, in particular in the context of Brexit? I referred to potential earnings. I acknowledge that the Minister of State and diplomatic team did their best and raising this issue is not about having a go at them. We have lost the Rugby World Cup, the European Medicines Agency and the European Banking Authority, despite having really good people on all of those teams trying to sell Ireland. There is a big sell we need to start winning on. Financial services, engineering and professional services jobs, as well as all manner of other jobs, are coming from the UK and, it is to be hoped, other places. We are under pressure in terms of FDI and the US. We need to learn from our losses and start winning. Does the Minister of State have any reflections on things which team Ireland can start to do in order to get more jobs into the country? We really need them.

Perhaps we could have that conversation if the Deputy tabled another Topical Issue matter. I do not say this very often, but I am absolutely satisfied that there was nothing more we could have done. To be frank, we pulled out all the stops. Everybody who was asked to participate did so really well. Many people did not believe we were in the race for the European Banking Authority. Many were of the view that we had made an error withdrawing from the European Medicines Agency bid. However, we said this was the only pathway for Ireland to get into the race for the European Banking Authority third round. We said that if we got into that we would be very competitive, and we were. We had 13 votes after the second round. The French had ten and the Germans had four. The Germans were subsequently eliminated and its four votes were to be distributed in the next round. One country chose to abstain by spoiling its vote and the French then got three votes. It was 13 all and it went to a hat. That was agreed beforehand. I am not sure whether Deputy Donnelly is aware that the European Medicines Agency also went to a hat. Milan and Amsterdam went into a hat before us at 13 all. They are the facts. More money would not have made a difference. We had a really good offering in terms of property solutions and staff relocations. Money did not become the deciding factor. Rather, it involved politics and larger countries, whereby Germany and France combined to level with Ireland. All three German votes went to the French. The core levelled with the periphery. That is the new dynamic and it is very interesting. Perhaps we will have a chance to have a coffee after this debate. That is the really big story in the European Banking Authority and European Medicines Agency because the Dutch, a smaller nation, also beat the Italians, a larger nation, and that vote was 13 all.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	262	I, along with my colleagues, wish to raise the issue of the Midland Regional Hospital in Portlaoise, specifically the action plan which has recently come into the public arena. I wish to put on record my disappointment that the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, is not present for the debate. He has responsibility for this issue. Given that four Deputies are raising the issue, it would have been far better for the Minister to be here. We will have to seek a mechanism to arrange a debate to ensure the Minister is here the next time. We have serious concerns about Portlaoise. Before considering these, we have to look at the overall national context in which the report was prepared. There are 685,000 women, children and men on waiting lists for surgery and outpatient treatment. The waiting times in many of our hospitals are totally unacceptable by European standards. Every accident and emergency department in Ireland is overcrowded. People are on trolleys in the majority of them most days. The ambulance service is creaking at the seams. That is the context in which the report was drafted. The report refers to closing the emergency department, maternity department, paediatric care unit, intensive care unit and all inpatient surgery in Portlaoise. The regional manager effectively only sees Portlaoise as a glorified health centre dealing with minor injuries and day procedures. Did those involved in the report think of the national context when drawing it up? It totally ignores the position of our health services throughout the country. The report is fundamentally flawed because it lacks an appreciation and recognition of the overall national position. For that and no other reason, this report must be rejected.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	263	I concur with Deputy Fleming. It is very disappointing that the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, is not present to deal with such a serious issue. If proposals are introduced by the Government to downgrade Portlaoise hospital, lives will be put at risk. There will be a knock-on effect on other hospitals, such as the Midland Regional Hospital in Tullamore. The emergency department in Tullamore Hospital has already been in crisis. For example, the emergency protocol was activated three times last year, a measure only used as a last resort. There is no way that the hospital’s emergency department could cope with an extra intake of patients. Common sense and decency need to be exercised in respect of the emergency department in Portlaoise. It must be retained. Ill patients will be put at serious risk if the downgrading goes ahead. Surely it is high time to set about improving our hospital services, rather than downgrading them. Resources should be provided to all hospitals in the midlands region. We cannot pit hospitals against each other. We are in the midst of chaos in our health service. It would be nothing short of reckless to pursue an action which would have dire consequences for patients. Such an action would also put our hospital staff, who are already under serious pressure, under much greater strain. People are very concerned and I want this matter passed onto the Minister, Deputy Harris. I ask that the Minister make a commitment that the emergency department at Portlaoise will not be downgraded. To do otherwise would put people at risk.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	264	I thank the Office of the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this very important matter. As the Minister of State is aware, there has been great concern in Laois and south Kildare regarding future health care services in Portlaoise hospital. Many of my constituents view the emergency department in Portlaoise as their natural place to go when there is a need to attend such a department. Many have used maternity services in Portlaoise, including people living in Kildare and along the border. From Athy to Monasterevin, Newbridge, Portarlington, Jamestown and Killenard, people see Portlaoise as their local hospital for emergency department, intensive care unit and maternity services. First and foremost, we must ensure that we have the safe delivery of services and that the services available to the people of Laois and south Kildare are of the highest standard. Previous HIQA reports showed deficiencies and risks to patients following the death of baby Mark Molloy. I recognise the update from HIQA last December, which pointed to maternity services now being improved and delivered in a safer way, but there are still issues with understaffing and the recruitment of non-consultant doctors. HIQA has pointed to the need for a strategic plan for the hospital and its future. A report was leaked to the media which is causing major concern in the area. The people of Laois and south Kildare need and deserve a number of things. We need clarity as to the future plans for Portlaoise hospital. We need the safe provision of health care services and a plan for the delivery of increased investment to ensure the safe provision of emergency and maternity services for the people of the area.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	It is very disappointing that the Minister, Deputy Harris, is not here to address this issue. This is not the first time he has not been present when important debates on Portlaoise hospital are taking place. Only a week ago, he failed to turn up for another debate on it.This hospital is on my doorstep. I have campaigned with others for over 20 years because of the constant threat to downgrade the hospital. Dr. Susan O'Reilly, who headed up the preparation of the report that was hidden for a number of years, has said she is now willing to engage in public consultation. She is talking from both sides of her mouth as the decision has been made and she is ploughing on with this. According to her, the only concern is the low volume of patients going through critical care in Portlaoise. Answers have been put forward by local doctors in response. The first plan was leaked to me almost four weeks ago and one was leaked to the The Sunday Business Post and they spell out exactly what is supposed to happen. The minor injury and medical assessment units will operate in the day time. The paediatrics, maternity and the intensive care units will be gone. According to The Sunday Business Post leak - these leaks are deliberate - 12 hospitals, including Portlaoise, will stop taking trauma patients and major trauma centres will be created in Cork and Dublin. What absolute insanity. Does neither the Government nor the Health Service Executive understand the need for a regional network of emergency units staffed and equipped to a modern standard? Dr. O'Reilly has not taken on board the need for the "golden hour" to be taken into consideration. This is the hour after a serious trauma, accident or injury. She has not explained how these patients will be transported to Dublin, Cork, Tullamore or anywhere else. The question is whether a patient is safer in the back of an ambulance or, in the first hour, getting to an accident and emergency department such as the facility in Portlaoise, which is well-established, well equipped and properly staffed. There is also a shortage of ambulances, with only one ambulance in County Laois on Monday and Tuesday nights. Will the Minister of State address that?
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	266	I thank Deputies for raising this matter. At the outset I reassure the Deputies that, as my colleague the Minister for Health, has stated, the most important issue in the consideration of services at the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise, is that patient safety and outcomes must come first. The Minister, Deputy Harris, is committed to securing and further developing the role of the Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise as a constituent hospital within the Dublin Midlands hospital group. He has said he will bring clarity to this matter in the coming weeks. Reports on Portlaoise hospital in recent years have pointed to the need for restructuring of some services to ensure patients are treated in the most appropriate setting by specialist staff who can safely meet their needs. Since 2014, the focus has been on supporting the hospital to develop and enhance management capability, implementing changes required to address clinical service deficiencies and incorporating the hospital into the governance structures within the Dublin Midlands hospital group. Significant work has been undertaken to strengthen and stabilise current arrangements for services at the hospital to ensure services currently provided that are not sustainable are discontinued and those that are can be safety assured and adequately resourced. The HSE has confirmed that hospital funding has increased by 28% relative to the 2012 budget and staffing levels have risen by 29% from the 2014 base. Funding of €300,000 has also been provided in 2017 to facilitate the opening of the new medical assessment unit. In addition, governance and management arrangements in Portlaoise hospital have been strengthened, additional clinical staff have been appointed and staff training, hospital culture and communications have improved. The Dublin Midlands hospital group has been working for some time on a draft plan for a new model of clinical service delivery at Portlaoise hospital. A draft plan was submitted to the Department of Health in December 2016. This draft report was reviewed in detail and was the subject of engagement between Department officials and the HSE. Significant additional work was undertaken by the HSE on foot of this engagement, resulting in a revised draft plan that was submitted to the Department in September 2017. I emphasise again that patient and public requirements are paramount and have underpinned the Department's consideration of the draft plan. The report is currently under detailed consideration in the Department of Health. Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended there will be further engagement with all interested parties to ensure the needs of patients, staff and the local and wider community are addressed. Any future changes to services at Portlaoise must take account of existing patient flows and demands in other hospitals, as well as the need to develop particular services at Portlaoise in the context of the overall service configuration in the Dublin Midlands hospital group.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	267	Everybody in Laois and in this House would accept and agree that patient safety is the most important aspect of the services in Portlaoise but this plan does not achieve that goal. In 2014, the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, produced a report at the request of the Minister and a second report was issued in December 2016. I will quote the statement of Dr. O'Reilly from two days ago. She states, "Specifically, in December 2016 HIQA again highlighted significant patient risk at the hospital and found that the governance arrangement in the emergency department remained largely unchanged" from 2014. Who was the regional manager from 2014 to 2016 who did nothing? In 2015, she announced the scaling down of the accident and emergency department, which did more than anything to undermine public and staff confidence. It put people off coming to take up positions in Portlaoise. Her actions before she put pen to paper to draft a report undermined the accident and emergency department. People said it was not a place to go to further one's career. That act did more to damage patient safety in Portlaoise hospital than any other action by any other person. She has done more damage than good to Portlaoise hospital. She should have spent those two years upgrading the accident and emergency department, as was done in the maternity section. HIQA found problems in the maternity area and there are now management arrangements with the Coombe, as well as extra resources and staff. The same is required in the accident and emergency department but she chose not to act. As a result, we are where we are. Looking at the national context of the report, one can see we need positive leadership for the region and somebody who will approach the matter positively so as to build services. Who would ever speak about closing hospital services, as proposed in the document, with 680,000 people on waiting lists? There is also talk of investment in the Coombe but the Government has already made the decision to close the Coombe hospital and move it to the St. James's Hospital site after the national paediatric hospital is built. I ask the Minister to meet Members now rather than after a decision is made. Dr. O'Reilly wrote to me last week asking to meet and I will do that next Tuesday to discuss the matter.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	The decision regarding retention of the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise hospital is in the hands of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, who should be leading by example. The approval of the proposed action plan submitted to the Department of Health is a policy decision for the Minister, so I urge him to take immediate action. It has been stated that lessons have been learned from other downgrades but has the Minister learned any lessons? More important, have such lessons been taken on board? The Minister should be able to make a commitment as soon as possible that there will be no downgrading at Portlaoise hospital and he should seek to reassure people who are, at this time, very concerned about the possibility of a reckless and short-sighted decision being taken. Such recklessness will put the lives of many patients at serious risk. For example, we can look at attendance at the accident and emergency department at Portlaoise, which should be taken into consideration. In 2016, there were a reported 39,212 visits to the department. This demonstrates that the department is very busy and there is a need for extra resources. The emergency department should be retained and I call on the Minister to make a commitment in this regard.
#MartinHeydon	unknown-#MartinHeydon-party	unknown-#MartinHeydon-dob	unknown-#MartinHeydon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	I thank the Minister of State for his response. I will focus on Naas General Hospital, which in some ways is inextricably linked with Portlaoise. Many of the people on the Kildare-Laois border have a decision to make as to whether attend at Portlaoise or Naas. The hospital at Naas serves all of Kildare and west Wicklow, as the Minister of State is aware, and it is under very significant demographic pressure. We have seen a major increase in our population in the past 20 years and the hospital now serves over 240,000 people. Last year the hospital saw a year-on-year increase in accident and emergency department attendance of 6.4%. That is purely because of demographics and it must be said that the management is doing a remarkable job in managing this increase. It is nonetheless at capacity.We got funding to move 1,000 patients on a waiting list for endoscopy services. They were dealt with through the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF. However, that still leaves 700 people on a waiting list for those services. We need the new endoscopy unit delivered for Naas General Hospital as soon as possible. Naas is under that type of pressure already. When we talk about the link with the services, what sets Naas apart from Portlaoise is that Naas does not have paediatric services. I have two young children and live in south Kildare. If there is an emergency situation, Portlaoise is the natural place to go. Tallaght is an awful long way to travel with a sick child. These are all causes of concern for residents of Laois and south Kildare. There is uncertainty in the ether. I want to see a very clear investment plan for the Midlands Regional Hospital Portlaoise to ensure that we deliver the services that are required in Laois and south Kildare and that those services are provided in a safe way in the best interests of everybody in that area.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	The real issue here is a lack of resources and staff. There have been some improvements. The budget has gone from €44 million to €56 million this year. There have been improvements in the maternity services, which have almost a full complement of staff now, whereas before they were working with less than half the staff required. Portlaoise has always been on the back foot. Ms Susan O'Reilly wants to spend €100 million on a fantasy plan. If €10 million of that were given to Portlaoise, I guarantee that we would have a good, state-of-the-art, properly equipped hospital. In reply to a parliamentary question I raised over a week ago, the Minister gave an answer similar to the one the Minister of State has just given. It seems as if the Minister is kicking the can down the road, because he said, "Once there is an agreed position on the draft plan, it is intended there will be a further engagement with all interested parties". The draft plan has been on the Minister's desk for the past year. Who is to agree that position? We need certainty. The answer to the parliamentary question and the reply here today do not give us any certainty. We need confirmation of what is happening. People in Laois and the surrounding counties are entitled to answers to that. Reports on Laois are getting worse by the week. It is obvious what is coming. The Laois faculty of the Irish College of General Practitioners and Midoc have expressed a total lack of confidence in Susan O'Reilly. She is due to retire in early January. She will go, but the local community will still be there. The people will be there. This is her plan, but it is on the Minister's head as to whether it is signed off on. The plan put forward by both the GPs and the Midoc staff mentions that, "it is recognised internationally that attempting to centralise high volume essential services produces risks for patients and does not achieve cost savings". They go on to say that it should be the bedrock of a system that is already low in terms of capacity. The Minister is here day after day. There is no capacity in the system. There has to be a regional network. I want the Minister of State to take that message back to the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. There has to be a regional network of fully equipped emergency departments. Portlaoise is in the strategic location for that. I want the Minister to come back quickly on this matter, secure the future of the hospital and put Ms O'Reilly's plan through the shredder. She is retiring in the first week of January and she needs to take her plan with her. The copy that the Minister of State has should be put in the shredder.

Deputy Stanley is correct to say that it is not about resources. The resources to the hospital have improved under this Government by €12.5 million over the past three or four years, which is a significant increase in investment in any hospital the size of Portlaoise over that time. Nobody has a monopoly on the right thing to do. I welcome the debate in the House and the opportunity for public representatives to have their say. Our duty, as public representatives, is to feed into this process, and we have to have the voices of local people heard in our hospitals because they are the owners. Other voices have to be listened to, which voices have as much if not more expertise in different areas which affect the future of hospitals. I am referring to clinicians and people who practice, and also, of course, to the management of the HSE and departmental officials. Public representatives are a vital cog in that as well. I welcome the opportunity to air the debate here. The draft report that we referred to was revised and resubmitted back in September after further consultation. There was a commitment that there would be an update on that report in the coming weeks. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, will give us an update on that revised report.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time." "We have a low level of homelessness compared to our peer countries", according to our Taoiseach. That has no factual basis whatsoever. "It is damaging to Ireland's international reputation that our social response to the housing crisis is being portrayed as dysfunctional", according to the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy English. "When somebody becomes homeless, it does not happen overnight. It takes years of bad behaviour, probably", according to Eileen Gleeson, director of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive. "Homelessness is a dreadful thing, but it is a normal thing. It happens", according to Conor Skehan, chair of the Housing Agency. Last week was a bad week for the Government on the issues of homelessness and the housing crisis. We saw an insidious, conscious campaign to normalise homelessness and to blame the victims of the housing crisis. The message clearly went out, from the top of Government, to set free the Fine Gael within. This happened. The callous, Dickensian approach of Fine Gael to those who are the victims of the housing crisis and those who are homeless was on full display. It was hard to conceive that it could get any worse, but it has. On the very day that record homeless-rough sleeper figures are released - 184 people, which is clearly an understatement - the Government is set to oppose our Bill. It is a simple Bill, which would mean that planning permission will be required for anti-homeless devices such as spikes, bars and sprinkler systems designed to discourage homeless people from seeking some shelter. It is a Bill which would allow local councils effectively to ban such devices through local development plans. I am awaiting the Government's reasoning for opposing such a basic, simple measure. Fundamentally, the Government has to decide if it is in favour of these anti-homeless devices. Is it in favour of sending a message to homeless people that they are not welcome and that they should move on? Is it in favour of making it even more difficult for rough sleepers to find some shelter from the elements that we have seen in recent days? That is what the Government's vote, and the vote of Fianna Fáil, will represent if they take that step, as I believe they will. There has been a proliferation of these devices around our cities, and, shamefully, leading the charge was the Department of Social Protection, as it was known, under the then Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, which has perhaps 50 bars in front of Gandon House, across the road from Connolly Station, to prevent rough sleepers from sleeping or resting outside that public building. People walking around will see them in Henry Street, Grafton Street, O'Connell Street, Temple Bar and right across Dublin city, and in towns and cities around the country. The approach that lies behind them could sum up the approach and the attitude of the Government, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, which appears to be see no homeless, hear no homeless, help no homeless. The way we are heading with these devices was demonstrated last week by Waterways Ireland, which gave a written notice to quit to homeless people, with nowhere else to stay, who were living in tents along the banks of the canal.It then proceeded to flood the area, literally to force them on their way. Waterford Whispers News captured it perfectly: "Government Unveil New 'Homeless Plough' To Clear Streets During Winter". If only it was just a joke and not close to the truth of the approach this Government is taking. We are heading in the direction of cities in America like Seattle, which have homeless sweeps of areas of the city where there are homeless people and sweep them out of the way on a regular basis in order that people do not have to see them, despite the fact that people protest and mobilise against these actions. That is the approach this Government is driving towards and which is encapsulated by opposing this Bill. I presume the Government will disingenuously ask: "Sure, is this the best that Solidarity can offer people sleeping on the sides of public buildings?" Obviously, it is not but in the past couple of weeks we have heard from homeless people, and from people active in fighting against homelessness, about the insufficient number of shelters, people only being able to access sleeping bags and the many people who do not want to go into emergency accommodation because of the difficult conditions in such places, especially in the form of drug use. We put this Bill forward to deal with one part of a huge housing crisis that affects most people in this State in some way or another. The profit-driven property market, the refusal of the Government and councils to build public homes and the absence of real rent controls have meant most people have been forced down at least one rung of the so-called property ladder. Those who previously would have bought homes now cannot afford them and only the top 15% of earners can get mortgages to enable them to buy homes. Instead, they rent. Those who previously rented now cannot afford to do so because, to be able to rent a one-bed apartment in this city on an affordable basis, a person needs to be on a salary of €42,000, which is quite a bit above the average. The 500,000 young people in this category are trapped at home or forced into substandard accommodation like bedsits. Those who cannot afford rent for bedsits or substandard accommodation, such as low-paid workers, are forced into emergency accommodation. Right at the bottom rung in terms of the impact of this crisis are those who have been kicked off the ladder entirely, those 184 people who we have now heard are rough sleeping in Dublin. We are concerned with the whole ladder and the whole of society. Tony Benn once said, "The way a government treats refugees is very instructive because it shows how they would treat the rest of us if they thought they could get away with it." The same is true for how the Government treats rough sleepers and homeless people generally. It is also true of how this Government and previous Governments have treated Travellers, such as with the 90% cut in the accommodation budget in the course of the crisis, and refugees and asylum seekers in the open prisons of direct provision. If people are being pushed down the ladder, there is another side where people are going up the ladder. There are 15,000 extra dollar millionaires in this country compared with last year and 63% of homes that have been bought in the past few years were bought by cash buyers, which include vulture funds and rich individuals. Cairn Homes owns 20% of residential land in Dublin and could build 12,000 homes but, instead, built just 94 in the course of 2017. Stephen Kinsella put it well in The Sunday Business Post at the weekend, writing that property owners were the people quietly benefiting from a crisis experienced by the young and the poor. He said our shortage was in housing and the result was misery for the poorest and happiness for the wealthy. Karl Marx put it more dramatically in Das Kapital: "Accumulation of wealth at one pole is ... at the same time accumulation of misery ... at the opposite pole". There are winners and losers from this housing crisis. The winners are the vulture funds, the big landlords and the developers the Government represents and the losers are everyone else - the rough sleepers, those in emergency accommodation, those facing unaffordable rent rises, those facing evictions and those who cannot afford to buy a home. The Government is callously indifferent to the need of all those people for a home and it repeatedly puts the right to profit of the winners before the rights of the others to a home. Fundamentally the Government does it, in the words of the Minister, because of its neoliberal ideology which means an absence of money and resources to build public homes. Figures this week show the incredible situation that councils have landbanks on which 38,000 homes could be built but that, since 2016, just over 1,000 have been built, between direct council homes and housing associations. In the four Dublin local authorities, with a combined waiting list of 33,000 families, just ten homes have been built this year. The answer is quite simple. As a small step, pass this Bill tomorrow, implement a Housing First strategy and recognise that the only solution to homelessness is for people to have homes. Build public homes, council and affordable homes, on a massive scale on public land to resolve this crisis.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	277	We are not suggesting for one minute that this piece of legislation is the solution to the housing crisis or homelessness. This Bill is simply a measure to ensure that people in the most desperate situations, who are victims of the failure of successive Governments and housing authorities, are not further persecuted and victimised beyond what they have had to endure so far from the lack of long-term solutions to the housing and homelessness crisis. It cannot be described as anything else. People are now putting sprinkler systems to sprinkle cold water on homeless people lying under doorways outside shops or businesses. As if it is not bad enough that their lives are in danger or that, when they ring an emergency number, they cannot get accommodation which they are not terrified to go into because of the drug use and alcohol problems in hostels and the fear that their clothes and goods will be stolen, meaning they are forced to sleep on the street, they then have to face the humiliation and indignity of a sprinkler system set up to sprinkle cold water on them while they are sleeping on the streets in winter. In other cases, spikes, bars and other barriers are put up to prevent them finding some sort of shelter from the cold and the elements. I will not believe the credentials of the Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy English, or the Taoiseach until we get an apology for statements made in the past couple of weeks on this unprecedented homeless crisis. The Taoiseach should not tell us he has compassion or that the Opposition does not have a monopoly on compassion. He should apologise for suggesting the homelessness situation in this country is somehow normal by international standards. That minimises a shocking and unacceptable crisis. The Minister of State, Deputy English, suggested that those who continue to protest and shout out about the homelessness crisis are somehow damaging our international reputation. What a shocking attempt to turn the tables on those who are calling out the failure of the Government and the authorities to deal with this obscenity. Is the Minister going to demand an apology from Eileen Gleeson of the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, who made the extraordinary statement that people ended up homeless as a result of years of bad behaviour? That is a shocking statement for anyone to make, or for Conor Skehan, head of the Housing Agency to talk about homelessness in this country being normal. If that is the attitude at the top, a situation which is already disastrous is destined to get worse. There should be apologies for this. The Government should pull back from this cynical and obviously orchestrated campaign, probably run by the strategic communications unit, to try to minimise the crisis. The Government needs to face up to it and do anything possible to stop the further persecution, suffering and hardship of people who are at the sharp end of this catastrophic failure by housing and governmental authorities. That is all this Bill does. Beyond that, it allows for the right of advocacy groups, the homeless themselves and others to oppose planning permission for anti-homeless measures - the phrase itself is extraordinary. What will happen if we do not stop these anti-homeless measures is that we will get more deaths. If someone cannot sleep under a shelter that exists at the side of an office building or shopping centre, or under a bridge at a canal, where will he or she end up sleeping? Will this person magically get somewhere to stay? No, he or she will not. This person will end up sleeping in an even more dark, dingy, dangerous, unhealthy environment, down a back lane where we know that the likelihood of death is greatly increased, and deaths will increase significantly. That is what this specific measure proposes: it is to end the further persecution of the homeless. Beyond that we are saying that the solution to this crisis is a massive increase in directly provided council housing on public land, rent controls that bring rent down to affordable levels, where rents are set at levels to prevent vulture funds or unscrupulous landlords from increasing rents to unaffordable levels, and stopping economic evictions by landlords or vulture funds. I will conclude by answering why we keep going on about council housing. I have heard the Government's response, which accuses us of only wanting to talk about council housing but that it is providing other types of social housing which is just as good. It is not just as good. There is a reason we are going on about council housing and its miserable levels of delivery. Can the Minister answer how many council houses were built in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, which is one of the best performing areas for meeting the Government's targets? There were six. There are 6,000 people on the housing list and that will be 10,000 by the end of the year. Last year the council managed to build 54, so the figure is decreasing but it looks better because we have approved housing bodies and more Part 5 schemes. That is not good enough and I will give a few examples why that is the case. Nicola is 13 years on rent allowance and after all that time she is 98th on the list. She has four children, of 13 years, nine years, three years and one eight months. All four children are in one bedroom. The mother's bedroom is too small for even the travel cot that the eight month old is in. The three year old is also in a cot which is far too big for the room and the 13 and nine year olds are in bunks and have to get dressed in the one bathroom. They have no hope of getting housed. She does not want to get a HAP, which is social housing, because at least the landlord of this rotten, insufficient, over-crowded place happens to be a not-bad landlord who will not evict her. If she goes to a HAP house that could be slightly bigger, she could be evicted and homeless again within weeks because HAP is not like a council house. One can be evicted from it and people are regularly. In the case of the Joyce family, there had been ten of them in a two bedroom house. Most of the members of that family have been in and out of homeless accommodation all their lives. Kayley, who is one of the children in the family, and is now a mother herself, decided that emergency accommodation would be better than living in those overcrowded conditions, with ten people over three generations in a chronically overcrowded house. Sarah Jane has four children. Her sister, who also had four children, passed away and now she looks after eight children in a three bedroom house and no garden. She is in an approved housing body house. The problem in this case is that it is not possible to transfer from approved housing bodies to a council house because of overcrowding. HAP is not like a council house. It does not give the sort of security, support and back-up that a council house provides. That is why we keep going on about council houses, but the Government continues to resist building them or is doing so in miserable numbers even though, as highlighted last week, we have sufficient land to build 38,000 council houses, where last year the Government built 400. The targets are miserable compared to demand. That is the solution: the Government must start using public land and resources to build council houses so we adopt a serious long-term solution to this crisis.

I will focus my comments on the actions being taken to help these people during this crisis. I will not use my comments to demonise people working in homelessness to help these people into supported accommodation, to misrepresent others, who cannot come into the Chamber to defend themselves, to normalise rough sleeping which is what this Bill tries to do, or to make homelessness a political football which I believe the Deputy and his colleagues are doing.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	280	This year we will support more than 21,000 tenancies in social housing supports. Next year we will build almost double the figures built by local authorities, housing bodies and social houses this year which was four times the 2015 figure. We will not return to the era of monotenure massive social housing estates because we do not believe in segregation and division, but in mixed communities. That is what we are doing with Rebuilding Ireland. There is €6 billion of capital ring-fenced with which we can provide for the needs of people on our social housing lists. We will be able to get people out of homelessness into secure, supported accommodation. That is what the Government is trying to do. We will not use this issue as a political football. At a housing summit in September, I emphasised the need for all local authorities to have sufficient emergency beds and appropriate facilities for every person sleeping rough on any night of the week. Today, the Dublin Region Housing Executive has reported a total of 184 people who were sleeping rough across the Dublin region on the night of 7 November 2017. We are in the process of delivering 200 permanent emergency beds so that a bed and all necessary supports will be available to anyone who needs it. All these beds will be brought into use over the coming weeks and will be in place by 18 December. There are already 1,850 beds in supported temporary accommodation to which these 200 are in addition. Exit from rough sleeping into Housing First will continue in parallel with this work. We support the Housing First model, for which we put beds in place and in coming weeks I will appoint a national director for Housing First. The Dublin Region Housing Executive will also implement its targeted programme to reach out to all those sleeping rough and provide them with the interventions and supports they need. Housing First is the best solution, but some people need beds immediately and these new beds will provide them on a permanent basis. These supports are being put in place with partner organisations. The facility I visited today on the Cabra Road will be funded by the Exchequer and operated by our partners in the Peter McVerry Trust. The people who use this facility will also have access to a range of health and welfare supports, as well as food and sanitary facilities which they would not have on the streets. Facilities such as the ones being delivered between now and Christmas will enable some stability so that the housing authorities and the HSE can work with individuals to see how they might exit homelessness into independent living. These beds are not just for the Christmas period. They are not temporary beds: they are permanent emergency supports. Our first priority when dealing with homelessness must be to look after those who are most vulnerable and that is the 180 people, and more, who are sleeping rough on the streets tonight, to get them safe shelter and sustainable supports.We are entering a cold weather period when people will be particularly vulnerable and it is imperative that we have in place a co-ordinated and robust response for anyone who might be sleeping rough over this period. Accordingly, I requested that a contingency arrangement be put in place in the event that any additional requirements arise during the winter and cold weather period. I welcome the DRHE's cold weather strategy, which was published today. This will see the availability of a further 50 temporary beds, if required, in addition to the 200 new beds that were also announced. There will be more than enough spare capacity in the system as an additional precaution. The cold weather strategy can also be activated during more extreme weather conditions. We saw the response for vulnerable homeless people during the recent Storm Ophelia, which was testament to that. This was implemented with our partner organisations in the voluntary sector. Given the cold weather expected over the coming days, arrangements are in place since last night with our partners, such as the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland, to ensure that additional temporary shelter will be brought into use across a range of existing services and facilities for single people and couples on a temporary basis. A contingency emergency response is in place permanently for any family who may be at risk of sleeping rough at any time. These beds are in addition to the 40 emergency beds that have already been delivered in the past number of months. Across the country, cold weather plans and initiatives are also being advanced. Local authorities in major urban centres have confirmed to me that they have robust contingency arrangements to meet any additional homelessness requirements as they arise during the winter period. In Cork, an additional 25 temporary beds are in place. In Galway, 34 temporary beds are in place. In Limerick, an additional ten temporary beds are in place. As the emergency beds and facilities are delivered over coming weeks, the DRHE has a targeted plan and programme to reach out to all rough sleepers and provide them with the interventions and supports that they need. As I have stated, my priority was to deliver permanent emergency accommodation in 2017 and there will be enough beds in place by the end of the year to meet the needs of all those who are currently rough sleeping. The officials in my Department and I will continue to monitor and review the situation as the winter progresses. We continue to face a crisis in homelessness. However, the situation is beginning to look like it is stabilising in Dublin, which is where our homeless problem has been most severe. The numbers continue to increase outside of Dublin, however, so we must take the actions that have arrested the increase in Dublin and apply them elsewhere. In October, the Dublin region experienced a decrease of one in the number of homeless adults and the number of families in emergency accommodation increased by one despite 88 new families entering services during the month, meaning that 87 families successfully exited homelessness in the same period. This follows two months of a decline in the numbers of families in emergency accommodation in Dublin. In the same month, the number of families exiting commercial hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation also reduced from 690 to 676, which is a 22% decrease in the number of families in hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation since the high point of March 2017. Last week, during Private Members' business, I spoke about the new family hubs which provide family appropriate transitional accommodation. I can now say that between now and January 2018 an additional 185 hub spaces will become available in Dublin and an additional 45 spaces in Limerick. Since the beginning of Rebuilding Ireland, in addition to securing housing for those who have already lost their homes, DRHE has worked tirelessly to prevent people from losing their homes. This has resulted in more than 600 preventions of homelessness in addition to more than 2,000 exits from homelessness since the beginning of this year. That is more than 2,600 people who would be homeless today if not for the coordinated efforts led by the DRHE and Eileen Gleeson. This is the product of many hours and weeks of work by the DRHE. We ask those who feel they are at risk of homelessness to link in with the DRHE at the earliest opportunity so that it, with its partner Threshold, can begin, in the first instance, to prevent the eviction or, where this is not possible, put the correct supports in place to ensure the housing needs of the household are met. The number of people accessing emergency accommodation in October was 8,492 nationally. This comprises 5,298 adults and 3,194 dependants. While the figure has increased, the rate of increase is much smaller and we are seeing the number stabilising in the Dublin region. The delivery of homes is key to meeting the needs of those experiencing homelessness. We will provide social housing solutions for more than 21,000 individuals and families this year and my Department, local authorities and approved housing bodies will continue to work closely, quickly and proactively to identify further solutions and increase social housing supports so we can give those in emergency accommodation the help they need. I am concerned that the effect of this Bill is to imply that rough sleeping is somehow acceptable and that owners or tenants of properties should in some way support this or at least not prevent it. We are well aware of the many anti-social behaviours that happen, unfortunately, on our streets during the day but we have the supports in place at night for rough sleepers to get them into secure accommodation, keep them safe and then get them into successful pathways to more sustainable accommodation in the future. I fundamentally disagree that this Bill is an appropriate response to homelessness. I believe that providing Housing First is a better solution and I know that I am supported in that view by our housing partners, such as the Peter McVerry Trust, which supports the Housing First model.

We all know that emergency accommodation should only be a first response. We want all homeless people - individuals and families - to be moved on to more permanent housing quickly. Many homeless individuals have complex needs that require supports beyond housing. We must work with the homeless individuals one-on-one so that root issues can be addressed and managed to help with independent living in the long term. This includes rough sleepers, long-term users of emergency accommodation, young people exiting care and those exiting institutions such as prisons and hospitals. The Housing First programme is critical in this regard and provides direct access to housing and intensive health, addiction and personal supports required for people who are homeless and have complex needs to maintain their tenancies. While using this model, 180 new tenancies have been created in Dublin under a consortium contract between the DRHE, Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust. We are now extending Housing First to all major urban areas outside of Dublin. The housing authorities in Cork, Limerick and Galway are working closely with the HSE and non-governmental organisations with a view to delivering 100 tenancies starting next year. As I said earlier, we are moving to appoint a national director of Housing First, who will be recruited shortly, to support the delivery of this important programme. This programme is being extended to other urban areas and we will work with the HSE and NGOs to ensure that those tenancies are delivered next year. In addition, €350,000 in funding is being provided to NGOs to appoint exit co-ordinators to support those exiting homeless services and report to the DRHE. The homeless inter-agency group established following the housing summit in September to deliver homeless services in a coherent and joined-up way between the relevant Departments and agencies has also met on several occasions and is working specifically to improve the homeless help supports and mental health addiction services in emergency accommodation facilities. In 2018, community mental health services and support teams will engage with homeless action teams to improve outcomes for people who are homeless and have mental health issues. Multidisciplinary teams, addiction and mental health and primary care will be part of the Housing First initiatives for individuals in Dublin and other main urban areas. These are real, tangible services and supports available to individuals who find themselves in this unfortunate situation which can have a meaningful and positive impact on their lives. They are more structured, more secure and safer and more likely to lead to a long-term solution for homeless people than the proposals in the Bill. For that reason, the Government must oppose it.

The Bill was described by the proposers as a mechanism to ensure that planning permission would be necessary to install anti-homeless devices which are currently exempted development. I would have thought that, historically, the majority of such exempted development structures and edifices were put in place by property owners and business owners in an attempt to protect their property from intruders, burglars and vandals and not to discourage specifically the use of their property as a refuge by homeless people.

#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	It is disturbing and sad to hear of such instances. It is sad to hear the contention that Inland Waterways somehow allowed the level of a canal to be raised to force those who were living in tents on the side of the canal to move. This should be investigated and the situation clarified. Rather than ruling this Bill out of hand, if actions such as those contended are prevalent, there is an opening for the Minister to explore whether, in the course of planning applications, guidelines could provide for such measures instead of disbarring genuine attempts by property owners, business owners and land owners to protect their property as they see fit from, as I said, intruders, burglars and vandals, especially given the week that is in it and the debate last night on the vast up-scaling in the level of crime in both rural and urban areas.It is sad to hear the frustration and anger expressed by many people and their fears for their property and themselves. It is sad they are contemplating the provision of tasers and other weaponry to protect themselves and their property rather than joining the Garda Reserve or ensuring the Government lives up to its obligation regarding the recruitment of gardaí and their deployment where required. I do not wish to enter into another protracted debate on the housing crisis because I, along with many others here, have made suggestions and proposals, passed motions and introduced Bills in this regard. One such Bill, on vacant sites, fast-tracking the provision of units over shops and providing accommodation in towns, villages and cities much more quickly than at present, will be taken on Committee Stage tomorrow. Bearing in mind the background to the legislation under discussion, it is sad that people in positions of strength and power have definitely given the public the impression, in an orchestrated way or otherwise, that our homelessness crisis is somehow normal and that we compare reasonably well against international norms. The figures collated in the first page of the OECD report constitute a warning against doing this, as has been said by many others. The comments of the Taoiseach, the Minister, his Minister of State and the chairman of the Housing Finance Agency some months ago to the effect that there was no housing supply problem and the more recent comment that our figures are somehow normal are a sad reflection on them. They have sought to retract or clarify the comments but, as was stated, perhaps it is time for them to put their hands up and say they were inappropriate, ill judged and wholly unsatisfactory and that they apologise for having made them and for the effect they have had on society. The Minister of State got completely muddled when he said the international reputation was being damaged because many firms that wish to locate here in our cities and regions are worried that, if they do, there will be a major question mark over the provision of housing and affordable housing. Today I met representatives of IBEC in my region, the midlands, and they were laying out their stall in the context of the national planning framework. One of the recurring themes, from company after company, was that of housing and its availability and affordability. It is now proving to be an obstacle to them in attracting a relevant and well-qualified workforce. I accept the intent of the Bill. I am surprised, worried, alarmed and saddened that it was felt necessary to put forward a measure such as this. I do not support it but I do believe there is an opportunity, under the planning guidelines and legal framework, for the Minister to address the matter and ensure that nobody is planning developments with a view to preventing the homeless from having a refuge. God forbid.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	The intention behind this Bill is worthy. We all agree there is a problem with the construction of spikes that prevent rough sleeping. It is a sad reality that, on the streets of our cities and towns, homeless people seek shelter in doorways and porticos. It is regrettable that property owners feel the need to place spikes at ground floor points to prevent this. Introducing planning legislation to prevent the placement of spikes is the wrong way to counter the practice, however. In our view, planning guidelines should state the specific security measures and locations that require and do not require planning permission. This would involve each local authority taking account of the particular circumstances of its area, for example, the acute circumstances of rough sleepers in Dublin city centre compared with circumstances in rural local authority areas. A common-sense approach would involve not only each local authority but also, in the Dublin example, local chambers of commerce co-operating to ensure spikes that are unsafe, unwelcoming and ugly are avoided at all costs. Most home and business owners are willing to engage with the practical issues that arise from rough sleeping on our streets. The text of this Bill is so poorly drafted, however, that its effect could easily have an impact on the legitimate rights of property owners to protect their homes and businesses from criminal damage or burglary. The critical section of the Bill states, "development shall not be exempted development which has the object or effect of deterring a homeless person from obtaining shelter from a structure, building or land". This is a very broad definition as nearly all legitimate security measures could easily be said to have the effect of deterring a homeless person. This is not the intention but I repeat to those who introduced this Bill that this is the wrong way to deal with planning matters such as this. Just last night, this House debated the dreadful fear that home owners and businesses are experiencing because of rural crime. Rural property owners, in particular, are vulnerable to being attacked, almost at will, by gangs that use our roads, such as the M11 and N81, to target properties all over Wicklow. This Bill could easily be misused to deter rural property owners from using legitimate security measures to protect themselves, their families and their properties from these criminal gangs. One has only to read the text to realise what I am talking about. I have been dealing with planning applications for more than 15 years, so I know the implications of the text. The Bill is not workable, not practical and can easily be misinterpreted. The issue of homelessness, with all the human tragedy it entails, and the issue of rough sleepers deserve far more comprehensive treatment than is evident in this Bill, however well-intentioned. There are complex reasons people are forced to sleep on our streets. Irish people are compassionate and regard the homelessness crisis as an unacceptable blight on their society. The Parliament of the people must take this crisis as seriously as it has taken the financial crisis. This Government still does not get it, and it still regards this crisis as normal. This is not good enough.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	My colleagues, Deputies Cowen and Casey, have been front and centre in addressing the housing crisis and have put forward some key priorities from Fianna Fáil's perspective. We have put forward numerous Bills, such as the Vacant Housing Refurbishment Bill, to get to grips with the crisis. We successfully pressed for further investment in social housing. The Taoiseach has claimed homelessness is not increasing and that it is low by international standards. That is simply untrue and misleading. The most recent figures show a total of more than 8,000 people homeless in Ireland, a record high. Nationally, there are in excess of 5,000 adults and 3,000 children homeless. This points to a clear example of a Government that has focused on spin over substance to date and that has downplayed the prevailing crisis. The change that is proposed will impose a larger burden on property owners in proving that minor development is required. Currently, there are more than 100,000 on social housing waiting lists. Despite this high number, only 658 social houses were built last year. In addition, rents have soared to in excess of 32% above the peak in 2008. This means that Dublin city dwellers are spending as much as 55% of their take-home pay on rent alone. The high house prices, combined with the Central Bank's restrictive rules, have meant that the home ownership level has reduced to a record low of 69% throughout the country. This is largely because the Government has scrapped the affordable housing scheme of 2011 and never re-established it. Although the Government launched its housing plan several times, it has not built a single unit in a number of counties. It has deliberately removed local authorities' role and slashed the Part V proportion to 10%.This restrictive policy has meant that the State is well behind. To put the numbers into perspective, in 2007 to 2010 Fianna Fáil built more than 14,000 social houses. That is, on average, more than 3,500 per year and 117 homes per local authority per year. The record high for Fine Gael is between 2011 and 2016 when it built 3,050 social houses, which is 508 houses per year, on average, and only 16 per local authority per year. The approach Fianna Fáil would take is different in that it would focus on the home first. We would focus on new units and wraparound service. We believe HAP recipients should not be removed from the social housing list. In order to make homes more affordable, we would establish a new affordable home purchase scheme on State lands, as well as establishing an affordable rent scheme on State lands. When we talk about homelessness and the housing crisis in Ireland and while I accept much of what has been said today, there is a perception that it only affects the larger urban areas. Even in rural constituencies such as mine in Cavan-Monaghan, people are on the social housing waiting list for three to four years. My local authority does not seem to have the capacity or wherewithal to build the types of developments that are needed when it comes to social housing. We have generations of families, including married couples, living with their parents because they cannot get on the property ladder and own their own home. In his endeavours to address this crisis I also ask the Minister to recognise the fact that it is not just urban areas where housing issues arise. It is also an issue in rural areas, especially when it comes to council housing.

I wish I had a much longer time to address the Bill. The first thing that is obvious from the Bill is that the local authority will be required to read into the mind of the proposer of a development as to the purpose of the development. That will give rise to a very strange situation. The greatest scandal of housing in this country, as well as people sleeping in the streets, is the way that over a long period, Travellers have not been properly accommodated in suitable Traveller-specific accommodation or in houses, whichever is their choice. There has been a total failure of society in general to deal with this issue. The Bill would provide an out to local authorities to continue to renege on their responsibilities to deal with this issue and to continue with irregular housing arrangements that Travellers are forced to adopt. It is time that we dealt with the Traveller housing issue. I have been working with Travellers for many years. One of the greatest scandals was the Carrickmines fire but an even greater scandal was the aftermath of the fire, where locals objected to the rehousing of those families on a NIMBY basis, not in my back yard, despite the fact that there are Travellers living in the area who have been housed for a long time and cause no disturbance. The usual NIMBY arguments often do not stand up. Above any group in society, Travellers would be the group most affected by the Bill and if anyone is really serious about dealing with this issue he or she should make a suggestion to the Minister. For many years we have relied on local authorities under Part 8 to vote for Traveller-specific houses. Many local authorities, including Galway City Council, have failed to grasp the nettle year after year. Galway City Council is in flagrant contravention of planning in Galway County Council's area. Despite the ruling from An Bord Pleanála, it will not grasp the nettle. I suggest that we stop leaving the decision on Part 8 planning for Traveller-specific housing to local authorities. Local authorities can make the plan for Traveller-specific housing in the normal way but related planning applications would be referred directly to An Bord Pleanála, which would have to take cognisance of the plan when considering any planning application and would allow for people to make objections in the usual way for a critical infrastructure process. If we were to do that it would do ten times more to provide high-quality, long-term suitable housing than the way outlined in the Bill, which just provides a quick lazy fix to a very serious problem.

There is no doubt that it is a time of crisis and that at such times we must come up with emergency solutions and often desperate measures are required. Many young people with children are presenting for social housing and in some instances they are being driven out of their home by certain circumstances. As a member of a local authority I was accused many times of dealing in the micro rather than the macro but I wish to deal with the micro and I will offer some practical solutions that might help to address homelessness. Currently, people who are in council houses are rightly obliged to advise the council of the occupancy of their house and that occupancy dictates the amount of rent paid. The living alone allowance is a vital source of income for many households together with the fuel allowance. Surely, during this crisis, and until such time as the Government gets to grips with the situation, a relaxation of the scheme would be allowed to operate to incentivise families to provide accommodation for relatives or friends in need. Figures have been touted of up to €1,500 being provided to HAP clients where housing is made available to accommodate a family unit and a lot more than that in the Dublin region. Surely a worthwhile scheme would be to offer genuine households an additional income of, for example, €500 that would be untaxed for making rooms in their home available until we get to grips with this problem. I asked a question last year about the number of people and the number of approved housing bodies. The response was that there are 547 housing bodies with 6,500 staff. Surely, if some of those staff were relocated back to local authorities to do the job they need to do, we would be able to solve some of the problems. I am very conscious of the fact that I seem to be always allowed in last. Last but not least I wish to refer to half acre sites that have been abandoned in rural areas. Consideration should be given by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to allowing some form of septic tank on them as that would bring back a considerable number of small housing units in the countryside of which people would be delighted to avail.

It is very simple and it is very reasonable because it is not looking to outlaw these devices; it is just placing a requirement on businesses or public bodies who would seek to put them on their premises to justify that through planning permission and to allow the rest of us to engage in that process. The Bill comes down to something very simple. If one thinks it is wrong for public or private property owners to put spikes on the ground or sprinklers under their doorways to stop homelessness, then one supports the Bill. If one thinks that it is justifiable, legitimate or appropriate, then one opposes the Bill. It really is that simple. This is not an argument to support rough sleeping. Contrary to what the Minister said it is not an argument to normalise rough sleeping but it is an argument against the further stigmatisation of people who, because of the failure of the State to provide adequate emergency accommodation, have no choice but to sleep rough. It is also an argument for common decency. I listened very carefully to my Fianna Fáil colleagues and I accept the sincerity of their remarks in terms of crime and the right of people to protect their property. However, there is nothing in the Bill that would prevent anybody anywhere from doing anything to protect his or her residential or commercial property because the specific devices we are talking about are spikes that go along the ground underneath a shelter at the front of a building or a sprinkler under such places. They are of no use to protect the properties the Deputies so rightly say are being affected by crime in rural and urban areas. I agree with Deputy Ó Cuív, in particular in respect of Galway County Council and Galway City Council and on Traveller accommodation generally.

It is disingenuous of the Deputy to suggest otherwise. Contrary to the claims of some people, no one chooses to sleep rough. I am pleased no one has made that claim in the Chamber today. However, sometimes in the public debate about homelessness we hear that people turn down emergency accommodation and choose to sleep outside. I work with some people who are rough sleepers. They tell us they are too fearful to go into emergency accommodation, especially dormitory-style emergency accommodation, because of the fear of theft and violence as well as the fear of being in proximity to drug use when they are going through detoxification. On these grounds, the decision to sleep rough is not a choice. These people simply believe they have no other option because of the failure of the State to provide either adequate emergency accommodation or any emergency accommodation. In some of the locations where rough sleepers tragically died recently outside Dublin no emergency accommodation of any kind was available, whether adequate or otherwise. Those people did not choose to sleep rough. The absence of a safe and secure emergency response or a better permanent response was the cause of their difficulties. It is appropriate to debate the matter today because three sets of figures have come out between today and yesterday. These figures are bad news on the homeless front. Other Deputies have already referenced the Dublin Region Homeless Executive figures for rough sleepers, which are disturbing. We have seen the Department's figures on emergency accommodation as well. I do not have time to go into the details now but I do not accept the Minister's interpretation of the figures as stabilising. A great deal is going on behind these figures. Yesterday, South Dublin County Council published its quarterly homeless figures report, produced by the strategic policy committee. Alarmingly, not only did the report show a significant increase in the number of people in emergency accommodation – the figures do not record children separately - but it also gave us figures for the number of presenters. The number of repeat presenters is especially alarming as is the frequency of repeat presenters at the emergency accommodation desk at South Dublin County Council. This confirms what we are hearing anecdotally, in other words, large numbers of families are presenting as homeless and there is no emergency accommodation for them. These families must present repeatedly throughout the month. In other cases, they may get into homeless accommodation in a hotel. Then they are put out because of the commercial decision of the landlord. Consequently, they are forced back into the system. What the Minister sees as stabilisation has more to do with the absence of adequate emergency accommodation. Families who have an emergency need are being pushed away from the emergency system and have to continue to repeat-present. If we had similar figures for the other Dublin local authorities, we would see the same pattern. I have no wish to take any time from my colleagues. I fully support the Bill. If Deputies are against the spikes on the ground and the sprinklers under the shelter that further undermine the dignity of people who are forced to sleep rough, then they should support the Bill.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	304	My colleague was diplomatic in responding to the Fianna Fáil contributions. I will not be as diplomatic because I believe some of them were rather cynical. It seems there was almost a competition among some of the colleagues to see who would come up with the best excuse not to support the Bill. An Teachta Ó Cuív won hands-down with his cynical remarks to the effect that there was some correlation between accommodation for Travellers and this Bill. This is a practical Bill. No one on the side of those who proposed the Bill - I heard them speak earlier - presented it as a panacea for the housing crisis. Of course it is not. Everyone in the House has put forward practical proposals to Government. In fact, I said to the Minister the last time we spoke on housing in the Chamber that not a week goes by when we are not in the Chamber challenging the Minister and his Government on the housing crisis. Not a week or a month goes by when the housing crisis does not get worse. Yet, solutions are available for the Government. The problem is that the Government is simply not implementing them. I have already had a discussion with the Minister about the all-party Oireachtas report, which was supported by all parties in the House. The Government is not even implementing the recommendations in that report. We would go further, but if the Government implemented the recommendations across a range of areas in that report, especially in respect of the number of new builds – the recommended number is 10,000 per year - it would solve many of the problems. This Bill deals with one problem and one problem only. Some businesspeople and some who own premises are using devices such as spikes and sprinklers to prevent people from sleeping rough. The spikes are dangerous generally. I have seen them in many different parts of Dublin in particular. I do not understand how anyone could see them as anti-loitering devices. They are dangerous. They should be regulated and the Bill is perfectly reasonable in this regard. It simply proposes that before any businessperson or anyone else can erect sprinklers, bars or spikes, they should seek planning permission. That is all the Bill seeks to do. It is one practical proposal to deal with one element of how we support those who are homeless. Those of us who support the Bill absolutely understand that more accommodation is necessary. We also need more supports and shelters for those who are homeless and all the other practical solutions which, unfortunately, the Government has not put in place.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	305	There is no more open expression of hostility to some of our most vulnerable and deprived citizens than the appalling use of anti-homeless spikes. The cynical term describing these inhuman barbs is "defensive architecture". With whom do these people think they are at war? What are they defending against? The city belongs to everyone as does the space within it. There are some positive controls, including traffic lights, to alert people to various dangers. There are acceptable barriers and rails in place for our safety and to stop people wandering into cars and buses. There are benches in the parks and picnic tables. These are inviting features and offer people a chance to rest and a place to bring their families. However, metal spikes in doorways and on ledges clearly make a hostile and aggressive statement. They suggest the owners do not want that sort of person there. They suggest such people are not as good as the rest of us and are somehow lesser beings. These are ugly statements to make to those who are destitute and homeless through no fault of their own. They represent the antithesis of Ireland of the welcomes. There is no céad míle fáilte for the homeless here. These features are not defensive architecture but abusive architecture. They do nothing to address the problem of homelessness; they force the problem to go somewhere else. The idea is that out of sight is out of mind. God forbid someone working in a big bank might have to look at a homeless person. Such anti-homeless devices are a direct assault on the homeless and on our humanity and dignity. They blame the victims for their plight. They divide us into the haves and the have-nots. This is not how I want us to be defined. This is not how I want our city and country to be defined. I have no wish for the problem of homelessness to be brushed under the carpet. I have no wish for the homeless to be labelled as some sort of untouchable caste. I want the homeless to be treated with dignity, respect and humanity. For many years, mention of social housing by councillors or deputies from the bigger parties was always frowned upon. This has led to the situation now facing communities. The idea has been filtered down over the years that social housing and homelessness are bad and that the people affected will cause us problems. That is nonsense. We built social housing estates in the 1960s and 1970s in large numbers. The biggest problem was that we did not put the facilities in place. That is what we need to do: we need to build social housing estates.

It is important to support the Bill, which seeks to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000. I wish to express my disappointment at the number of rough sleepers in our streets today. The Government has done little to fix the current housing crisis. It is now more than 15 months since A Programme for a Partnership Government was introduced. In the programme, the Government dedicated a whole section on ending the housing shortage and homelessness. Yet, today the Dublin Region Housing Executive published figures, including the figure of 184 rough sleepers in the city on the night of 7 November last. That was the highest this figure has been since the official count began more than ten years ago. I cannot see any substantial efforts being made to fulfil the promise of ending homelessness. I cannot see any actions being carried out to reduce it by the Government. In the first place, it is shameful that families are moving around our towns and cities, sleeping in doorways and under windowsills as they seek to find shelter from the weather. What is much more shameful are the barriers, spikes and water sprinklers put in place by property owners to stop homeless people from gaining shelter. These are truly inhumane measures that should not be allowed. Every week, new motions from all elements of the Opposition are introduced in an effort to tackle the housing crisis but we have seen little action on the Government side. Recent figures show that 1,442 families are homeless, an increase of 25% since this time last year. While I appreciate that the housing crisis will take a long time to fix, we have heard much talk but seen no action on housing shortages in my constituency of Cork South-West. Every day of the week, constituents on the verge of homelessness call to my office and visit my clinics. Many are sleeping in the homes of family members and plead with me to find them a house. The sad reality is that no houses are being built to meet demand.
#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	307	I received a telephone call today from a young man who expects and fears that he will be made homeless before Christmas. He is married with two children and cannot find a home for his family. All Deputies are dealing with homelessness. The motion is different from previous motions on homelessness in that it refers to the use of sprinkler systems and spikes. I have not seen these measures being used and I do not believe they are in use anywhere in County Kerry. Some people will choose to sleep rough because they are afraid to use hostels or places of refuge for various reasons, for example, the ready availability of drink or drugs, but I sometimes wonder if there are others who would not take any place to sleep to get them off the streets. I may be wrong in that regard. While Kerry County Council is proactive in providing housing and emergency accommodation, it appears to have stopped providing demountable homes. Planning permission is now required for this type of home. That was not always the case because I remember once when a family home caught fire that the council provided two demountable homes the following day. The large family concerned were living in these homes in their own yard the following evening. Why have local authorities stopped providing demountable homes? I am sure many local authorities have land on which they could provide such accommodation on an emergency basis to give families and single persons a place to sleep. At least they would be dry and would be looked after in some way, rather than being worried, as the couple who telephoned me today are, that they will be homeless before Christmas. The family in question has land but the local authority will not accede to my request to provide them with a demountable temporary home. I do not know the reason for its refusal to do so but I will try to find out again tomorrow. The Minister stated that money is not an obstacle. While demountable homes are a little expensive, they are an option that is not being explored. 
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	308	In case anything I say could be construed as a conflict of interest, I should declare that I have an interest in this matter. I compliment the staff of Kerry County Council's homelessness unit on the excellent work they do. Our housing investigating officers do the best they can to ensure people in the county who are facing homelessness are treated with respect. They do their best with what they have but the trouble is that private and council accommodation is extremely scarce. When plans are being made to address the accommodation crisis, I insist that all persons in rented accommodation have their own bathroom. The requirement to have a shower, toilet and so forth is sacrosanct. However, people give the impression that bedsits are awful places to live. If a bedsit is nice and provides proper space, there is nothing wrong with it. Years ago, people from Kerry moved to Dublin and spent years in bedsits until they were able to get on the housing ladder and buy a home. They were glad to have affordable accommodation. I welcome the recent television programme which showed people living in cramped conditions. These outrageous conditions should not be tolerated. However, there is nothing wrong with living in a bedsit. I ask the Government to consider this issue because bedsit accommodation is a sensible way of dealing with circumstances in which there simply are not enough places to live. Every village has empty houses. A system should be introduced to incentivise and encourage people to provide accommodation in empty units. While I acknowledge the Government is moving in this direction, we must make progress on this issue and try to have vacant dwellings turned into places where people can live safely, happily and with dignity. All we want is fair play. The argument is made that accommodation must be big. There is nothing wrong with small accommodation, especially for single people, provided it is nice, clean and has been done up. I ask the Government to take my suggestion on board. 
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	309	The old saying, "Not in my back yard", applies in this context. It is sickening and in no small way ironic that the House should debate this motion on a day when homeless statistics were published showing that the problem is not being solved. This will not come as a surprise to most people. Increasingly, Departments and business premises are taking measures to prevent homeless people from finding some semblance of shelter when they cannot secure a hostel place. Some may not feel safe using a hostel, which is very much an issue. Those of us who woke up during the night to the sound of torrential rain will not have been surprised by reports of flooding this morning and will find it hard to reconcile this with people being denied the possibility of finding a degree of shelter outdoors last night. While I sympathise with some small business owners who have health and safety concerns and must try to open their premises every morning, I find it hard to accept the practice by which Departments erect inhumane structures to prevent people from finding shelter, particularly given that the growth in homelessness is very much a failure of successive Governments. The issue is not the barriers per se, although I find them offensive and they make matters worse, but the need to deal with cases where people do not have a roof over their heads. My office is in Agriculture House. The side of the building could provide a decent shelter, although I certainly would not like to spend the night sleeping under it. However, a structure has been erected specifically to deter people who had previously used it as a shelter at night from continuing to do so. Deputy Paul Murphy noted that Fr. Peter McVerry said dignity is the first thing that is lost. This is compounded by virtue of the fact that people who do not have a place to sleep, to wash, to go to the loo or to eat are being told, by means of a physical structure, that they are not wanted even in an outdoor environment. When one gets the No. 66 bus to come into town and sit upstairs, one cannot but see tents in the Phoenix Park. None of us would have ever expected that we would have got to this stage. While rough sleeping is something people undoubtedly understood as homelessness, there is a whole range of other types of homelessness as well. It is deviating a little from the Bill but I refer to split families and several families often living under the same roof. I remember the housing rights campaign in the 1970s of one family, one home. It is shocking to think that in 2017, we are further away from what was aspired to at that time. The homeless figures released today show there are 5,298 adults and 3,194 children who are homeless. I never thought I would see a child who was homeless. The first time I encountered a child who was homeless and sleeping in a car was five or six years ago. I remember coming in here and speaking about it. I was horrified at the idea. We have stopped being horrified. We talk about numbers. That sense of outrage must be the driving force, for example, for Government. The language that has been used in comparing Ireland with other countries has diminished the sense of outrage we should rightly have. It is not normal. It should not be normal. It is not acceptable. It is particularly offensive for Departments, in particular, to erect barriers when they are part of the problem.

#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	312	I will use my time to reply to some of the points that have been raised in the debate by those who voiced their opposition to the Bill. However, I will start by commenting on the information that has been provided to us and to the country today on the number of rough sleepers in this city. We are told there were 134 such rough sleepers six months ago and that on the night of the count in October, that figure had increased to 184. Moreover, if one includes the 50 people who stayed that night in Merchant's Quay, there were 234 people who could not be accommodated elsewhere. That is a shocking figure. It is not a small marginal increase. It is not an increase that has happened over a period of years. It is an increase of more than one third in the space of six months on the Minister's watch. It leaves a bitter taste in my mouth to listen to the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, come in here and state, it is "beginning to look like it [homelessness] is stabilising in Dublin" on the day that those figures are released. This is a shocking failure on the Minister of State, Deputy English's, part and on the part of the Government. The Minister tried to recruit the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust as an ally in making the case against this Bill stating that the Fr. Peter McVerry Trust is for Housing First and is for providing homes instead of this approach. Fr. Peter McVerry supports this Bill. He participated in a press conference with us yesterday in support of this Bill. The other homeless charities also support this Bill. Let us have a little bit less of the political football from the Minister in that regard. In arguing against the Bill in the media during the week, a Government source incredibly stated, "We do not want to enable people to stay on the street, we want to enable them to find a home." That is not an argument against this Bill. A homeless person who goes tonight to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection office in Gandon House, across from Connolly Station, but who cannot sleep on a bench underneath a shelter because there are iron bars all along the line, will not get up and walk into a house because the Government has failed to provide housing or even a roof over that person's head. Instead, he or she will go somewhere else. If the person cannot get a place in such a building, he or she will go to a darker and quieter place, and the Minister of State knows where that leads to. There have been years of anti-homelessness laws in the United States and they show us where this leads to, if this policy continues. There were hearings recently in the state of Colorado about the anti-homelessness laws. They heard about the homeless man, who could not sleep outside a building, who went to sleep down a dark lane and was run over and killed by a car. They heard from five different women who had gone to sleep in dark quieter places and had been raped in those places. This is a criminal type of policy that the Minister of State, Deputy English, is defending with these anti-homeless devices. Fianna Fáil, in the course of the debate, made points about rural crime. It is a complete red herring. The idea that people will put sprinkler systems up outside their homes to stop the homes from being robbed is nonsense, as is the idea that iron bars on benches outside of buildings will stop burglars. They would be stopped from what, from having a fag after the deed has been done? The point is Fianna Fáil knows that it is nonsense. I will not go into it in any great detail. It is interesting that we did not see an appearance in this debate from the Independent Alliance. It is a busy day for them - the tickets to North Korea are officially being cancelled today. On the silence from the Independent Alliance, I would have liked to have seen the socialist Minister, Deputy Finian McGrath, or the socialist Minister, Deputy Halligan, come in here, look me in the eye and justify voting against a Bill that would ban sprinkler systems dousing homeless people with cold water on a cold November night. I will save my final word for the Fine Gael Members of the House, many of whom say that they were inspired to come into politics by the ideas of the "Towards a Just Society" document that was produced in the 1960s. The Minister of State, Deputy English, cannot defend the idea of a just society and oppose a Bill that would make it easier to stop spikes, iron bars and sprinkler systems being used against those who the Government's policies have denied even having a roof over their heads.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	313	Obviously, I support the Bill. This is a symptom of how society deals with people who find themselves homeless, not because they choose to be homeless but because society makes them homeless. Many Members in this House have stated how many are homeless today. There are 184 rough sleepers in Dublin today. That is 42% more than last year's figure. If anybody finds that normal, he or she is in the wrong game. They would be better off walking out the door here and walking away. That is not normal. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, even stated over the weekend that we have not seen the worst of this crisis. The Minister is right but the previous Minister said the exact same, as did his predecessor. Obviously, there is something wrong.I also want to refer to comments that were made about people who are homeless, including by the Minister of State himself, the Taoiseach and others. They were completely crass and insensitive to people who find themselves in a crisis of homelessness. As I said in last week's debate, it is almost like social whitewashing of homelessness, such is the level of debate on the matter.  The devices to which this Bill refers are completely crude and dehumanising. The term for them is "defensive architecture", which is quite incredible. This is even worse than the term "gated communities". The message is "stay away, don't come here". There are other cities across the world where the situation is similar to that in Dublin but they try to cater, aesthetically for want of a better word, for people who find themselves homeless. I was in Lisbon last year where I discovered that lockers are provided for people who find themselves homeless. Homeless people are provided with lockers to store possessions such as clothes and blankets. I am not saying that is normal. It is abnormal but in a society where homelessness is prevalent, it is a good thing.  These devices are completely alien in a civilised society. Any business that erects such devices should be boycotted. It would be a good thing if the Government tried to eradicate homelessness, although I do not think it is capable of doing so. I do not mean that personally in respect of the Minister of State. I do not think Fine Gael is capable of doing it because it is ideologically wedded to a market system and it believes that homelessness is acceptable in a market economy. As long as that belief system prevails, we will always have homelessness. We need to change the system. There are 8,000 people in emergency accommodation, which is a disgrace. There are 190 people homeless in this city today, which is also a disgrace.  I urge the Minister of State to support this Bill. While it is largely cosmetic it will send out a message that this is not acceptable and that homelessness is not acceptable.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	314	I am grateful for the opportunity to address the House on this matter. It is very important that we are here again, discussing housing and homelessness for possibly the seventh or eighth week in a row. That is where the focus has been for everybody in here. It is our number one priority and as I said last week, it is wrong to argue otherwise. Week in and week out, everyone in this Dáil chooses to make this the number one issue and that is right. We have today's figures, which the Government published. We count them and put them out there. Nobody is trying to hide from these figures. We admit that they are not acceptable and Deputy Gino Kenny is absolutely right in that regard. Regardless of ideology, nobody would accept homelessness as normal or want to accept it as thus. I acknowledge Deputy Kenny was not referring to me personally but my party does not accept or want that either and neither does any other party in this Dáil. That is not what we are about. This House has agreed to spend €6 billion to fund solutions to homelessness and rough sleeping. There is a commitment there in the form of funding.  Today I met all of the housing teams from the local authorities to discuss delivery timelines, moving projects forward, trebling our pipeline of projects and so forth. Deputies Cowen, Ó Broin and others have been saying for months that we need to improve the delivery timelines and so forth. In my discussions with the housing teams I make it clear that the minimum target in Rebuilding Ireland, which is to reach 10,000 social housing units per year has cross-party support. Many Deputies in this House want to do more and that is fine but we must have a plan to get there. However, I make it clear to everyone concerned that there is cross-party support for this. The Government has announced the amount to be spent but everybody here agrees that it is the least we will do. I stress to the local authorities that Deputies view them as the number one, front-line bodies to solve this problem. Local authority housing is key and local authorities, in conjunction with all of the other stakeholders, must drive this. We want them to do that and every week in the Dáil, Deputies argue that local authorities should do this and the Government agrees. I stressed to the local authorities, on behalf of everyone in the Dáil, that everyone here supports this. Some Deputies want them to do more but the money is there and the local authorities must make it happen and put projects in place. I do not want to bring ideology into this at all because we are all committed to solving this problem and if we are not, we should not be in here.  I welcome the discussion on this Bill. However, it is misplaced and unworkable, albeit well-intended, legislation that will not solve the problem. The use of these devices is wrong. I do not agree with these devices, which are not needed. Their use is not something I would encourage but I do not believe this legislation will solve the problem or even help the situation. It is not an appropriate response. We are in this House every week trying to explain what we are doing. Again this evening we heard some Deputies saying that the Government is doing nothing and that nothing is happening but that is not fair. It is not fair to all of the people who are working, week in and week out, to improve the situation. It is not fair to all of the people in the various housing bodies, non-governmental organisations and voluntary groups who are working night after night and week after week, spending fundraised and taxpayers' money trying to help people. People still come into this Chamber, week after week and say that nothing is being done. I have no problem saying that not enough is being done but it is wrong to say that nothing is being done. That does not reflect the work that is being done night after night and week after week.  I welcome the debate on this issue and would welcome more solutions to address the problem. We do not see this legislation as a solution, however. I accept that these devices are wrong and unnecessary but this legislation will not help rough sleepers or address their issues. That is what we need to face up to here. The issues faced by rough sleepers are complex and require nuanced and comprehensive solutions. A simple change to the planning code is not going to provide that. Some Deputies argued that the legislation aims to send out a clear message and I can accept the motive behind it. However, the legislation is unworkable and will simply complicate what we are trying to do, which is to prevent rough sleeping. We want to be able to help rough sleepers into different housing solutions, whether that is emergency or permanent. Mention was made of the Housing First option, which works very well in Scandinavian countries, in Canada and elsewhere. We introduced it here in the last year and it is working quite well. Approximately 180 people have gone through that system and while that is not nearly enough, it is certainly a solution for some rough sleepers. The idea is to get them a home first and then to wrap the services around them. In the past, the approach was to try to get the services in place first before moving rough sleepers into homes. We are turning that on its head and rightly so. We are working with the Peter McVerry Trust, Focus Ireland and others to make that happen. We are using taxpayers' money to make it happen and we want to do more of that. That is what we should do, along with all of the other solutions.  I am not convinced that this Bill is going to help. We are all in agreement that no person should have to sleep on the streets without shelter at any time of the year. The figures are horrific and there is no denying that. The latest figures indicate that there are 190 rough sleepers. I would argue that the core figure of rough sleepers is between 160 and 180, for whom we are trying to provide solutions. At the same time, there are far too many people living in hotels and other emergency accommodation, numbering approximately 8,500 and we must intervene with different solutions for those people.  Rough sleeping is an issue that we particularly want to address, which is why the Minister will announce changes to the cold weather initiative. We will put in place more emergency beds of a permanent nature. There will be an additional 200 such beds, building on the increased number of emergency beds that were put in place last year. We want to make sure that we can say, hand on heart, that there is a bed available for every rough sleeper and that such people could engage with the homeless services, although not everyone will want to do that. We try on a nightly basis, through both formal and informal arrangements, to engage with people and to encourage them to use the system. I understand that some people are afraid to engage with the services, having had a bad experience in the past. We are trying to provide a top-class service in all of the new facilities. While nobody wants to be in emergency accommodation, we are trying to improve the service and the standards therein. We are also trying to ensure that the existing facilities are improved. That said, all of these facilities are emergency in nature and are only meant to be temporary. We need to find permanent solutions and that is what we are trying to do. By the middle of this year, we had found an emergency solution for more than 2,000 people. Moreover, more than 600 people who would have been in emergency accommodation in hotels have found homes through various housing schemes. That is what we have to do to get ahead of the figures. It will take a bit more time because with roughly 88 homeless presentations per month, the problem is still getting worse. It is hard to get ahead of the figures. All of the interventions that were made last year and all of the solutions that were put in place were not enough. More money will be spent next year on more solutions. I would be very happy if Deputies would come into this House with more ideas and more solutions that could make a real difference. Some good ideas have been put forward and we have tried to implement them but I am not hearing any additional magic solutions over and above what we are already doing. We are committed to building 10,000 social housing units and are doing that. There have been good proposals in respect of affordable housing and other options and we will do more on that. However, nobody in here is providing additional solutions week after week. However, if good suggestions are made that we believe will make a difference, we will try to get them off the ground. We will try to do that, genuinely, because the resources are there to do it. Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae raised a couple of issues around vacant properties. I repeat to both Deputies that there are solutions to this issue. If anyone has a vacant property, we urge them to bring it forward and talk to the local authority. There are a number of schemes they can avail of to put the properties into use. I point out to Deputy Breathnach that Louth County Council has been a fine example of how to do this, and when people do not come forward, it can take their properties through other means. There are many options for people who own properties but cannot afford to get them back into the system. We will spend money on that and we will make changes to the system to make it a little easier. There has been a lot of feedback on the repair and lease-back initiative, for example, that it is too complicated, with too much red tape and requiring too long a commitment. We will make changes to reflect that. We change things when we get feedback. As I said, the Minister, Deputy Murphy, has announced an extra 200 emergency beds. They will be up and running during December and all beds will be in place by 18 December. In addition, other temporary emergency beds are being put in place for when the weather conditions get so bad that the people who do not normally engage with any service come forward. We have allowed for that and will try to deal with it as well. It is hoped that will give an opportunity to engage with them on long-term solutions. I think the Housing First approach is the right option. We need to do more of that and it is something I hope we roll out a lot more. Deputies made the point that local authorities need to lead this and I cannot stress enough that they are leading. We have put them front and centre. At this morning's discussion, the head of the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, Michael Walsh, said that in the past local authorities were driving the construction of social housing but they were told seven or eight years ago to stop and just to buy, lease and so on. He said we have now put them back in the position to do that. We are giving local authorities increased teams, increased powers and increased finances to be back in the space of leading the challenge to deliver more social housing. The approved housing bodies also do excellent work and I have asked local authorities and councillors to strengthen their relationships with them. Any proposed solution that comes through an approved housing body comes through the local authority as well. The local authority is in charge of that and it says yes or no before it comes to us. Local authorities are at the front of this and I want to reinforce that point, given it was raised in the debate. Deputy Ó Broin raised the point about repeat presentations. We are trying to intervene where, for whatever reason, people end up in a property or housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme and it does not work out. In some cases, the landlord withdraws the property, but in others it does not work out for the individual or family that goes into the home. We try to work with them more closely, perhaps by providing more services in order that they can stay in the house. For some families who are homeless for a long time or have a very complicated case, a traditional family home is a good way to get back into operating their own home in a secure environment with extra services and then, eventually, move on to a house. The Deputy is probably raising two different categories but he is focusing on those who were in a rented house or HAP house and it did not work out due to reasons associated with the landlord. That is something we are trying to deal with. We have put in increased teams to make sure we do not have people who come back again and have to re-engage. There is nothing worse than being in a homeless situation and living in a hotel or bed and breakfast, then finding a housing solution only to be back in the same situation six months later. We try to intervene to prevent that happening. There is a pipeline of projects but we have told the local authorities it is not enough and that we want it literally doubled or trebled. We have asked them to engage in a new system to make it happen more quickly and they are up for that. They have done it in the past and they are in that position. Now we have to make it happen even more quickly. I am asking all local authorities with their councillors to get involved with us on the new timelines and the Part 8 process to make this happen. Again, we have stressed that the local authority management should engage much more with councillors and the community to get acceptance for projects at a much earlier stage. The issue of Traveller accommodation was raised and it is one on which we are trying to focus, with changes, to make sure we get that money spent, as well as increasing the budget.

A constituent wrote an email to me about that and I wish to read a little of it before I give my presentation. She wrote:Dear Taoiseach,I write this email to convey my concern and absolute disagreement with recent comments made by Eileen Gleeson of the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, Minister of State Damien English and yourself. I won't repeat the comments but Minister English's comments about this concern for Ireland's reputation abroad were particularly galling. I write this not as someone living on the margins or at risk of homelessness, or as someone with any political motivation, but as a concerned citizen of Ireland and a resident of Castleknock, Dublin 15, who is fortunate to have a well-paid job. You could say I am one of people who get up early in the morning, to use your words.I do not have time to read the whole email but I think the Minister of State will get the tenor. If he, the Taoiseach, the Minister, and the homeless and housing officials who are representing their agenda think their particularly contemptible attitude towards homelessness is going down well among people, they are wrong. I could read the rest of it but I do not have time. I will send it on to the Minister of State.

#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	I want to begin by congratulating the Government for breaking a record - the highest number of rough sleepers since records began ten years ago, as my colleagues have said, with 184 in Dublin on one night plus 50 in the Merchants Quay café who were not able to get somewhere. They are not counted, by the way, in the Department's official homelessness report of October 2017, which counts only those availing of private supported or temporary emergency accommodation. Therefore, the homeless figures are obviously limited. In Dublin, there are 3,536 adults homeless and, nationally, it is 5,298, with 3,194 dependants, generally children. Obviously, we have the numbers on the housing list. As Peter McVerry, whom the Minister of State's colleague tried to use as a "partner", said, this does not include sofa surfing, people in massive overcrowding or those staying with family, given we have many parents with two children in rooms with their grandchildren or people in completely insecure and unaffordable accommodation. The fact these anti-homeless voices are being led by State agencies is particularly shocking, and this includes Waterways Ireland which should be condemned for what it is doing. The Government should issue an instruction tomorrow that it desist from doing that. The Government has obviously stopped counting deaths but 345 people have died on the streets from 2005 to 2015, and the number of males in particular has sharply increased. This is a serious problem of on-street homelessness but it is all interrelated. It is related to the people who are in emergency accommodation, to the people on the housing list and also to the people Fine Gael claims to represent, the people who are struggling to pay mortgages and rents. It is all interrelated. The Minister of State asked for a solution. It is not a mystery. We do not need to go searching for solutions and we do not need special committees. The solution is very simple. It is public lands and public homes. Yesterday it was revealed on RTÉ by a planner, Mel Reynolds, that local authorities have 12,000 hectares of land that could provide at least 38,000 homes. That is not to mention NAMA or other State agencies, just the councils themselves. The lands are already zoned and serviced, yet Dublin City Council last year built 56 public homes and my own council, Fingal County Council, built ten. Why, when the resources are sitting there, are they not being deployed? This brings home the fact there is an ideological issue. It is not, as the Minister said, that the Government does not want mono-tenure estates. It is because there has been a change in policy in recent decades. In the 1970s, some 8,000 to 9,000 public homes were built by local authorities routinely but that is now gone. Neoliberalism has reigned for the past 20 to 25 years in particular. That particular Thatcherite philosophy says no society exists. It slashes public housing and demonises those in local authority and public housing. The unfortunate thing for ordinary people is that the private sector is on strike. Land is being hoarded, as we know, and there is no willingness on the part of private developers to build until prices rise even more.Those prices are rising relentlessly. As my colleague showed at the start of the debate, this is working very well for a small number of people. Before I continue, I will briefly give examples of what could be done to address opposition to the Bill. One of the reasons cited for opposing it is the possibility of unintended consequences, for example, squatter's rights, but someone needs to have stayed somewhere for 12 years to get those. The excuses have actually been funny, particularly Fianna Fáil's. We have heard everything from concern for Travellers to burglars. They must be the dumbest criminals if they cannot overcome a few spikes and a sprinkler system. We have heard it all. Clearly, Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have decided that the business class that they ably represent at the best of times should not have to suffer the terrible difficulty of having to apply for planning permission for these devices. Of course this Bill is not a solution to the housing crisis. If the Minister of State recalls, we tabled a Bill last January that could have banned most of the evictions that have since taken place on grounds of, for example, the sale of a property or its refurbishment. However, the Government turned its back on that. We have proposed other solutions. This Bill is designed to highlight the Government's attitude in particular to the homeless. The Minister of State asked for solutions and said he never hears of any, but if all of the local authority land that I mentioned was used and planned out and the almost 200,000 vacant units-----

That is the solution. We have a proposal regarding Dublin West, which is the Taoiseach's constituency, and I challenge the Minister of State to support it. The council has sat on 90 acres of land in the greater Blanchardstown area for a number of years and has not devised a development plan. We could comfortably build at least 1,100 homes without any high density construction. They would be a mixture of apartments and houses. We could create a community with parks, facilities, an outdoor fitness area and a youth centre. We have called it "Damastown Village" and suggested a way to develop it. It would not be monotenure. If the Government wants to ban monotenure developments, it should change the local authority rules. This is simple. Allow more people into developments. We are proposing that 50% be affordable housing, with mortgages for the very people who are suffering with large rents that account for as much as half of their incomes in some cases. The other 50% would be social housing for homeless people in the area and those who had been on the social housing list for many years. We had an architect draw up plans, which Fingal County Council did not bother to do in recent years despite the homelessness crisis in the area escalating. We can pass these plans on to the Minister of State. The cost would be approximately €170 million. The Government claims that money is no object and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated that there was no shortage of money. Approximately half of that amount - €87 million - would be paid for by the affordable mortgage aspect and accrue profit of around €15 million over the 25 years of those mortgages, allowing money to be paid for community centres and community infrastructure. The other half would require Fingal County Council to use its capital budget, borrow €10 million from the Housing Finance Agency and receive an injection of €48 million from the Department. This is not a major request, given that 35% of the homelessness problem in Dublin is located in Fingal County Council's area despite it only having 22% of the homeless population. Is the Minister of State prepared to support something like this or does he want working people to travel up the road to Hansfield where McGarrell Reilly, which was named in the Paradise Papers, is selling houses for €315,000, which the Taoiseach believes is affordable? Houses in Damastown could be sold for approximately €170,000. It is being done in Ballymun, which shows that it can be done in Damastown. Why is it not being done? The Minister of State claims the Government does not need cross-party support, but it will get none from us anyway because there is an ideological divide. There are parties like Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party that are committed to, and put all emphasis on, the private market, and then there are other parties that believe in prioritising public need. Instead of cross-party support, a left alternative must be built and strengthened in this country. We need a left alternative that would break the EU rules for the common good, commandeer wealth and resources to end the crisis, pass emergency laws to stop evictions and run society, not in the interests of the 1%, the vulture funds and the developers, but in the interests of working class people as a whole.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	The Ceann Comhairle is spoiling the party. He is way too serious for this job. Although the Minister introduced a one-year benefit-in-kind provision in respect of electric cars, which is estimated to cost the Exchequer approximately €500,000, we should be doing more. This is not just a point for the Department of Finance, but any Department. This morning, I was arguing with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport in the Chamber. Ireland will have to change its approach. We claim to care, but our actions do not back that up. Last week, we saw the publication at UN climate talks in Bonn of the 2018 climate change performance index, which contained the not-so-surprising claim that Ireland was now the worst performer on climate change action in Europe. A few weeks beforehand, a study was published in which revised calculations of methane produced per head of cattle showed that global livestock emissions in 2011 were 11% higher than estimates that were based on data from the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, meaning that the figures being used by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine need to be revised and Ireland's standing on climate change action may be even worse than that damning report suggests. We are doing little to tackle the threat of climate change, our agricultural and transport sectors being the major culprits. We are increasing the beef and dairy herd even though we know that they are the most climate destructive and carbon and water intensive forms of food production on the planet. To stop being the worst performer on climate change in Europe, we need to face a few hard facts. As Mr. Ian Lumley of An Taisce pointed out at the Bonn climate change conference last week, global animal agriculture needs an exit strategy. We have got to change our approach. He stated that, if the target in the Paris Agreement is to be met, that exit strategy should be as rapid as necessary for coal, oil and gas. In that spirit, we need to get oil, coal and gas out of our transport sector as fast as possible.We need to consider increasing benefit-in-kind for those who purchase electric cars through work, and I have recommended a period of five years. The Minister might say that is off the Richter scale, but it would not be a mad expense. I do not have figures, but it is something worth considering. As the Minister knows, I am seeking a review. I am not saying this has to happen now, otherwise my amendment would have been ruled out of order because I would have transgressed the money message rule. Assessing whether this is value-for-money cannot be a bad idea. It is not a mad notion for me to come up with. If we are serious about electric cars, we also have to get serious about how we produce electricity. Unfortunately, we are not the cleanest producers of electricity around. In fact, if one was to compare us with western European countries I doubt any would be in as poor a place as we are. The burning of coal in Moneypoint should stop. The State should borrow in order to provide massive investment in solar, wind and water renewable power. Much like the housing crisis, the private sector will not fill that gap. The State has a significant responsibility to come up to the plate and it can do so. We know we do not have an endless supply of money, but the State has to play a stronger role in tackling climate change. Everyone has seen their electricity prices rise of late, as the PSO levy has increased. We have been told this is to help to pay for new renewable projects, but in reality we are subsidising the highly inefficient and destructive burning of peat at power stations while we convert them to biomass, another climate disaster in the making. Future generations will thank us if we play a positive role now and deal with these issues. The Minister has probably heard what people in the industry have said about going from one to five years. Alan Nolan, the director general of The Society of the Irish Motor Industry, welcomed the move to promote electric cars in the first place, but said it is so limited in scope that it will have very little impact given that most companies buy vehicles over three-year periods. He went on to say that if it really wants to make an impact, any such scheme needs to relate to the buying cycle. I can assure the Minister that when I was buying commercial vehicles we worked on a five year cycle because it made more financial sense to do so. I ask the Minister to consider the measure urgently. I do not think it is a mad idea. God knows there have been plenty of mad ideas in this place. It is to be hoped that the Minister will see fit to at least agree to a review after about six months or whatever.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	We discussed this to some extent on Committee Stage. My view is that we should give a longer-term commitment. One year is too short from the point of view of a company or employer investing in vehicles. They need more certainty. The Minister indicated on Committee Stage that the intention was to keep it for a longer period of time. He should formalise that in the Bill. Yesterday, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, said the exemption would be in place for three years. That is not what the Finance Bill, as currently constructed, actually states. The Minister might clarify the Government's policy, as well as from the point of view of employees. If they think they will have a benefit-in-kind exemption for 12 months that may affect their decisions in terms of whether it is worth their while accepting it. In the booklet issued on budget day, the Minister indicated that the cost was €0.5 million, which is extremely modest. We are well behind the curve in terms of tackling climate change. We are facing substantial fines in three years' time, and we need to show greater commitment to this issue. The Minister should extend the period from one year. A period of three years would be reasonable, and I look forward to what the Minister has to say on that.

The main reason for that is because I aim to carry out an overall review next year of how we provide benefit-in-kind treatment to all motor vehicles. I want to ensure that this policy decision next year fits into the broader review we have under way. As I confirmed on Second and Committee Stages, it is my intention to retain this relief for a minimum of three years. I accept that buying cycles stretch well beyond a single year, in particular for companies which are providing vehicles for their employees. It is my intention that this change will be in place for a minimum of three years, subject to this change proving to be successful, which I believe it will be. I might make further decisions beyond that once I have completed the review of benefit-in-kind treatment for motor vehicles. I agree with nearly all of the arguments advocated by Deputy Wallace. It is for that reason that I am reducing the rate to 0%. As I said, I envisage the provision being in place for a far longer time period than is referenced in the Bill.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	I welcome the Minister’s comments. I would like a period of three or five years to be enshrined in the Bill. I accept that the Minister seems to be moving in the right direction. At the same time, experience has taught us to be wary. I had a discussion today with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Shane Ross, about the fact that every single one of the many buses we purchased over the past six years is powered by diesel. There is a significant movement away from diesel right across Europe. Several European cities will have no public transport diesel by 2025. We have all bought things which we cannot throw away. However, I was shocked to find that we bought new buses which are 100% diesel powered. I tabled a motion which was ruled out of order, perhaps because the matter was not discussed in committee. I wanted to equalise the tax on diesel and petrol in order to encourage people to move further away from diesel. I understand there are issues around that, such as the commercial use of diesel, and there is a body of work to be done to make sure businesses are not crucified. However, there has to be a genuine move away from diesel in the direction of renewable energy. It is to be hoped that will happen. When I hear that all of the new buses purchased in the past four years are diesel powered it makes me wary.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	332	The only point I add is that when a company looks up the policy on this benefit-in-kind treatment, it will not read committee or Dáil transcripts. Rather, it will look at the Revenue website which sets out the legal position, which is that the exemption is for a one year period. We have a political commitment that it will be there for at least three years. The reason the Minister gave for not extending it further in the Bill is that there is an overall review of benefit-in-kind in respect of vehicles. I put it to the Minister that he is very unlikely to seek to change this anyway. He has given a commitment that the provision will be in place for three years. He is not going to dilute or remove this incentive in any way. The Minister has an opportunity to provide the certainty that people need.It will set out the legal and statutory position as enshrined in the Finance Act, and it will say one year. It could influence decisions in a negative way, notwithstanding the political commitment given by the Minister.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	333	Across our tax code we have many forms of relief that are time-bound. As such, this example is no different. I take on board the point made by the Deputy and I will see if there are other ways in which this policy statement from me can be made clearer to those who would be involved with the purchase of these vehicles. I have explained why I am making it available for one year. It is a change I believe is welcomed and understood by the House. There may well be further changes relating to benefit-in-kind next year and, through engagement with the Revenue Commissioners or representative bodies, I will seek to find ways in which we can make this clear. I am given to understand some of the organisations involved in representing interests and groups in this industry are already aware of what I have said and understand our intention in this area. I am happy to use this as an opportunity to confirm it further and I will see if there are further ways in which I can make it clearer. With regard to Deputy Wallace's point on how we tax diesel, this is one of many matters I consider in the run-up to the budget. One of the difficulties that became very apparent is the impact on commercial vehicles. I decided this merited further reflection before I could make any decision. In looking at the potential uncertainty and difficulty that we may need to manage in the coming period with respect to haulage and access into and out of our country, I decided this budget was not the time to change the tax treatment of diesel. It is a matter I will continue to review, as I do with all tax measures. I hope Deputies recognise that this movement in the benefit-in-kind treatment of electric vehicles, and what we are doing with employer-provided electrical charging points, reflects my intention.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	I agree 100% that there are complications with the diesel issue and allowances must be made for certain commercial vehicles. At the same time, we must start encouraging companies to move in that direction. As I stated, I do not expect companies to throw away what they have but they must start moving in the direction of using less diesel. The impetus will probably have to come from here so the sooner we do it, the sooner we will get to a position where we are in a better place. We must bring the companies with us. I would make allowances for companies as I would not want to penalise them in the transition period. It is a piece of work that can be developed. The point made by Deputy Michael McGrath is very good. People looking at whether to invest in this will look at the Revenue Commissioners' information and see it as one year rather than three. The Ceann Comhairle will ask me if I will press this. I would if Fianna Fáil would vote with me. Deputy McGrath informs me his wife will kill him if he votes with me so there is not much point in me pressing it. I will have to give the Minister the benefit of the doubt and trust him. I hope companies will have the courage to take this on board as well and trust him. It is not enough for me to do it.

There is an issue, and I have heard the Minister's comments about certainty. It has happened many times that provisions have been put into a finance Bill to give certainty over three years. If a company was getting into this in a big way, it would be a serious consideration that it could change. The only reason this is not in the Finance Bill is that, although the Minister has given a commitment, he is not 100% sure it will be in the finance Bill next year. How can a company director or shareholder make a decision based on a verbal commitment of the Government? The only reason it would not be in the Finance Bill, it can be deduced, is that there will be a review and the Minister is not 100% sure it will be there next year. It is a pity but we are where we are and the motion is not being pressed. I wanted to add my support to it and perhaps, between now and the conclusion of the legislation, the Minister will reconsider it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	338	I support the amendment, which makes sense. It is a feature of both Committee and Report Stage amendments that reports are called for to get information. If the Department was better organised, frankly, it would not be contentious and it would form the basis of people being able to make intelligent decisions. I confess to being one of those mostly women who some years ago switched to a diesel car because I believed all the propaganda I read. One might say somebody involved with politics should be very alert to propaganda but I really believed it. It is a particular concern for the Minister in his constituency, for me in my constituency and probably for Deputy Michael McGrath in his constituency in Cork that all the international evidence indicates the level of pollution and particulates from diesel cars is far higher than has been appreciated. The health consequences, particularly for young and vulnerable people living near busy traffic routes, are very severe and ultimately could be very costly to the Exchequer. The data and information about diesel were not available until the various scandals, particularly involving Volkswagen and so on, which emerged in the United States when tests were faked. It is a second reason to support this, particularly for any of us who represent urban constituencies with dense concentrations of traffic. Many of the drivers in the traffic, like me, bought diesel cars thinking they were better for the environment. That was four or five years ago. I am not somebody who would trade in a car very frequently but a strong case can be made for a financial incentive in this respect. A former Minister, Mr. Ruairí Quinn, did this in the past for what might be called clapped out vehicles over ten years old. There was a subsidy to have them replaced and get the bangers off the road. It worked very well at the time. There is a role, with regard to consumer and business behaviour, in providing such subsidies. Our carbon record is desperate and that is a primary reason for doing some of this. We really are bottom of the class with regard to carbon emissions. Internationally, that is put down to our cattle and it is associated with our name. Significantly, we can act in this respect for health reasons. The Minister and I live near a children's hospital and we know asthma rates, for example, are very high in Ireland. The evidence now is that particulates in diesel are likely to be culprits in that. I strongly support the amendment, although I recognise it may not be pressed.

The amendments clarify that the emolument is calculated by reference to the market value of the insurance policy prior to deducting any tax relief that would be available. Further, they provide that individuals subject to benefit-in-kind taxation as a result of this section can avail of tax relief in the same manner and amount as any other employee whose employer provides them with health or dental insurance. This is an important measure to ensure equity of treatment of all employees whose employers provide health insurance benefits.

“The linking of DIRT rate and Exit Tax rate on Life Assurance policies
10. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the breaking of the link between the rate of DIRT and the rate of exit tax from Life Assurance policies, including the impact of this on life assurance savers.”.The issue I raise is the breaking of the link between the DIRT tax rate and the exit tax rate on certain life assurance policies and I am seeking a report on the issue. In last year's budget the decision was made to reduce DIRT tax by 2% each year up to 2020. Historically and up to the past 20 years, the DIRT tax rate was linked to the exit tax rate on life assurance investment products. I understand there are several hundred thousand savers in the country with such products and I am seeking to establish the policy position of Government on this. If this trend continues, DIRT tax will be reduced to 33%, which I welcome, but the exit tax will be kept at 41% and we will have a significant differential - 8% - when up to last year the rates were identical. The issue is whether the Minister is discriminating between different types of savings products. What is the rationale behind this? Is it simply about the cost of extending the reduction in DIRT tax to the exit tax on the investment products in question?

It is because that is the way we have to table amendments. The intention is to have a link between DIRT tax and exit tax but, given the fact that people will be getting ready to make their beds in different doorways tonight, or to go into emergency accommodation, there are far more important areas where we can spend the scant resources of the State than on a reduction in exit tax. My party and I will not be supporting the amendment.

This was provided for in the Finance Act 2016. This will fall to 37% from 1 January 2018 and by a further 2% each year until 2020 when it will be 33%. It is a final liability tax, that is, it satisfies the individual's full liability to income tax in respect of deposit interest. The individual may still be liable to PRSI on the interest. Deposit interest subject to DIRT is not subject to the universal social charge. It is estimated that as the overall cost of each 2% reduction in the rate of DIRT is approximately €6.4 million in a full year, the total annual full-year cost over the three remaining years is estimated at €19.2 million by the time the full reduction is in effect in 2020.  I am aware that prior to the enactment of the Finance Act 2016, the rates payable on a series of other taxes, including taxes on life assurance policies, have tended to move in line with DIRT. However, on that occasion, my predecessor decided not to reduce those other rates. The decision was made due to the annual cost of reducing the rates of these other taxes by 2% being tentatively estimated by the Revenue Commissioners to be, allowing for rounding, €14 million annually with tax on life assurance products alone accounting for €11 million. Therefore to immediately bring the rates into line with those applicable to DIRT would cost €28 million in 2018, rising to €56 million by 2020. It therefore remains too costly to the Exchequer to reduce the rates of these taxes in the same manner as the ongoing series of reductions in the rate of DIRT.  This summer, the tax strategy group examined the matter of taxation of investment products. The tax strategy group examined options for changing and amending that taxation. It set out some options in this regard but constrained financial resources meant that it was not possible for me to act on them in this year's budget or Finance Bill. During work on that paper, and following advice from Revenue, it became evident that there were more complex issues to be addressed, in the context of the tax regime that applies to personal investment products other than those covered by DIRT, than simply the degree of the rates of tax applied and it was soon determined that a more holistic approach might be required. I therefore propose to establish a working group of officials from my Department and Revenue to examine and address the variety and complexity of the operation and taxation of personal investment products including the interaction of these regimes. An examination of the matters set out in the Deputy's proposed amendment will form part of the group's work. It will take longer than the three months suggested in the amendment for the group to carry out its work on such complex issues in a thorough and complete manner. I will instruct the group to provide me with a co-ordinated form of proposals prior to budget 2019, allowing sufficient time for those proposals to be acted on if necessary. The resource argument was particularly important in my decision. If one looks at the cost for this year of this decision on DIRT, and the cost of continuing the decision of the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, it was €6.4 million in a full year. The costs in respect of similar decisions on other investment products would have been €28 million for next year, rising to €56 million by 2020. Given the cost involved in the decision, I decided I would not include it in the budget. I will go ahead with the working group, which will tease out different policy issues on the matter to be presented to me in advance of next year.

I welcome that he plans to set up a working group to examine this and related issues. I recognise the budgetary reality but it is particularly important in the context of the very low returns available in the present environment. The reality is that people earn little or nothing on their savings. The effect of having this differential between the DIRT on traditional savings and deposit accounts and the exit tax rate on longer-term products is that it incentivises people to put money into traditional banks, savings and deposit accounts where they are currently earning little or nothing, where other products tend to be longer-term in nature. Hopefully the working group will take these points on board and I look forward to engaging with it along with colleagues. I will not press the amendment.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	I welcome the establishment of the review group. Presumably it will take some time to do its work. Charges on savings products including life assurance are very high in Ireland. Early on in my time as Minister for Social Protection, I commissioned a study on costs of investment products in respect of people saving for pensions. Compared with other European countries, our costs can be very high. That is something the review group could look at. I agree with Deputy Michael McGrath that savers, many of whom are saving for pension lump sums, find it extremely difficult to get any decent return. My view and that of the Labour Party is that there should be a product available either through An Post or through the National Treasury Management Agency, which could be a savings bond, for instance. The ideal candidate for the use of a savings bond fund would be housing. I envisage it would permit people to save up to a certain amount, would allow many people to save, especially those on lower incomes, and could be used to invest in housing. It could pay modestly above the current rates of return. For many people who are trying to save for their retirement, interest rates in the Irish market make it almost impossible for them to get any return worth talking about. It is important that the Minister for Finance should facilitate people, especially smaller savers, to do so to facilitate their comfort in retirement and that they can accumulate savings that keep their value. As I am sure the Minister is aware, many savings have a negative return in real terms, perhaps not hugely so but negative nonetheless. The focus, in finance terms, has been on restoring the pillar banks. As such, interest rates are low and interest charges are high and we do not have the kinds of products that are available in other countries, especially for smaller savers who would not be in a position to pay the fees on other products and who, because of their age, are understandably risk-averse. They need deposit-type structures or something very close to that. The review group is a good idea in the context of the economy recovering. It would be good if it was in a position to address those issues.

An investment undertaking tax, which is in place for some of these products, operates at a 41% rate with an eight-year disposal window.We then have a 60% rate in relation to personal portfolio life insurance products that also operate over an eight year window. In terms of some life assurance products, we also have a 41% exit tax rate over an eight year disposal window. I understand that at the moment we have 12 different regimes in place, many of which operate under different rates and rules. For those reasons, I believe that the best way to move the matter forward is through the working group. I emphasise that the cost of such changes would be an important point for me.  On Deputy Burton's two points, it is unlikely that the cost of supplying these products will fall into the terms of reference of the working group as we are looking more so at the taxation regime that applies. However, this is perhaps an area the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, who has responsibility for financial services and other areas, could examine next year. I would propose to establish the group promptly and put in place a deadline for early 2018 to allow for submissions and proposals to be made to us, flesh out the matters to which I have referred, particularly the number of different regimes and their different rates and, if resources permit, use that report to guide choices in next year's budget.

“Tax bands for people over 65 years of age
10. The Minister shall, within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the potential impacts and costs of increasing the income tax bands for those aged over 65 years of age from the current €36,000 for a couple and €18,000 for singles.”.This amendment relates to the tax exemption limits that currently apply for people aged 65 years and over. For a single person, a widowed person or a surviving civil partner, it is €18,000. For a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership, it is €36,000. Those figures have not changed for some years. People have made the point to me and, I am sure, to other Deputies that the value of those exemption limits is eroded over time if they are not changed. I recognise that the priority in this budget was the reduction in the universal social charge and the raising of the entry point to the higher rate of tax. However, this is one issue where the non-indexation of the tax system has a direct consequence. While, on the face of it, people might think those exemption limits are generous, the State contributory and non-contributory pensions are taxable. Therefore, if a person has other income such as a private occupational pension, even of a modest amount, that can be taxable income and the person may have a tax liability. For those whose incomes are marginally in excess of the current exemption limits, there is the option of paying tax at a rate of 40%. This is known as marginal relief. However, it is somewhat complicated because the point at which the marginal relief ceases to be of benefit varies depending on the circumstances and the tax credits that apply. As a practitioner of constituency politics, people come to me with tax issues and so on and, obviously, I advise them to get professional taxation advice. However, many of them would not be aware of this particular provision. The purpose of the amendment is to establish Government policy on these exemption limits and whether it is its intention over time to amend them, which is why we are proposing a report.

Such individuals whose income is below the relevant exemption limit are not liable to income tax. The current annual exemption limits for people aged 65 and over are €18,000 for an individual and €36,000 for a married couple or a couple in a civil partnership. The purpose of the exemption is to identify an income threshold below which a taxpayer aged 65 or over is not required to pay income tax or to submit claims to Revenue for income tax reliefs. This exemption limit does not equate to the amount of income which would be sheltered by the tax credits available to the individual or couple as both the exemption limit and the tax credit available can vary depending on the personal circumstances of the individual. However, I note that the exemption limits are slightly above the point at which such individuals would enter into a liability to income tax based on the current PAYE and age tax credits. As there have been no changes to personal PAYE or age tax credits in recent years, I do not see a need to review the exemption limits for those aged over 65. I am, therefore, not minded to expend resources on the production of the report requested by the Deputy and, consequently, cannot accept the amendment.

That is an important point to put on the record. Pensioners do pay tax. They pay the universal social charge and will have benefitted from the reduction in it. Others who would pay income tax under the normal system would potentially have benefitted from the increase in the entry point to the higher rate as well. I will not press the issue but it is something of which to be conscious. It is an element of the income tax code that relates to a cohort of people aged 65 and over. There has been no change whatsoever in recent years. Many of them are very aware of the issue and have raised it and it should be examined in future budgets.

“Report on the Possible Extension of the TaxSaver Commuter Ticket Scheme to include annual parking tickets
10. The Minister shall, within 3 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dail Eireann a report on the possibility of extending the TaxSaver Commuter Ticket Scheme to include parking costs associated with public transport.”.I thank Deputy McGrath for tabling this amendment on Committee Stage, which I will speak to on Report Stage. I tabled the same amendment last year and the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and I had some discussion on it in the House at the time. The Minister has now changed and I wish the new Minister well in his position. The outcome of the debate, however, was that the Department and the former Minister were to review the situation. I am not sure if that review has taken place. I hope it has and that it will inform this discussion. The amendment would require the Minister, within three months of the passing of the Act, to prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the possibility of extending the tax saver commuter ticket scheme to include parking costs associated with public transport. In essence, the amendment would mean that, when one purchases a ticket for a train, bus, Luas or another of the multiple different public transport options to commute primarily into Dublin but also to the main regional urban centres, one would be able to purchase the add-on of a parking ticket along with the fare. The House will be aware of the extremely successful tax saver scheme whereby one can buy an annual train, bus or Luas ticket and have the cost deducted against tax. It is efficient, cost-effective and convenient. It also promotes consistency of behaviour because people travelling on a tax saver ticket do not make the choice of driving or getting the train or bus to work each day. They form a pattern of behaviour in how they go about their business.  The benefits of promoting public transport are many and are probably well-understood. However, they might be worth recapping. We have gridlock on many of our roads. Flooding was exacerbated today in my county of Kildare and probably in many other places. However, we have it on normal days as well. We have congestion on our motorways. A recent report in The Irish Times on the M50 noted how it is gridlocked and has reached capacity at a stage when we hope growth is still occurring in the economy and it is likely that the load on the motorway will be increased again. The M4 and M7 and other major motorways are the same. Unfortunately, we see the effects of this in the backlog of traffic going into our city centres and the knock-on effects on quality of life and climate change. I asked the Taoiseach last week about climate change targets and it is likely that the State will miss its targets, which could result in fines of €1 billion to €1.5 billion, which is pertinent to the debate on this and future Finance Bills. It is, therefore, in everyone's interest that we highlight climate change and promote public transport.This is a good example of using the taxation system to reward and incentivise certain responsible public policy behaviours at the individual level. In the real world, while we would like to see everyone's journey start and finish on public transport, we must accept that it is often impractical to make the entire journey in this way. I refer to the commuter belt, in particular. I represent Kildare North but my point applies to the wider area of sprawl around Dublin. Very many people in slightly outlying areas may have to drop children to a crèche or perform other duties before they embark on their journey to work. They must, of necessity, drive part of the way, park and then change to another mode of transport going to the city centre. Park-and-ride facilities are becoming more critical in the circumstances. As of yet, however, we do not have any integrated ticketing or system whereby one can have a combined parking and rail ticket. In recent years, Irish Rail moved to introduce an annual ticket at certain stations but, because it is not incorporated into the taxsaver scheme, it makes it that much more difficult to incentivise. The objective of the scheme I propose is to include parking costs, paid for on an annual basis, as an add-on to the public transport fare. The whole sum would be tax deductible to incentivise behaviour to make it easier and more convenient for the rail user or bus user. There also would be a knock-on benefit in terms of consistency and reliability in respect of the journey. One would not be fumbling for change every morning at the train station or trying to load the meter while watching a train pull away from the platform in front of one. The frustration of the daily commuting experience could be alleviated slightly by having a measure such as the one I propose in place. In essence, the suggestion is that the taxsaver scheme, which has been very successful in influencing public transport behaviour, be extended to include the cost of parking. It was not always a cost but has been in recent years. The proposal would enable the commuter to make a single purchase once per year, with everything included. This would be good public policy. It would not be terribly difficult to implement. We may discuss the implementation details in a moment but I hope the Minister will look on my proposal favourably. As I stated, the previous Minister was positive about my amendment when I introduced it last year. I await the current Minister's response. My proposal would be a sensible and pragmatic measure that would reward good behaviour.

I wish to outline the various reasons offered to me as to why I should not accept the Deputy's amendment and to have a dialogue with him about it. The first point, which the Deputy has acknowledged in his contribution, is that the tax relief already available to anybody who purchases a commuter ticket is already very significant. The taxsaver scheme was put in place to incentivise the purchase of tickets and it represents a very good investment on behalf of the State. One reason the existing scheme has been so robust over recent years is that it is very transparent. By that, I mean that the providers of the tickets against which the tax relief can be claimed are all named in the primary legislation. At the start of the year, one knows the cost of the tickets against which the relief may be drawn. There also are conditions in place concerning providers or, in other words, they are required to be regulated. We must ensure that any service provider providing a ticket against which relief can be obtained is regulated. A crucial challenge we would face in implementing the Deputy's proposal is that parking facilities are provided by a multitude of providers. Parking exists in different formats. For example, there are multi-storey facilities in some areas and single-storey facilities in others. In others, parking may be in premises that are not used for anything else. The charging is not set by or influenced by the State and can vary in many ways. Moreover, there is a concern that were the scheme extended in the way proposed, it could have the unintended consequence of increasing the distance driven by commuters before they switch to public transport. I have listened to the Deputy's contribution, however, and I believe he makes a fair point that gaining access to a public transport facility in many counties requires the use of the car in the first instance. While we are making strides to ensure there are public transport routes and options available to get people to a train station, for example, I acknowledge this is not possible at present for many commuters. That is one reason there has been such investment in upgrading parking facilities in many counties, including the Deputy's, that are right beside public transport routes, particularly train routes. I am advised that there could well be difficulties in minimising opportunities for misuse. Let me give one concrete example. These are the factors we need to consider when introducing any form of tax relief. We could grant tax relief against the ticket but, of course, we could not have a guarantee regarding who might be using it. Different people may use it. It may be provided for an organisation or a company and different people might use it, despite the fact that tax relief is granted against the ticket itself. For all these reasons, I regret I am not in a position to accept the Deputy's amendment. It was considered. I have outlined my reasons for not accepting it. I do not know whether the Deputy is aware that one can purchase a parking pass, at a reduced rate, on the taxsaver website when availing of the benefits we are debating. Perhaps this can be attributed to the debate we had here last year and the fact that the Deputy has been raising this matter. Perhaps the issue the Deputy is raising here is being dealt with in another way. We are giving those individuals who make a purchase on the website the opportunity to purchase at a reduced rate access to parking facilities that may well allow them to use the public transport. The tax relief and the reduction in the cost of parking for those who make a purchase on the taxsaver website demonstrate an intention to provide the relief in a different way. I hope that the Deputy can see that, over the past year, we have considered the matter and have tried to make progress in a different way. For the reasons I have outlined, I am not in a position to accept his amendment.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	359	I thank the Minister for considering my points. I acknowledge the progress since last year. If I am still a Member next year, however, I will table my amendment again because there may still be some work to do in exploring it. I take the Minister's points on board. I will respond to each of them. The providers are named in the primary legislation. I suggest that a review could recommend that a list of providers be extended. That could be included in the primary legislation, which can always be updated. I believe there was a reference to the possible accrual, possibly accidentally, of a double benefit. At present, it is possible to travel to Dublin using one's taxsaver rail ticket, disembark at Heuston Station and then use a bicycle purchased through the cycle-to-work scheme at a discount to cycle to the city centre. This would involve rail and cycling as opposed to driving and rail. I do not know, therefore, whether what the Minister suggests in this regard is necessarily a problem. I certainly agree there is a multitude of parking providers. Regulations are being introduced by the National Transport Authority at present on managing commuter parking. They typically concern clamping but also other issues that arise in parking management. It is possible that the regulations could be extended to include measures such as those I propose. In any case, the parking facilities are typically provided by the State providers, particularly Irish Rail. My proposal could be implemented initially in Irish Rail's car parks only if that would get around the difficulty. As for the potential for overuse, I must disagree with the Minister's analysis or the Department's analysis. This matter arose last year. The same point has been made even though I responded to it last year. I am going to respond to it again. If we have the debate next year, let us hope we can move this on.I do not accept the point that the ticket could be abused or re-used by multiple persons or entities because there is a very simple check. In the same way that a train ticket cannot be given to another person to use because it contains ID on it, by the same token a car registration plate could be used. As one typically does not swap cars around, the same car can be parked in a space in the station every morning. That is the system most parking systems use already as an identifier. It is built into the system. I suggest that the issue could be re-examined because there is a very simple way to address the concern. I thank the Minister for his response. I suggest that the issue could be looked at again as there is scope to revisit it. Some of the points that have been made could be countered. Where there is a will there is a way and it would be worth doing that.

I have a Leap card and I am aware that it took years to make it happen. Now that I see how Leap cards are used, I understand why it took so long to make it available. Technology is now being made available to allow the Leap card to be used on more forms of public transport. It is now possible, for example, to put one's photo on the card to ensure that if it is lost, one can get it back. I am very much in favour of looking at measures in the tax code to incentivise more use of public transport. I will give an example of the kind of difficulty we need to manage, which is the reason I cannot accept the amendment but am happy to look at further ideas in the year ahead in regard to it. Deputy Lawless made the point a moment ago that if we were to list the various providers in legislation, we could begin to make the relief available to some providers rather than others. From a tax policy point of view I cannot do that because what would then happen is those parking providers, for example, a private sector company providing parking from a facility that is beside an Irish Rail train station – Deputy Lawless knows where this argument is going – would then claim they are being disadvantaged by the tax relief. Deputy Lawless referred to the legislation on the regulation of clamping companies. I introduced that legislation when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and I remember all of the challenges we had in terms of trying to define property and where clamping takes place. I assure the Deputy that if during the year he comes up with further ideas on how the matter can be addressed I will engage positively with him because I am open to such ideas. Perhaps one thing we could do arising out of this debate is to ascertain if we can find out how many commuters have access to parking at a reduced price because that might help us understand the potential scale of the opportunity to which the Deputy refers.

That is a fair point about the multiple providers and tax equality for them and the difficulty in achieving that if we were to select some and not others. I will address the Minister with his Public Expenditure and Reform hat on rather than his Finance hat. The commuter parking services are so popular that they are in scarce supply. The National Transport Authority, NTA, would be very grateful, as would the commuters of Kildare North and of the wider commuter belt, for any support that could be given towards the provision of additional parking services in those areas. I will finish on that point and thank the Minister for his response.

KEEP is an SME focused share-option programme, intended to help small, growing companies to attract and retain key staff. It operates by providing that any gains realised on the exercise of qualifying KEEP share options will not be subject to income tax, PRSI or USC at the date of exercise. The gain will, however, be subject to capital gains tax on a future disposal of the shares. The relief therefore has a twofold benefit. First, it reduces the tax payable from income tax to capital gains tax rates. Second, and possibly more important from the perspective of small unquoted companies, it provides that the tax will become payable on disposal of the shares, when the sales proceeds would be available to pay the tax due. These amendments make two technical changes to the KEEP legislation in order to ensure that it operates as intended. Report Stage amendments Nos. 11 and 12 amend the definition of "qualifying company" to ensure the inclusion of enterprises in sectors that are part of Ireland's strategic enterprise and employment priorities. It expands the definition of qualifying company to include companies that provide pharmaceutical and engineering services. My officials have continued to engage with small business representatives following the publication of the Finance Bill and it was identified that the legislation could have the unintended consequence of incentivising a company not to grow beyond small and medium enterprise, SME, size while qualifying KEEP share options were on issue. Amendments Nos. 13 to 20, inclusive, correct this issue by amending the definition of "qualifying company" to specify that the conditions relating to the SME size requirement and the cap of €3 million on the maximum value of issued but unexercised qualifying KEEP options are to apply only at the time of the granting of KEEP share options. I commend the amendments to the House.

“Amendment of Parts 9 and 36 of, and Schedule 25B to, Principal Act (capital allowances for equipment and buildings used for the purposes of providing childcare services or a fitness centre to employees)
12. (1) Chapter 2 of Part 9 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following after section 285A:
“Acceleration of wear and tear allowances for childcare and fitness centre equipment
285B. (1) In this section—‘qualifying expenditure’ means capital expenditure incurred on qualifying machinery or plant by a person carrying on a qualifying trade;‘qualifying machinery or plant’ means machinery or plant in use in a qualifying premises;‘qualifying premises’ has the same meaning as it has in section 843B;‘qualifying trade’ has the same meaning as it has in section 843B.(2) Where a person has incurred qualifying expenditure, and for any chargeable period a wear and tear allowance is to be made under section 284, subsection (2) of that section shall apply as if the reference in paragraph (ad) of that subsection to 12.5 per cent were a reference to 100 per cent.”.(2) (a) Part 36 of the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following after section 843A:
“Capital allowances for buildings used for the purposes of providing childcare services or a fitness centre to employees
843B. (1)
In this section—‘childcare services’ means any form of childminding services or supervised activities to care for children, whether or not provided on a regular basis, in respect of which it can be shown that the applicable requirements of the Child Care Act 1991 (Early Years Services) Regulations 2016 (S.I. No. 221 of 2016) have been complied with;‘construction’ has the same meaning as it has in section 270;‘fitness centre’ means a gymnasium used exclusively in providing a range of facilities designed to improve and maintain the physical fitness and health of participants;‘qualifying expenditure’ means expenditure incurred by an employer, carrying on a qualifying trade or a profession, on the construction of a qualifying premises;‘qualifying premises’ means a building or structure which is in use for the purposes of providing either childcare services or the facilities of a fitness centre to employees of the employer referred to in the immediately preceding definition, and where that employer is a company, whether the employees of that company or of a company connected with that company;‘qualifying trade’ means a trade, other than a trade which consists of the provision of childcare services or a trade which consists wholly or partly of the provision of the facilities of a fitness centre.(2) The provisions of the Tax Acts relating to the making of allowances or charges in respect of capital expenditure incurred on the construction of an industrial building or structure shall, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in those provisions, apply in relation to qualifying expenditure on a qualifying premises—(a) as if the qualifying premises were, at all times at which it is a qualifying premises, a building or structure in respect of which an allowance is to be made for the purposes of income tax or corporation tax, as the case may be, under Chapter 1 of Part 9 by reason of its use for the purpose specified in section 268(1)(a), and(b) where any activity carried on in the qualifying premises is not a trade, as if (for the purposes only of the making of allowances and charges by virtue of paragraph (a)), it were a trade.(3) In relation to qualifying expenditure incurred on a qualifying premises, section 272 shall apply as if—(a) in subsection (3)(a)(ii) of that section the reference to 4 per cent were a reference to 15 per cent, and(b) in subsection (4)(a) of that section the following were substituted for subparagraph (ii):‘(ii) where capital expenditure on the construction of the building or structure is incurred, 7 years beginning with the time when the building or structure was first used subsequent to the incurring of that expenditure.’.(4) Notwithstanding section 274(1), no balancing allowance or balancing charge shall be made in relation to a qualifying premises by reason of any event, referred to in that section, which occurs more than 7 years after the qualifying premises was first used subsequent to the incurring of the qualifying expenditure on the construction of the qualifying premises.(5) Where relief is given by virtue of this section in relation to qualifying expenditure incurred on the construction of a building or structure, relief shall not be given in respect of that expenditure under any other provision of the Tax Acts.(6) A person shall not be entitled to allowances under this section while that person is regarded as an undertaking in difficulty for the purposes of the Commission Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty.”.(b) Schedule 25B to the Principal Act is amended by inserting the following after the matter set out opposite reference number 50:“50A.Section 843B (capital allowances for buildings used for the purposes of providing childcare services or a fitness centre to employees)An amount equal to—(a) the aggregate amount of allowances (including balancing allowances) made to the individual under Chapter 1 of Part 9 as that Chapter is applied by section 843B, including any such allowances or part of any allowances made to the individual for a previous tax year and carried forward from that previous tax year in accordance with Part 9, or(b) where full effect has not been given in respect of that aggregate for that tax year, the part of that aggregate to which full effect has been given for that tax year in accordance with section 278 and section 304 or 305, as the case may be, or any of those sections as applied or modified by any other provision of the Tax Acts.”(3) This section comes into operation on such day as the Minister for Finance may appoint by order.".This section introduces a scheme of accelerated capital allowances for the construction of buildings and structures for use in the provision of child care services or fitness centre facilities by employers to employees. The scheme also provides relief for expenditure incurred on related equipment. The rationale for introducing this relief is to help tackle the cost and availability of child care facilities, both of which we know are barriers to work.The measures will also support the Government's vision for Healthy Ireland by supporting the provision of fitness facilities by employers. The tax relief will not commence immediately as approval of the European Commission from a state aid perspective is required, on foot of which the scheme will commence by ministerial order. The relief will work in a similar fashion to other capital allowances. The accelerated allowances for buildings or structures will apply at the rate of 15% per annum for six years and then 10% in year seven in respect of qualifying expenditure. The wear-and-tear allowances for related equipment will operate at an accelerated rate of 100%. The relief is only available to employers that incur qualifying expenditure. Unlike in the past, passive investors cannot avail of relief under the scheme. Where the employer is a company, employees of other companies connected with that company may avail of the services or facilities. I commend the amendment to the House.

Will the Minister explain the allowance? I think I understood him correctly. The amendment allows for 100% of the cost to be drawn down in one year. Is that correct? Is it 15% over six years and 10% in the remaining year? What is the situation currently for capital allowances if an employer provides these services for employees? Can the Minister tell us whether any safeguards are built in, including anti-avoidance measures? If the facility was no longer used for the intended purpose, how long would the company have to use it to be able to claim the accelerated tax allowances? Would the company be able to keep all of the allowance? Would it apply only for as long as the facilities were being used?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	383	I am always suspicious of capital allowances, given what has been happening with capital allowances in other areas, for example, the scandal of the intangible assets, which we will discuss later. Anyway, a range of other allowances are simply mechanisms through which profitable enterprises avoid tax and reduce their tax liabilities. I assume the logic the Minister is putting forward in this case is that these allowances should be given because of a major shortage in child care capacity. I am keen to hear what the Minister has to say on that point. There are insufficient child care places and we need more. Therefore, the Minister is encouraging greater provision. Perhaps the Minister could clarify the point. Is it only for employers? Is it simply for workplace-based child care? Does it apply to investment in child care places generally, including businesses providing child care? Who exactly is getting the tax break? Even if providing more child care places is a laudable motive that we should encourage, what is to stop it being abused? I presume the other measure is about encouraging physical fitness and so on, possibly to tackle obesity or address general health. Perhaps the Minister can elaborate on that. What is to stop abuse of the provision? What is to stop people putting in minimal facilities to benefit from the allowance without doing much in terms of providing child care or fitness facilities for employees? Perhaps the Minister can come back on that point. Can the Minister clarify whether it is only applicable to workplaces? Does it apply for more general provision of child care by businesses in that sector?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	384	Several different issues have been raised, including the provenance of the idea. I am a former Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. When I was involved in the Healthy Ireland initiative I could see opportunities to make sporting facilities available in more workplaces. I thought it was something we should consider. There has been a debate on the provision of child care facilities for some time now, especially with regard to how we can incentivise and make more facilities available. As I said on Committee Stage, I believe this is something we should look at. We are some time away from having to enact the measure, because I will need state aid approval and that will take some time. As I am getting ready to do all of that I will be in a position to be able to outline the cost, depending on the number of people who might actually access it. Deputy Doherty put several questions to me. The provision operates with six years at 15% and then the final year at 10%. It is only in the case of equipment that the rate is 100%. I understand this as a standard provision for the provision of capital allowances for equipment. Is the measure available within businesses? The answer to that question is "Yes". This is something that I anticipate will be provided within the workplace for employees of the workplace or, as I said a moment ago, for employees of companies that might be dealing with the company within which the facilities are supplied. I was asked how we are dealing with this from an anti-avoidance point of view. As I said, my objective is that it will only be available to employers which incur qualifying expenditure. In other words, money will have to be spent to activate the provision. Then, upon the activation of the provision, the reliefs that I have described will become available.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	385	My question related to capital allowance for six years at 15%. Is that comparable to what is in place now? Are companies or individuals entitled to capital allowances if they construct a gymnasium, fitness centre or crèche at this stage? Are they entitled to claim capital allowances? That was my original question. I also asked about anti-avoidance mechanisms. Let us suppose two people had a company, which consisted of myself and my wife, who was an employee. Let us suppose I decided to put an extension onto the back of the house and turned it into a nice gym, and we made use of the gym. Let us suppose the same applied to a larger company and the gym was being used. Let us suppose the space was constructed and the company was able to claim accelerated capital allowances for the building in which the gym was situated. In addition, the relief would be 100% for the gym equipment. What happens after three years if the gym closes and it becomes a store for the shop or supermarket that created it in the first place? How do we ensure that smaller businesses would not be able to twist it? I have in mind a scenario where only two or three people are working. How do we ensure such companies will be unable to abuse the provision? One of the big problems with an amendment like this, which is rather detailed, is that it is coming on Report Stage and we cannot really scrutinise it. We are limited in the number of interactions. The proposed amendment does not say the facilities have to be for the sole purpose of the employees. Let us suppose there was a crèche or gym. I am keen to tease this out with the Minister. Let us suppose I own a company that makes widgets. Then, three miles down the road I decided to create a gym or fitness centre.If there is a distance or space involved and I allow the use of the gym for my employees, I presume they will have use of the facility free of charge and will not incur a cost. This is not stated in the amendment. Let us say the employees are entitled to use the gym, is the employer allowed to charge other individuals for the use of the gym while at the same time availing of accelerated capital allowances?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	386	I echo Deputy Pearse Doherty's point about introducing detailed amendments at such a late stage when Deputies have not had an opportunity to properly study them. We do not have the explanations that are normally provided in the explanatory memorandum of a Bill, as initiated. While the Minister has an explanation available to him, Opposition Deputies must work out what this proposal, with its various unexplained references to principal Acts and so forth, means. If we are to deal with these types of amendments, we should have an opportunity to read the notes provided to the Minister before the debate. This is also true of other significant Report Stage amendments. The Minister did not answer the question as to whether these allowances are available to people who are in the business of providing child care services or fitness centres. I ask him to clarify this matter. Deputy Doherty's question brought to mind another question which follows on to some extent from the point he made. Must the facilities be made available to all employees free of charge in order that the provider can benefit from the allowances? One could imagine a scenario in which an employer or the top executives of a company build a very nice child care facility for themselves which they do not make available to other employees in the workplace. In such circumstances, the facility would be a major boon for the bosses but of no benefit to the workers. Similarly, one could imagine a nice spanking gym being provided for the executives or owners of a company, which would be of no benefit to general employees. Has provision been made to guard against such a scenario and ensure every employee is a beneficiary of the facilities for which the allowances would be provided?

The reason we are introducing these allowances is to incentivise the provision of such facilities. As to whether the facilities must be provided on site, the answer is "No". I anticipate it will take a period of time to establish the scheme because, at a minimum, we must obtain state aid approval for it. In addition, its operation will be subject to guidance from the Revenue Commissioners.  As to whether a requirement to provide the child care service free of charge is built into the scheme, the answer is "No". I cannot set the price at which a service is provided, just as I cannot set the price at which, for example, crèches currently provide services to families and parents.  On the issue of regulation, which was also raised, the amendment is drafted in such a way as to require that facilities be provided in full compliance with all child care regulations, as set by Tusla.

I do not want to vote against the amendment but the Minister will force me to do so because there is no clarity on certain issues. While incentivising crèches is a good idea - I am not sure the same applies to fitness centres - this proposal must be teased out. We cannot pass it into law without properly discussing it. If we recommit the amendment, I will give an undertaking not to spend more than ten minutes discussing it. Clarity is required on the scheme.

"Amendment of section 97 of Principal Act
12. The Principal Act is amended by inserting the following section after section 97:
"Accidental landlords
97A. (1) In this section—'qualifying let property' means a residential property which was acquired, between 1 January 2002 and 1 December 2008 the floor area of which is less than 113 square meters; 'qualifying rented property’ means a residential property, which has more bedrooms than a qualifying let property, where the rent paid is no more than the market rate;'qualifying landlord' means an individual who—(a) owns only one premises and—(i) that premises is a qualifying let property,(ii) that premises was acquired by that individual as a principal private residence, within the meaning of section 604, and was occupied as such for a period of at least 2 years prior to its first letting, and(iii) at the time that premises was acquired, the individual was a first time buyer,and(b) resides, on a full time basis, in the qualifying rented property.(2) Notwithstanding section 97(2), in calculating the surplus or deficiency in respect of the qualifying let property, a qualifying landlord shall be entitled to take a deduction for the amount of any rent payable in respect of a qualifying rented property.".".The purpose of the amendment is to end double taxation of accidental landlords. Families all over Ireland who bought small properties during the boom are in negative equity to this day. Their families are growing and the properties they bought between 2002 and 2008 are not suitable to raise growing families. As a result, they are left with an unenviable set of choices. They can stay in the apartment or small house in which they are living and raise their children in unsuitable accommodation, try to sell their property which is impossible in most cases because they are in negative equity or rent out the apartment in which they are living and try to find a suitable, slightly larger home in which to raise their children. The problem is that if they choose to rent out their apartment and rent an apartment in which to raise their children, they are hit with a substantial tax bill at the end of the year.Let us say that a couple decides to rent out their apartment for which they take in €1,000 a month in rent and they go and rent a two or three-bedroom semi-detached house to raise the children in on which they also pay €1,000. Obviously, in Dublin they would pay a lot more. Let us assume they take in €1,000 in a month and they pay out €1,000 a month, and their household finances are exactly the same. They have no additional income. They are taking rent in and they themselves are paying rent out, and they are no better off financially. The tax code taxes the rental income they take in. There are some amounts one can write off for interest payments but, in most cases, most of the rent they take in is taxed at the marginal rate of approximately 50%. If a couple is taking in rent of €1,000 a month, they will take in €12,000 by the end of the year. Let us say approximately €10,000 of that is taxable, after deductions, at the marginal rate. Therefore, a couple in a modest situation, taking in €1,000 and paying out €1,000, gets hit with a €5,000 tax bill. What is happening is some such couples are moving and hoping to God the taxman never finds them because they cannot pay it - they do not have €5,000 at the end of the year. Others are moving for the sake of their children but they are caught in a trap because now they cannot save any money because they are getting hit with this extra €5,000 a year in tax. I know people in this situation. No doubt the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knows people in this situation. We are of a similar age and it is mainly a particular age group who got caught in this who have been trapped. This is my fourth year trying to get some relief for those who are stuck in this situation. Last year, on Committee Stage, I raised it with the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, who essentially said that he was not willing to accept it on Committee Stage because he believed it could be gamed. He stated there are too many ways around this and it is not restrictive enough and he gave specific instances where he felt it could be gamed. I went and took solid legal advice and I drafted an amendment that was very restrictive and on Committee Stage I went through the various restrictions. I tabled it on Report Stage and the Minister never engaged in the detail. He merely dismissed it using the same logic he had used on Committee Stage, stating this could be gamed. On Committee Stage this year, I tabled it again, but the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, was substituting for the Minister at the time. I stated that I understood this amendment will be technically flawed. We have just passed an amendment on tax deductibles for gyms and crèches consisting of three pages of technical legal text and I am aware that what I have tabled will contain flaws. That is why I asked that, if the Government agreed that these people have to be taken out of this trap, the Minister would come forward on Report Stage with his own amendment because none of us has access to the civil servants and technical support needed to get the amendment right. I was very disappointed to see the Minister did not submit his own amendment that would free these people from it. Ultimately, this comes down to political will. It is not a technical issue. I have taken solid legal advice stating there are probably some tweaks and changes that would need to be made to my amendment but the basic idea, what I am trying to achieve here, is well within the wit of legislators to incorporate into the tax code. That is not the issue. Last year, I engaged at great length with the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, on section 110 entities and closing vulture funds. There was advice to the Minister stating that one could not do this and one could not do that but, ultimately, the then Minister decided it was going to happen. It happened, and an entire section of Ireland's tax code was rewritten. The Government then decided that it was bringing in a new section of tax code, the real estate investment funds, and an entire new chapter of tax law was written for that. I went through that at length with the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, who went out of his way to explain that businesses could not be double-taxed and there was all sorts being done to ensure that under no circumstances would these be double-taxed. For professional property investors in this country, there are significant tax breaks in place. The vulture funds still use significant tax breaks. Any of the vulture funds that various Members in this House have gone through over the past few years might declare €500 million in assets and €50 million in profit, and will pay €250 in tax. By comparison, one family trying to raise their children, that has rented out their apartment that they wished to God they had never bought and that is sitting in a house, gets hit not with a €250 tax bill like the vulture funds but with a €5,000 tax bill. One family is paying 20 times more tax under the current situation than a vulture fund with €0.5 billion in assets. I implore the Minister. It is all I can do at this stage because the merits of the argument do not seem to have worked over the past four years. These people are trapped and they need help and we can help them. I ask the Minister to look at the amendment, take it seriously and tell us whether or not he agrees with what it is trying to achieve and then we can work together to see if an amendment from the Minister could be brought forward by the end of the year.
#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	411	I support Deputy Donnelly's amendment. As in Wicklow, we in Kildare North are no strangers to accidental landlords and multiple starter homes in negative equity which remain so. The phenomenon of accidental landlords is well understood right around the commuter belt and elsewhere. As Deputy Donnelly stated, unfortunately these individuals are taxed at the marginal rate. I suppose the key inequality is that - Deputy Donnelly alluded to the vulture funds - any kind of commercial entity or corporate structure, for instance, a local commercial interest, leasing the same house as the unfortunate young couple or individual who has ended up as an accidental landlord avails of far greater reliefs and a far more attractive tax rate and, indeed, draws down far more allowances than the personal taxation levied on the poor unfortunate accidental landlord. I understood there were moves afoot to include the likes of deduction of local property tax, LPT, to include additional allowances and some sort of gesture towards the time involved in leasing a property, even if not the entire cost. Some may choose to manage the lease themselves rather than incur the additional expense of employing property agents. I understood there was some movement towards that but I am not sure whether that has been reflected in the Bill to date. I concur with Deputy Donnelly. I support the amendment to put the onus back on the Department to find a solution to this because the issue is so acute for so many families.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	412	The Minister is sympathetic to this issue and I ask him to find a way of dealing with it. We are talking here about a relatively small number of couples who are in quite a horrendous situation. Let us be upfront and straight about it: they are victims of the property crash. The Minister will know them. I certainly know some of them. I had a couple in to me a few months ago who are living in a two-bedroom duplex apartment. They were considering renting that out and renting somewhere else, but when I took them through what that would mean for them, in terms of the taxation treatment of their rental income, the loss of mortgage interest relief on their existing principal private residence etc. they quickly realised it simply was not possible. What they had done previously was divide a boxroom into two bedrooms - the Minister can imagine what that looks like. The reality facing many such people is stark. We already have differentiation in the tax code in relation to certain rental income. With the rent-a-room relief, for example, up to €14,000 of income is exempt. The point must also be made that many of these borrowers face the prospect of never owning another home. That is the reality because some of them are still in negative equity and, under the Central Bank deposit rules, as the Minister will be aware, non-first-time buyers face a 20% deposit requirement. Even if they hang on in there until the negative equity is gone and they sell the unsuitable property, they face the prospect of coming up with a 20% deposit for the property which they would like to buy to meet their new family needs and it is just not possible. It is not a runner for the vast majority.I would expect any measure like this to be very tightly controlled. We would need very strong anti-avoidance provisions. Deputy Donnelly has acknowledged the need to tighten up the amendment and work certainly needs to be done on it. As a party, we prepared a policy paper on this issue back in 2012 and it is an issue that needs to be addressed.

The irony of this is that if the people affected, the so-called accidental landlords who are being screwed at the moment, were to miss one payment, the vulture funds to whom their loans were sold on would end up with tax breaks. Vulture funds are getting tax breaks and are paying only €400 or €500 on millions in profits but the people to whom Deputy Donnelly refers are struggling in many cases. The Minister should listen to the Deputies and accept what they are proposing. If the amendment needs more tweaking to make it foolproof, then so be it. Every Deputy will accept that and I do not think anyone would have a problem with that. It is very sad to see accidental landlords struggling at the moment while the big guns, the vulture funds are getting away with murder with the support of the Government.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	414	While I have some concerns about any possible abuse of this, for the Minister not to consider it when it has been raised on a number of occasions and not try to tie down any possible unintended consequences but to deal with the substance of what Deputy Donnelly is seeking to do would be a gross inequity, given that in many cases vulture funds have been given a tax holiday on rental income or capital gains to the tune of millions. Many of these funds will walk away having paid literally nothing in tax unlike those who are caught up accidentally in a situation which is largely not of their making but the making of another generation of property speculators. That amounts to a supreme irony and inequity. Even if the Minister thinks there is a problem with, or flaws in, this amendment he should explain what he is going to do on the substantive point for the people who are genuinely caught up in this situation through no fault of their own.

There would also be an issue of fairness in the context of cut-off dates and so forth. While I am willing to hear more on it, I would be very interested to know if there is any estimate of what this would cost to implement. The amount of property acquired between 2002 and 2008 in this country was substantial, given that we were building approximately 70,000 units per annum at that time. Obviously, the square metre condition would rule out quite a number of non-urban houses. Larger houses could be built for a lower cost in rural communities. I am not convinced by the amendment but would be very interested to hear the cost of this measure to the Exchequer. What would it cost if people could pay no tax on their rental income because they were renting another property?
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	416	Deputy Donnelly raised this issue on a number of occasions previously with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. He raised it with me in the first instance a week and a half ago. We had a discussion on the matter over the phone. I am sympathetic to the issue that the Deputy raises because many of my constituents are facing the same kind of difficulty to which he refers. That said, when I asked my officials to examine the issue over the past week, many matters arose which made it very difficult for me to be even able to offer an alternative amendment on behalf of the Government. I will now illustrate some of the issues that arise in the context of Deputy Donnelly's amendment. Three issues came to light when we began to consider it. I want to acknowledge that this is a different amendment which approaches the issue in a different way than was done in the past. I considered this amendment on its own merits, as I have already indicated to the Deputy. Three matters arise from the amendment which mean that I am not in a position to accept it here this evening. However, I am happy to engage with the Deputy on this issue afterwards to see if there is some way to deal with the issue without causing difficulties elsewhere in the tax code or giving rise to tax avoidance issues that I would have to deal with at a future date. The first point is that the amendment makes a judgment that any property less than 113 square metres, or approximately 1,000 square feet, would be unsuitable as a home for an individual or a family. It is the case, however, particularly in many urban areas that many people will reside in properties that are smaller than that. This amendment, as drafted, will then create a difficulty for citizens in properties that are smaller than 113 square metres. The amendment as currently drafted would involve extending the relief to all first-time buyers between 2002 and 2008 who are renting an alternative or larger property. One of the issues that I ran into quite quickly is the fact that there may be many reasons for people to move on to acquire a second property. Included within that are the issues and pressures to which the Deputy has referred, which I acknowledge. However, there may be other reasons for people moving on to acquire another property. If I accept this amendment, it may cause problems for me in terms of the reasons for which this relief might then be drawn down. Finally, the amendment as written assumes that all accidental landlords have moved on to properties with more bedrooms. Therefore, it might exclude a family that moved to a property of the same or even smaller size in order to be closer to family support, to a school or to public transport. It is for all of these reasons that I am not in a position to accept this amendment. However, what I have not done is reject the amendment giving the same reasons that were proffered last year. The Deputy has submitted a different amendment but the fact that he only raised this issue relatively recently with me meant that I was not in a position to find an alternative way to deal with the issue that would satisfy me. I have just outlined several reasons as to why this particular amendment will not work but I am happy, following this debate, to engage with the Deputy to determine if there are ways in which this issue can be dealt with that do not trigger other problems with which I would then have to deal. It is for these reasons that I am not in a position to accept the amendment.

While I know he is not trying to be disingenuous and I acknowledge his offer to meet to see if this can be fixed, it is a deeply frustrating response. As the Minister of State, Deputy Michael D'Arcy, will tell the Minister, I explicitly said on Committee Stage that I did not want to be discussing my amendment on Report Stage but wanted to be discussing the Government's amendment. I know that my amendment is flawed. We have just dealt with three pages of detailed legalese aimed at figuring out how to stop employers from gaming the system if they want to build a gym or a crèche. The departmental officials have thought it through at great length. They have mapped the amendment to different parts of the tax code and to different Acts to make sure it is sound. No individual Deputy in this House has that capability.On behalf of the families who are stuck in this situation, I do not accept an Ireland where the Government can say it can come up with the most detailed tax plans for vulture funds, property investors, employers who want to invest in gyms and non-domiciled residents, and where we have 1,000 pages of detail and armies of lawyers looking at ways of undermining us, as well as sweeping anti-avoidance powers within the Revenue Commissioners. We are able to do those things because that is our business yet, for these families, it is just too complicated and we cannot figure it out. On behalf of the families who are trapped, I do not accept that and I do not think it is a reasonable point to put forward. I take the Minister at face value and acknowledge he is not trying to be disingenuous. Again, on behalf of these families, I appeal to the Minister. If he has the political will, in my experience, his very clever officials and their advisers will be able to figure this out in the same way they are able to figure out how to avoid having people get around the tax code in so many other ways.

The difficulty I faced in dealing with this issue with the Deputy for the first time was that, while I approach all the issues in front of me with fresh eyes, as he would expect me to do, given all the other priorities I had to deal with in the context of putting together a full Finance Bill, it simply was not possible for me to see whether there is any way in which the issue he is raising could be dealt with in a way that would not cause issues for me in other parts of the tax code. I have outlined good reasons why I cannot accept this amendment and, in fairness to the Deputy, he has not challenged some of them, and I understand that he knows how careful we have to be in regard to the drafting of changes in our tax code. I will commit to the Deputy that, in the aftermath of this Finance Bill, in which, for the reasons I have outlined, I cannot deal with this issue, I will meet him and will engage in a serious way to see if this issue can be addressed without causing issues elsewhere in the tax code. I understand the plight of many families who are in this situation. I do not have a monopoly on good ideas about ways to address serious matters in our society. This is the spirit in which this is being offered. I did not answer a question Deputy Doherty put to me on the cost were this amendment to be accepted. We cannot give that cost at the moment because of the way the amendment has been drafted, given it makes reference both to the square footage of a property and what the level of rent might be. For that reason, we cannot give the Deputy such a cost. This goes back to the heart of the issue I have. Before going ahead to implement any code, including any other amendment change that I will have to implement across next year, I will only do it when I am certain as to what the cost is going to be. For those reasons, I cannot accept the amendment but I am making an offer to Deputy Donnelly that I will honour later on in the year.

First, I acknowledge the offer, which I think is genuine, and I hope the Minister will be persuaded not by the legal argument but by the political argument - the human argument. People's lives have been destroyed. People have left the country over this. There are people living in fear of getting a call from the Revenue Commissioners saying they have been renting for five years and have not paid any tax, and that they owe €50,000. Obviously, they should not be doing that but there are people in this situation. I have met people who sit down at the end of the year and fill in their self-assessments, trying to figure out where in the name of God they are going to find €5,000 that they never had to pay before when they are not earning a penny more, while their children are growing and eating their wages at an accelerating rate. I will ask a clarifying question and the Minister might respond to me after the debate. When he says he will meet me later this year, is there an opportunity to get this into law for 1 January 2018 or is he talking about engaging later on in the year with a view to putting it into the budget next year?

The Minister shall within 1 month of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report considering the merits of a Vacant Home Tax.”.A couple of weeks ago, we had a good debate on this issue on Committee Stage. I argued strongly that we needed to introduce a vacant home tax. We have the amendment that is tabled in my name but I note that, interestingly, amendment No. 79 commits the Minister to include in the Finance Bill a report within nine months. He is taking our clothes in the sense that we only do this because it is the only way we can put forward these types of amendments, whereas there are no restrictions on the Minister. Usually, a commitment on the floor would have sufficed-----

If there had even been a commitment on Committee Stage, I do not think the Minister would have had to put this into the Finance Bill because we take his word on these issues. However, there was no commitment and the Minister argued very strongly that, because of the complexity of the issue, he would not go ahead with it. Unfortunately, I was forced to put it to a vote but, given the abstentionist position of my colleagues in Fianna Fáil, I lost that vote, along with many others. Hand on heart, I welcome the Minister's commitment in this regard. While it is just a report, my view is that it signals the introduction of a vacant home tax. It is one part of the jigsaw and there are many other parts but it is a very serious part. One of the issues we have in terms of the housing crisis and homelessness crisis is the length of time it takes to construct a property and to go through planning. The Central Statistics Office tells us approximately 183,000 properties are lying vacant across the State and while those figures may be disputed, we all know that only a portion would in any way, shape or form be capable of being brought into usage in any meaningful way in a short time. Nevertheless, the vacant home tax is a way of trying to encourage owners to avail of other schemes that are available, like the renewal schemes, to get their homes back into a condition where they can be let or sold and brought back into use. This is long overdue but I welcome that the Minister has done it. I am glad we were able to have that debate on Committee Stage and I am sure it prompted the Minister to bring forward this amendment. On that basis, I will withdraw amendment No. 23. I note the Minister's amendment refers to "not later than 9 months". The quicker we can bring this in, the better, because there will need to be a discussion in this regard.As such, it would not be appropriate to introduce it in September, which would be just one month away from budget day. It is key that, instead of us still discussing this issue at the time of next year's Finance Bill, we be enacting it in that legislation.

As a Deputy, a significant number of cases have been referred to me concerning delays around the granting of probate - it can drag on for many months - as well as legal disputes about the ownership of property and questions about properties that are under the control of receivers and properties that belong to people in nursing homes, giving rise to concerns that any rental income would affect the computation of their liabilities under the fair deal scheme. The House can support the general principle of an analysis, but the Minister will need to get accurate baseline data, which he has recognised in his amendment. We need to see a profile of the more than 181,000 vacant properties divided into some of the categories to which I just referred. If this is to be an effective intervention by the State to help bring more of the housing stock into use, it will have to recognise those complexities.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	427	I was a part of the discussion on this matter on Committee Stage. We have also tabled an amendment. Like Deputy Doherty, I welcome the fact that the Government has acceded to the suggestion that we need a report on a vacant home tax. I will not press our amendment, as the Minister has tabled one, but urgency is critical. I said something on Committee Stage that bears repeating, given that the Minister and the Department will decide how fast to move on this matter. It is immoral that there are, according to the CSO, 180,000 empty units when we are facing a shocking and appalling housing and homelessness crisis. Something that might not be underlined enough is that, also according to the CSO, 65,000 of those houses have been empty for five years. Deputy McGrath cites, and the Minister probably cited them as well on Committee Stage, complexities and various reasons these units are empty. I accept that, but I do not accept 180,000 units being empty when there are people dying on the streets. That is more unacceptable than a few unintended consequences of the measures taken to deal with it. The crisis is beyond any kind of excuse in light of the hardship and suffering it is imposing on people. The main priority is to get people who have no place to live into properties that are sitting empty. I do not believe that a vacant home tax is the only solution to this, given that more needs to be done, but it may be part of the solution. We must find out the status of every empty unit, particularly in areas where the crisis is most acute in terms of homelessness, housing lists that are a decade or more long and where there is nothing available for people on ordinary incomes to rent or buy, and get as many of those units as possible into use as a matter of urgency. While I welcome the Minister's decision to insert an amendment along the lines of the Opposition's proposal, it needs to happen quickly and the wider issue of determining the status of those vacant units and doing everything that is necessary to get people who need homes into them should be a priority for the Government.

We need to keep an eye on a certain matter, though, especially in respect of rural parts of Ireland where, for example, an elderly person's family member built a house that is no longer in great nick. If we do not include provisos to address situations like that, we will be levying taxes on people who receive no benefit from the houses. The number of vacant houses around the country is incredible. We should do more and people need to be pushed to ensure that those houses are put into use, but we must be mindful of areas where there is no rental need - unfortunately, might I add. I wish there was such a need. We must be mindful of situations where a family has a new house built over the road or an elderly person dies in an old house. The councils had a system to address this if a house did not have running water or electricity.

However, I have decided to introduce it because we need to crystallise and understand this issue. There has been much debate in recent months on the role of such a tax. I decided that, in light of the ongoing debate, it would be helpful to lay out the various issues that could be involved. To clarify for the House, and as the nature of my contributions on Committee Stage bore out, I am not committing to the introduction of this tax. Rather, I am committing to scoping out all of the matters that the Department of Finance, the Oireachtas and I would need to be aware of before a tax like this could be introduced. I am not committing to the principle of it because, before I can commit to the principle of any form of taxation, I must be able to answer basic questions on how it would work. What are we taxing? What do we believe the effects of the tax would be? What do we believe the side-effects would be? Would it deliver against other objectives for that tax apart from raising revenue? If these complexities were not dealt with, many of the Deputies who support the principle of this tax would be, within moments of their constituency offices being contacted by people who have been disadvantaged by this tax in a particular circumstance, some clear examples of which Deputy Fitzmaurice has just given, condemning me for being either callous or incompetent for implementing a tax that created the kinds of difficulties that they would be gripped by shortly after the introduction of such a measure. For all of these reasons, I have decided to propose this amendment to lay out the various issues that would need to be addressed. I have done so because a number of Deputies who have been calling for this measure to be introduced do so without taking account of all of the complexities and unintended consequences that could be created by introducing this tax. It is in that spirit that a measure like this would be a helpful contribution, if not even a vital one, to the debate on such a policy across 2018.

We have argued for this for quite a long time. We have always said that there is a lot of detail in it and there could be many unintended consequences. I welcome the fact that there will be a report on it. I referred to a nine-month period. The Bill will pass into law in December, and nine months would take us to next August or September. This needs to be scrutinised. The Minister is giving himself nine months. Will he indicate to the House when he will be able to complete the report and lay it before the House? Will he complete it any earlier? That would ensure it could be properly discussed and we could deal with all of the issues he has outlined, which we are well aware of in terms of potential tax. We could then be fully informed about any scrutiny of such a measure, including by the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, before the Minister makes a final decision on taxation matters and the budget in the second week of October.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	431	We propose to replace the property tax with a landlord tax, which mainly involves wanting to deal with the inequities of the local property tax. In our alternative proposal of a landlord tax, we make a distinction between people who have one additional home and those who own multiple properties and are running a business. A simple distinction could be made in terms of thinking about a vacant home tax. A dispute in a family over an inheritance may mean that a number of family members are involved in legal issues and so on. Vulture funds, major commercial landowners and so on have multiple properties. Once a person owns more than three or four properties, he or she is involved in a business. It is unconscionable that such people are sitting on empty properties. I cannot think of many complexities in a situation whereby someone who owns multiple properties leaves them empty. This is happening on a major scale. In the committee, I cited an example of which I have intimate knowledge in my area, namely, the Robin Hill flats in Balally. NAMA sat on them, as it were, and then flogged them to a vulture fund which sat on them and tried to evict tenants because it was profitable for it to let flats lie empty and appreciate in value. That sort of thing is, quite frankly, disgusting. Urgent action could be taken on that, notwithstanding the need to examine the more complex issues relating to families and individuals.

We all know what a vacant house or apartment is, but will a definition and timeline be placed on properties over shops or offices which may have been habitable and occupied up to two or three years ago? These are the kind of complexities which will arise. So-called granny flats which have independent access and adjoin properties are another issue.

Such properties are not transferred and are being left idle for a long time. People were thrown out on the road, while at the same time properties were being left idle for a year or 18 months. We should be mindful of that issue and ensure we give banks engaged in such practices as hard a medicine as we can.
#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	434	I agree that an important starting point would be to define what constitutes a vacant home. One element will involve defining for how long a property has been vacant. We can begin to tease that out. If we set a definition that a home has to be vacant for more than a year, for example, we then get into questions regarding who determines that. Is it a local authority? Is it the Revenue Commissioners? Will there be self-certification? If we fix on one year, what about a property which has been vacant for eleven and a half months compared with one which has been vacant for twelve and a half months? While many are calling for the prompt introduction of this tax, if these issues are not resolved, they will condemn me for not doing it properly. These are the issues which need to be better understood. On the direct question put to me, I wish to inform Deputy Doherty that I will try to complete the report quickly enough to allow for its proper discussion. I will ensure this is not a report that we publish on budget day, because that is a criticism he has made of other documents. I will ensure it is available in advance, if possible, in order that it can feed into the political considerations of parties or Independent Members and debates in committees. I do not want this to be a report that we publish on budget day because those who support the tax will have questions that they need to answer which will be highlighted by the report. Would I support a landlord tax? It would merely accelerate some of the difficulties we have regarding the provision of private sector rental accommodation. The Deputy is well aware of the challenges in that sector.

#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	436	I move amendment No. 24:In page 20, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:“13. The Minister shall, within nine months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a comprehensive cost benefit analysis of the Help to Buy Scheme.”.This amendment relates to the help-to-buy scheme. The wording of my amendment is taken directly from a recommendation in the Indecon report which calls for a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the scheme to be undertaken after a period, because given the limited timeframe since the measure was introduced, this report inevitably can only represent a preliminary assessment. In essence, the report found it was too early to determine the impact of the scheme on house prices and the supply of new residential properties. The report was critical of the Government for not conducting a cost-benefit evaluation of the scheme prior to its introduction. It states that while there were understandable reasons for this, Indecon was concerned that this should not be seen as a precedent for other measures. The wording mirrors what is in the Indecon report. Just like the commitment of the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, that the report on the possible introduction of a vacant home tax would be published in advance of budget day, the same commitment should be given in respect of a cost-benefit analysis of the help to buy scheme in 2018.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	437	Very serious questions have to be asked about the value of this scheme. Property prices are out of control in my area and are completely out of the reach of ordinary working people. It is not just that 6,000 people are waiting for 15 or 18 years on housing lists. Others who cannot even get onto housing lists because their incomes are slightly over the threshold do not have a prayer of buying a house in my area, where average house prices are €400,000 or more.This is no use to them but it is a benefit for people who could afford a house anyway. It is not helping those whom we need to help because it has just increased house prices. They have risen 12.3% so far this year and they are going up approximately 10% per year. This is wiping out any benefit for ordinary people but giving a nice boon to people who could probably afford to buy houses anyway. The scheme has helped drive up property prices, as the Opposition predicted it probably would. We did not do a cost-benefit analysis and there is no real evidence it is doing anything to help the housing crisis. We need to reconsider its point and whether this money would not be far better spent on directly providing the housing we need or in some other way helping the people at the sharp end of the housing crisis. This scheme has not helped; it has, arguably, made things worse. There may be an unintended benefit for the people who do not need it. I do not see an argument for continuing the scheme.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	438	My views on the help-to-buy scheme have been long on the record. The Government introduced it without carrying out any assessment of its effectiveness and the goalposts have been shifted time and again as to why it was introduced. Originally, it was to help individuals gather their deposit but then the Central Bank pulled the rug from under the Government and changed the rules. We now see very clearly that the majority of people availing of this have no problem reaching the Central Bank's minimum requirements in getting a deposit but they still get up to €20,000 tax-free. We just have to look at this as handing money to individuals. I have spoken on this many times and house prices are escalating at a dramatic rate. This is a case where the Government is not seeing the wood for the trees. When prices are going up by 10%, 11% or 12% per year, the maximum of €20,000 that one can get in one's pocket is just a fraction of the rate prices are increasing. It is the main problem and we must stop house price inflation. Economists and people with expertise in the area have said time and again that this scheme leads to house price inflation. The best the report carried out by the Government a year after the fact could say is that findings are inconclusive, but it also mentioned everything I referred to on Committee Stage. The issue is supply and this is a demand-side solution. This is quite basic as there is a problem with supply but this scheme increases demand. Therefore, it does nothing to resolve the supply-side problem. This was put to the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, and he argued this scheme will encourage developers to build houses, therefore increasing supply. That cannot work because there is only a set period in which this scheme will exist. If a party was not planning to build a house in the first place, there would be no planning permission on a site and that process would have to be gone through. There would have to be tenders for the build before the construction. It could be a three-year lead-in period and at that stage the scheme would no longer be available. It simply cannot work. I have no problem with Deputy McGrath's amendment but I wonder if he is sincere about it and will push it to a vote. When we put forward a similar amendment on Committee Stage that would have monitored the effectiveness and value for money of the help-to-buy scheme, Deputy McGrath did what Fianna Fáil does these days - he abstained and sat on the fence. The amendment was defeated by one vote, arising from Deputy McGrath's refusal to vote. I welcome that he has tried to claw back a bit of integrity with this issue and has put forward his own amendment. I will support it as there should be cost effectiveness and we should monitor such matters. I hope the Minister will agree with us but this should have been done on Committee Stage. There was nothing to fear from the amendment I put down on Committee Stage, which sought a report on the effectiveness and value for money in the help-to-buy scheme. Deputy McGrath is correct about the recommendations of the report that was published on budget day. The Minister's predecessor gave the commitment it would be published prior to budget day and there was no reason not to do it. The only reason to hold back anything until budget day is if it would have serious consequences for the market. For example, if a report indicated stamp duty should be increased to 6%, I would completely understand a Minister not publishing it until budget day because it would have given a clear indication of where the Government was going on that. This report did not state anything like that. The report in question was published on budget day because it is critical of the Minister's measure and it does not prove that the scheme assists, in any way, shape or form, with supply. It indicates there is a supply-side problem and this is a demand-side solution and it notes that the majority of individuals benefitting from this cash in their pocket do not need this money to meet the Central Bank's rules for minimum deposits. Its findings are inconclusive and there is an indication that more study needs to be done. It is critical of the fact these studies were not carried out beforehand. As I said, I have no problem supporting the amendment. We discussed this on Committee Stage. Everybody can change their mind and I welcome that Fianna Fáil has done so and wants us to monitor the effectiveness and value for money of this scheme. I would have preferred if Fianna Fáil supported Sinn Féin in seeking to have this scheme ended. All this is doing is contributing to pushing up house prices and putting money into the pockets of developers.

We can have a go at the Government but it may have tried something it genuinely thought would help people. I am not saying it was or it was not and there are question marks over it. It is important, especially before we have another budget, for a report to be done to analyse its good and bad elements. There is no point in doing something that might inflate the market, pushing houses from the grasp of people who might be living in a wonderland who think X amount will be coming to them. The reports sought by Deputies McGrath and Boyd Barrett would have unanimous support, from what I have heard. I hope the Minister will consider that and Deputy McGrath should push the issue to ensure the report is done.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	440	The Deputies will be aware that the help-to-buy initiative has been in operation since January 2017. It is designed to assist first-time buyers with obtaining the deposit required to purchase or build their first homes. With a view towards increasing the supply of new housing, the relief is only available in respect of new build or self-build properties. Following its introduction in budget 2017, Indecon International Economic Consultants was commissioned to undertake an independent assessment of the measure, which included examining whether the policy objectives on the supply of new homes were being met, as well as the impact, if any, it was having on house prices and the residential property market generally. The Indecon review found that the scheme is meeting its objective of assisting first-time buyers of new homes to fund the deposit required under the Central Bank's macro-prudential rules, and that the scheme has not had a measurable effect on house prices to date. Furthermore, it indicated that:Indecon’s assessment of the HTB is that there was a valid market failure argument for the HTB introduction. We also believe that the HTB, as a tax refund incentive, was likely to be as efficient as a direct expenditure intervention.On the basis of the Indecon findings, and considering that help-to-buy has only been in operation for less than a year, I decided to allow the measure to continue in its current form for the coming year. In continuing to monitor the scheme, my officials may draw upon a range of statistical sources, including data on construction activity and house prices from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as well as data from the CSO, such as the residential property price index and elements from the quarterly national household survey. In addition, the Revenue Commissioners publish monthly statistical reports on the cost of help-to-buy. Its report includes the numbers of claims made, approved and paid, as well as breakdowns of the figures by metrics such as property value, loan-to-value ratio and property type. It also includes a geographical breakdown of claims by county. As regards the amendment proposed by Deputy McGrath, I note the Indecon recommendation that a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis should be carried out “after a period". I think we can all agree that the measure has only been in operation for a limited period and there is, as yet, insufficient data for a meaningful ex post cost-benefit analysis. The period referred to in the Indecon report needs to be considered in the context that there is already a sunset clause in place for the help-to-buy scheme. Absent an amendment to the Taxes Consolidation Act in either Finance Bill for 2018 or 2019, the incentive will cease on 31 December 2019. For this reason and the fact that we have only just received a detailed report from Indecon, I cannot accept the amendment put forward by Deputy McGrath. Also, having regard to the information I have just presented to the House on the approach to keeping the measure under close review, I do not propose to accept the amendment put forward by Deputy Boyd Barrett and colleagues. There was a parliamentary question for the Minister for Finance in the last round. What people have said here is incorrect. The data that were presented by the Revenue Commissioners on the number of cases, the value of the property and the loan-to-value ratio showed that the vast majority of claims on the help-to-buy initiative were from those who were targeted.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	441	Deputy Doherty questions my sincerity and integrity. I can assure him of both on all matters concerning this Finance Bill. He is well aware of the confidence and supply agreement. When I make a commitment, I stick to it. I am not going to enter into an agreement and then seek to inflict defeats on the Government on the Finance Bill. I am not going to do that. Equally, I say to the Government and to the Minister for Finance that we want the cost-benefit analysis. Last year we insisted that there would be a report, which was subsequently carried out by Indecon. Ongoing monitoring by the Department is not sufficient. I deliberately took the wording from the Indecon report. The comprehensive cost-benefit analysis is a clear conclusion and recommendation from Indecon. I do not accept the argument that the scheme has not been in operation for a sufficient amount of time to carry out such a report. The scheme was originally flagged in July of last year. It was then included and formalised in the budget day announcement and enacted in the Finance Bill last year. In effect the market is made up of buyers and builders. Everyone has been aware of it since July of last year. What I am looking for is that over the course of 2018 the Minister will implement what Indecon, as independent consultants, have recommended on a scheme that is costing tens of millions of euro. I do not think that is too much to ask. I put it straight to the Minister. We want the cost-benefit analysis.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	442	I agree with the Deputy. I believe the scheme should be abandoned, but at the very least we should have the cost-benefit analysis and the Minister should set out clearly how he is going to monitor the benefits and effectiveness of this. To the minds of a very broad spectrum of opinion, including expert opinion, this is something that has actually contributed to the spiralling house prices. It has accrued no real benefit to those at whom it was to be targeted but has had unintended benefits for people who frankly do not need them. Given the squeeze on resources and the desperate need to put resources where they will actually have an impact on the current housing and homelessness crisis, anything less than a proper cost-benefit analysis of this measure, which costs a lot of public money, is not really acceptable.

People who are younger than me tell me that they will never aspire to own their own houses because of how property prices are at this point in time. It only suits one cohort of individuals, and that is the developers. I put it to the Minister of State that he is misleading the Dáil. He did not name me, but I presume he was referring to me when I said that the information is that the majority of those who benefit from the help-to-buy scheme do not require it to reach the minimum deposit requirements set down by the Central Bank. The Minister of State said that was wrong and that the scheme was targeted. He mentioned a response to a parliamentary question. I have not seen the response. The Minister of State obviously has. However, I have read the Revenue report of October which gives us the monthly statistics on the help-to-buy scheme. It shows that there have been 4,487 claims on the scheme at this point. Some 1,408 of those had a loan to value in excess of 90%. All of the rest were below 90%, falling between 90% and 70%, which is the threshold for entering the scheme. This means that of the 4,487 claims in that report, 3,079 of those who received the money did not need the incentive to make up the loan to value ratio. That equates to 68.6% of the total. It is important that the Minister of State puts the record straight and deals with the facts and statistics, if he wants to rely on those statistics. I am sure that the departmental officials can give the Minister of State the Revenue report. It is produced monthly, and from my memory, on each month that it has been produced since the start of this year it has always shown that the majority of beneficiaries of this scheme did not require the help-to-buy scheme to make up the deposit in terms of loan to value.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	446	I am sorry that I missed the start of the debate. I have been interested in the help-to-buy scheme since it was announced. I was a little sceptical as to the positive effect that it would have. I have a good understanding of the industry and the mentality of all sides involved from my own experience. I remain sceptical that it is the way forward. There is no doubt that people need help, but in a scheme like this it is so difficult to avoid the benefit going into the pocket of the seller. That is not the Government's fault.There were a lot of things at play but it is not remotely unreasonable to look for a proper analysis of how it has worked and in fact it is a good idea. There are better ways of helping people in this area than by this scheme.

The figures which I have in front of me are very clear. They show that 53% of properties are less than €300,000 in value, showing that the money is targeted at first-time buyers buying average-price property throughout the nation. The next 30% is between €300,000 and €375,000. While €375,000 does not buy an awful lot where Deputy Boyd Barrett lives, 83% of properties relate to first-time buyers of new properties with very average prices. The figures I quoted were correct. I accept the advancement of a cost-benefit analysis in 2018 by the Department of Finance.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	448	I welcome what the Minister of State said. To be clear for Deputy Doherty and everyone else, when I table an amendment I do not know whether the Government will accept it. My party and I seek, sometimes through negotiation and sometimes through our work in Parliament, to get things done. This scheme was announced in July 2016 and lasts for 3.5 years, or 42 months. We are now in the 17th month of the scheme and will be half way through it in March 2018. Indecon recommends a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis but is not prescriptive as to when, but it is reasonable to do one half way through the scheme as there is not much point in doing it when it is all over, apart from what one may learn from the experience. If it is to have an input into policy it needs to be done in a timely fashion. Can the Minister of State elaborate on the commitment he gave? He said it would be 2018 but when will it be done? Will he commit to publishing it and will it be available before the budget next October?

On Committee Stage I introduced an amendment to the Irish real estate fund, IREF, regime to remove, from 1 January 2019, the exemption which applied to profits arising from the capital gains on land held for more than five years. Given the changes I am making elsewhere in the Finance Bill on CGT and stamp duty, I felt that it was important that this provision was also amended for consistency. In applying this provision from the start of 2019, I am ensuring that this change is introduced in a timely way while avoiding any undue disruption. As this measure was only introduced in Finance Act 2016 I felt it would be imprudent to completely remove the measure just one year after implementation. Doing so would negatively affect our position regarding the certainty of our tax system, which is critically important in terms of investment. Signalling this change one year in advance will help to negate any negative effect this change may have regarding confidence in the certainty of our tax code. This technical amendment ensures that the same treatment is afforded to both realised gains and unrealised gains. I commend this amendment to the House.

This year's Finance Bill removes that exemption. As a result, where property assets are sold after 1 January 2019 and gains are distributed to investors, the IREF will apply a 20% withholding tax on those distributions unless the investors are exempt as is the case, for example, with pension funds. This applies regardless of when the asset was bought by the IREF and any realised gains after 1 January are caught. Amendment No. 27 makes a further technical amendment to deal with the situation regarding unrealised gains. These unrealised gains are recognised in the income statement of an IREF each year and reflect an asset's increase in value but the gains will not be realised until the asset is sold. We are not looking to catch unrealised gains when they are recorded in the income statement each year as we want to catch them when the asset is ultimately sold and the gain is distributed. By making this amendment, we make sure the provision operates as intended and we do not inadvertently catch unrealised gains.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	460	My amendment No. 28 was ruled out of order but it deals with the same topic. It sought to amend section 18 of the Finance Bill on Irish real estate funds and to change the date which shall apply to disposals from 1 January 2019 to 1 January 2018. The section as it currently stands provides that IREFs which dispose of assets before 1 January 2019, and where the five-year period has elapsed, will be still able to avail of the capital gains tax exemption. The implementation of the change from 1 January 2018 would have had the effect of adding to the tax liability of those IREFs currently covered by this section in 2018.Therefore the amendment has potential to impose a charge on the people, I was told. I do not understand where they came up with that one. It was discussed at the committee. I do not understand why the Minister could not make it 2018. He might make the argument that this would be springing it on them too quickly, but the amount of profits that REITs have been allowed to make in this country in recent years is out of kilter with anything that has happened in the property sector in my lifetime. The State should be garnering much more from them than it is. To bring the date to 1 January 2018 rather than 2019 would be some compensation by recouping something that the State has lost.

I take it that is the case. Therefore, a person did not actually have to dispose of the asset to be able to avail of the dividend withholding tax. Obviously, however, the other provisions would have applied then where it started to taper off. I made all the points on Committee Stage which Deputy Wallace has made here. It is appalling that the Minister is not introducing this measure for 2018. We have discussed it on Committee Stage and had votes on it and, unfortunately, the parties are where they are on this matter. It is ridiculous because this is a major benefit to the funds. There is a question about this amendment. This will mean that any disposals after 1 January 2019 will be subject to dividend withholding tax and any unrealised profits or gains recognised in the income statements from that point on will be subject to dividend withholding tax.

I am making this change because I want to ensure that we are treating these gains in the right way. The Deputy is asking me a question which I cannot answer now, but I will do so at the latest over the course of the Bill's passage through the Seanad. I do not want to answer it and unintentionally mislead the Deputy or the House. On the broader point which Deputy Wallace touched on and on which Deputies Doherty and Fitzmaurice agree, I believe the appropriate taxation regime for these gains is the one to which I am changing it. It is consistent with what I am doing elsewhere in the budget. The trade off that I have had to make, and Deputies disagree with me on it, is because the treatment of these assets and gains was only introduced in the Finance Act 2016. It has only been in operation for a relatively short period. I believe it should change in the way I have outlined but to maintain what I believe is an important part of our tax code, namely, certainty regarding how investment decisions are taxed, I believe the appropriate point at which to introduce this is the beginning of 2019, after which I believe it will be the most effective way of taxing the gains accrued by these entities. I will return to the Deputy with the details in response to his question.

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	469	I get the point that the Minister makes but I take a different position. I find it incredible that we have allowed this to go on for so long. I had a debate with the former Minister for Finance in this House on 16 January 2014. I said to him:The Government might view real estate investment trusts, REITs, as a quick fix measure to get rid of properties on the books of ... NAMA and the banks, but questions must be asked about the increased corporatisation of property, with little financial gain for the State. REITs are not taxed on their rental income as long as they pay 85% of it to shareholders as a dividend. [There is different corporation tax] as long as their income relates to rental income and non-resident investors are also exempt from Irish capital gains tax. There must surely be implications for the rental market in the years ahead.That was nearly four years ago. The Minister responded to me with some points: "My officials will be monitoring the uptake of REITs in the Irish property market, but it is not expected that REIT ownership of property will reach the level of concentration at which a distortion of competition in the market may occur." He went on to say:I also wish to highlight to the Deputy that potential benefits for property tenants were a motivating factor in the introduction of the REIT framework last year. REITs are specifically designed for the long-term holding of income-producing property.Then he said: “It is hoped that the introduction of this type of professional property management into the Irish market will, in the long term, help to standardise and improve management standards across the rental property sector as a whole, which would be of benefit to both investors and tenants.” That was four years ago. I do not understand, when we saw that this was going off the Richter scale, why the Government did not act earlier and deal with what was a licence to print money. It had incredible potential to distort the property market, which it did, and especially the rental market. We sat idly by. The Minister is making a change now, and that is to be welcomed, limited as it may be, but can he explain why we did not react at an earlier stage?

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	471	I was on the finance committee when these REITs tax breaks were first introduced. I opposed them from the word go although I did not fully understand what they were, but I knew it was a tax break for people investing in property. I thought it was unbelievable at the time and said so. After the property bubble and the crash that we had gone through and the devastating consequences which it wreaked on the entire country, I found it hard to comprehend that the Government planned to introduce new tax breaks for property.As Deputy Wallace said, the former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told us at the time that we needed professional landlords to come in and that this would sort of modernise the property sector and be to the benefit of tenants. As against the dysfunctional property sector that had led to the bubble and the crash, we were going to get a new and improved professional, streamlined property sector. However, that is not what we got. We got another property disaster only a few years after the previous one which produced the worst economic crash in the history of the State. Brilliant. Absolutely brilliant. As I mentioned on Committee Stage, I find the websites of guys such as Deloitte incredible. I quoted from PwC's website earlier and I will quote from Deloitte's website now. Referring to real estate investment funds and the changes in the Finance Bill 2016, it states not to worry about the changes because "the vast majority of Irish regulated funds continue to be exempt from Irish tax on their income and gains with no Irish tax on payments to non-Irish resident and exempt Irish resident investors". Brilliant. It is brilliant if you are a non-Irish resident or an exempt Irish resident speculator in property because there is no tax on income or gains although income and capital gains in the sector are going through the roof. Last week Hibernia REIT plc had yet another half yearly report on the absolutely unprecedented increase in its profits. Its half yearly profits were up 118% - you could not make it up - and its rental income was up by 31%. They are creaming it off. I-RES REIT plc is similarly creaming it off and making an absolute fortune from the property chaos that is going on in this country due to the mad decision to give tax breaks to these guys and unload all of this property from the banks via NAMA to them. They must think all their birthdays have come at once. They will walk away without paying any tax and the Minister is now letting them know he will close the door. However, it will be long after the horse has bolted, which is no good to anyone. It is no good closing the door after the horse has bolted but that is what is being proposed. We should close the door as soon as possible to try to recover something from the disastrous policies that have brought us to where we are today.

If the Minister is going to do something, he has to spring a surprise and the beginning of 2018 is the time to do it. Basically, we should not be telling everyone our little secrets to ensure they can escape what is to come.

Part of this was dealt with by the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, on Committee Stage and I understand that the committee went into private session to allow a number of technical questions which were raised by Deputies to be answered by the Revenue Commissioners. We committed at that point to supplying a technical note to answer formally questions that were raised by members of the committee and we will do that. On the points put to me by Deputies regarding the change coming into effect on 1 January 2019, the decisions that the former Minister, Deputy Noonan, made about these funds were right given our property market and the economy of our country at the time. However, I have decided it is right to make this change. I am changing the relief because I believe, with the developments in our economy, this is the right policy choice to make. There is a benefit to maintaining a degree of certainty regarding how we manage tax policy and important policy changes in the country. Therefore, as I said on Committee Stage and earlier in my contribution today, as this amendment, which I want to make, relates to a measure which was recently introduced in a Finance Bill, it will not come into effect until early in 2019.

"Gambling
19. The Minister shall, by way of follow-up to the report published in 2015 by the Department of Social Protection and entitled Playing Social Roulette: The Impact of Gambling on Individuals and Society in Ireland prepare a report under this section on the potential for increased taxation of gambling operations, including as a Government response to the incidence of problem gambling.".The amendment is self explanatory so I will not delay unduly other than to make two short points. The report to which Deputy Burton refers in the amendment gives a very clear indication of the severe impact of gambling on individuals and society. We often use taxation as a measure to deter such behaviour, for example, in relation to cigarettes, sugary drinks and alcohol. I urge the Minister to consider the study outlined in the amendment in order that we can effectively tax gambling. It would also bring in very useful revenue which would assist public expenditure in other areas.

In a significant move in the area of regulating betting services, the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015 brought remote bookmakers and betting intermediaries offering betting services in Ireland into the regulatory regime for the first time. At the same time, these operations were brought into the betting tax net, effectively doubling the revenue receipts from this source. The 2015 Act was seen as a temporary measure pending the introduction of a wider Government approach to gambling under the gambling control Bill being prepared by the Minister for Justice and Equality. The Bill, as proposed, will update all existing laws on the regulation and licensing of gambling activities, including betting and gaming. It also includes a proposal to establish a social fund to assist in counteracting the ill effects for society, as well as for persons and their families, of irresponsible gambling. The scheme does not include the national lottery whose activities are separately regulated under the National Lottery Act 2013. Having been given special responsibility in this area, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is working to ensure that legislation providing for the regulation of the gambling sector can be published at the earliest opportunity. Discussions with the Office of the Attorney General are under way. The Deputy will be aware that a review of betting duty was published in the tax strategy group paper earlier this year. As part of this review, which included consultation with stakeholders and interested parties, consideration was given to the impacts, benefits and drawbacks of both imposing betting duty on the customer and also of increasing betting duty rates. As part of the process, Department officials met various stakeholders, including advocacy groups such as Problem Gambling Ireland and the Rutland Centre. The review can be found as part of the tax strategy group papers published on the Department's website. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

"Real Estate Investment Trust (REITS) and impact on Housing/Rental Market
19. The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report analysing the impact Real Estate Investment Trust (REITS) have had on rental prices, and residential and commercial property prices throughout Ireland, and particularly Dublin.".My amendment calls on the Minister, within six months of the passing of the Bill, to prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report analysing the impact real estate investment trusts, REITS, have had on rental prices, and residential and commercial property prices throughout Ireland, and particularly Dublin. There are several good reasons that should happen. I was amused listening to the latest report from Hibernia REIT boasting about the incredible money it is making. People might not have noticed but we tabled amendments to the commission of investigation into NAMA that was set up under the auspices of Mr. Justice Cooke. We added in a third module to examine the establishment of the Hibernia REIT. It was set up in 2013 following a three-year stint at NAMA by one of its founders but the company was planned long before the individual left NAMA. Some business men on the east coast of the United States were briefed on the plan for Hibernia REIT as early as 2012. The same founder is on the record as stating that they know enough people in Dublin to be able to go buy properties in Dublin without having to go to auction or having to go onto the market. If one looks at some of the assets it has purchased, the links back to NAMA begin to appear, for example, the Forum Building, the Dublin Observatory building, the Harcourt Street building, Windmill Lane, and New Century House on Central Quay. All of those assets were in NAMA and are now in the hands of Hibernia REIT either through direct purchases or secondary deals. If the State is going to continue to turn a blind eye to how these people operate and allow them to have such an impact on the property game in Ireland, be it in terms of ownership or rental, that would be a huge mistake on the part of the Government. REITs are subject to an entirely different tax regime from individual landlords. They are not subject to any tax on their rental incomes nor are they subject to tax on their gains. To achieve those gains, REITs must distribute 85% of all property income profits annually to shareholders. The manner in which REITs were set up in the first place is worthy of research given that Bill Nowlan of WK Nowlan, the father of Kevin Nowlan, spent nearly two years lobbying the Department of Finance and they got the best sweetheart deal anyone in business in Ireland ever got. We are calling for research on whether this is good for the State and if we should allow it to continue in the manner in which it is working currently. The question is whether it is worthy of examination of the impact on the property game in Dublin, as it is mostly Dublin in which the REITs are operating. We want to examine the impact they have had and how big a part they have played in the escalation of rental prices in Dublin city in particular and other cities around the country. I referred in an earlier amendment to a discussion I had nearly four years ago on the issue with the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan. I refer to one of his main arguments against me at the time when I was warning him about REITs.I reminded the Minister that one of the big problems we had with our building bubble was that a small group of people gained control of most of the land in the city and they land-banked it. They owned over 90% of the land with potential for development and thus controlled the price of it. The prices went crazy. I have said it before, but I ended up paying €5 million for one fifth of an acre in a rough part of Dublin's north city. It was not the developers and builders who were making the mad money; it was the land-banker. This was in January 2014. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued:There is a huge overhang of property, including portfolios held by NAMA and properties being held as collateral for impaired loans across the banking system. The banks have been deleveraging rapidly, especially Ulster Bank. There is potentially an enormous amount of property on the market. Part of the Government's job is to clear the overhang first because there will be no property development in this city or country until that is cleared. It is surprising that the overhang is being cleared so fast. I am unsure why he was so surprised given that NAMA was absolutely flogging it at fire-sale prices. The take-up was powerful because it was money for jam. It is all well and good to say that the horse has bolted and that there is no point in worrying about it from here on. Actually, that is not true. In recent years, real estate investment trusts have bought one fifth of all new residential properties in Dublin and the figure is rising. Those involved have a cartel now. That is why an investor can get €2,700 for two-bedroom properties in some parts of the city. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, argued at the time that we needed professional landlords. By God, we have got them, but we have paid the price for it. Is the Government happy with the fact that rents are the price they are in this city? A person can rent an apartment in the centre of Turin for €400 per month. The Government may believe that we are going in the right direction by having a rent of €2,000 per month, but I do not agree. It is nuts and it is unsustainable. The Government needs to look at how REITs operate and how the Government relates to them.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	485	My comments are on a similar note. The points were made in the earlier discussion as well. We have a similar amendment. What has happened in recent years in this country is really extraordinary. The approach that Fine Gael and its partners, the Labour Party and the Independent Alliance, have taken to the property sector is quite extraordinary given what had happened previously. We could talk about amnesia. How could anyone think it was a good idea to incentivise property speculators after a bubble and crash that was caused by property speculators? How could anyone think of bringing even bigger property speculators in to replace the mostly-domestic property speculators that helped to produce the crash of 2008? It beggars belief. Those responsible must be literally off their rockers. However, that was a concerted policy for real estate investment trusts and vulture funds. The then Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, or Department officials had 64 meetings with these people in the period when many of the tax changes to benefit these entities were brought in. It was a conscious decision to bring these players in in the belief that it would restore the property sector. The last thing we needed to do was to restore the property sector to enable it to do all of the things that led us to the last property bubble and crash. However, that is what we have done with these tax breaks. As a consequence, rents and property prices are now spiralling out of control. Moreover, there has been a massive hand-over of property assets which, for a brief moment, we had in our hands. That is the awful thing. For a brief moment, via NAMA, we actually had these assets where we needed to have them, that is, in the hands of the State. We could have taken that opportunity and utilised those property assets and the revenues that were derived from them to provide housing and help small and medium-sized enterprises with office space. Had we done that, we would have done society a major favour and we would have prevented the possibility of crazy booms and slumps of the type that have wrecked the country in the past and that are likely to wreck the country again. Instead, we handed over the assets to an even smaller bunch or clique of enormous funds and international property speculators, mostly from the USA. I wish to highlight an additional point that has not been made. We do not even know how much tax is forgone in all of this. That is the other extraordinary fact. In the case of most tax loopholes, allowances and reliefs, we know how much tax is foregone. That allows us to assess whether any benefit arose, and we can carry out a cost-benefit analysis. In this case, for the cost analysis one need only look at the property sector, with the unaffordability of property and rents and the vast profits that keep rising for these entities. However, we cannot even assess the revenue side because we simply do not know. We cannot get figures. The Government cannot even tell us how much tax was forgone. Really, the Mafia could have designed a scheme of the sort that we have seen with NAMA, with the combination and interlocking of the hand-over of NAMA assets with the myriad or array of tax breaks. PricewaterhouseCoopers was the firm that advised these speculators to come into the Irish property market. It referred to the array of tax breaks that will allow certain organisations to walk away paying no tax whatsoever. We do not even know how much that tax foregone is. The figure is in the hundreds of millions of euro, without question. More likely, it is in the billions of euro. The Government cannot even tell us. The least we could do is produce a report on all of this to establish the consequences for the property market, including the residential market, in terms of the taxes forgone. People need a proper explanation and understanding of what the Government has done and what the consequences have been for all of us. That should include the consequences for the economy in a macro sense and for people who must now pay a fortune or who simply cannot afford the prices and rents that these entities are seeking for the properties.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	486	I welcome the two amendments. We have discussed this at the finance committee. I have been raising the matter for a considerable period. I will say it again: the Minister needs to open his eyes to what is happening around him. I have told him time and again. I have been banging this drum for well over a year now in respect of what has happened in the property market. We can talk about the results of the crisis and how it presents itself, but we must look at the source. Families are being outbid by what are called tax-efficient or tax-evading companies. Such companies have been allowed to operate while paying virtually no tax because of our tax code. They are able to outbid families in Dublin and elsewhere in the property market. I have given the Minister the figures and I have gone through them time and again. I keep repeating different figures because the figures continue to get worse as time goes on. Let us consider the figure for non-household buyers. A large proportion of this figure is made up of REITs and IREFs. These groups purchased 42% of new homes in Dublin up to July this year. That figure compares to 25% of properties purchased by first-time buyers. Does the Minister for Finance believe that is appropriate? It is not only those on the left who are saying it. Stockbrokers are coming out and calling for penalties on non-household buyers for outbidding and out-purchasing families who want to purchase homes.The Government is allowing this to happen. Nearly half of all properties in Dublin are bought up by real estate investment trusts, REITs, and Irish real estate funds, IREFs. In addition, 13% of all homes in the State are bought by non-household buyers. When we strip out local authorities and approved housing bodies, the figure falls to 10%. We estimate that the national figure for 2017 will be higher again. It is an absolute disgrace that these tax avoiding structures are pushing up house prices by increasing demand for property. They have the fire-power to buy off large tranches of housing resulting in ordinary families being outbid and pushed out of the market. They can only dream of having a home. A number of steps must be taken immediately. We must change the way in which these tax avoiding structures operate, remove their competitive edge and set a minimum amount of tax they must pay to protect the tax base. One immediate measure would be to increase dividend withholding tax for non-resident investors to 25%, with no reductions available. We should also abolish the capital gains tax exemption on properties sold while proceeds are kept within the fund.  The Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, described REITs as long-term investors when he appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach. Hibernia REIT blew a big hole in that argument when it stated it may sell some of its property assets. Funds are not long-term investors. Hibernia REIT's rental income increased by 31% in the first half of 2016 and has been increasing by more than 50% in different periods. According to its chief executive, Mr. Kevin Nolan, it is considering selling some of its properties to other investors should the right opportunity arise. Deputy Mick Wallace is correct. The Ministers should read the book NAMA Land to see how some of these structures were set up, the inside information and all of the rest. REITs are able to sell off property and the State, through the finance code, is incentivising them by having no capital gains tax, CGT, within the fund and allowing them to flip assets for massive profits and reinvest this money tax-free to expand their holdings. That is what is happening. I asked a number of questions in the joint committee, including on the 85% minimum the REITs must disburse as dividends. I also asked how their income was calculated. It is clear that, for example, with regard to deductibles, when computing their annual property income - this is crucial because not less than 85% of this must be in distributions - local property tax, remuneration, including bonuses, which is an absolute scam within the REITS, asset manager fees, which is another scam to ensure the 85% is reduced, are all deductible or may be written off.  I have done an analysis of the accounts of REITs, all of which are published every year, including 2017. I put to the Minister again that 85% of REITs are foreign owned because they are structured in order that foreign capital can buy up our assets in a tax efficient manner. It is an absolute scandal that the Government is allowing this to happen. Fianna Fáil needs to start to flex its muscles on this issue which is having a major impact on the property sector. Let us consider the three REITs operating here. In 2016, their combined value was €2.637 billion and their profits, including their asset value, was €329 million. As part of this, they made rental profits of €117 million, on which they paid €8 million, or 8%, in dividend withholding tax. When we consider all the profits recorded in their accounts for the same year, the effective tax rate paid was 3%. The three REITs paid €8 million of tax on the €329.1 million profits recorded in their annual reports. It is a scandal that the Government is allowing this to happen. The 2017 accounts are worse because the total value of the three REITs was more than €3 billion with Hibernia REIT having a value of €1.2 billion, Green REIT having a value of €1.3 billion and the other I-RES REIT having a value of €480 million. The dividend withholding tax paid on their profits continues to be 3%, which is pathetic. All of this is done because of the double tax treaties and so forth. We must apply capital gains tax within the fund, increase the dividend withholding tax and no longer allow for the deductibles that currently apply. The Minister must start to penalise these non-household funds for outbidding people who want to put a roof over their heads and call it a home.

The previous Government, with the then Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Moran, took a decision to openly invite vulture companies to invest here. We decided to sell the country when things were bad and we are trying to buy it back now that it has become expensive. The vulture funds are here to make a quick buck. Lives have been lost as a result of what some of them have done. They are crucifying people and they show no mercy. Their only concern is figures and how much profit they can make. For every €1 they invest, they will get at least €2, if not €3 or €4, back. What have we done? We have let them away with every scam in the past five or six years to ensure they do not pay taxes. They can get away with whatever they want because they bought assets when the country was in a bad state. They have screwed Irish people and rather than crucifying them, we are allowing them to use whatever loopholes they can find, patting them on the back and telling them what great fellows they are. When one is robbed one generally tries to catch the robber and put him in jail. These vulture funds have robbed Governments and citizens and, worse still, they have robbed lives, yet we are not doing anything about it. It is about time the Oireachtas put these fellows back in their boxes. We should screw them in whatever way we can and impose whatever penalties we can on them for what they have done to this country.

The Government and its predecessors appear set on preserving the status quo and supporting the rich and famous at the expense of ordinary citizens. This beggars belief after all we have been through and the rape and plunder visited on us by the banking scandal, the National Asset Management Agency and the vulture funds. While REITs and IREFs are not vulture funds, they are of the same species. I hate mentioning names but we brought a mercenary into the Department of Finance who has since left these shores again and moved on to the next rich pickings. We should have looked at the stables he was in, although I objected at the time of his appointment and referred in the House to the trail of destruction he had left behind him in the United States. The Minister for Finance invited him back to lead us here. This was all part of his dream.

They led the attack on our people. Deputy Fitzmaurice is right; it is as bad as what the Black and Tans did and many lives have been wrecked. Many people have taken their lives and many families are distraught, not to mention all the homeless people to whom we pay lip service. Hand in hand with all of this, we are not building houses. There is something very sinister taking place at the heart of Government. We are unable to build houses, yet we built houses in the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s and 1990s when we did not have a crane or a JCB. In the past, houses were built with picks and shovels and ropes were used to move cement. Everywhere one looks in Dublin one sees cranes.One would get dazzled with them at night-time through the haze. However, they are not building houses. They are building more offices for the companies we thought we would get over here in the past couple of days, but we saw where our friends were there as well. We pulled out of one of them and we lost the other. These policies are disastrous and they are having a negative impact on our country. Men gave their lives to get our independence and here we are selling it for 30 pieces of silver in a Judas-like sale, and we keep doing so. We expect to dose the medicine on the ordinary people - to hell or to Connacht. Now it is to hell or to anywhere. Connacht has not even room for them anymore, but we do not care. We let all these fellows have their bonuses and their big dividends and tax havens. It is despicable. Deputy Donohoe is a relatively young Minister. I wish him well. I am not saying that the Minister is too young or anything like that. Deputy Donohoe is a married man with a couple of children. I am sorry, I cannot say anything about children or being married anymore. The Minister knows what I mean. He is new on the job, a new kid on the block and we expect a great deal of him. We expect that the Minister has a nose on him that is smart enough to see what is going on, that we are being ripped asunder. We are being mauled and plundered, like we were back in the days when Cromwell was here. It is the very same. I stated, through the good offices of the Ceann Comhairle, on Leaders' Questions to Deputy Donohoe's great leader a few weeks ago that the bank robbers are no longer on the streets as I used to see them when I was young, with the gardaí following them and the Army minding the money for the courier services. They are inside, deep in the boardrooms. They are inside in these Ponzi schemes and they are doing what they want to whom they like when they like with impunity. We even pass legislation to support them. We say, "Off you go, lads.", and pat them on the back. I have said on many occasions that it is like rubbing butter into a fat sow's you-know-what. I will not say you-know-what but the Minister knows it is a big behind - we all know what it is. It is craven. It beggars belief that we, as an elected Parliament, would allow this to go on in this day and age, in 2017. With all the education, all the advisers and all the financial gurus, it beggars belief that these fellows can come in and run rings around us and have Ponzi scheme after Ponzi scheme, and as Deputy Fitzmaurice and others have said, rape and plunder, ride into the sunset and let us all go to hell. How can any ordinary person buy a house? Then we try to bring in a rejuvenation scheme. The former Taoiseach announced it one day, in what I called the "Four Roads to Glenamaddy", in Edgeworthstown, somewhere over in Longford. It was like "Four Country Roads." I do not know where he has gone now, what road he is on. I would say, a road never travelled - I do not know was it Mick Foster or which of them said that. We are not afraid to travel, but these fellows are travelling all of the time. They are running rings around us and we are supporting them. We try to rejuvenate towns and people want to turn offices and failed businesses into living apartments, and we cannot take the VAT off for them because we would be helping the builders. I say we can easily just take it off for the person buying the property who wants to get a house for himself. We cannot take the charges and development fees off because the local authority needs them. I have asked on countless occasions that we bring up the county managers to explain why we cannot build houses. We are sick of announcements of all the funding the Minister is giving. The people out there are wide awake to this. I have stated previously that they are waiting in the long grass for the Government. They waited previously and by God, they gave Fine Gael a fair clipping in the grass too. The few of them who survived were like hares in tufts of grass so that they could not be rooted out, but they will root them out the next time. The people are coming for Fine Gael because they are educated. We have young families out there who are educated now and they understand a fraud for what it is. Fraud is being perpetrated on the people in the name of democracy, and it is awful. I am surprised at the Independent Alliance. The Labour Party, the ordinary working man's people, supported Fine Gael. Founded in my own town, it could not even hold its conference there. We know what it did and what happened to it. Now it is the Independent Alliance's turn. Fine Gael was trying to export them to North Korea - some of them would not come back - and it was happy out to be part of the laugh, a diversionary tactic. Here we are. We had heavy rain today but the fog is lifting. The scamaill on the mountains are lifting and we can see what is going on. I doubt the Government wants people rioting on the streets, as they did over Mugabe - I mentioned his name here two weeks ago and I was told he was nearly finished, and he is. The Government's day is coming too because the people are awake. It used to be the west awake. The whole of Ireland is awake to see the misery on the streets, the people who cannot get homes and the homeless, and we then ridicule the priests and the nuns and all the volunteers who help to feed the hungry and clothe the needy. However, there are no needy with the Government, only the boys who need and want everything, and they will not allow anything, not even the scraps. When we were young, we would feed the hens with the scraps from the table. These fellows will not even give the scraps to anybody. They want it all to themselves, with big deep pockets. I would remind the Minister that there are no pockets in a shroud. They want to be everywhere. Greed is alive and well, and kicking. The culture, here in this Parliament, and in the Department of Finance and the Government circles, in the past number of years is feeding that greed enormously. Unless we get food poisoning or something, I do not know how we will get rid of it.

I recognise the role of international capital in a modern economy. I recognise the role of collective investment vehicles. They are widely used internationally. I understand the taxation rules that apply and the objective of avoiding double taxation and of ensuring that the profits are taxed on distribution. What we are lacking here is a proper analysis. The Minister published on budget day the 136-page report of the working group on tax and fiscal treatment of rental accommodation providers. I wonder how many people read it. The report needs to be gone through in some detail. The issues raised in these amendments, REITs and IREFs, got scant attention in that report. There was less than two pages on REITs and the taxation of REIT shareholders, and literally a few lines on IREFs. There was no analysis whatsoever on their role in the economy. The report states that 18% of households now are in the private rental sector. That figure is rising rapidly for a whole host of reasons. What we need here is a detailed analysis of the impact of these collective investment vehicles. Obviously, when one has limited residential supply in the market, ordinary buyers are competing with REITs and IREFs. That is a statement of fact. I would like to know what impact they are having on supply, on the traditional landlords in the market and on the rental market, for example, on tenants. We need an evidence-based approach to this issue. I understand why the taxation environment and taxation laws were designed to facilitate them coming into Ireland and I recognise their role in a modern economy, but there is a lack of analysis. There is a lack of detail on the impact that they are undoubtedly having. We need that analysis. There are amendments before the Minister. On Committee Stage, there was a commitment given that the tax strategy group would examine this issue and the role of REITs, IREFs, etc., in some detail. Can the Minister elaborate on that? Can the Minister give us more detail on exactly what he is asking the tax strategy group to do because it needs to address all of the issues that have been raised here by a number of Deputies?
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	495	Before I start, I will put on the record information I have that is contrary to what Members have been saying about the quantum of properties involved. There are three REITs in Ireland. In relation to activity within the property market, of the three REITs, I-RES is the only one that has concentrated on residential property. I-RES has approximately 2,450 apartments. As of May 2017, the top 20 large professional landlords, including corporate vehicles, REITs, investment funds and individuals, accounted for 2.83% of residential tenancies. Section 23 of the Finance Act 2016 introduced a new tax regime for funds that hold Irish real estate to be known as Irish real estate funds, or IREFs. The section was introduced to address the use of certain fund vehicles to invest in Irish property by non-resident investors. IREFs are investment undertakings, excluding UCITS, where 25% of the value of that undertaking is made up of Irish real estate assets. Where the main purpose of the fund is to invest in Irish property, this will also fall into the regime regardless of the level of property. Where an IREF makes an actual distribution or on the redemption of units in the IREF, non-resident investors will be subject to a withholding tax of 20%. Certain investors, such as pension funds, life assurance companies, charities and credit unions, are exempt from the withholding tax as this is the norm for such bodies across the tax Acts.The new regime applies to accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017. I am advised by Revenue that the first returns from IREFs will be filed in the middle of next year. If any areas of concern are identified, these will be addressed. I am also advised that my Department has been working with the CSO in order to get a more granular breakdown of the non-household buyer category classification into further categories. However, it is likely to be March 2018 at the earliest before this information is available.  Real estate investment trusts, REITs, were introduced in the Finance Act 2013. The regime provides for a collective investment vehicle for persons wishing to invest in property. REITs must be widely held, as it is a requirement that the REIT not be a close company, that is, a REIT cannot be under the control of five or fewer participators. A REIT must hold at least three properties and carry on a business of letting property. No one property may account for more than 40% of the total value of the property in the REIT. The REIT must derive at least 75% of its profits from property rental and must distribute at least 85% of its property income to shareholders.  I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that as there are only three REITs in Ireland at present, for reasons of taxpayer confidentiality it will not be possible to share the information sought by the Deputy with the House or with myself. However, I understand that Revenue’s large cases division has a dedicated team who look after REITs. As the REIT regime was introduced in the Finance Act 2013 that team is, as part of Revenue’s normal compliance review process, reviewing the structures of those REITs and the tax payable by those companies. Should any issues arise from that review, Revenue will bring those matters to the attention of my officials. On Committee Stage I agreed that certain issues raised in amendments tabled by Deputy Doherty in respect of IREFs and REITs would be examined by the tax strategy group. However, given the constraints regarding availability of information and taxpayer confidentiality, I do not think it would be appropriate to put the preparation of the requested reports into legislation. I cannot commend these amendments to the House but I can assure the Deputies that both IREFs and REITs are being kept under constant review.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	496	The Minister of State made reference to some figures showing the low percentage of residential units that are held by REITs relative to the amount of properties in the country. The point I made is that these guys have gotten hold of an incredible number of properties that have been made available to rent in Dublin city. They bought them in bulk from NAMA and from the banks. They are buying an incredible proportion of what has become available in the last few years. They are having an incredible impact on the system. One of the most frustrating things for me since I came into this place in 2011 is the fact that the problems around how we supply housing in all forms are not being dealt with in the way they should. I do not see anyone doing what needs to be done. There are so many problems in our construction industry and in how we supply housing and they are not being addressed. It is inevitable that we will continue with boom and bust. I promise that there will be another bust in a number of years, probably four or five. I will be shocked if there is not because the fundamentals are completely wrong. The Government is looking for trouble. I am not saying it is easy to fix but the Government is not doing what needs to be done. I do not know to whom the Government is listening but there are people in the industry who know where the bodies are buried and where the problems lie. It is fixable. It might take a long time but the Government could make a start. Rome was not built in a day but it was started. The REITs are only one element of the problem but the Government has allowed them to grow so much. The former Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, told me in 2014 that they were only worth €400 million. He also said that if it got out of control, he would address it but it has not been addressed. We tried to get Hibernia REIT into the NAMA inquiry as a module. In a few year's time, the Government will be checking to see if that entity was built on the proceeds of crime.

I understood that text would have been provided to us at some stage outlining exactly what was agreed. I ask that such text be provided at some stage just so we know exactly what type of report to expect because we took the commitment that the Minister of State gave us at face value. I have no doubt that the Minister of State will deliver on that commitment, as he has repeated it here this evening. The issue here is one which I will keep raising until we take action rather than just producing a report. The Minister of State made reference to the fact that there are only three REITs in the country and 2,450 IREFs. Hibernia REIT also has residential property, with approximately 9% of its portfolio made up of such property. Green REIT also has some such property but on a smaller scale. When I talk about non-household buyers, and I make this clear every time, I am not just talking about the REITs but the IREFs as well. The CSO, which we cannot dispute, will provide more granular detail but what they are telling us now is that over 40% - I think the figure is 45% up to July 2016 - of new homes in Dublin were bought by non-household buyers compared to 25% by first-time buyers. The amount of new homes in Dublin is not big anyway. It does not run into the thousands as we all know. There is an issue in terms of supply but the problem is that in a vacuum these funds, which are tax efficient, are going in and grabbing these properties. Revenue is not going to see anything wrong in that.

The Finance Act 2013 introduced the regime for REITs. I have addressed the fact that it cannot be a close company. We had a good conversation about that and we went into private session at one point to go into the details. In general the trading profits of companies is subject to corporation tax at 12.5%. Rental profits and corporation tax in relation to these is at 25%. Rental profits arising from REITs are exempt from corporation tax provided the REIT distributes at least 85% of its annual rental profits. Profits from any other activities within a REIT are subject to corporation tax in the normal way. I am advised by Revenue that while a REIT must distribute 85% of its annual rental profits, the Companies Act sets out the amount of profits that a REIT has available for distribution. In accordance with the Companies Act and taking a REIT which has rental profit, the profits available for distribution by the REIT would be the rental income of the REIT less all expenses of the REIT, including but not limited to local property tax, remuneration including bonuses and asset manager fees. It is important to note that a REIT does not get a tax deduction for the local property tax. In calculating the amount of a dividend a REIT is able to pay, the local property tax gets deducted along with other expenses paid. This reduces the amount of dividends a REIT can pay. The expenses come out of the profits. Therefore, the profits available for distribution are the profits after deducting all expenses incurred. The investors are then taxed on the profits as distributed. I gave a commitment to look into the matter of providing information to Deputies on Report Stage but I have been told that I am disallowed from going there and I have to adhere to that.

We make decisions in here all the time and, obviously, the Government of the day makes most of them. Whatever we do, it has to be in our interest that it is well-informed. I challenge the Minister of State to sit down and argue with me about where the property game in Dublin is going, where the housing industry is going and what is happening. I will sit down with him at any time and argue it out with him. We need to be better informed in order to make better decisions. Doing something like this is a small step but it is a small step in the right direction. It is not unreasonable and it would be a positive for this Parliament if we decided to do this.

When we look at the content of the amendment and what it is suggested a report would examine, can the Minister of State confirm whether or not the Tax Strategy Group will actually deal with these issues? A comprehensive amount of work needs to be done. Has it the capacity to do it? Some of the issues veer outside the taxation issues and, presumably, these will not fall within the scope of the strategy group, which will be focused on the taxation side.

We have withdrawn some previous amendments on foot of commitments by the Government to look at these things and I note the Government has conceded on producing a report on the vacant homes tax. As far as I am concerned, this is part of an array, to use PwC's term, of things that we need to know more information about, for example, what the impact and cost, or benefit for that matter, is to the people of this country. This area is not all of the problem but it is a significant part of the problem. The percentages the Minister of State quotes are slightly misleading because the question is how much property is actually moving at any point in time, and how much of the available property is being grabbed, and the Minister of State also concentrated on particular areas. We see that the combined impact of these entities, along with some of the other entities that are buying up large blocks of property from the banks or from NAMA, is having a very distorting, damaging and adverse effect on the property market. More important than the markets are the people who need housing and accommodation. We need to know what commitments the Government is making to produce a report that will tell us what the impact is on the property sector, and in regard to the taxes paid and the taxes foregone on the various tax breaks that have been given to these entities.

“Income volatility for the farming sector
19.	The Minister shall within three months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before the Oireachtas a report on the feasibility of introducing further tax provisions and stabilisation tools to deal with income volatility for farm enterprises both in terms of income tax and corporation tax.”.This amendment relates to the important issue of income volatility in the farming sector. In recent years, some provision has been made in the taxation code to recognise the extreme difficulty farmers face because of the uncertainty around their income, in particular commodity prices, milk prices and so on. We now have an income averaging system which allows taxable profit to be averaged over a five-year period. There was a further enhancement last year in respect of an opt-out scheme of income averaging for a particularly poor year.  We are all aware of the variables, not least the weather, which affect the farming sector. A number of farming organisations brought forward specific proposals to go further in regard to income stability measures. They were considered by the Minister, but he was not minded to include them in the budget. He has given a commitment, as part of an overall review of agri-tax, to re-examine this issue. We are asking for a report on the options to determine how we can further improve income stability measures for the farming sector.

There were realistic and genuine expectations that something would happen in this budget. There was a belief that there was political will across all parties and a willingness on behalf of the Government to introduce measures to help to equip farmers to deal with income volatility. There have been some measures in recent years. Income averaging, in particular, has been some help to farmers in this regard. However, it has flaws and additional tools are required.  Over the past two or three years, incomes in the dairy sector have varied greatly from one year to the next. Last year, as the Minister is well aware, given that the Minister of State, Deputy D'Arcy, has a background in dairy farming, dairy incomes were on the floor and people were under significant pressure. This year, dairy incomes are likely to be much higher and it has been a good year. We do not know what next year will hold. That can hold across various sectors of agriculture, in particular the dairy sector over the past two or three years.  In order to assist farmers, it is important that the tax code and Government policy work to try to mitigate against peaks and troughs. It is something we will consider as part of the next CAP programme in terms of how European policy can help to address the issue and provide a greater suite of tools to assist farmers. At national level, we need a greater range of tools within the tax code and the way with which income is dealt. Several farming organisations, including the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society, ICOS, put forward very reasonable and clear proposals. It is exceptionally disappointing that they were not adopted and progressed by the Minister in the budget. The amendment asks that within the next three months the Minister conduct a report into the viability and various advantages of the different proposals which were put to him and that we then set settle on introducing measures which would assist farmers and provide them with new options.  I ask the Minister to accept the amendment and give an explanation as to why, for the second year in a row, the Government balked at this idea when it came to the crunch. There were very real expectations in the previous year that something would be done and certain expectations were heightened this year that consideration had been given to the proposals on the table. It was hoped that action would be taken and something real would happen as a result.
#MichaelFitzmaurice	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-party	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-dob	unknown-#MichaelFitzmaurice-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	517	The first day I came into the House there was a discussion on equalisation of the rebate for farmers and the self-employed, and it was announced that they would get €1,600 back over a three-year period. It was disappointing to note in the budget that the figure for this year is approximately €250. A commitment was given for a three-year process, which has not happened.  On the farming sector and price volatility, as Deputies McGrath and McConalogue pointed out, milk prices were on the floor and farmers were losing money. Luckily, this year, milk prices are good. There has been a drive from the Department to encourage many people to return to the milk sector.Many people are currently very heavily invested and there is a danger that in two or three years, with the amount of money that has been borrowed and if milk prices get bad again, we will see the banks from which people have borrowed money closing in once more. History has a habit of repeating. Something must be put in place. I agree with doing a report but with everything I have heard tonight, it seems we are doing a report on this, that and the other. Actions speak louder than words. We need something where a farmer can park part of a good year to give some breathing space. There is ferocious price volatility now. In the beef sector, we have been told that with the likes of the Mercosur deal, if it comes about the way people are saying it will, there will be a reduction in beef prices of between 8% and 16%, which will blow the beef sector in this country. That is before we even talk about Brexit. The way prices are flying over a five-year period, if we do not allow an opportunity to benefit from a good year, more farmers will be lost. People may not like to hear it but with the likes of factories, one in seven people is involved in the agricultural sector, either directly or indirectly. If we do not ensure it is protected, we will be running down a very dangerous road. We will not be "rural-proofing" the system and this will lead to land abandonment, fewer exports and more unemployed people. Whatever about having a report, we must ensure that we can face down crises and leave people on a solid footing. Currently, it is like they are on a wave as they are up and then down. Price volatility is a major problem in the agricultural sector. The comments about Europe earlier were correct. We need to bring in some sort of minimum price as some stores in Ireland and other places are deciding to sell products below cost, leaving farmers basically rudderless; they can do nothing about it and it is driving people from the sector. If there is plenty of product at hand, people do not worry. We are in danger, particularly with small farms, which are affected more by this. They cannot weather the storm as they do not have the resources to do so. If we do not do something about this, we will have fewer farmers. When we joined what is now the European Union, we had 300,000 farmers, but we are now down to 120,000. We know we have a problem with age but it is not encouraging youngsters to come in when we have price volatility like we do. Nobody can survive with it.
#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	518	Before the budget, all the indications were that volatility in farming incomes would be addressed. I support the comments of my colleagues, Deputies Michael McGrath and McConalogue. Volatility is a problem for the dairy sector and, unfortunately, there is a probability other sectors will come under severe pressure. It is in the dairy sector that the problem really exists. There has been very significant investment in the dairy sector and, unfortunately, prices fluctuate from year to year. In 2016, we had a year of very bad prices but I am thankful that this year they have improved somewhat. All the indications and reports from Ornua predict that 2018 will again be a difficult year. Milk production is up around the globe. Some markets did not recover throughout 2017 and the butter price has dropped very significantly in the past couple of weeks. The indications are that prices will be under pressure in 2018. When the day comes for income tax to be paid next October, the cash flow on dairy farms will be under pressure and a significant tax bill will have to be paid. This happened in 2016, when income was at its lowest and significant tax bills had to be paid. Unless we address this volatility, we will seriously hamper a sector that has great potential for the economy and which could really deliver for rural Ireland. This is one sector that is driving on and that has the potential to deliver for rural Ireland, which has come under major pressure in the past number of years. Production has rocketed in this country since the abolition of quotas in March 2015 and the predictions of Food Wise 2025 may even be exceeded. How to handle volatility is probably the greatest pressure on dairy farmers. We have reneged on our responsibility to tackle it in this year's budget. I recommend that the Minister look very seriously at this matter. We are not talking about tax avoidance but rather having a level tax bill year after year. If we are serious about farmers who have invested huge amounts, we must realise that making predictions about cash flow and everything else can be virtually impossible because of the fluctuations in the market. We have the Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Schemes, which have brought investment to the sectors, but the Department of Finance can help rural Ireland and these farmers, who will be the backbone of rural Ireland into the future. In rural Ireland we have two resources, the agrifood sector and tourism. In 2016, farmers had to borrow to pay their tax bills. We cannot allow that to happen indefinitely. The Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association and the Irish Co-operative Organisation Society had proposals that had met a good hearing from the Department of Finance but it was extremely disappointing that some element of their submissions was not included in this year's budget. I request most strongly that we formulate a solution that could negate the differential in taxation from year to year from the system. It is imperative on us to deliver this change for the sector. I hope other sectors will see this in future but currently the dairy sector is the one that experiences the problem. It is incumbent on us to formulate a solution.

It is normal for a farmer to see income going up and down from good years to bad years. It is price volatility and it is the norm on any farm enterprise. The aim is to smooth the tax burden as it does not make sense to pay a big tax bill in a poor year. If we smooth it out, it will give certainty in a very volatile enterprise. The feasibility study being requested here would give a better handle on how to implement this process, what it would cost and what would be behind it. It would be a very positive step in giving certainty to farm families. There were positive indications before the budget that something would be done on price volatility and there was disappointment when that did not come about. This is an opportunity for the Minister to help farmers and give some level of certainty without any major cost to the State.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	520	I support this important amendment. Our flagship industry is the agricultural economy. I am now old enough to remember a number of recessions and each time it was the farming sector that took us through. When the farmers are doing well, they spend money locally. They spend it with local suppliers and on local equipment. We cannot just pay lip service to the problem of income volatility and we should formulate some balancing scheme for the good and bad years. We need some equalisation with respect to taxation. Farmers may be able to pay in advance, which may not be a good idea, or pay when they are able to pay. They always pay.They have no choice but to pay because they are levied with punitive interest and penalties. On the other hand, when the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed stands up and explains that a computer glitch is delaying the payments or blames human error the farmer then has to wait. He gets no interest, and he owes his suppliers money. He has no way of charging penalties. It is a one-way system and it is terribly unfair. Farmers make a large amount of investment. Nothing is happening in terms of house building in rural Ireland, or anywhere else outside the Red Cow. That is clear from this budget. For all the infrastucture investment only a tiny bit went into Kildare. The rest of the country is forgotten about.  The only people who have invested anything in the last number of years are the farmers, especially the younger farmers and dairy farmers. They have made huge investments. The banks have lent them the money. Two different banks held public meetings in my town - one of which we own almost 100% of - and they shovelled out the money to young farmers. It frightens me. I have a business that was a beneficiary. The young farmers always pay as well. They have made massive investments to double and triple their herds, lease land for 20 years and build new buildings. They are very important for the concrete industry, the construction industry and for tradesmen. Planning permission has been sought by many of them for tunnels under the roads. The county council cannot do them but the farmers can do them. The council cannot repair bridges but the farmers can get permission to close a road and put down an underpass. They can show the council how to do it. These are the people who put their shoulder to the wheel and took out those loans. Many of them have young families, are married and are setting out in life. They keep the last vestiges of rural Ireland alive. Everything else has been taken away from it.  There was a big story yesterday concerning a €30 million investment in An Post, in the form of a loan. One might think we were getting a gift. These people did not ask for any gifts. All they want is fair play and to be allowed to carry out their business with some supports. There is a spin-off of employment for the industries that service them. They pay back their loans, but they want to be able to pay their taxes when they are able to pay. They do not want to evade taxes, but want to put money away for the difficult years because it is a very volatile industry. Look, for example, at the weather patterns that are completely upside down. The farmers have to have certainty. After the harvest this year the grain prices are appalling, the beef prices are very uncertain, and the milk, thankfully, was better. We had three or four terribly lean years, and these farmers have huge bills all the time. They always pay their bills. When these farmers try to buy a bit of land with the intention of expanding by increasing the number of cows they have to stay viable, they have no chance. It is certainly the case in my county anyway, with the home-grown vulture fund which the Minister refuses to deal with. There is the equine industry fund and the money from Japan and China, but the local man has to borrow from the bank to match that. Many of them have been put to huge expense. The Minister will not tackle that issue either.  Deputy Fitzmaurice and I had an amendment which would have meant that vulture funds who buy land would have to pay a larger stamp duty. Anything more than 500 acres or 750 acres is not a farm any more but a large business. They are investing money but we do not know where the money comes from or how long it will stay. The young farmer and the family farmer must be supported. They are the backbone of this country and have got us out of many a recession. When they do something they spend and they pay. They borrow to do this.  It is a vital industry. As Deputy Cahill said, we only have agriculture and tourism. There is nothing else. We do not get factories or jobs; the Government will not give them to us. We are not even allowed to build houses now. Farming is so onerous now. It is so onerous to get planning. Not only do the planners want to know how long farmers have been farming, or if a farmer was born and reared there, but also if they were conceived on the farm. That is what planning wants now. The regulations are just mad. The Government cannot build houses. The young farmers will build their own with a borrowing, but they cannot get planning. The will is not there to allow rural Ireland the oxygen to survive. The Government is cutting off the oxygen and strangling it. The rural independent group, in our budget submission lobbied the Government to look at some sort of equalisation system whereby farmers could pay in the good years instead of the bad years. The farmers are not saying that they will not pay. They will pay when they are able to pay. They have to pay all of their suppliers, otherwise the suppliers would not work with them. The service people would not work with the farmers if they were not paying them, but they always pay, unless something unforeseen happens. There is also the TB racket and the other rackets to contend with. The most unfair part of it all is the inordinate delays in the GLAS payments due to what we are told was a computer glitch or incorrect information being fed into the computer. If anyone else is behind in paying the Revenue they face punitive penalties and interest and there is no choice but to pay them.  I hope that this will be pushed to a vote and that the Government will be forced to change it because it is for the good of all of Ireland. When rural Ireland is going well there is a spin-off because the farming community all come to the towns and cities and spend money, whether it be for a match, for education or for shopping for Christmas. They all contribute to the economy. 
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	521	We are supporting the amendment. Sinn Féin supports the concept of having a means of looking at farmer's taxation over a number of years. It was in our pre-budget submission. Many parts of the farming community are open to volatility in income. We regularly hear about the dairy sector's problems in this regard, but it exists in many other sectors as well. Deputy Mattie McGrath mentioned the delays in payments, which result in this. I often come across farmers who have a delay in getting their rural environment protection scheme or REP scheme or green low-carbon agri-environment scheme, GLAS, payments. When it is delayed it runs into the second year and they get two GLAS payments in the same year. For many farmers the payments they receive from supplements of that nature are actually a large portion of their income. The grain farmers were before the Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine this morning. Some 85% of the grain farmer's income actually comes from that cheque in the post. That gives an indication of how important the GLAS payments are to them. If that is delayed and runs into the second year they will be taxed on the two cheques together, and it is a huge hit to that farmer's income. The idea of equalising the tax payments over a number of years is very simple and honest and a decent way to do so. I implore the Minister to look at this and support the amendment because at the end of the day the farming community is the backbone of our society. Where I come from most farmers are on areas of natural constraint, ANC. They are very dependent on ensuring that they can get a decent income. Many of the farmers will not pay much tax because they do not have much money, but they need to be able to see that they will not be hit with a big tax bill when they have a good year. It is vital that they are given fair play. People who live in that part of the world need to have a chance of making a decent living and a chance to ensure that farming can provide for themselves and their communities into the future. At present that does not happen and that is something that needs to be looked at and resolved. Looking at agriculture into the future, we need to find a way of ensuring that the family farm can be sustainable. If it is to be sustainable these tax measures will have to be part of that. I implore the Minister to support the amendment.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	522	I live on a farm in rural Ireland. People come to this Chamber and say that rural Ireland is dead. That is not correct. There are challenges within rural Ireland, of course there are. However, some areas in rural Ireland are flying. Some areas are not, but to come in and state blankly that rural Ireland is dead is wrong. I am conscious of the prevalence of farm income volatility in the agriculture sector. I am a dairy farmer myself. I do not know if there are many dairy farmers in the Dáil any more. There are a number of other Members from a farming background. The dairy sector is the area with the highest price volatility. At the lowest point in 2016 the price of milk was 19 cent a litre. It currently 41 cent per litre for farmers who are providing winter milk on contract price. The volatility in the same product is reflected in this way in the difference between summer supply and winter supply. It is huge and I know more about it than most. In response to this volatility, a targeted relief is already available to farmers under the income averaging regime. It allows farmers to pay tax based on the average of the aggregate profits and losses of the farming trade over a five-year period. In acknowledgement of income volatility in the sector, my Department has introduced further flexibility to the income averaging regime in recent budgets. In the Finance Act 2014, the availability of income averaging was extended to allow farmers in receipt of income from an on-farm diversification trade or profession to opt into the averaging regime. The period of income averaging was also extended from three to five years, thereby providing a longer period over which income volatility can be smoothed out. In the Finance Act 2016, an optional step-out from the regime was introduced to allow for farmers to temporarily opt-out from the scheme in a year when they experience lower than expected incomes. The aim of this was to ease associated financial pressures and improve cash flow for farmers in a particularly difficult year, which 2016 was. As referred to during discussions on this matter on Committee Stage, I have committed to undertaking a review of agricultural tax incentives more generally, in co-operation with my colleague the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine, Deputy Creed. This will involve an examination of existing schemes, with a particular focus on income volatility and income stabilisation measures, as well as engagement with relevant stakeholders in advance of budget 2019. We are going to do what the amendment seeks. The aim of the review will be to update the findings from the 2014 agri-tax review to ensure that the schemes are operating in an efficient and effective manner and meeting their policy objectives in this area. Everybody I know in the agricultural sector believes that was a very successful review for the sector. Therefore, on the basis that there is already a targeted tax measure available to full-time farmers under the income averaging regime and given a commitment by the Minister for Finance to undertake an update of the agri-tax review with a particular focus on income stabilisation, I do not propose to accept this amendment.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	523	I acknowledge the Minister of State's bona fides on the issue and his in-depth understanding of it as a farmer. I also acknowledge the progress that has been made on income averaging and the optional step-out year, which has made a difference. The review he is pledging now should have taken place by now as 2016 was a particularly bad year. Volatility affects the farming community far more than any other. Many businesses come to us and tell us they have ups and downs, as they do, but the Minister quoted the price of a litre of milk at its low point at 19 cent, with its high point having been 41 cent. It is about managing cash flow. I understand the reluctance on the part of the system, including Revenue which understandably takes a pretty conventional view of taxation obligations, but the reality for farmers is serious. I include incorporated farmers and we made particular reference to corporation tax because a significant number of farms are now incorporated. I welcome the pledged review. Can the Minister give any more information as to when he expects it to be completed? Can he give a commitment that it will be published in advance of the next budget? He said it will have a particular focus on income stabilisation and measures to address income volatility. We will hold him to that commitment and the report should set out options as to how, in the next Finance Bill, this issue can be addressed.

The commitment to a review is welcome but it should have taken place last year and it is overdue. Unfortunately, this budget has now passed and the opportunity to bring about real action has been missed by the Government. There is an air of complacency over the suite of measures which is in place at the moment. I accept that the Minister of State understands the sector exceptionally well, but his tone suggests he believes the measures are sufficient. They are not sufficient and we need additional measures. It is crucial we explore the options and have a clear timeline for when the report will be completed, as well as a clear commitment to real engagement so that we expand the options available to farmers to deal with income volatility in time for the next budget. There is a danger, as Deputy Cahill said, that 2018 will be a more difficult year, income-wise, than 2017. Had there been some movement in the budget the options to farmers could have been widened but it is never too late to do the right thing. I urge the Minister to expedite these measures.

We were talking about a suite of measures to deal with volatility and to keep farmers going. The current suite of measures is not good enough for what we need and are facing. The Minister of State knows the dairy sector, but it is like the crest of a wave. With the forces coming, in the beef sector or dairy, we have to make sure we are adequately armed and what Deputy McGrath proposes is common sense. We need a proper suite of measures.
#PatrickDeering	unknown-#PatrickDeering-party	unknown-#PatrickDeering-dob	unknown-#PatrickDeering-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	526	I welcome the Minister's commitment to a review in this area. As one of the few surviving dairy farmers here, I understand the volatility issue. I can go back further than the Minister. In 1998, the price of a litre of milk was the equivalent of 28 cent. The problem is that costs have increased by 50% in the intervening 20 years. We must remember that a number of instruments have been introduced by the co-ops, such as forward selling and set contract prices, where a supplier sets a price for a certain period and which are very important. Last year, a €150 million low-interest loan was introduced, which was very welcome and well accepted by farmers. A similar scheme is due to be announced in a number of months, which will also be very helpful in dealing with volatility. Volatility does not just apply to the dairy sector but applies across the farming sector. Deputies McConalogue and Martin Kenny spoke about the tillage sector, which we were dealing with in committee today and where there are huge differential problems as farmers in the sector depend on the basic payment to make up their income. That issue also has to be taken on board.When the new loan scheme is introduced early next year, a certain amount must be ring-fenced for sector-specific funding, whether it be for tillage, horticulture or dairy. In general, I welcome the Minister's commitment to introduce a review based on the principles drawn up in 2014.

Maybe my Fianna Fáil colleagues are over-confident that the Government is going to do what it says on the tin. Why do we need a review or report? Why has it not been done already? Is the permanent government totally in charge that it would not let it do it? The sooner that changes the better. The Minister can be ag gáire if he likes, but that is the fact. The real Ministers are the lads behind him and beside him and out here on the corridor, there is hardly room for them, they barely fit. The Minister will have to get a new pen to put them in, maybe near the Visitors Gallery. The permanent government is running the show. Do we need another report? I am glad that Deputy Deering said that he is a dairy farmer himself. Everyone knows it and one does not need to be in farming to be aware that it is across the sector, whether it is dairy, grain, potatoes, pigs, any sector, and that is without mentioning Brexit and its repercussions. Now there is to be a report and a review to fill up some other building's shelves with reports, and more consultants to be hired in to do it. It is farcical. We do the business or we do not. We look after our farmers or we do not. Do not pay lip service to them and say live horse and get grass. Dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi go raibh fear i dTiobraid Árainn a bhfuil póca ina léine aige. I do not know if the Minister understands that. There was a saying 40 or 50 years ago, "A woman told me that a woman told her that there is a man in Tipperary with a pocket in his shirt". This is the type of tomfoolery that is going on. Get on and do it and let the farmers who want to work put their shoulders to the wheel and do it and have a buoyant economy. No more reports. The compliments are flowing across to the Minister of State on everything he knows about farming. Fair dues to him, I would not take that away from him, but if he insisted and anyone in the Fine Gael party would insist that it happen, they should bring the Dublin Jackeens down to see what is going on with the farmers. There was horticulture damage in Tipperary recently and also in east Cork and the Minister of State would not even visit. He told them they could find some other grant scheme. Live horse and get grass is the adage here, it seems to be the new buzzword. Put it off. There are missing emails, people did not read the emails and a merry-go-round takes place. Then there's Leo's spin team with its €5 million. No bother.

It is a hugely beneficial opportunity for the agriculture sector. It is not to be discounted and people should not ignore it. That came following the 2014 review. We are doing another review, and it will be a good one, so that we can have targeted measures for the areas that need the most. If that is income volatility, it will come out in the wash with the analysis led by the Department of Finance in conjunction with the Department of Agriculture and the stakeholders. That is the right thing to do. Whatever funding we have and whatever resources we put towards the farming sector, which I know better than most and I would say I know no less than anyone involved in the sector, we want to prioritise the areas that need them most in order to keep a vibrant agricultural sector and rural sector. We are doing what the Deputy is asking but we will undertake a bigger review. I hope and anticipate that we can make sure that the areas that might need it most are targeted. The only way to do that is based on analysis and focusing funding where it is required. That is what we will do.

(1) The Minister shall within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a report on the potential to raise additional Corporation Tax revenue by closing down loopholes, examining the extent, legitimacy and abuse of all corporate tax expenditures, exemptions, allowances and deductions, such as losses forward, R&D tax credits, the Knowledge Development Box, Intra-group Transactions, allowances on Intangible Assets and establishing a minimum effective tax rate of 12.5 per cent on gross trading profits and incomes.(2) The Minister shall, within 6 months of the passing of this Act, bring a specific report and comparative study on the relative social and economic benefit of Research and Development Tax Credit expenditures, benefitting private corporations as against the investment of the equivalent funds into Research and Development in public universities.".As we approach midnight it is appropriate that we would discuss the dark side of the Irish tax code, where the wealthiest corporations and the individuals who own them succeed in sucking vast profits using our tax system out of the view of the public and out of the hands of the tax man to enrich themselves to extraordinary levels. Sadly, most of this stays in the dark because the Government and the main opposition party, which acted similarly when it was in Government, have colluded to cover up the extent to which our tax code ensures that some of the most extraordinarily profitable corporations in the world have dodged tax and used Ireland as a base from which to do so. This amendment seeks to require the Government to produce a report which will go through all the tax loopholes, the black holes in the tax code, forensically. These suck out tens of billions in terms of profits made by these corporations out of taxable income through the mechanisms of allowances, deductions and reliefs. These are tax loopholes which I believe were designed deliberately in order to facilitate tax avoidance by these corporations. These are a select group. The European Union found Ireland guilty of state aid but I have no doubt that it was not only in respect of Apple. It was the company which was exposed but more cases will follow. A select group of corporations benefitted from this. They were corporations which had the ear of Ministers for Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach through bodies such as the IFSC Clearing House Group and so on, who more or less wrote Finance Bills in the area of corporate tax, in order to benefit themselves. These are loopholes which, for the most part, do not benefit small and medium enterprise in this country, which do genuinely pay the 12.5% corporate tax rate. These huge spectacularly profitable corporations get away with murder because of the tax loopholes. Seamus Coffey's report is an eye opener on this. I refer particularly to page 120 where he details the extraordinary growth in loopholes. He says figures published by the Revenue Commissioners allow us to get a better insight into the allowances and deductions used to off-set against gross trading profits to arrive at taxable income for the years since 2011. He says that these allowances and deductions have increased from €18.9 billion in 2003 to €97 billion in 2015. That is extraordinary. Most of the jump from €18.9 billion to €97 billion has happened in recent years.Of a whole array of tax breaks, the one most recently exposed is that relating to intangible assets. We have another amendment which deals specifically with that. This tax break benefits big IT corporations such as Apple and Facebook, which, faced with the prospect of the double Irish tax scam being closed down, moved to exploit another tax loophole in respect of tax allowances for the purchase and use of intangible assets. Coincidentally, at exactly the time they were forced, due to popular and political pressure, to move away from the double Irish tax structure, lo and behold another loophole opened up in the form of the intangible assets cap being moved from 80% to 100%. As a result, all of the purchases of intangible assets from one arm of a corporation to another become tax free. There is then an absolutely extraordinary jump from just more than €2.5 billion in allowances in this particular area in 2014 to, I think, €28 billion in one year. This benefits the likes of Apple, Facebook and Google, which move their intellectual property assets around to exploit loopholes that were conveniently opened up for them by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan. There are plenty of others as well. The research and development tax credit jumped considerably between 2014 and 2015. Intra-group transactions jumped from €2.9 billion to €9.1 billion in one year. Massive loopholes are opening up all of a sudden to the benefit of these corporations and this is against a background where profits are absolutely going through the roof. They reached the extraordinary level of €149 billion in gross trading profits in 2015, which is double what they were earning only five or six years previously. However, because of these €90 billion worth of allowances, the actual taxable income is reduced to pitifully low levels so that they can avoid billions in tax. These loopholes, and many more I have not had time to mention, need to be investigated. They need to be exposed and closed down. The public needs to know how much money we could have for health, housing and education if they were closed down.

#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	537	Some important work has been done recently and more will be done. The role of this country, stood over by this and previous Governments, as an important link in a chain of tax avoidance around the world by global corporations, which are robbing from public services in Ireland and, in particular, developing countries to the tune of $100 billion a year, will be exposed more and more. The Government will be badly exposed not only for not doing anything about this but also for having consciously facilitated it. Last week, Christian Aid made available a couple of good papers that highlight the reality of this in terms of tax avoidance. The papers in question make matters real by, for example, comparing the tax revenue lost by so-called developing countries with the overseas aid they get from this country. Christian Aid concluded that the cost of the tax Zambia lost was 40% of the overseas aid they gained from this country. Further, according to Christian Aid, South Africa potentially lost out on withholding tax revenue of over three times the value of the Irish aid it received in 2015 thanks to the Ireland-South Africa tax treaty. Another aspect of this matter has become very clear. The Minister has referred to the so-called "single malt" as a new loophole that has been discovered. Of course, it is not new. The single malt existed from the moment the corporations discovered that the double Irish was going to be phased out over a period. Big corporations such as Microsoft and LinkedIn immediately began to put in place processes to take advantage of the different tax treaties Ireland has with other countries - Malta is one, but it is not the only example - to continue to avoid paying all corporation tax. The Government knew about it. There is no way the Government did not know. There is no way that this is new. Eight days after the budget speech in which the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, under pressure as a result what was happening in terms of Apple's tax at that stage, spoke about closing the door on the double Irish, there were already discussions about the use of the single malt. A very good example of how this operates in order that big corporations can effectively avoid paying any tax is given in one of the Christian Aid papers to which I refer. That example relates to LinkedIn and the myriad different corporations that exist as part of the wider LinkedIn family and their different tax residencies. This is reminiscent of the Apple operation and all various aspects of Apple International that managed, through the double Irish, to avoid paying any tax and, presumably, that continue to do so. The paper states:LinkedIn Ireland is tax resident in Ireland, and thus subject to Ireland's 12.5% tax rate. However, its available accounts from 2010 and 2011 show that it made a substantial operating loss in these years, thus being liable for no Irish tax ... One of the reasons for the reduction of its profits is the fact that LinkedIn Ireland pays 25% of its turnover as a royalty fee to a second Irish-registered company, LinkedIn Technology Ltd, for the use of LinkedIn proprietary intellectual property. In turn, LinkedIn Corporation in Delaware USA [which is obviously a tax haven within the US], the ultimate holding company of the group, licenses the use of this IP to LinkedIn Technology Ltd. LinkedIn Technology Ltd is registered in Ireland but is tax resident in the Isle of Man, which levies no corporation tax on corporate profits ... LinkedIn's non-US revenue was already [$168 million] of which a quarter ... was placed as royalties in the Isle of Man. By 2016, its non-US revenue had ballooned nearly seven-fold to over [$1 billion].This resulted in total tax savings of perhaps $100 million between 2010 and 2015. Different corporations set up transfer pricing and profit-shifting between them to take advantage of Ireland's tax treaties and ended up paying no tax. The Irish Government knew about this. The double Irish is still in place for those corporations that were able to avail of it. They are able to continue to avail of it and, in effect, the Government is doing nothing about it. There is an interesting observation in the Christian Aid papers regarding the so-called BEPS process. The Government likes to go on about this. It covers itself by saying that people should forget about the EU and all of that because it will deal with the issue through the OECD BEPS process. The Government tells us that it thinks the BEPS process is the best. Interestingly, however, Christian Aid highlights that Article 12 of the new OECD multilateral instruments arising precisely from that OECD BEPS process seeks to alter parties' tax treaties to widen the "permanent establishment" definition to prevent sales being arranged in one country but income being booked in another country. Ireland signed that instrument on 7 June 2017. The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, announced that the new instrument means:If you make the widgets in Dublin, the tax liability on the profits from the widgets is an Irish tax liability ... It will be illegal to transfer tax liability to other jurisdictions to avoid taxes.In reality, however, the Government, when it signed the multilateral instrument, opted out of Article 12. It opted out of a key part of the instrument in order to avoid actually cracking down on some of this tax avoidance. This proves a point. The BEPS process and going on about the OECD is simply a cover for the Government to continue to operate in a way that Ireland is the sixth worst tax haven in the world. The answers to deal with these are clear. All double-taxation agreements need to have anti-tax avoidance measures as part of them. The transfer pricing regime, which incredibly is currently only one way, only applies if Ireland-----

One is not being unpatriotic when pointing out, time and again, that the State is facilitating tax avoidance. Perhaps the Minister has reasons to do that; I am sure he does. My point is not just about what the two Deputies have talked about in respect of their amendment, about which there is nothing to fear. The thinking I am referring to is littered throughout the Finance Bill. The Minister will offer various justifications for this. I am sure the Government side will vote down the amendment on the banks and the banks will continue to fail to pay tax. We will consider issues concerning non-bank lending and section 110 provisions. Again, there will be a shutdown in this regard. We referred to the REITs paying tax at an effective rate of only 3%. There are funds that pay no capital gains tax. There was the tax advantage that was introduced and that the Minister has just closed down, but it is to be allowed to continue for another year. All of these mechanisms provide considerable opportunities for those in charge of international capital to exploit the tax system. The Minister is handing them opportunities on a plate. This results in commentary such as that of the Comptroller and Auditor General, who talked last month about 13 of the top 100 companies in the State paying tax at an effective rate of less than 1%. This was not said by a member of Sinn Féin or Solidarity-People Before Profit; it was said by the Comptroller and Auditor General. In earlier contributions, we heard a lot about millions and billions of euros. I do not know how many of these points have been absorbed at 11.30 p.m. We know from the Paradise Papers, however, that this island is in the middle of an international tax avoidance storm or scam. We had the Panama Papers before them. There was a response to those but it was nowhere near enough in regard to dealing with this issue. I am open to correction but I have serious suspicions that when the tax residency issue concerning stateless companies was dealt with by the Government as a result of serious international pressure and pressure from my party it - and the Administration that preceded it, whose Minister for Finance was Deputy Noonan - deliberately, on foot of lobbying by multinational companies and tax advisers, including the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, increased the rate. The Government knew there would be onshoring of IP because that is what was stated in black and white in the submissions made to it. Those concerned sought certainty in respect of how intangible assets would be dealt with. The Government increased the rate to 100%. I simply refuse to believe that this was not some type of cosy deal with Apple in mind. The Commission will consider this case, as it has the other. I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about this case but he did not answer. It is my understanding that the Apple case will be heard in 2018. I would like the Minister to confirm whether it will be heard by the European courts in 2018. Have they notified the Department about this? It is also my view that Apple will not be the only company involved. Google will be involved. We will wait to see how the Amazon appeal bears out in terms of Luxembourg but I have no doubt that Google is in the cross-hairs. Pepsi and Pfizer will also come into scope. We can shake our heads at the Commission and say it is infringing on sovereignty but that is nonsense because we know that state aid approval is associated with tax measures. In this regard, the Minister mentioned earlier the taxation for the gyms and crèches in terms of state aid approval. Tax is a state aid issue in certain regards. We are allowing this to happen. A vote was nearly lost in the German Parliament because almost 300 MPs there believe we are operating some type of tax avoidance scam or tax haven. Therefore, it is time to clean up our act and have these issues dealt with. The single malt is not something that just appeared out of thin air. We have been raising this for a considerable period. Mr. Matt Carthy, one of my party's MEPs, has been raising this in the European Parliament. He put it directly to the Minister for Finance when there was a claim that the double Irish was closed down. The double Irish was closed down but there is a tail period. Even in that scenario, one can still operate the same type of system because of jurisdictions with no double tax treaties. Malta is one but it is not the only one. There are many of those types of cases so we need to tackle tax evasion aggressively. Yesterday, we heard - I am not sure if it was from the Minister - that more attention would be paid to the issue of the single malt and that the only problem is that it is out of our control. It is the exact same script that we heard about the double Irish. It is the exact same script we heard in respect of stateless companies. Of course, they play off the tax systems in two jurisdictions but any jurisdiction can change its tax system and close a loophole. We need to be careful that we are not deliberately or unintentionally opening another loophole. As I stated, there is nothing unpatriotic or anti-jobs about closing down tax loopholes or producing a report on this. I do not support the views of the two Deputies on raising corporation tax because I believe they are missing the point. However, this amendment gets to the point. It is not about the 12.5% rate. If some of the companies in question were paying at a rate of 12.5%, we would be building schools, hospitals and houses for our citizens. The country would be awash with money. The companies are not paying at a rate of 12.5%; they are not even paying near that. As the Comptroller and Auditor General said, some are paying less than 1%. Thirteen of the top 100 companies are in this category. This is a sensible amendment. It gets to the real nugget of what is done. We need a Government to stand up and say we are taking it no more. The international view will change also. As was said before, some companies are considering green energy that is environmentally friendly. The mood is changing and we need to be a leader so we will no longer pimp out our country to the next multinational that wants to exploit it for tax reasons.

I am proud of the efforts of successive Governments to attract investment into our country. If the best that the Deputy can offer in a serious debate is to describe this as "pimping out our country" and if the only reference he can make to jobs is the phrase "anti-jobs", he is doing a grave disservice to the role of international investment in creating jobs in our country and sustaining communities. The only reference I heard in the contributions by the Deputies on the role of these companies in creating jobs was when Deputy Pearse Doherty used the phrase "anti-jobs". Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Paul Murphy did not make a single reference to employment or the fact that the corporations to which they refer are employers in our country. Those same companies play and have played a valuable role in creating the tax revenue that has allowed for the funding and improvement of public services. They have played a valuable role in creating jobs in our country. If the best Deputy Doherty can offer is to describe this as "pimping out our country", he does not recognise the value of many of the good jobs that have been created by the companies in question. Reference was made to a number of contributions. I do not believe it is unpatriotic to have a debate; I have never suggested that. It is important that we have an open debate on any element of public policy.I would never question the motive of any Deputy in doing that, but I will challenge his or her language, as is done to me, and I will challenge the intent, as is done to me every time I make a point on why I support Government policy. Let us look at the report of the Revenue Commissioners and what Deputies have said in response to it. The report did make the point that 13 of the top 100 companies pay an effective rate of tax of just 1%. There are explanations for that and on the engagement between the earnings of those companies, how they pay tax abroad and the role of exemptions that are available in the tax code for economic activity. However, what none of the Deputies mentioned when referring to the report is that 79 companies paid an effective rate of tax of 10% or more and almost two thirds paid rates in excess of 12%. Reports published by the Revenue Commissioners have pointed to the fact that our effective tax rate moved to between 9.7% and 9.8% and for 2012 and 2013 the effective tax rate was 10.1%. They are the other things in that report that were not mentioned by any Deputy quoting from the report. The other thing that was not mentioned by any Deputy who made reference to corporation tax and what is happening with the trends is the fact that corporate tax receipts have grown and that was listed in various reports, including the Coffey report, which was commissioned and published by my Department. The Coffey report makes very clear that since 2000, corporation tax receipts have moved from €3.9 billion to €7.35 billion. In all of the commentary on corporation tax so far in the debate no account has been taken of the role played by the companies that pay those taxes in creating very important jobs within the economy or the fact that corporation tax receipts in recent years have increased, so we are raising more taxes from companies that are subject to corporation tax. Neither did the commentary take account in any way of the fact that the companies that have been referred to here by name by some but not all Deputies employ people in this country and the general sector overall is a critical employer within the country. A specific question was asked about Article 12. From the way that was referenced by Deputies one would think Ireland was the only country that is not in it. I will explain why we are not part of that provision at the moment. Not only are we not part of it but countries such as Denmark and Germany are not part of it either. One of the reasons for that is because work is still under way at OECD level to determine what profits, if any, would be attributable to a new permanent establishment created under this test. As we have to play a role then in providing clarity to companies so their tax liabilities can be generated here in Ireland, once we are clear how this will be calculated I believe that we will be happy to include this test in our tax treaties but that is the reason that article has not been triggered. As to the allegations that have been made that this or any Government was involved in deals with any particular company, I repeat again that this and any other Government that has preceded it did not make agreements on tax policy for any individual company. We tax for the economy in its entirety or sectors of the economy. That law is then applied impartially by the Revenue Commissioners. While some Deputies have either doubted the intention behind it or the impact of moves that have been made to dealing with stateless companies and winding up the double Irish agreement, all of those decisions were taken because we want to be in a place where we have a tax code that is a source of competitive advantage and we do so in a way that meets the growing international consensus regarding how these matters will be dealt with, and I will do that. However, of course if any job is lost or if any employer were to change the investment it has in this country because of any change that was made, some of the Deputies who are in here tonight criticising what is happening would also be the ones criticising job losses.

That is the problem. That is the kind of thing that says, in effect, that we should keep quiet and not raise issues. The vast majority of companies in this State, including multinational companies, pay their fair share of tax in terms of the 12.5% rate, but the issues on which I focused relate to companies that do not pay, who pay as little as 1% or 0%, or as little as €250, as we discussed in the finance committee in terms of section 110 companies. That is the problem and that is why I say to the Minister that when he deliberately puts that into the tax code what he is doing is pimping out this country to those companies and allowing them to use and abuse our tax code and pay little or no tax. The Minister might stand for that but I will not. I believe that is completely and utterly wrong. I do have my suspicions on intangible assets and what the Government has done. In terms of the great work the previous Government did on stateless companies and the double Irish, the Minister should pull the other one. We had to drag the Government kicking and screaming into the light regarding that. The point I am making, and this is an issue relating to jobs, is that companies are starting to wake up internationally to this and they do not like to invest in a country that has a cloud hanging over it or where there is a smell about some type of tax avoidance scam going on and the Government is facilitating it. We have got ourselves in hot water. By "we" I mean the Government, because of Apple and state aid issues. I believe it is not over at that and that we got ourselves in more hot water because we did not collect the money for the escrow account. What is patriotic and what will defend jobs in the future and put us on a solid footing is for us to deal with a minority of issues but ones that have a big effect. Let us clean up our back yard and stop pretending that everything is okay just like the Minister's predecessor did when I put it up to him about stateless companies, section 110 companies and the double Irish. On all three occasions the Minister had to come into the light but it was done after being kicked and dragged there.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	543	I am not sure whether the Minister has heard of the term "the finance curse", which comes after "the resource curse", which describes the apparent paradox of countries with valuable natural resources. Rather than thriving they crumbled and often had something significantly less than democracy, which became known as "the paradox of plenty". The finance curse was coined by Nicholas Shaxson who wrote Treasure Islands, a book about tax havens where Ireland features quite prominently. It is described in an article in The Atlantic:When the "finance curse" strikes a country, there is a recurrent pattern: While its democracy, economy, and culture remain formally intact, they are increasingly oriented to and co-opted by international elites. In other words, such countries gradually become organized around the interests of people who don't even live there, to the detriment of those who do. The services produced by these countries protect cosmopolitans’ wealth, but the riches never flow to the local producers, undermining their capacity for self-governance and social cohesion, as well as the development of infrastructure and institutions.That is a pretty good description of what is happening in this country and it is a pretty good description of the kind of policy capture that has gone on in terms of enshrining the interests of those corporations. When one looks at companies such as Apple, the companies themselves that are avoiding the tax did not employ anybody in terms of what we thought was going on. There is a separation between the actual value-producing activity and the tax avoidance that is going on with the elevation of those corporations on an absolute pedestal.Yet, we elevate these corporations on a pedestal. The scale of the money we are talking about is immense, and includes the €13 billion from Apple. If we doubled corporation tax revenue in this country, we would raise in excess of €6 billion. That would transform people's lives. It is a choice of the Irish Government to hold to our current industrial policy. It has chosen to continue being a corporate tax haven. That is a choice that goes absolutely nowhere because the clock is ticking on it.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	544	Let us be absolutely clear: we want jobs, if there are decent well-paid jobs, from wherever they might come. However, those companies making astronomical profits should pay a fair share in taxes. The Minister has yet again quoted figures to do with effective rates and so on. I will put some figures to the Minister. In 2015 the figure for gross trading profits plus other income equalled €161 billion. The tax paid in that period was €6.2 billion. That is an effective rate of less than 4%. In fact, it is approximately 3.9%. That is not 12.5; it is 3.9%. If the Government charged 12.5% on that, it would get €20 billion. That is what is at stake. We were more modest than that in our pre-budget submission. We simply said that we should close the loopholes to the extent that we would double corporate tax revenue for the Exchequer. That would only bring the minimum effective rate up to 8%. That is modest. The Government could do that even if it had no wish to go as far as we might want to go in terms of taxing these corporations. Why would the Government not do that when everyone knows that these companies are avoiding tax? Why would the Government not close the loopholes to ensure that these companies pay more? All the evidence points to the fact that we facilitate these companies with loopholes.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	545	It is appropriate that we debate, scrutinise, critique and question our corporation tax code in all its respects. However, we also need some balance in the debate. It should be acknowledged that Ireland has been to the fore in terms of the OECD BEPS process and the reforms at an international level that are being introduced. Undoubtedly, there is a journey to travel; there is no question about that. However it should be acknowledged that several of the items referenced in amendment No. 34, which proposes to introduce these items in a report, are described as tax loopholes. In fact, they are legitimate tax deductions. They are based on our corporation tax code, which is in statute. We have a broad base in respect of the calculation of taxable profits. We have limited deductions in Ireland. We heard that evidence when we examined the common consolidated corporate tax base proposals. Other countries have higher headline rates but lower effective rates because they have a far more expensive way of reducing their taxable profits. We should acknowledge that we have no God-given right to inward investment in this country. We have no God-given right to be boxing far above our weight in terms of jobs, investment and so on. Let us make no mistake about it: what is at play here as well is a desire by other countries to win over the investment, jobs and tax receipts that Ireland is getting. The flagship reform in corporation tax that is proposed by the European Commission is the CCCTB. The Commission is proposing that the distribution of where taxable profits are taxed and where corporation tax is based would be on the basis of where the assets are, where the jobs are and where the sales are. How would Ireland fare in that context? It would not fare well at all and we would not be long in seeing our corporation tax receipts, which amount to approximately 15% of all tax income in the State, getting a fair whack rather quickly. We need to have certainty. I do not support amendment No. 34. I believe it would introduce great uncertainty. I believe it conflates several issues by describing legitimate tax deductions, in some cases, as tax loopholes. If we were to announce a great review of our corporation tax code, including all of these individual items, it would introduce uncertainty. I liaise with representatives of multinationals on a regular basis. Their contribution to the Irish economy is considerable, with 200,000 direct jobs provided by foreign-owned companies in this country. Many more jobs arise from indirect employment as well in support services, suppliers and so on. There is no problem in critiquing or going through our corporation tax code and playing our part in the reforms - I fully support that. However, we should not seek to open up an entire rewriting of the corporation tax code. It has been an important element in Ireland doing so well with inward investment.

We are on the playing field with countries like France. We hear people from such places shouting one thing out of their mouths on a given day to the effect that they want harmonisation, but they are the same people who actually give lower tax rates to certain entities. Ireland has to fight for business because we are on the periphery of Europe. Whatever is good for the goose is good for the gander, whether an Irish company or a multinational. We should ensure that we treat both types the same because we have to look after Irish companies as well. Multinational companies are important to this country; there is no doubt about that. We must ensure that we bring jobs in. We need to ensure that the striving by Europe to get rid of our 12.5% rate is not touched. Ultimately, that is the most important point of all. We need to ensure we protect that. Whatever the big guns say abroad in Europe, we should not take it on board or listen to them. There should be a fair rate for everyone in the country in the line of corporation tax - I agree with that. Every business should be treated the same, whether a small business in the west, south or north. Such businesses should have the same tax incentives as anyone else. Ireland has to go out and fight for business. We are against some of the countries in the middle of Europe. We are punching above our weight, in fairness. We need to keep punching above our weight.

I never said that any Opposition Deputy was anti-jobs. I simply said that Deputy Boyd Barrett and Deputy Murphy never mentioned them. I simply made the point that Deputy Doherty gave jobs a passing reference. That is what I said. I do not base my arguments on appeals to patriotism. I believe we should be able to openly critique and debate policy. However, we should also acknowledge the fact that, as Deputy Fitzmaurice and Deputy McGrath highlighted, there are jobs in our country that many other countries throughout the world want in their countries. We need to ensure that we are competitive while making the right to changes in our tax code. The idea, as Deputy Murphy appeared to suggest, that if we doubled our tax rate, we would-----

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-11-22 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	552	When we discuss the amendment on intangible assets tomorrow, we will discuss the specifics of one particular loophole. I suggest the Minister read Mr. Seamus Coffey's papers on this issue. He points out, for example, that following their introduction, the other changes in the area of intangible assets provided for in successive budgets from 2009 onwards applied to all claims made under the relevant allowance. This is the first time this has not happened, as the Minister stated the change will only apply in future. Mr. Coffey stated explicitly in his paper that the Minister did not have to make that choice and if he had not made done so and instead applied the 80% rate to all claims made under this measure, it would have generated an additional €1 billion in tax revenue in 2018. That point was not made by us but by Mr. Seamus Coffey in a paper and I will quote the relevant passage tomorrow.
