I will call on the Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public and national concern, namely, the 80% cost increase to €183 million in the past two years of renting accommodation and office space for State Departments and agencies; the concentration of over 90% of the State rent spent in the Dublin area, with an uneven distribution of State rents countrywide; the considerable portion of State rents wastefully expended on unallocated properties; to call on the Government to examine the value for money aspect of purchasing property for State use, as opposed to leasing it; and to call for the establishment of an independent State agency to oversee the management of State accommodation requirements, with a view to securing optimum value for taxpayers' money.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a specific and urgent matter of public interest, namely, the revelation that the company brought in to mediate between Cork Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority over the debt liability that Cork Airport is expected to carry into the future, is the same company that acted as adviser to the Dublin Airport Authority and prepared the business plan for Cork Airport; the conflict of interest that such an appointment may create; and the urgency to address reports that the new Cork Airport Authority may have to carry a debt of €100 million, which will put the future of Cork Airport at risk and has already led to the threat of two airlines withdrawing from the airport.

In view of the importance of this issue, I hope you will agree to my request, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to obtain an explanation from the Government on a matter of urgent public concern, namely, how a Monsanto GM food-promoting, multinational company was accredited as an Irish participant at the World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong last December, given that the vast majority of people in Ireland and the EU generally are opposed to GM food and that Monsanto is using the Irish Government as a trojan horse to gain a foothold for GM food in Ireland; and if the Government will cease flirting with GM companies that threaten Irish food marketing and environmental integrity at home and abroad.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to raise the following matter of urgent national importance, namely, the report of the Equality Authority and the National Youth Council of Ireland entitled Inequality and Stereotyping of Young People; and the urgent need to redefine the age ground under the Equal Status Acts to extend the provisions of the Acts on the age ground to people under 18 years.

It is reasonable to speculate on how many people must die in an imminent civil war before you would regard it as urgent. I find these rulings quite absurd.

We should not wait for a religious-based civil war to emerge. Nor should we wait, because the European Union is inactive, to deal substantially with the impasse that has arisen in Palestine, including the occupied areas of Gaza, east Jerusalem and the West Bank. Quite frankly, I find these rulings to be absurd.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Neither the Taoiseach nor the Tánaiste is in the House, which is not very conducive to doing business in the way we would like. I understand that in respect of No. 10a, referral to select committee of the proposed approval by the Dáil of the Finance Act (Section 91) (Deferred Surrender to the Central Fund) Order 2006, there was agreement at the Whips’ meeting last night that the Government would refer back to the Opposition Whips. The Government did not revert back, however, yet this appears on the Order Paper. May I have an explanation from the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism why this happened?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Some time ago, the Minister for Finance had to apologise in the Dáil for the Estimates being wrong because €56 million had gone missing, AWOL or whatever, from the Department of Health and Children. There is a lot of confusion. Was the money spent? Was it in the capital Estimate or did it go on current spending?When the Revised Estimates were published, we were promised a detailed explanation of what happened. Today we are presented with the schedule for Revised Estimates and for the capital carryover of €289 million. This figure relates to areas such as transport, money which the Government was not able to spend and which it is carrying over to 2006. However, €56 million is unaccounted for with regard to the health Vote. When the Minister for Finance made his unprecedented and very embarrassing apology to this House some time ago, we were promised an explanation, but we are now being fobbed off. All is to be rushed through with no debate or explanation, and there is no Tánaiste.Last night the Labour Party Whip was promised the Government would allow time for debate. A sum of €56 million is not much to the Government but it is a lot to the people on trolleys. We want an explanation of where is the taxpayers' money. We object to Nos. 10 and 10a proceeding without debate by the Government.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	With regard to Nos. 10 and 10a, it is a constitutional function of this House to be responsible for the sanctioning of expenditure. For the Government to propose that this function should be delegated to a committee for decision, without further debate in this House, is a negation of the responsibility of the Government and undermines the work of this House. It is not simply the usual set of Revised Estimates we are looking at, but expenditure in the range of €290 million, in the month of February. On those grounds the Government must set aside time for a proper perusal, examination and critique of these figures. Otherwise the relevance of this House will be further lessened.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	No. 10 is a motion re the presentation and circulation of Revised Estimates 2006. Perhaps the Revised Estimates have been circulated to Deputy Burton but I have not seen them. I am not aware they have been circulated. Have other Deputies received the circulated Revised Estimates 2006? I doubt they are here at all. If other Deputies can show they have them, well and good, something has gone amiss in terms of the pigeonhole delivery, but I do not know that they are here. Has this information been circulated or are we being asked to sanction something on the blind without any sight of what is involved? I would like clarification of that. Has this information been circulated or are we simply being asked to rubber-stamp Revised Estimates when we have no sight of what is being proposed? If other Deputies have the information I will accept it has been circulated and it has not reached my office. However, I doubt if it has been circulated.With regard to No. 10a, referral to select committee of the proposed approval by the Dáil of the Finance Act (Section 91) (Deferred Surrender to the Central Fund) Order 2006, multi-annual programming and budgeting with regard to capital projects is welcome, but let us see what is included in the schedule. I note that under the provision of local authority and social housing programme, €73 million is provided at a time when the need for social housing across the State is imperative, and projects are failing to move forward with the required speed and alacrity. Questions must be asked, and referral to the select committee as a mechanism of avoiding full scrutiny in the Chamber is not acceptable.While I understand that all this relates to capital allocations, with a title on each item — it may well be that this is a technical requirement — all items are explained as being for salaries and expenses. Every one of the Department's allocations begins with the salaries and expenses, and that is not capital spending in anyone's understanding.These issues must be addressed and answers must be given this morning. These are the reasons we should not refer this to committee without debate. Real and substantive issues are involved. As Deputy Burton said, under No. 10a we are looking at a sum just short of €300 million and we cannot allow these proposals to proceed without debate in this Chamber. I ask the Minister for clarification on the points I have raised and an acceptance that a full debate and scrutiny should take place in this Chamber.

There was an agreement at the Whips' meeting last night that with regard to Nos. 10 and 10a, the Office of the Government Chief Whip would refer back to us on foot of our request for a debate in the House, but we had no further contact. That is a fact.

No. 10 is a standard motion put before the Dáil each year. Before Revised Estimates can be presented and circulated to Members, the agreement of the Dáil must first be obtained by way of a motion. There is no great mystery about it.

Clearly the carryover sum of unspent capital from the previous year could not be spent on the particular capital purposes until the order is approved by Dáil Éireann and signed by the Minister.In regard to what Deputy Burton said, the Minister for Finance, in his statement to the Dáil last January, referred to information which had been received from the Department of Health and Children, which had been advised by the Health Service Executive that there could be some alterations to its estimated 2005 outturn.

The country was taken aback by the extraordinary announcement by the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, that she made an agreement with the Taoiseach on 6 November to resign her seat this December. The internal perks associated with ministerial office seem to be of more importance to Fianna Fáil backbenchers than any other issue in the country, such as the 400 patients on trolleys, job losses or accident and emergency units. I see Deputy Martin Brady, the third socialist, has risen in the ratings as a dark horse and is in line for promotion.

I note that in the case of the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, when the going got tough the Cope got going. It seems Ministers of State can change jobs at will.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Sea-Fisheries and Maritime Jurisdiction Bill has provoked contentious debate over the past three or four weeks. Deputies Perry and Broughan made strong arguments for fines being levied on an administrative basis. At yesterday's Fianna Fáil Party meeting, 15 rebel Deputies met the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources who proposed legislation within months to deal with administrative fines. A letter was circulated by the Taoiseach explaining technical details of how one decides what an administrative fine might be or otherwise.This legislation does not appear on the A, B or C list of the Government legislation programme. Is it a Government decision that legislation will be published to deal with the administrative fines issue, as proposed by Deputy Perry, Deputy Broughan and others? When will we see this Bill or is this a face-saving exercise for behind the closed doors of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party rooms? The third socialist, Deputy Brady, who is in line for this job, is interested in this question.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Is the Government resolved to proceeding with the sale of the Great Southern Hotels? Will the Minister inform the House whether it is intended to sell them as a going concern? I have a sheaf of statements by him to Kerry’s Eye, The Kerryman and The Sunday Business Post. The Minister told The Sunday Business Post that as far as he was concerned the hotels should stay in State ownership for the reasons he described to that publication. Will the Minister meet representatives of the staff? Will he say whether the hotels will be sold as a going concern or as a different kind of arrangement?The second matter I wish to raise relates to correspondence I had with the Minister on 1 July, when I enclosed relevant court documents relating to a person appointed to the board of Bord na gCon. On 15 June, the Minister stated to Deputy Hogan: "I am not aware of any appointees to State boards under the auspices of my Department currently disqualified from holding a directorship of a private company."

A person was disqualified for five years from holding any directorship in a private company and six different interests in Bord na gCon had made representations to the Minister not to appoint him.

Any signals there are bad. The Minister has an opportunity to make the quantum leap and indicate how he can deal with it in the context of the electronic communications miscellaneous provisions Bill.Since the Minister has the dambusters beside him, it is an appropriate time to ask about the hydro potential of the Dublin Port tunnel. In this context, the energy miscellaneous provisions Bill comes into focus as to how soon he will be able to encourage the relevant Minister. I see the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, is smiling. As it was he who invented the port tunnel, I would not smile too much about it. Anybody going through it will have to carry an umbrella. Perhaps the Minister might indicate on both the Black Valley and the energy miscellaneous provisions Bill.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	83	Will the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, a former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, inform the House when he expects to receive the Dalton report from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will he make time available for it to be debated in the House? In that context, will he address the clear bias that exists whereby dogs, horses and fat cats are healthier under this Government than ordinary men, women and children, given that €1 out of every €3 spent on sport is spent on horses and greyhounds? In that context also, will the Minister return to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and take responsibility for the coroners Bill, given that so many deaths are due to obesity and low exercise levels? Perhaps it needs to be addressed as a precaution rather than a cure.

In light of the serious revelations in Cavan regarding the death of Jamie Maughan and that a Brazilian national absconded with the help of the Brazilian Embassy before the inquest in the case had been held, it is vital that the coroners Bill be dealt with as quickly as possible and whatever changes necessary be made to it.In light of the serious situation concerning many pure bred herds being cleared out by TB and the fact that the evaluation is unacceptable, when will the animal health Bill be brought before the House to allow us to discuss it?Given yesterday's announcement that work will commence on the Northern end of the Ulster Canal, is there a possibility that the law will be changed in this jurisdiction?

Will they be shared with health spokespersons promptly, in line with the Taoiseach's preference that the heads of a Bill would be shared well in advance? Publication of the legal costs Bill, No. 69 on the list of promised legislation, is expected in 2007 but given the exorbitant fees charged by senior barristers in particular, and which cost the State an excessive sum, will the Minister intervene with his colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have this legislation brought forward and addressed this year?

Perhaps he has gone to try to block the hole in the Dublin Port tunnel. Will the Government lead by example by having State cars obey the law and drive within the speed limit? I ask the Minister to review the provision that allows State cars to break the law. I also ask that the Government stop the practice of providing Garda outriders to escort foreign dignitaries and put those gardaí on the roads to do the job for which we pay them and which we want them to do, namely to manage traffic.

It is time-constrained. Women who are pregnant or who have already had their babies could be excluded from availing of it if it does not come before the committee soon. For that reason the Opposition did not delay the Bill.

In the Dublin area it is one in five. Professor Michael Kerin, a former director of BreastCheck, works in Galway and is horrified the people will have to wait until 2009 for the BreastCheck service. That is ridiculous considering all the money that is available. This morning I said 200 people in the west and south would die in the meantime because of the lack of BreastCheck but I revise that to 300. Surely the Government has some money to give to provide the BreastCheck service for those people.

In the letter, he failed to indicate that he intervened with the European Commissioner to get a vessel owner benefit-in-kind of €100 million. It put huge pressure on the pelagic sector with regard to administrative sanctions.

#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	168	I welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, for the great work he is doing for older people and the less well off. Measures will include the introduction of standard and enhanced non-contributory pension schemes that will lift some 34,000 recipients into higher and full pensions, increased support and entitlements for lone parents, carers and widows, changes to scheme names as part of a modernisation programme so that they more accurately reflect modern society and the underlying purpose of the entitlements, increased emphasis on employment activation measures to ensure that no individual's potential is overlooked, establishment of the legal structure for the payment of the early child care supplement — beginning later this year — to some 260,000 families in respect of 350,000 children under the age of six and implementation of a range of budget 2006 increases and improvements.On pensions, new measures to strengthen protection for members' schemes include: provisions for the Pensions Board to impose a fine as an alternative to the prosecution of an offence; and allowing the Pensions Ombudsman to bypass the internal dispute resolution procedures in cases where there is clearly nothing to be gained from the process.The improvements, increases and reforms in the Bill represent a further step in a wide-ranging programme of reforms of social policy. Ireland is now making steady progress in tackling the core issues that lead to poverty and leave people vulnerable and marginalised. Investment in welfare supports and entitlements now account for one euro in every three the State will spend this year. Payments alone will not solve our social problems, however. That is why the Minister must go behind the payments and tackle the causes. We must shape reforms that over the coming months and years will introduce further enlightened social policies in a number of key issues. There is no better Minister than Deputy Brennan to do this.He is ensuring that all older people and in particular the most vulnerable have a decent pension and that this is a priority of Government and future Administrations. It is also important that those reaching pension age who wish to continue working should be encouraged to do so. While pensions to older people have increased by more than 80% in less than a decade, significantly ahead of increases in the consumer price index and gross earnings over the same period, further improvements will now be introduced.The Bill makes provision for a number of important new measures designed to target resources — in addition to significant weekly increases announced in the budget — at particular groups of older people who are aged 66 or over. These measures include combining all non-contributory payments for people over 66 into one standard and enhanced non-contributory pension scheme with a greatly improved means test that will lift some 34,000 pensioners on to higher or full pensions. The means disregard for this standard pension is being increased from €7.60 to €20 per week. To allow pensioners earn more income without having the value of their pensions eroded, a special earnings disregard of €100 per week will be introduced. The weekly disregard of €20 per week ensures that a single person with no other means will be able to have €35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This rises to €70,000 in the case of a couple.The Bill also provides for the extension of the enhanced earnings arrangement in the new non-contributory State pension scheme to particular persons aged under 66 who are in receipt of the widow's or widower's pension, deserted wife's allowance and prisoner's wife's allowance. This will introduce a special earnings disregard of €100 a week. It is estimated that the improvements will benefit more than 3,000 recipients.The disregard of €100 per week is very welcome, especially for widows and deserted wives. I have always felt that such people who could work part-time perhaps, were unable to do so lest their pensions were reduced. They found themselves in a poverty trap where people on a contributory pension or other allowance could work or earn what they wished. This is a very welcome departure by the Minister and will help many pensions. Also the general disregard of €20 ensures that pensioners without any other incomes can earn up to €35,000 for a single person and €70,000 for a couple. This is also very welcome. It is not long since pensioners found they had to hide a few thousand euro in the mattress, leaving themselves in danger of being attacked or their homes broken into. However, matters have changed for the better over a relatively short period under a good Fianna Fáil-led Government.I welcome the change of name from "old age" to "State" pensions. This is the right decision as 66 is no longer old due to better life-expectancy into the 80s and over.The Minister also acknowledged that recognition of and support for carers must be at the core of a caring society. In recognition of the valued and valuable work of carers, the Bill makes provision for increases in the rates of annual respite grant by €200 to €1,200 from June this year. In 2005 more than 36,000 such grants were awarded and it is expected that the number of beneficiaries will further increase in 2006. The duration of the carer's benefit scheme has also been extended from 15 months to two years for each recipient. In addition, regulations will provide for an increase in the number of hours a person can work and still be eligible for carer's allowance, carer's benefit or carer's respite from ten to 15 hours per week. The Bill will also make the necessary amendments to the Carer's Leave Act 2001 to provide for the extension of the duration of carer's leave from 15 months to two years.I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and previous Fianna Fáil Ministers for their actions on carers. A few years ago if a carer came to me looking for advice on carer's allowance, I had to tell the carer gently that if she or her husband had income of any worth there was no point in applying for the allowance. All that has now changed as the disregard of €580 per couple means that many carers can now qualify. In other words, if a daughter-in-law is minding an elderly relation and her husband's earnings are under €580 per week, she will qualify for the full carer's allowance of €180 per week and still receive additional benefits for her children. I encourage the Minister to go even further in future budgets to recognise the great work carers do.The Bill also provides the necessary legislative provisions for the payment of early child care supplement, which will be administered by the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It also contains the necessary amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to exempt the payment from assessment as taxable income. Some 260,000 families on child benefit will receive the early child care supplement in respect of approximately 350,000 children under the age of six. This is equal to about 50% of all families on child benefit and some 33% of all children for whom payment of child benefit is made. The rate of payment will be €1,000 per annum, paid over four quarters with three payments being made in 2006. In general, payments will be issued early in the month following the end of each quarter. It is intended that the first payment will be issued in August 2006 for the quarter April to June, with further payments in October for the quarter July to September and in December for the quarter October to December. Payments will issue for full quarters only, which means a full payment will be made in respect of an eligible child born during a quarter or a child reaching six years of age during that quarter. The estimated expenditure on early child care supplement payments in 2006 is €265 million and the estimated full-year expenditure in 2007 is €357 million.The scheme for childminding relief was announced by the Minister for Finance in budget 2006 and the legislative approach will be underwritten as part of the Finance Bill 2006. The scheme will exempt from taxation the childminding income of an individual who, subject to certain conditions, minds up to three children in his or her home, subject to a maximum income from childminding of €10,000 per annum. The Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill deals with the social insurance aspects of this measure. To ensure that all those who participate in this scheme are afforded the opportunity to build up a social insurance record that can have important advantages for benefits such as pensions and maternity benefit, the Bill will require that annual PRSI contributions at a rate of €253 are made in respect of such childminding income. This is in keeping with the Government's recognised policies of making every effort to encourage the extension of pension coverage, particularly to women who have emerged as especially vulnerable because of their lack of any, or adequate, pensions.The Minister has also committed to significant reforms for one-parent families. The Bill will deliver a better standard of living and fresh opportunities for lone parents and their children, with policies directed at breaking down existing obstacles to employment, increasing access to career enhancing education and training opportunities through targeted supports and enlightened social policies. In this regard, recommendations will be published within weeks for general debate before the Government introduces specific proposals. Currently, income support is provided through the one-parent family payment to more than 80,000 lone parents at an estimated cost of €847 million. There has been no change to the income limits applying to the one-parent family payment since it was introduced in 1997. The Bill introduces changes that will give lone parents an opportunity to continue to increase their earnings without raising fears about their entitlement to the payment. A provision in the Bill will substantially increase the upper income limit for the one-parent family payment from €293 to €375 per week. This should allow many more lone parents to qualify.I commend the Minister for the far-sighted social welfare measures he is introducing, especially those that will allow more people to work and thereby take them out of the poverty trap. I congratulate him and wish him every success for the future.
#DermotFitzpatrickFF	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-party	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-dob	unknown-#DermotFitzpatrickFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I welcome the provisions of the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006.I especially welcome the Bill's social welfare measures: the introduction of a standard and enhanced non-contributory pension scheme to lift some 34,000 pensioners on to higher or full pensions, the increased supports and entitlements for lone parents, carers and widows, the increased emphasis on employment activation measures to ensure that no individual's potential is overlooked and to increase people's belief in their own abilities, and the establishment of the legal structure for the payment of the early child care supplement, beginning later this year, to some 260,000 families in respect of 350,000 children under the age of six.On pensions, I certainly welcome the new measures to strengthen protection for members' pension schemes. Those measures include: provision for the Pensions Board to impose a fine as an alternative to the prosecution of an offence; allowing the Pensions Ombudsman to bypass the internal dispute resolution procedure in cases in which there is clearly nothing to be gained from this process; and powers to make regulations requiring a scheme actuary to have his or her work reviewed to ensure that it complies with the provisions of the Pensions Act 1990.A big problem facing this country is the need for pensions facilities for the steadily increasing number of people due to come into the pension net. Currently, I am told by the building trades unions that thousands of their members are denied their rights to a pension because of the complete failure of employers to make the required payments to the building trade pension fund. The issue is too important to be allowed to meander through the courts over many years at great expense with possibly no benefits to the aggrieved parties at the end of the day. Even the most carefully regulated building sites are still inherently dangerous and, although health and safety regulations are being improved and tightened up, many workers' entitlement to a pension has been denied.I am glad that investment in welfare supports and entitlements will now account for €1 in every €3 spent by the Government, but I am also glad the Minister understands that lack of finance is not the only cause of poverty and that further enlightened social policies are needed in several key areas. I welcome the important new measures in the Bill that are designed to target resources at older people aged 66 or over, in addition to the significant weekly increases announced in budget 2006. These measures include combining all non-contributory payments for people over 66 into one standard and enhanced non-contributory pension scheme with a greatly improved means test that will lift some 34,000 pensioners on to higher or full pensions. The means disregard for this standard pension will be increased from €7.60 to €20 per week. A special earnings disregard of €100 will be introduced to allow pensioners to earn more income without eroding the value of their pension.The weekly disregard of €20 ensures a single person with no other means will be able to have up to €35,000 in capital and still qualify for a pension at the maximum rate. This rises to €70,000 in the case of couples with no other means. The Bill also makes provision for the extension of an enhanced earnings arrangement in the new State non-contributory pension scheme to persons under 66 who receive a widow's or widower's pension, deserted wives' allowance or prisoners wives' allowance. This will introduce a special earnings disregard of €100 per week.I am delighted there is a change in terminology in the Bill. The old age pension will now be called the State pension. Today, the vast majority of people who reach the age of 66 do not consider themselves to be old and are, in fact, in the prime of life. I had the honour of attending the launch this week of a survey into the needs of elderly people in Stonybatter in my constituency. While money was one of the complaints mentioned, it did not appear to be a major problem facing the elderly in this area. Many of the problems mentioned related to health, lack of mobility, aids to assist mobility, fears for personal security, social interaction and loneliness. I am sure that if this study was replicated in other constituencies, much the same concerns would arise.This study was not conducted by social scientists studying for a PhD or a Master's degree but by ten senior citizens who live in the community, spoke its language and, more importantly, were prepared to listen to their neighbours. This is what the Minister meant when he stated we must go behind the payments and tackle the causes of poverty. He might regard this study as a pilot scheme and replicate it in different areas around the country, particularly in areas where need is greatest, using local people to inquire about, empower and motivate their neighbours. I welcome this Bill and wish the Minister success in implementing it.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	170	It may sound strange coming from this side of the House but I also welcome this Bill. All the increases provided for in the Bill are very much appreciated. While money is important, we must remember it is not the only issue connected with poverty. The one measure I would like to see is more communication and interaction between different Departments in this regard. For example, the lack of a medical card for a pensioner with a small amount of additional income can often leave him or her in poverty. If the person's pension and any additional income is assessed, he or she will not receive a medical card and will be forced to pay for his or her medical care, which can have serious implications. This issue must be examined very carefully.While there have been announcements in respect of medical cards, which are not relevant to the debate on this Bill, the answer to a parliamentary question I tabled last week revealed that of the 200,000 doctor-only medical cards promised, only 5,000 have been issued. Major questions must be answered about how we treat those on low incomes. A total of 100,000 medical cards were taken away, 10,000 of which were in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, although it has a much lower income rate per person than Cork, where only 8,000 medical cards were taken back. I appreciate the individual work carried out by the Minister but cross-compliance is clearly needed to ensure we minimise the difficulties experienced by people, particularly elderly people. I am referring specifically to widows, widowers and people between the ages of 66 and 70 since people over 70 automatically receive medical cards. The Minister rightly pointed out in his opening speech that payments alone will not solve our social problems.He also mentioned lone parents who are caring for 130,000 children and wish to escape welfare traps and start out on a path to training, education and work. A report on literacy published last week reveals that we have a significant problem with young people leaving school with inadequate literacy levels at a time when there is unprecedented finance in the country. These young people are far less likely to secure proper employment and avoid the poverty trap.I welcome the change relating to people receiving the non-contributory pension, a point I will revisit as it is particularly important. Allowing people to earn €100 per week and still receive the full pension is a very valuable change.The issue of cross-compliance was starkly highlighted at a meeting I attended last Friday night. A colleague from Cavan County Council raised the case of a pensioner living in a nursing home in County Monaghan who was forced to hire taxis to travel to hospital. She was forced to take two taxis to Dublin, one taxi to Cavan and one taxi to undergo a blood test at Monaghan Hospital, which was only one mile up the road. Her total taxi bill was €552.50, of which €160 was spent on each of the taxi journeys to Dublin. On two separate occasions, she was forced to pay €75 and €60 in waiting penalties. Her journey to Cavan cost her €60, as well as €25 in a waiting penalty. She was forced to borrow the money for these taxi journeys from her local credit union in a town in my area. The taxi driver knew that a person of her age would be honourable and pay but this is how she was forced to raise the money for her journeys. She must now pay back this money out of her weekly pension.We must examine such cases very carefully and ensure that they do not happen to someone who does not have a family to look after his or her needs. Information must be available to ensure someone like this is dealt with in a caring and realistic way. The local Health Service Executive area maintains that it has no budget for taxi services but in an area like this where there is a lack of hospital services, such an issue must be dealt with very sympathetically. We can give out all the money we like in flat-rate payments but they do not cover this type of expense.The amount of money a person has in a bank or building society account while still receiving the maximum rate of pension for a single person has increased to €35,000, which is a welcome development. The amount has increased to €70,000 for a couple. This change is possibly related to the SSIA scheme. I remember an occasion when Deputy Jim O'Keeffe and myself spoke in this House to try to bring about some change in this area. The former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, told us we were only interested in looking after millionaires. We have come a long way, which I appreciate. It is important that people keep this money in a savings account. It gives them a sense of security because they know they will not have to depend on a son, daughter or someone else to help them out if they encounter a problem.We dealt with another matter at the time which the Bill does not resolve. It relates to pensions for the self-employed and people who had less than ten years contributions in 1988 when the self-employed levies were introduced. Given the age limit, some of these people were not able to pay ten years' contributions. Some of them paid nine years, some paid eight years and some paid five years' contributions. The resolution was that anyone who paid five years' contributions, or more, got a half rate pension but they did not get it pro rata for the remaining years. If someone who paid ten years’ contributions was a few days too old, they were barred from getting a full rate pension. Later the half rate pension was included. I ask the Minister to examine this because the numbers of people involved are not great. These people who feel very let down will feel even more let down today when they see people who never paid a penny benefiting from the €100. I ask the Minister to try to rectify the situation. If one has paid six years’ contributions, he or she should get six-tenths of the pension and if they have nine or ten years’ contributions he or she should get nine-tenths of the pension.The special earnings disregard of €100 a week will benefit approximately 3,000 recipients. I would like to refer to a specific group of people, namely, small farmers. Like our illustrious Ceann Comhairle, I come from Cavan-Monaghan, a constituency which includes very small farmers, many of whom do not have successors. These people may have a few acres of land on which they want to live for the rest of their lives, which may often be rented or leased. Some are involved in private deals and others are not. If they have a few cattle on the land, they will get the full pension, but if the land is leased or rented, it is considered to be unearned income. Will this money be treated in the same way as the €100 earning?I want to emphasise why this issue is extremely important. We are in a completely new situation as a result of the nitrates directive to which all farmers must adhere. If a young farmer wants to benefit from his neighbour's land, he must go through the legal process. In other words, if a retired farmer is receiving a pension of, say, €5,000 a year, the money should be regarded as earned income, just as if he was in a job, because it is the same thing. I would like this matter clarified, because in the new nitrates directive era, it is extremely important for a farmer to be able to disclose any legitimate dealings to his neighbour.On the medical card issue, will the €100 be a disadvantage to those who are 66 years of age or widowers? I welcome the increase in the respite grant from €1,000 to €1,200. Some 30,000 people were granted this money last year. There was a provision in the budget to provide the respite grant to 9,000 people who did not have carers, but who were being looked after. As far as I know, fewer than 7,000 people benefited from that grant, despite the fact that carers' bodies and so on say that some 150,000 people are caring for the elderly. Could this provision be promoted better through the different organisations to ensure that as many people as possible can avail of this respite grant?I welcome the changes in carer's leave. As a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs for a number of years, I am aware that much work has gone into this aspect on a cross-party basis to see how we can best serve the elderly and their carers. The Minister's colleagues will verify that we put enormous work into the whole area of carers. The one area that is still not recognised is the role of widows or widowers. It is good that old age pensioners are able to earn €100, but the situation has still not been rectified. The committee proposed unanimously that at least a 50% carer's allowance should be paid to a widow or widower who is caring for either their own parent or the parent of a deceased spouse. These people are told they cannot receive two pensions. Given that a non-contributory old age pensioner or widow can earn €100 a week, can the same not apply to widows or widowers who are caring for people in care? We have broken the bind whereby people are allowed to earn this money. If a widow or widower works somewhere else they are allowed to receive a non-contributory pension, but they are not allowed to do so if they are caring for someone who is handicapped or aged. It appears a widow or widower can earn €100 caring for a neighbour's parent but they will not be allowed to receive even a half rate carer's allowance if they care for their own parent or their spouse's parent. We talk a lot about the need to deal with the issue of care. We want to make sure people are cared for at home so they do not occupy beds in hospitals and so on. However, if we are to be realistic, we must ensure those who care for these people are paid for doing so.Regarding the renaming of allowances, the Minister said in his speech that it is important to be revolutionary in this regard. However, we must try to change the attitude of some personnel who work in the social welfare service. While I recognise the majority of personnel are extremely helpful, some individuals who deal with inquiries can be less than helpful. People are scared to approach some individuals. Renaming allowances will not be sufficient to deal with this issue. The title "unemployment benefit" is being changed to "job seeker's benefit", "unemployment assistance" is being changed to "job seeker's allowance" and "unemployability supplement" is being changed to "incapacity supplement". While some people are literally unemployable, they may not be classified as suffering from a disability. I met someone recently who had an alcoholism problem. That person needed some payment from time to time to stay alive, but this was not provided. I sat beside the coffin of this 39 year old man a few weeks later. We must treat issues such as this realistically. During my short period there, his father spoke three times about his son's alcoholism. These issues must be recognised by the social welfare system and the health service, and support must be provided. It is an attitudinal problem in many respects.The changes the Bill introduces are generally welcome and represent improvements. I am from a farming background and make no apology for raising issues relevant to the self-employed and farmers. It seems many people on low incomes are unaware of their entitlement to the supplementary income payment. I blame employers more than employees for this. Media publicity may not be particularly effective because, for example, many of the people concerned may not read newspapers. Pressure must be put on persons employing ten workers or fewer to ensure they advise those workers of their entitlements or even assist them in completing application forms.My colleague, Deputy Stanton, yesterday observed that people may not be aware of their eligibility for both supplementary income support and a medical card. Obtaining such entitlements can change a person's life completely. Advertisements in the Irish Independent or The Irish Times will not be effective because the people we wish to target may not read them. The Minister must find some other way of informing them of their entitlements.Will the Minister look again at the issue of supplementary income support? Older people with small shops and other businesses sometimes find it impossible to make ends meet but receive no income support. They must either give up their jobs or struggle on to the last. Many would like to hold on to their small corner shops or other small businesses. Their accounts are accepted by their banks and they are refused loans. The Revenue Commissioners accept that they are not eligible to pay tax. Why does the Department of Social and Family Affairs not accept their accounts and provide them with a supplementary income which takes them up to a standard at which they can survive? With the increasing number of large stores, many owners of small shops and other businesses find it difficult to survive. I urge the Minister to look again at this area and to allow such people to end their days with respect and dignity.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I am pleased to support the Bill. I congratulate my friend and colleague, the Minister, Deputy Brennan, for making such significant and innovative changes in social welfare in a short timeframe. I thank him for the package he brought forward in December for budget 2006, involving expenditure of more than €1 billion. This is additional to what is already being spent and brings the total expenditure on social welfare this year to €13.5 billion.This is a huge amount of money and represents a 100% increase in expenditure on welfare supports and entitlements since 2000. This expenditure constitutes a major investment of taxpayers' money. We should be confident that spending on this scale will have a positive impact on the recipients. I welcome the common theme of reform that runs through the Bill. I am aware the Minister is anxious to see the reforms implemented for the greater benefits of those who will receive them.The Bill includes a full spectrum of measures to address child care costs, including increased child benefit and other measures. This is a major issue that warrants special address. As the parent of three young children, who seem to grow inches taller every time I blink, I appreciate and understand the escalating costs of caring for children. I also welcome the changes in regard to the carer's benefit. In addition, I congratulate the Minister on the new scheme titles, which are most appropriate for our modern society.I particularly welcome the improvements to the old age contributory pension, retirement pension, invalidity pension and pre-retirement allowance. The new provisions in regard to the State pension, involving the disregard of weekly earnings of €100 in respect of the means test for eligibility, are positive. There are also improvements to the one-parent family payment, early child care supplement, respite care grant, family income supplement, invalidity pension and occupational pensions. The Bill also provides that specific bodies are included as bodies authorised to use PPS numbers as a public service identifier.The issue that struck me, apart from all the benefits I mentioned, is the concept of reform. I welcome the Minister's indication that these reforms are about liberating, empowering and encouraging people, and striking a balance between rights and responsibilities. As he observed, it is, above all else, about striving to ensure the potential that no individual is overlooked and that nobody's contribution is written off. This legislation is concerned with bringing about the reform that will help us to meet the challenges of modern society.Of relevance to this debate are the measures announced by the Minister for Finance in the recently published Finance Bill to provide incentives for the transfer of money from SSIA funds into pensions. We all recognise there is a challenge in regard to pensions provision. Nobody wants to see pensioner poverty. We must ensure the foundations are laid so all citizens are secure in the knowledge they will have a decent pension and will be able to live with dignity in later years. This is an area in which I have a particular interest because I served as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for services for older people. I am aware of the challenge of the amount of work to be done in this area. Equally, we recognise the tremendous amount of good work and input that continues to be made by older people to society, and that should be encouraged.I congratulate the Government on its decision to pay a bonus of €1 for every €3 transferred directly to a pension account arising from the SSIA benefits. It creates an ideal opportunity for thousands of people to improve their pension positions as it allows for a maximum once off contribution of up to €10,000. I hope the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will undertake a good publicity campaign to promote this scheme. Perhaps the Minister could ensure an appendix to avail of this bonus is attached to the SSIA4 form to draw down the SSIA moneys. Any person who draws down SSIA moneys should be encouraged to see the benefits available arising from this move by the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.My area of interest is provision for the welfare of older people. The Department of Social and Family Affairs recognises the large number of older people in our community. There is potential to ensure greater participation by older people in our society. I would be happy to discuss privately with the Minister some of the issues I have in mind. I congratulate him on his endeavours to ensure older people, particularly those who are vulnerable, will have decent pensions and security in their latter years. That view is held strongly by the Minister. I congratulate him on his endeavours to secure this arrangement and we all sign up to ensuring such security.Equally, I congratulate the Minister on the provision of a €100 earnings disregard per week in respect of recipients of pension benefit. Every individual is different and some people look forward to retirement or early retirement. Some people have opted, for one reason or another, to take early retirement but following a number of years with their foot on the back pedal find they would like to return to the workplace but find they are in a catch-22 in that should they do so they would lose certain benefits. This €100 earnings disregard is a great benefit in that it will encourage older people to contribute in some form in the workplace, perhaps simply for the sake of having an occupation. I have met people in my constituency and elsewhere who had a pressurised and demanding job and were happy to back out of it but subsequently find they miss having an occupation and getting up in the morning to face some type of challenge. They would welcome the challenge presented by having an occupation, whether it be doing the books, stacking shelves in their local supermarket or whatever. This provision gives people an opportunity should they so desire to participate in the workplace.I also welcome the means disregard for the standard pensions which is being increased from €7.60 to €20 per week. In essence, it will mean a person will be able to have means of €35,000 in capital and qualify for a maximum pension, and a married couple will be able to have double that in means. This provision is helpful. There are other ways this benefit will have an impact on people. For example, some people, for a host of personal reasons, may wish to downsize their property, distribute some proceeds of that to their children and retain some of the proceeds, and they will be able to retain such means without it impacting on their qualification for the maximum rate of pension.Since I was elected to this House and, particularly during my time as Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, it has been a priority of the Government to recognise the contribution of older people to our economy, society and their communities. One of the substantial means of recognising this contribution is through increases in the pension schemes that are applicable to this group of people. This Bill will introduce further significant reforms in pensions and potentially increase the incomes of thousands of additional pensioners. The Government has ensured the welfare of older people has remained a principal concern. Under this Government, pensions have increased by 80% during the past number of years, well ahead of the consumer price index, a record of which we are rightly proud.In my constituency of Dublin North-Central there are several active retired individuals and retirement groups. These people are an inspiration as they volunteer, put on shows and exhibitions, engage in fitness activities and events and contribute positively to their community. They are a living example that retirement is not necessarily a time to opt out and sit back. Their energy and enthusiasm is a credit to them. Older people in similar groups elsewhere throughout the country participate in their communities. They know their contribution is vital. The Government, in this Bill, is increasing options and opportunities for older people and allowing them to contribute to the economy without fear of losing their well earned and well deserved non-contributory pension.I am delighted the Government will allow and encourage those reaching pension age to continue to work should they wish to do so. In the past financial concerns about pensions may have discouraged people from continuing to work or re-entering the workplace. This Bill, by providing a special earnings disregard of €100 per week, will allow people the choice of working and not losing out on their pensions.Those who cannot continue to work, or wish to use their time in retirement differently, will also benefit under this Bill. A greatly increased means test will ensure that more than 34,000 pensioners will see their incomes raised. Welfare benefits will be combined to make claiming entitlements clearer and more comprehensible.This Bill will see the establishment of the non-contributory State pension scheme from next September. A standard non-contributory pension scheme based on a means test will be available to all welfare recipients over the age of 66. To ensure additional older people qualify for this new scheme, this Bill will see the means disregard increase from €7.60 to €20. This new scheme, in bringing together all the other support schemes currently in place, will not only increase benefit payments for a significant number of people but will make the entitlement to benefits easier to understand.I am pleased with the news that pensions will be paid on the date that people turn 65 for the retirement pension and 66 for the old age pension, rather than on the pension pay days. I am sure that those entitled will welcome this extra bonus on their birthday.The Bill also deals with occupational pensions and rightly addresses concerns workers may have about their pensions. The Government, in recognising those concerns, asked the Pensions Board to undertake a statutory review of those 2 million people in our workforce who are without personal pensions. As the report was published recently, I hope people inside and outside the House will review and debate its findings.Meanwhile, this Bill introduces several measures to protect those who have paid into pension schemes. The Minister for Finance introduced measures to incentivise the transfer of the SSIA funds into pensions and encourage contributions to occupational pensions. This is another innovation by which the Government will assist occupational pension holders.The benefits outlined in this Bill are being renamed to better reflect the nature of the benefit in today's society. The old age contributory pension will be the State pension, indicating that the age of 66 is no longer considered old. The Government has no wish to hinder people by suggesting that their age is a barrier to their activities and ambitions. The retirement pension has also been changed to the State pension, indicating that retirement is no barrier to continuing to work.It is vital that older people who have contributed so much to our economy, society and communities are not hindered by financial worries and complicated means of claiming their benefits. The innovative and far-sighted changes in this Bill will be of great benefit to older people, not only in my constituency of Dublin North-Central but throughout the country. I am happy to support this Bill and commend it to the House.
#PaulConnaughton	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-party	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-dob	unknown-#PaulConnaughton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	172	The Minister for Social Welfare has the art of being the first to think of a jazzy headline. While I agree with the name changes for the various pensions in this Bill, the leopard does not change his spots. We must watch to see what these changes mean for the delivery of service.There are some fine provisions in this Bill so I will not spend all day castigating it. The Minister, however, is in the privileged position of distributing not the Government's money but that of the people who work hard for it. The economy is strong now and the redistribution of wealth is what matters to the elderly, the disabled and so on.The benchmark of all civilised societies is the manner in which they deal with the elderly and the sick. I will discuss some of the black spots in this Bill and personalise my comments, which is the only way to show how the system has let people down badly. The change in the disregards in this Bill may be a small step but it could have serious consequences. Old age pensioners would hardly need to get up five mornings a week to earn the €100 permitted in the disregard.Many people will approve of the principle behind these changes. Thankfully today people live longer and are healthier; many 66 year olds whom I know are healthier than were 56 year olds 25 years ago. There is a significant change in overall health and it would be foolish of any Government to consign people aged 65 or 66 years to the scrap heap because these people have a significant contribution to make.The disregard is small, but I am concerned about how it will be calculated. I assume that employers who take on pensioners must comply with PRSI contributions and so on. Many people will worry about getting back into the system again and what it means for them. In other words, will it be costly for employers to take them on? If the limit is low, at €100, the need to pay PRSI and so on will make a significant difference. No one will want to earn over €100.Times are changing but in the long time I have been in this House many people have told me they would lose more through earning an outside income while receiving a pension. That concept prevails in rural Ireland. I do not know whether the same is true of Dublin city. I met a man last week who said he would have been better off if he had never seen the pension book because he had to do so much to get it, but he says the book means everything to him. I will be interested to see how the €100 disregard will bed down while that concept persists.The Minister was rather mean-minded in changing the means disregard from €7.60 to €20. That disregard existed for years. I do not know on what the Minister based the increase, but at €20 it is very small. Pensioners face a wider problem. If I were sitting in the Minister's seat I would be happy with what I was doing because I could argue that pensioners never received a larger pension. The Minister, however, must recall that they have never paid higher prices for ESB, and the ancillary services they receive, their heating fuel, petrol and diesel for their cars. Those items have never been so expensive.The Government intends that the non-contributory pension, or the State pension as it is now known, will be €200 next year but no one will go mad on that sum. I know people who do not live in high society but would pay €200 to go out for an evening meal. Against that background, we should not lose sight of ourselves in saying how good all this is.This sum will not be enough for people who may unfortunately have to end their lives in nursing homes, which can cost between €600 and €800 per week. Even with the payment from the Department to top up the pension there will be a significant gap as the years pass. We should not run away with the idea that the increase in the old age pension is a panacea. It must be seen in context.I am surprised that when the Minister delved into pensions he did not proceed to ensure that some of the anomalies in the system were corrected. It was not that he was not told about them. While we all hope the Minister will not be on that side of the House for long, he is the most likely Member on the Government side to implement a change. I am not sure of the numbers involved nationally but I know of 15 or 20 pensioners in east Galway so I assume the problem is quite widespread. In 1979 a man in north Galway, since deceased, was employed by the Office of Public Works at Headford. In that year employees were asked by the OPW to sign up to a new pension scheme. He and many others like him did not understand the significance even though they were given information about the scheme. The widows of those who signed up are now in receipt of what is admittedly a very small pension but a pension nevertheless. I ask the Minister to imagine the frustration within the one parish where five or six people are in receipt of those pensions but three or four other widows of OPW workers, who are entitled by right to this payment, but whose husbands did not sign up in 1979, are not. Numerically speaking, there are not many of these cases.I wrote to the Minister a few months ago on this subject and my letter was passed to the Minister for Finance who is responsible for Civil Service pensions. In the case of the widow for whom I was making a representation, it was decided that unless she could make a very strong case, there was nothing either Minister could do. The Pensions Board or whoever is responsible for these matters should be asked to investigate. It will not make any difference in ten years' time because by the law of averages there will be nobody left to claim it. I ask the Minister to examine this. I will send a copy of my letter to the Minister's office for his consideration.I cannot understand the reason the Minister did not take action on a matter of great importance. A man from north Galway emigrated to Birmingham many years ago. He worked in this country for five or six years but did not pay contributions because there were none to pay at that time. He spent his working life in England and returned home to his native parish two years ago. He is in receipt of a British contributory pension. He applied for and received the free telephone rental allowance as he is over 66 years of age. However, he did not receive the living alone allowance nor the fuel allowance. It is difficult to understand the reason a returned emigrant could be entitled to the free television licence and the free telephone allowance but for some strange reason the free fuel and the living alone allowance are denied to him. Why is he not entitled to these allowances, given that he sent remittances worth far more than the pension home to his parents and siblings over the years? He returned to Ireland every year for 50 years. It is unfair to an Irish citizen who had no alternative but to emigrate because he had no job in this country, and when he returned home to live, he is regarded as being in a lesser position than his siblings who stayed here. I ask the Minister to consider the effect on Irish emigrants abroad which I assume was never intended. I raised the matter a few times in the past months but it is not provided for in the Bill.I wish to highlight another problem which I regard as a national issue. An 82-year old man in my constituency had a review of his old age pension which he and his wife have been receiving for 17 years. He emigrated and worked hard with McAlpine's as one of their supervisors in London. He applied for the old age non-contributory pension for himself and his wife when he returned home. He informed the Department of Social and Family Affairs that he was in receipt of a British pension but he did not inform the Department that he was in receipt of a pension from McAlpine's. He should have informed the Department of this fact at the outset.However, in a recent review of his entitlements he informed the Department of his pension. I compliment the departmental staff for their humane approach. This case was the subject of an appeal before an appeals officer. I accompanied the gentleman to the hearing and he was treated with consideration by the staff. His wife is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and is being cared for in a nursing home in Galway city. It was deemed he had withheld information and arrears had accumulated amounting to €25,000 each for himself and his wife. This man is 82 years and in bad health and his wife is dying. His question at the appeal hearing was whether his house would be taken from him. This man cannot afford to repay any more than €20 a week and €50,000 is due.I ask the Minister to look at this case as sympathetically as possible. I reiterate that I would never support anyone trying to defraud the system but this is not the case in this instance.My colleague, Deputy Crawford, referred to pensions for the self-employed and the associated problem. I was in the Dáil when the then Minister, Deputy Woods, introduced the scheme in 1988. It was a good scheme, under which the period set for the self-employed was ten years, provided they were under 56 on that day. A number of beneficial changes have occurred since under different Governments, making entitlement to benefit somewhat easier. However, a small cohort of people remains who have less than the yearly average of five contributions. They are deemed to be going nowhere and their RSI payments were refunded to them. As Deputy Crawford stated, it was considered a good move at the time to give people who had five or more contributions a half pension but they would not be entitled to a pro rata pension. People with nine contributions believed they should get more than half a pension but at the time it was considered that half a loaf was better than no bread. Something should be done for those people who have fewer than five contributions. They would have included themselves in the scheme had they been born in time. The problem lies with their age. No more than with the other categories, time will solve all of this. The case has been made and the Minister knows what I want.It is usual for farmers to transfer farms to their sons or daughters when they apply for the old age pension. However, a technical matter that affects them is that if they transfer money held in bank accounts it is not seen in the same light as the transfer of farm assets. The transfer of money is considered to be a device to get the pension. I urge the Minister to examine this matter as it has serious connotations.

It gives me an opportunity to compliment not only the Minister but his staff. I am on record as saying the Minister, Deputy Brennan, has revolutionised the Department. The temperate language of the Opposition is a sign that even the Opposition accepts that and he is getting many back-handed compliments.I attended a chamber of commerce breakfast this morning with Deputy Ardagh and other colleagues. Deputies Connaughton and Stanton may be interested to hear that the former Deputy, Alan Dukes, addressed the group. He reminded us of the time when the Fine Gael Party was brave enough to say the Government was doing a good job when that was the case. There is general acknowledgement that the Minister is doing a superb job. He is taking on issues that have long required to be tackled. He is grasping many nettles that some people believed would not be tackled. He is doing his job in a brave, political way and I strongly support him.Pensions have been much discussed in the debate on the Bill. There is no question that this area requires to be dealt with and the Minister is leading the way. I take the lead from Deputy Connaughton, but not in a patronising way, as I have always complimented the Department of Social and Family Affairs, in all its guises, for the manner in which it deals with queries. It is important that we look after those who are in need of social welfare. We should not be afraid to look after them, as it is an important job. Throughout my political career I have supported the concept of social inclusion.I apologise for referring to Deputy Ardagh again but I heard him say last night that we are the envy of the world, that anywhere one goes throughout the world there is a major improvement in the image of Ireland. Any parliamentarian who travels abroad can attest to this. We are now seen as a leading player, which is important. The Taoiseach once said that when all boats are rising it is important that we give additional help to small boats. I expect that this approach drives the Minister in his work in the Department. It is important that we do not lose sight of this notion as there will always be people who are on the margins.Before I left my office this morning I got two calls in a short time about social welfare issues. When people are under pressure or have difficulty in satisfying the local employment office with regard to the information required for benefits we are sometimes required to intervene and I am happy to do so.I support the Minister in his proposed renaming of certain social welfare schemes. The old age contributory pension will become the State pension — contributory. The retirement pension will become the State pension — transition. Unemployment benefit will become jobseeker's benefit. Unemployment assistance will become jobseeker's allowance. Unemployability supplement will become the incapacity supplement. Disability benefit will become illness benefit. Orphan's — contributory — allowance will become guardian's payment — contributory. Orphan's — non-contributory — allowance will become the guardian's payment — non-contributory. While it is a challenge, we will all have to get our heads around the new terms.The Minister must continue to ensure that proper provision is made in the Department and that resources are put to good use in getting across a positive message to the public in so far as these issues are concerned. People need to know about the changes, what their benefits are called and how to access them. Some time ago I attended a function for the opening of a citizen's information centre where the then Taoiseach, Garrett FitzGerald, made the point which is still relevant today, that much of the work that reaches a public representative's desk would not be necessary if the systems were working. I do not wish to be unduly critical of the system but we must remember how important it is to send out a positive message about people's entitlements. Members of all political persuasions get numerous queries from all social classes which show this remains a continuing challenge.Different aspects of the legislation will attract attention. The extension of pensions investigation powers will no doubt get some headlines, as will the measures affecting jobseekers and pensioners. Those who read the Bill will find other sections that affect them. I compliment the Minister in regard to the jobseeker's allowance. We must ensure that those who qualify will be able to access the services and will not encounter problems. It is important that we help the unemployed to get back into the jobs market.I heard somebody make the point this morning in regard to the construction industry disputes that it is odd at a time when so many people are coming here to work that Irish people cannot get jobs. I know the Minister is examining this matter which I expect requires special attention. There will always be people who for one reason or another cannot find employment. I attended an important meeting yesterday when a deputation from the Jobstown Action Against Drugs Dependency Group, JADD, met the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern. It made the point that for some people even taking up a community employment scheme is a challenge. We should remember that. I have always taken the view that unemployment should mean job seeking.I represent an area in Dublin South-West where great progress has been made in terms of employment. I was a founder member of the Get Tallaght Working group 21 years ago at a time when unemployment was a major problem for the area and it was important that jobs would be created. Employment has improved dramatically in the area since then. Tallaght is now leading the way, as it should, being the third largest population centre in the country. That said, people still face challenges and we should not forget about them.Another highlight of the Minister's legislation is the early child care supplement, about which there has been much discussion recently. It was also highlighted in the Budget Statement by our colleague the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs is providing for the payment of the early child care supplement, which I note is being administered by his Department on behalf of the Department of Health and Children. The legislation contains the necessary amendments to the Taxes Consolidation Act in order to exempt that payment from assessment as taxable income.Some 260,000 families in receipt of child benefit will be paid the early child care supplement for approximately 350,000 children under the age of six. This is equal to about 50% of all families on child benefit and 33% of all children for whom child benefit is paid. The rate of payment at €1,000 per annum over four quarters, with three payments being made in 2006, has been generally welcomed.I understand that payments will issue early in the month following the end of each quarter. I hope the Department will take the opportunity of publicising this fact and ensuring that people are aware of their entitlements. All public representatives will tell the Minister they are receiving many inquiries about this payment, which is to be warmly welcomed.I wish to discuss one-parent family payments. I have already brought to the Minister's attention the concern expressed recently about a policy change regarding the length of time recipients have to visit their local post office. I am aware the Minister has reviewed that matter so I hope he will continue to examine that procedure on an ongoing basis.The Minister stated he is committed to significant reforms to one-parent family payments and the need to deliver a better standard of living and fresh opportunities for lone parents and their children. The Minister has also spoken of the need for policies directed at breaking down existing obstacles to employment, increasing access to career enhancing education and training opportunities through targeted supports and enlightened social policies.I have supported the Minister's plans both in this House and at the Fianna Fáil social and family affairs policy group of which I am the secretary. I have brought a number of issues to his attention which fall within his Department's remit. I am glad the Minister has informed us that reports and recommendations will be published within weeks for a more general debate before specific proposals are brought to Government.Income support is provided through the one-parent family payment to over 80,000 lone parents at an estimated cost of €847 million this year. There has been no change to the income limits applying to the payment since it was first introduced in 1997. The Bill includes changes that will give lone parents an opportunity to increase their earnings without raising fears about loss of entitlement to the payment.We should be careful to help people who otherwise might be caught in a poverty trap. Lone parents are among the many people who attend my eight clinics throughout Dublin South-West each week. They have told me of the challenges they face in trying to take up employment. The current buoyant economic period is welcome as people are finding employment. People who have been unemployed for a while may face a challenge in resuming work but lone parents face additional challenges, including child care and rental costs.Members of the House have often spoken about the manner in which some of these issues are handled, so I am glad the Minister has indicated an enlightened approach to them. I hope the days are over when local authority inspectors hid in bushes to see if people had visitors for whatever reason. Such matters must be dealt in an enlightened way. Bearing in mind our commitment to social inclusion, we must ensure that lone parents are given an opportunity to be part of the rising tide that lifts all boats. They must not be caught in a poverty trap because of old fashioned ideas of what they should or should not be doing. In his reply, the Minister might indicate how he intends to deal with that. In his initial statement he said he will bring forward proposals in this regard and will open the debate so I will be interested to see his ideas being fleshed out in order to make progress.Every day we get some sort of reminder that a general election is close. However, I calculate that there are over 450 days to the next election so it is important for Ministers to remain at the helm to continue the jobs they are doing. The Minister, Deputy Brennan, is certainly doing that. I expect that in the next year he will bring forward a number of exciting legislative provisions which will prove that this is a good, caring Government at work.I support colleagues who made a case for the continued recognition of carers. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, which is ably chaired by my colleague, Deputy Penrose. The record of that committee shows it has created many all-party initiatives which recognise the work of carers. In fairness to him, the Minister understands their importance. We must continue to support carers because there will never be enough of them.The Carer's Association is located close to my constituency in Clondalkin. Every time a deputation from the association appears before our committee and other fora, its members clearly indicate the particular challenges they face. I often bring my life experiences to politics and in this respect I have had many dealings with this issue through family connections. My late father, who died ten years ago, was looked after for a while by my sister so I saw at first hand the challenges that such matters entail. I have heard colleagues talk about carers being under strain and facing such pressures for a long time. As public representatives, we all come across many people who are dealing with such challenging situations. Therefore, I hope the Minister will continue to understand our strong support for carers. I was glad to note that he made that particular point in his earlier contribution. He is on record as having said that carers are at the core of a welfare society, which is as it should be.The Bill provides for increasing the rate of the annual respite care grant by €200 to €1,200 from June. In 2005, more than 36,000 grants were awarded. It is expected that the number of beneficiaries this year will increase further, which is welcome.The duration of the carer's benefit scheme has been extended from 15 months to two years for each care recipient. In addition, regulations will provide for increasing from ten to 15 hours per week the time a person can work while still receiving a carer's allowance, carer's benefit or respite care grant. The Bill contains the necessary amendments to the Carer's Leave Act 2001 to provide for the extension of the duration of carer's leave from 15 months to two years.I welcome the Minister's initiative on child benefit. He made the point that ending the unacceptable level of child poverty in an Ireland of considerable affluence in the 21st century was a target that must be achieved by the Government and society. In addition to substantially increasing the lower social welfare weekly rates by €17 per week in the budget for 2006, a number of measures have been taken to confront child poverty. The investment of more than €100 million in additional increases in child benefit will lift payment rates to €150 for the first two children and €185 for the third and each subsequent child.To be briefly parochial, local colleagues and I have strongly supported the childhood development initiative based in Jobstown in Tallaght. The Minister is aware of the great work done in that regard. The Taoiseach visited Tallaght in the summer to launch the initiative report. When we talk of child poverty and the need to deal with the challenges and difficulties, I certainly support that initiative. It falls within the remit of various Departments, including Education and Science and Health and Children, but I know the Minister for Social and Family Affairs also takes an interest. He shares a constituency boundary with me and takes an interest in my constituency. No doubt he will continue to do so and I am always happy to have his help. I look forward to supporting the Bill and warmly congratulate the Minister.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I thank the Minister for attending. He has been here for a considerable time and he is to be commended on that for it is often the case that Ministers of State attend for Ministers.I will take up where the previous speaker left off on innovation and imaginative structures to be put in place to deal with a world which has changed dramatically since the introduction of the social welfare code in this country in 1953. Needs have changed unrecognisably. When one considers what was required of the State when social welfare was first realised, one realises what a mammoth task it has become and how great are the needs of people. Our recognition of those needs is not just commendable but also demands we do something to address them.The Minister's colleague in his neighbouring constituency, Deputy O'Connor, has heaped praise on the Minister for increasing the period for which carer's benefit is granted from 15 months to two years. Giving someone carer's benefit for just two years is a terrible injustice. Since these people are on benefit, one knows they gave up jobs to look after others in need of 24-hour care. The notion that they would fall out of benefit because they made that sacrifice is unjustifiable, whether it is for 15 months, the 390-day norm in the social welfare benefits system, or two years. It is indefensible that someone should fall out of benefit because of having done a selfless thing.Such a person has made a huge sacrifice by giving up a job to do something which perhaps the person being cared for wanted that person to do. It may be that the carer was the only person allowed by the carer to do the job. That is often the case. It could also be that the carer thought the care provided by the State was not sufficient, recognised that the person needed 24-hour care, and therefore gave up his or her job to provide the care. Such carers have straight away reduced their income dramatically. They have virtually given up their social life and are on call on a 24-hour basis.I know that after a period a carer can accept up to ten hours' work on a social basis and so on. Nevertheless, the sacrifice is clearly recognisable and is a selfless act. After two years, however, the person falls out of benefit and no longer qualifies. If that person were no longer needed as a carer, he or she would have to begin a contribution record again. That needs to be examined, if only on the basis of such carers returning to work and perhaps being reinstated to the point they had reached when they gave up jobs to become carers. One should not necessarily continue getting the benefit while out of work, but one should get it on return to work or when a person comes to qualify for what will now be called the State pension, it would automatically be considered on a contributory pension basis no matter what lapse occurs.The sacrifice and selfless act must be recognised, as well as the fact that the State would probably not have provided the level of care involved. That recognition would be revolutionary, and since Deputy O'Connor recognises the Minister as a well known revolutionary, it would be no great feat for him to undertake. I wonder if there is any room for socialists in the world because Fianna Fáil appears to have them all if one were to take the word of its backbenchers.I want to talk about the means test for the carer's allowance. It always astonishes me that so few people claim or draw carer's allowance. It is not of the magnitude we expect when we look at the figures and is quite a small number. Now that we all recognise the crisis in the care of the elderly, we must take a serious look at abolishing the means test for carer's allowance.When the rainbow coalition was in Government, it began by doubling child benefit as a recognition of and a first step in eliminating child poverty, although we are not quite there yet. Nevertheless, an indication or first step from the Minister on the carer's allowance would be very important. A crisis is looming and it will not be a surprise because we knew the demographics ten years ago. They have changed slightly because of the economic success of the country and because of immigration but the demographics exist and we all know we face a crisis in care of the elderly. We must make it easier for families to care for people at home.I looked yesterday at a report published by the independent living advisory group, which reports to the Government. All of its findings show that people with disabilities want to live independently. From looking at reports on the elderly going back ten or 20 years, it is clear they want to live in their homes and communities. That is the best possible outcome and we need to facilitate it. The Department of Health and Children has a different job but the job of the Department of Social and Family Affairs is to facilitate people who live on support payments from the State. We need to think hard about that.I hope the Minister will correct me but a particular item is not in this Bill. I may have missed it.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	181	Although I do not pretend there are no widows over 65 or 66, we nonetheless have a group of young widows and widowers. This category of people do not do very well under the State. There has been an historic and deliberate attempt by all Governments to ignore this group as its circumstances will not always exist. The people involved, the Government and everyone else know that the group is in a transient period. That a mother or father of young children can find himself or herself in unplanned for circumstances is unfair, especially given that his or her lifestyle is based on two incomes. Their situations arise from tragic circumstances and are not a case of a marriage breaking up or one spouse deciding to leave the family home. However, they receive no secondary benefits.In this day and age, most of us would accept few houses do not have televisions. I do not want to generalise because, if I do, I will get a telephone call from the person who does not fit the norm to tell me I am wrong. Recent reports inform us that virtually every bedroom has a television set. However, young widowed mothers do not get free television licences. Licences are not inexpensive items and widows must find the money for them every year. In most cases, television is their only entertainment. They do not have free electricity or fuel. No one should be expected to live without the benefits of energy in his or her house. However, widows are expected to provide out of miserly pensions the comforts they have come to expect for their children.That they are young widows means a pension deriving from employment or a private pension is not available. They find themselves in circumstances near to but not in the welfare allowances net but have lifestyle expectations gained when they were married and their partners worked as well. We must examine this issue concerning this group of people. The social welfare code and needs of people have changed.I spoke to the Minister about lone parents previously but in a different context. We are now speaking on this Bill in which the only significant measure I see is the disregard of earnings in respect of the one parent family allowance. Before entering the transitional payment stage, one will be able to earn €375 per week, which will be increased from €293 per week. I welcome this measure. People will appreciate it as the money involved is serious to a significant extent.I was approached last Friday by a young woman who received a letter from the Department of Social and Family Affairs. I am not unique and am sure the Minister, Deputy Ardagh and others have also been approached by such people. I am one of those who believes the Department has changed radically over the past 15 years as to be unrecognisable. Its staff is courteous, available, anxious to help and, if one is mistaken in looking for one payment, they will direct one appropriately. This is important as the people being dealt with are vulnerable.I spoke to the Minister previously about the young woman in question. As in other cases with which I have dealt, the letter she received told her she owed more than €12,000 but, because she was unknowingly entitled to family income supplement since the date from which she owed money, the bill dropped to €6,500. One might as well have told her she owed the State €5 million and to repay it at €5 per week. She could not get this money together and has entered the appeals process. The Minister and I know that, if this young woman had stayed at home rather than worked, she would not have been billed. She does not receive a rent allowance, only a transitional half rate payment because she went out to work, and was honest, compliant and up front in giving the Department the information it requested. Approximately 4,000 people are in this position or so I am told. Fortunately, the cases I have appealed were successful.In this context a special unit has been established in the Department to examine payments made to workers. It is not this young woman's fault she went over the limit for the transitional payment. When she was asked to return her books, as it were, to reduce the payments by half, she did so. When she was asked to send in her P60, she did so. She did everything the Department requested of her. It has discovered it overpaid her by a certain amount and she is now in a state of panic.While a number of cases may have been dealt with because the process has continued for two years, approximately 4,000 other people are in the same position. If people owe the State money, they owe the State money. If this young woman had stayed at home, she would not owe the State anything and would still get a rent allowance and the other benefits to which she, as the mother of a young child, is entitled. However, she did not stay at home. She went out to work. Her income is paltry which is why she receives family income supplement.While I do not know how, something must be done in respect of that cohort of people. Many amnesties have been introduced by the Dáil for people who owed more than €6,500 and could afford to repay many times the amounts this young woman owes. I appeal to the Minister to introduce an amnesty for the group in question. That we would decide to crucify and cause such angst among all young women who choose to work, better themselves and inform the Department without underhanded dealings is astonishing. That 3,700 women have already paid is terrifying and I wonder how they managed to make the repayments.People with disabilities is my favourite subject. I read a report yesterday on people with disabilities who want to live independently. We automatically assume people with disabilities are young men and women in wheelchairs, but this is not the case as there are all types of disabilities. For example, the elderly can have disabilities. Reasons for disabilities include strokes, severe heart attacks, accidents, births, diseases, etc. We must not force people with disabilities to return to sheltered workshops or to sit in the corner of their homes.We have grown accustomed to seeing people with disabilities who we did not believe would venture out into the big bad world at every street corner. I welcome this as it creates diversity and gives us a different view of the world. It ensures we listen to the point of view of people who see the world in a very different way. I will not refer to access because it is so poor in this country that it terrifies me. The private sector will not deal with this until 2015.Why is there no indication that the Minister accepts it costs more to live for people with disabilities? Most people can get from A to B under their own steam but many people with disabilities cannot. They must rely on taxis, public transports or lifts from others. We must examine the idea of a cost of disability allowance. Perhaps this could be done as a first step, with the intention of implementing the full allowance sought in the equal citizens document. We must begin to examine this measure and it will eventually happen. The Minister's colleague on the backbenches, from a neighbouring constituency, Deputy O'Connor, sees him as the Che Guevara of the Government, and if the Minister wishes to make a mark he should introduce the measures I have suggested. If the Minister amended his budget to introduce a starter payment for disability allowance it would be deeply appreciated and he would forever be remembered for it.
#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I represent Dublin South-Central, a constituency in the south-west inner city that is the most socially and economically disadvantaged in the country. If one overlays a socio-economic map on a geographic map of Ireland, the constituency of Dublin South-Central is the darkest area on the map. When I began my Dáil career in 1997 it was black, now it is purple and I hope it will change to a bright sunshine yellow, with all disadvantage eliminated. I am hoping for a utopian society and all Members of this House and the Government strive towards this end. Deputy Lynch stated that people have major needs but I believe they also have great expectations. Members of the Oireachtas, including the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, face a major challenge and over the past ten years the Government has been meeting this challenge.During the drugs scourge in Dublin South-Central, heroin was rampant and everyone feared travelling across Dolphin's Barn bridge. Certain chemists and doctors were a magnet for those who sought a supply of drugs. Over the past ten years, through local drugs task forces, the Government has achieved a considerable amount. Today the drugs problem has diminished dramatically in comparison with ten years ago. The people responsible for this include Mr. Chris Flood and Deputies Eoin Ryan and Rabbitte.Fatima Mansions and Marrowbone Lane are being regenerated, while St. Michael's Estate in Inchicore is being demolished and replaced. Teresa's Gardens and Dolphin House have the opportunity for regeneration and Dublin City Council is anxious to make progress on the regeneration that the tenants of the complexes wish. The Government has the money to undertake a high class, high quality regeneration of those areas and I look forward to the residents agreeing to this.Community enterprise schemes, such as the job initiative and the social economy, have improved the lot of many people, particularly lone parents. The social capital of the country, particularly my constituency, has improved dramatically. Ten years ago, elderly women with long coats and scarves walked along the roads depressedly. Now the same cohort of women is dressed to the nines, with hair done, getting on the bus to Westport, Rosslare or some area in Cork, with volunteers such as former Garda Sergeant John O'Sullivan. Volunteers and participants in social community enterprise schemes work with the community to ensure the improvement in living standards of the elderly. Through participation, lone parents are also improving their quality of life and the social capital.The dramatic improvements in social welfare to which I refer are of great importance. In 1996, before this Government came into office, child benefit for the first and second child was €35 per month. In June 1997 it increased when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government came into power and it now stands at €150 per month. My calculator does not have enough zeros to calculate the significant percentage increase.

#SeanArdagh	unknown-#SeanArdagh-party	unknown-#SeanArdagh-dob	unknown-#SeanArdagh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	184	In 1996, the payment for a third child and subsequent children was approximately €41 and it now stands at €185 per month. The increase over ten years is in excess of 400%.In 1996, the old age contributory pension was less than €93 per week. Today the amount is €193.30 per week. In 1996 the figure for the old age non-contributory pension was less than €80 per week and it now stands at €182 per week. This is an increase of more than 100%, and these substantial increases are still not enough. I am sure we will see further increases. Whatever was stated in the media when he was appointed to the position, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has shown during the period he has been in the position that he is innovative and cares about equality and justice. He cares about his clients and customers. I do not know how many millions of customers there are. I am sure the Minister will tell us. He has shown he cares through the work he has done and effort he has made, and through the budgetary improvements that have come about. As Deputy Lynch stated, the Department is now courteous, available and anxious to help. All of the new systems are being introduced with style and management competence and ability second to none. I congratulate the Minister and ask him to keep up the good work.Regarding matters in the Bill, as I stated, child benefit has improved greatly. Do people realise that 540,000 families receive child benefit? It benefits in excess of 1 million children. These figures are huge. They are nothing like the figures we would have dreamt of ten years ago. The early child care supplement for children under six years is received by 250,000 families and 350,000 children. Each of those will get €1,000 a year towards child care costs. That is a significant figure. There is no meanness involved. If a child is born within a quarter, the parents will receive €250. If a child reaches his or her sixth birthday within that quarter, no matter at what stage of the quarter it happens the parents will receive the full €250 for that quarter. This generous spirit was not seen before in the former Department of Social Welfare. Previously the amount was worked out to the exact fraction. The Minister's hand is obvious in this type of measure and he is to be congratulated on that.The family income supplement is definitely the most important supplement available to families. It is not fully utilised. Deputy Lynch spoke about a particular lone parent who went out to work, and who was entitled to the family income supplement but did not avail of it. I can understand that. People on lower incomes spend so much time trying to live from hand to mouth that they cannot get into the schemes that are available. We all send out leaflets because full colour printing is now provided by the taxpayer free of charge. We as Deputies have a duty to inform all the people about the family income supplement.I did not realise until I went through the Bill that contributions to the personal retirement savings account, PRSA, will now be disregarded as far as the threshold amount is concerned. People aged up to 30 years can put up to 15% of their income into such an account. Will the Minister consider putting in place a scheme regarding the personal retirement savings account to give a tax equivalence to people entitled to the family income supplement? The State should increase by one third the amount of money put into a PRSA by anybody entitled to the family income supplement. For every €3 a person receiving the family income supplement puts into a PRSA, the State should put in €1. It is unlikely that people receiving family income supplement pay tax in the first place. There must be an incentive for it. If that is put together with everything else, it would inform people more of their entitlements and would allow more people to claim family income supplement.Regarding the one-parent family payment, I am delighted that, as Deputy Lynch stated, the amount of the disregard has increased by €82 to €375 per week. This gives an impetus, a reason and encouragement to lone parents to take a job. It would help them through the great expenses they have in bringing up young children.I would like the Minister to also consider the problems that widows, deserted wives and prisoners' wives have. People who may not have children, and who have been separated through no fault of their own, may find themselves in a position they never imagined. A one-parent family can earn up to €375 per week. If possible, will the Minister consider changing the anomalous situation within the system to allow a widow, deserted wife or prisoner's wife in a peculiarly nasty situation avail of this slightly better facility to earn money and get more involved in society?I am particularly delighted about the changes in maternity leave. I know it is not strictly a social welfare issue. However, the four extra weeks paid maternity leave effective from 1 March are extremely welcome. The four extra weeks unpaid leave, also effective from 1 March, are also welcome. A provision for a further four extra weeks to both paid and unpaid leave comes into effect in March 2007, when a total of 56 weeks paid and unpaid leave will be available to parents. Paid maternity leave will be 26 weeks, unpaid maternity leave will be 16 weeks and 14 weeks unpaid parental leave will also be available.I expect fathers will take this parental leave and take some of their family responsibility as is allowed under these Acts. It is a challenge to all new fathers. Many fathers today are older than in the past. In our day, men were fathers in their 20s. Now, a man is lucky if he is a father in this 30s. They should get in there and get to know their children early and avail of the parental leave.A person in receipt of the old age non-contributory pension can now earn up to €100 per week in a part-time nixer job. This allows those who want to remain active to do so. They can work a few hours a day to help out in the local community or take up a job and it will not affect their non-contributory pension. That is a great development and will give great encouragement to elderly people.I should be rapped on the knuckles for using the term "elderly". According to the Minister one is not elderly at 65 years of age.

Most of the people we know who are aged 65 and 66 are well-capable of going out and working. They would enjoy work and want to work, but are constrained because if they do so it will affect their non-contributory pension. The change is good. The Minister says it will affect 34,000 people. I expect it will affect many more in the future.

They must care for a particular person who needs care on a full-time basis apart from a certain number of hours that they are entitled to work. Last year more then 36,000 people took up the respite care grant. I would like the Deputies to trumpet the availability of this grant because many carers do not realise they are entitled to it. We should tell them about it. I hope that this year the number will increase substantially. Deputy Lynch suggested that we abolish the means test for the carer's allowance. While we would all love to do so, there is not an unending pot of gold. There must be priorities. The income for carers has been increased substantially to €580 for a couple and that is welcome.One of the main planks of this budget is to encourage people to return to work. That encouragement exists through many of the items I mentioned. It is backed up by the availability of child care places. Over several years more than 40,000 child care places were made available through the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Funding is available for a further 50,000 places bringing the total to 91,000 places by 2010. It is important that funding be put in place not only to increase places but for resources, buildings and improvements and, more importantly, for the training of child care workers to bring the standard up to a significant level. Childminders' income up to €10,000 is disregarded for income tax purposes but not for PRSI purposes. This ensures that people, mainly women, who mind children can have all the social security benefits enjoyed by other workers, such as pension and health benefits. I commend the Minister for Social and Family Affairs on putting that in place. I am delighted to speak on a Bill that is positive and that has so much in it for the people. Everyone must agree that we should fully support it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	189	Tá athas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an mBille seo. Is Bille é a bhfuil teideal fada air na laethanta seo, an Bille um Athchóiriú an Dlí Leas Shóisialaigh agus um Pinsin 2006.It seems that the wordsmiths in the Department are having a field day. I see they have already reformed the terminology for a number of the payments and entitlements. While that at least indicates that thinking is going on, closer reading of the Bill indicates that there is a need to measure whether the fine words meet expectations and whether we can benchmark ourselves against other countries in any fair or reasonable way.The Minister said that above all else we are about striving to ensure that the potential of no single individual is overlooked and that nobody's contribution is written off. Those are fine words and I also seek that objective but at my clinics I regularly meet people who are falling between stools. They may have been working, had an accident and find that because they have a house they fall between the stools in terms of means testing. They cannot get work because they have had an accident and they do not get a payment. The poverty trap is alive and well for some people notwithstanding the entitlements and the Minister's words.From the Green Party's point of view social welfare should be designed to maximise participation in the workforce. Social welfare for the disabled, elderly and other groups should not preclude involvement in the labour force. Many groups are forced into the poverty trap by compulsory retirement on reaching pensionable age, loss of social welfare on returning to the workforce or by having to choose between caring for elderly parents and full-time or part-time work. I do not envy the Minister the complexity of his remit.I pay tribute to the citizens' information centres throughout the country and particularly in my constituency, Dublin North, where much valuable advice and sensitive attention is given to the many people who avail of the services. I urge anybody who is not familiar with the citizens' information centres to keep them in mind. They constitute an important facility run by Comhairle and I hope the Comhairle Bill will be before us soon so that we can debate the reforms and updating of information technology needed to help impart the information.I read the Minister's speech with interest. As the Minister was speaking about his Department one would expect it to be positive. It is important to be sober when we compare ourselves with other countries. Ireland spends 16.1% of GDP on social protection. In other countries that are highly competitive from a business point of view, such as Finland, 27.2% is spent on social protection. Fine words will not make up for that clear difference between Ireland and other countries. I am proud that Finland is not only competitive and has good social protection but has had the Green Party centrally involved in Government and re-elected to Government. It would still be in Government except that the Finnish Government decided to build a nuclear power plant. It is important that we examine how other countries manage.A recent "Prime Time" programme illustrated the point when it quoted the EU average for the proportion of elderly people living below the poverty as 14.6%. Although that figure is unacceptable, it is much lower than the figure for Ireland, which Professor John Monaghan of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul suggested in the interview was 27.1%. Notwithstanding the improvements that have been made, we are starting from a relatively low base by comparison with the rest of the European Union. The Government needs to be reminded of that, lest it becomes complacent and believes that because it has done better than previous Governments all is now rosy. In comparison with other countries, we certainly have much work to do.I appreciate the solutions to many problems involve not just the Minister for Social and Family Affairs but collective responsibility whereby other Departments pull their weight in tackling social inequity and in looking out for the most vulnerable in society. As Paul Murray of Age Action has highlighted — Deputy Lynch mentioned this as well — elderly people often face a much higher cost of living than those who can avail themselves of a car for travelling to out of town shopping centres where they can do all their shopping in one trip and benefit from economies of scale. Elderly people often need to rely on corner shops and convenience stores, which have higher prices. Given that those higher costs of living perpetuate the income differences that have been mentioned, we need to ensure planning and social infrastructure take account of the most vulnerable in society rather than play to the loudest audience, which comprises those who can manage and who do not necessarily think about the day when they will be elderly.A similar issue arises in respect of education. The Bill makes extensive provision for child care, but I know many people in Dublin North find that child minding and child care facilities are becoming much more difficult to access because we have such a fast-growing population. Schools are becoming so packed that the enrolment age is being pushed higher, with children no longer being able to enroll at the age of four but having to wait until they are five or even six. As a result those children are left by their parents in whatever playschool or crèche facility is available and younger children do not get places at the age expected. That puts parents in the difficult position of trying to find money to pay for child care. The Department of Social and Family Affairs needs to lead the charge on that type of joined-up thinking, because the Department is affected by other factors coming into play that are in the control of other Departments.Looking to further debate on pension reform, the Green Party welcomes the fact the Government has kick-started these discussions. I acknowledge that the State pension has improved as Deputy Ardagh said but, given the increases in the cost of living, we should not lose the run of ourselves. In comparison with equivalent schemes in other EU states, the Irish State pension remains very low at 30% of the average wage or approximately €10,000 maximum.As Deputies we should also take account of the fact that, whereas we demand lots of bureaucracy and paperwork for the means testing, cross-referencing and checking of welfare claims to ensure people do not receive money under false pretences, we in the Dáil can claim expenses without the need for any receipts to vouch for them. We need to apply the same rules to ourselves as we apply to other people for social welfare. All our expenses should be vouched for by receipts so things are clear and transparent. Cynicism in the public mind is not helped when such facts come to light time and again when we debate social welfare. I will leave the matter at that because I want today's debate to proceed on the issue of pensions, but I will be interested in participating in that debate again.Finally, on the issue of nursing homes, I was astonished to read in the Minister's speech, in which he paid a well deserved tribute to carers, that although only 5% of the elderly live in nursing homes, 50% of funding for the elderly is spent on institutional care. Carers get a rough deal from this Government and from society in general. We need to reform not just pensions but other matters so the elderly and those who care for them are given not just a verbal tribute but a fair monetary tribute as well.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006. This important debate not only allows us to put down markers on the direction in which our society is going but to challenge and question the Government and to put forward sensible ideas on social welfare, child care, the elderly, carers and the disabled. I welcome the constructive proposals in the Bill, in particular the extra financial assistance it will give to our citizens. However, there is no need for Deputies on the Government side to lose the run of themselves or to clap themselves on the back for the way in which we treat the weakest sections of society.Before I go into the details of the Bill, it is appropriate that I mention the 25th anniversary of the Stardust fire tragedy in Artane in which 48 people died and more than 240 were injured. The pub has recently reopened on the 25th anniversary of the tragedy. I condemn that complete lack of sensitivity and I strongly support the families. In this debate on the welfare of our citizens, I urge the Cabinet to support the families in their hour of need. I also use this opportunity to thank and commend the people from the northside who have pushed the issue for many years, including Neil Fetherstonhaugh and Tony McCullagh who have written an excellent book on the matter. We need to support the families by providing a proper investigation and inquiry. In raising the issue again, I urge the Minister to bring it to the Cabinet table.On the broader welfare and disability issues, I strongly support the idea that resources should be targeted at the most needy. Despite the wealth in our society, we currently have approximately 3,000 people with intellectual disabilities on waiting lists. That is not a huge figure so we should consider how we can target such people on waiting lists for residential, respite and day care. The problem could be tackled fundamentally. I accept an attempt was made in last year's budget to make a large dent in the figure, but we need to target specifically the most needy. People with intellectual disabilities must be top of that list.We have heard from many good news merchants about how the Bill deals with the Ireland of today, but I remind such people that there is another Ireland out there. Some sections of our population are living in extreme situations with major problems in their lives. Some 19.4% of the population, 780,000 people, experience relative income poverty. The position of older people has deteriorated significantly in recent years and their poverty rate has increased by twice the average figure. The rate of in-work poverty has doubled and stands at 9%, with 157,000 people affected. The in-work poor are the second largest labour market category, after those with home duties, and account for more people than those in poverty who are unemployed or ill. Furthermore, 6.8% of the population, 270,000 people, live in consistent poverty. Groups at risk include children and adults in lone-parent households. We must also address the fact that cash transfers in this country reduce income poverty only by 40%, which is two thirds of the mean poverty reduction effect achieved through social transfers in the EU as a whole.The poorest fifth of the population received less than a quarter of income of the richest 20%, with cash transfers representing more than 80% of gross household income for this group. I raise these issues because there are people living in cities throughout Ireland in such poor situations. They turn up only now and again on our television screens on programmes such as "Prime Time", as regards crime. There are a great many poor people who need help and they are not all involved in crime. I should like the middle-classes to wake up to the fact that 90% of those who live in poverty do not get involved in crime. Those that do, very often come from a dysfunctional family, or have an alcohol-related or abuse-related problem. I commend those people and stress that as legislators we have a duty to support them and act as a resource for them.One can see clearly from the broader debate that not all of Irish society has gained equally from continued economic buoyancy. This is mostly due to structural inequalities which act as a barrier to sharing the benefits of a booming economy. Low educational attainment and outdated skills act as key barriers to employment, which is the major route out of poverty. I tell people who talk about poverty that the answer is education and more education. If children can be brought into the net before they even enter primary schools, they have an advantage. Already at four years of age when they enter the primary schools they are three or four years behind in literacy levels. Most schools in disadvantaged areas will spend the next eight or nine years trying to get children to catch up with average standards in middle-class areas. This is something that must be dealt with directly, head-on. I know that the Department of Education and Science currently has a number of projects under way to assist and support these children and to target the resources, and most Members of the House would agree with this. I urge the Minister for Education and the Science and the Cabinet to promote such projects as regards spending more money on the education of the disadvantaged.In the wider debate on taxation, Ireland has become a so-called low tax economy in the sense that direct taxation levels are now historically low. However, indirect taxation accounts for about 50% of all Exchequer revenue and is now a more dominant form of taxation. As indirect taxes are generally regressive, these hit the poor the hardest. Tax expenditures and reliefs for higher earners act as a drain, with the revenue foregone accounting for approximately one fifth of aggregate Exchequer returns. Efforts to broaden the tax base need to be pursued so that the tax system is seen to be fair. That is something that we must have the courage and the bottle to deal with.As regards social expenditure, relative to its EU counterparts, Ireland has one of the lowest levels as a proportion of national income. Listening to the debate earlier today one would think we were up in the premier division. Recent research by Combat Poverty Ireland identified public services as the key area that requires increased spending along with mechanisms for linking benefits to incomes from paid employment — and increasing the earnings of low-income working families. The independent group of Deputies in the House will always stand for low-income working families as a major priority in its broader political vision and agenda.Greater efforts are required to integrate groups excluded from the labour force. Generous investment in both incomes and services for children, such as education and health, are the keys to meeting the target as set down in the national anti-poverty strategy, Eliminating Child Poverty. Then we can have the debate about sustainable economic growth.Sustainable economic growth is crucial to our capacity to tackle poverty. It provides jobs and resources which are crucial if poverty is to be tackled in the years ahead. To maintain economic and employment growth, the Government needs to ensure Ireland's competitiveness in a global economy and to continue public and private investment in infrastructure and productive activity. The national action plan can contribute to this objective by targeting investment in human capital and local development which can deliver economic outcomes in the longer term. It is no longer a question of creating the wealth. We have that. The debate now is about how to distribute the wealth and resources.At present there is a centre-right view of the economy in operation which is damaging to the State and the poorer sections of society including people in need. I urge the Government to redistribute resources and opportunities in a fair and equitable manner. Despite economic growth not all social groups or areas of the country have gained equally. I urge a greater redistribution of resources and opportunities towards low-income groups. Greater effort is needed to integrate groups excluded from the labour force. Measures which target groups and areas excluded from economic growth are also important. Such measures will yield returns for the economy in terms of fostering economic growth among the less buoyant sectors. We have seen examples of good practice, I accept. Dublin City Council has come up with excellent projects which included investment in houses and community centres in disadvantaged areas, and this should be developed.I welcome the opportunity to debate this legislation. However, the debate is no longer about wealth, but rather about how it is distributed to the most needy.

Then he retraced his steps to search for facts to support a previously conceived conclusion, namely, to try to undermine the Government. It is an old tactic, something of a "Cassandra" that is invoked from time to time, but it does not stick to the facts. There have been historical increases in all social welfare payments year after year. It must be frustrating for Members of the Opposition, who would very happily stand over such increases. They stood over minuscule increases when they were in power.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	199	In an honest interval Deputy Finian McGrath might even concede that. However, on this occasion we are talking about the important area of social welfare reform and pensions. I take the opportunity to discuss pensions again. The problems with the pensions sector are obvious. The Central Statistics Office figures earlier this month reflected the fact that coverage has decreased in 2004-05, particularly among men, and especially in the west of Ireland. That pattern is unfortunate. We have two Deputies from the west here and they may know more about why that pattern appears to be more pronounced in that part of the country. It is a problem we will have to face in 20 years' time.The problem will be exacerbated by the vast increases in public service pensions. It is estimated that they will quadruple from the payments that were made around 1989 compared to what will have to be made in 2030, a bill in region of €3 billion which will have to be paid by all taxpayers, public and private workers. That is a problem we will have to face. Naturally, the Government has taken major steps towards addressing it, but much more has to be done. I just want to reflect on those CSO figures, however. The numbers have gone down and that does not seem to make sense because, clearly, Irish people are prepared and willing to save. They are willing to put money aside. What is not included in the figures compiled by the National Pensions Board is the fact that so many have second homes and rental properties which are actually their pensions. Until we accept this and try to factor it into assessment of needs in 20 years time, we cannot grasp the figures as they apply.An article by Mr. David McWilliams in yesterday's Irish Independent described this fault line between those who had bought houses in the 1980s and before and those who had purchased them from the mid-1990s onwards. Those on the good side of that fault line, the older people of Ireland, have major equity which they have been able to transform into second homes and rental properties. Ultimately, these assets will represent their pensions as lump sum payments when they cease to work, whenever that may be.Mr. McWilliams described how a house bought for between £20,000 and £30,000 in 1982 or 1983 would now be worth more than €1.5 million. This increase in personal wealth cannot be measured against any increase in effort, risk or any other factor. It is simply an accident of time and circumstances which occurred without the owner's intervention.Those of us on the other side of this fault line who have come into the housing market late, too late in some circumstances, have either negative equity or nothing as lucrative as the older people of Ireland have managed to gain. This state of affairs must be taken into account when one is assessing pension coverage.Younger people are also being forced into defined contribution pension schemes which are far less lucrative than public sector pension schemes and older defined benefit schemes. People in the latter schemes have many more advantages than younger people in defined contribution schemes. Mr. McWilliams's article was very interesting and well researched. I hope the change in figures will be acknowledged by the Pensions Board.One of the issues referred to in the board's report, which was published in January 2006, was the question of mandatory pensions. The Minister said he will be forced to consider whether mandatory pensions can and should be introduced in Ireland. At the moment, employers and employees face compulsory social insurance contributions, but mandatory pensions would be another tier on top of this. However, introducing mandatory pensions is a soft and easy option to take when certain other options should be considered and pursued.Introducing mandatory pensions would be particularly damaging to small and medium enterprises. Larger businesses have the time, expertise and resources to set up the superannuation schemes required under a mandatory system but smaller businesses would be damaged by it. They already operate in a high-cost, competitive environment where rates, insurance, energy costs and wages are increasing. Adding this further layer of bureaucracy, together with all the administrative costs associated with it, would be particularly damaging for small and medium-sized enterprises.We should examine other options for addressing the pensions issue. One of these is a public information campaign. Deputies may have seen a very well resourced public awareness campaign on television in respect of recycling. It featured the well known celebrity gardener, Diarmuid Gavin, and an older woman who was showing inappropriate affection for him. The campaign exhorted the public to reduce, re-use and recycle. Everybody understands the message of this light-hearted campaign, which has been broadcast for a number of months.A similar campaign that would focus on the pensions sector is needed. In doing so, the Government would be pushing an open door as people in Ireland have a propensity to save. The success of the simple, understandable and transparent SSIA scheme, which was taken up by 1 million people, is proof of this. The scheme was, admittedly, a no-brainer, so to speak, and a short-term scheme. However, there is an untapped market as Irish people have a propensity to save. Personal retirement savings accounts have clearly not been as successful as they could have been, in spite of changes included in this Bill. We need a nationwide public awareness campaign which would explain to people that if they do not take out a pension and face old age with just the State pension, they will be forced to live on an income of just €9,000 per annum. While there have been considerable increases in pension coverage over recent years, these stark figures may cause a few people to wake up.We must address the question of how to persuade people of my generation and those who are younger to take out pensions. I have reached the age where I am beginning to acknowledge my mortality. I acknowledge that I may not be here forever and I can envisage old age, especially on Saturday mornings. People of my age and younger need to be made aware of the necessity of pension coverage because of the changes that have taken place. A proper public awareness programme would accomplish this aim. It is not appropriate to consider a mandatory pension scheme at the moment because it is a soft option.Only 24,000 carers out of the approximately 150,000 carers in the State receive either carer's benefit or carer's allowance. There has been considerable progress in improving the lot of carers, particularly in the last budget and social welfare legislation, but we have a long way to go. I read a rather cynical article recently which argued that a minority can always determine Government policy if it is well organised. Examples of such minorities would include taxi drivers, heavy goods vehicle drivers, farmers in general and poultry farmers. Such minorities can have a disproportionate influence on Government policy merely because they are well organised.On the other hand, by virtue of the 24-hour, seven day a week work they do in caring for individuals, carers are not as capable of organising themselves, yet the budget contained a 20% increase in the carer's allowance, which was the highest single increase in any payment under the social welfare scheme, which is a credit to the Government. It shows that the Government is not necessarily influenced by the loudest voices but is influenced by a genuine and sincere issue, as was the case with carers. It proves that one does not need to block traffic or drive sheep into Department foyers to influence Government policy. One can do so by the very logic of one's argument. I am very pleased to see that this has happened in respect of carers.The Carers Association raised the issue of insurance contributions in respect of people receiving carer's benefit. The issue has become even more significant because the duration of carer's benefit has been increased to two years. It is important that insurance contributions be allowed to continue, as is the case in respect of the changes made to the child care income disregard of €10,000. This issue should be addressed if the Government has not already done so. I commend the Bill to the House.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill 2006. It is quite unusual for me to acknowledge that I agree with a comment made by Deputy Finian McGrath about social disadvantage. I agree with his argument that the way to deal with social disadvantage is through education. While I listened to him speak about social welfare in general, I realised that the traditional argument that increases in various benefits are insufficient is no longer relevant to a discussion on social welfare. In saying this, I do not mean to upset my colleagues on the opposite side of the House. In debating social welfare issues, we now look at fundamental changes, which is a reflection of the previous budget which introduced a range of real and significant increases in social welfare payments.Deputy Sargent acknowledged that the increases were significant but argued that we should not forget rising costs. We do not forget that costs are increasing but in real terms, the increases outlined in the budget and carried through in this Bill are multiples of the cost of living index. As a result, they are very real increases.I will now examine the impact of the Bill. It proposes to change the name of the non-contributory old age pension to the State pension, which is a much more appropriate name. The Bill changes specific aspects of the non-contributory old age pension. The new weekly disregard of €20 ensures that a single person with no other income can have capital of €35,000 while a married couple can have capital of €70,000. This change is of considerable comfort to people who have invested in SSIAs and similar products and recognises where we are.A special earnings disregard of €100 per week will be introduced to allow pensioners to earn more income without eroding the value of their pensions, which is appropriate not just from the perspective of pensioners but because there is a demand for people with experience who might not want to work full-time or retire permanently. There is an opportunity for these people to engage in limited work. I ask the Minister to pay attention to this aspect because there is a demand for workers. A significant number of people in their 60s can contribute and would like to work on a part-time basis. Let us see what the take-up is on the €100 earnings disregard, which is innovative. The market requires this innovative initiative, as do individuals. An analysis should be carried out each year to find out how many people are taking up this option. I would like to see the disregard extended so that people could work two or three days a week without it having a significant negative impact on their pension.I would like to refer to the early childhood supplement, which followed a long and difficult debate on how to tackle child care and so on. The budget announcement is being given legislative effect in the Bill. The constituents to whom I spoke gave a warm reception to the proposal. This move reflects a targeting of resources at an age group that might not normally be in school and for whom additional costs could be involved. The Minister was correct to go this route.I draw the Minister's attention to an issue which is not referred to specifically in the legislation. The question of over-payments by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arises from time to time in the Committee of Public Accounts. These over-payments can arise for a number of reasons, including fraud and so on. While I have raised the issue on a number of occasions, significant progress has not been made in this regard. The relationship between the Minister's Department and Revenue needs to be much tighter. I am dealing with a constituent of mine who is a lone parent. She has been working in a supermarket and making up-to-date PAYE and PRSI contributions. I understand it was her responsibility to make her situation known to the Department, but she failed. When I discussed the matter with her, she was able to show me all her tax certificates and other details. Therefore, she could not understand why the Department of Social and Family Affairs did not automatically get these details from the Revenue Commissioners. As people who have been receiving these payments may be vulnerable and may not always know what their entitlements are, Departments should communicate with each other in that regard.That individual owes in excess of €20,000 as a result of over-payments over four or five years, which was just discovered a few months ago. That woman will be paying back that money for a long number of years. From an administrative point of view, the Department should be able to track these over-payments that are not fraudulent and occur because someone is earning and has gone over the limit.I acknowledge the significant change in increasing the period of carer's benefit by nine months to two years. This time last year I spent a significant amount of time in Our Lady's Hospital in Crumlin. Very often, when we talk about carer's benefit, we think about people who are caring long-term for an elderly relative or someone with a disability. However, I came across a significant number of people in Our Lady's Hospital who had children who would require treatment not for life, but for six or 12 months. Many of these people were unaware that they were entitled to carer's benefit. More information should be made available to these people because it is not always easy to access this information at such a traumatic time in one's life. Once they access the service and realise what is available to them, it can make a significant difference. I welcome the increase in the respite care grant.I would like to refer briefly to the one-parent family payment. Lone parents often fall into the poverty trap, and one piece of legislation is not sufficient to deal with the issue. However, significant progress is being made in this area. While the increase in the income limit for the one-parent family payment from €290 to €375 a week is significant, it is not sufficient in its own right. While other initiatives must be undertaken, in particular, the rental accommodation scheme, the Minister must consider dealing with lone parents in a much more holistic way. The rental accommodation scheme, in conjunction with the lone parent allowance, family income supplement and so forth, will tackle some of the poverty trap issues. While it is still early days, the new guidelines for medical cards mean that people who traditionally had problems and were living on the margins will now be able to access them more easily by taking into account the cost of child care, mortgage payments, rental payments and so on. These changes will address what were previously referred to as poverty trap issues.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. The objective of any social welfare Bill is to ensure that people on lower incomes will have a reasonable standard of living and will not have to live in poverty. I would like to deal specifically with child poverty because, while we might be recognised internationally as trying to maintain a reasonable standard of living for those on social welfare and those living in poverty, there is gap in regard to child poverty.I am sure the Minister is fully aware of the excellent report by the End Child Poverty Coalition which was published last year. Despite a buoyant economy and increased wealth, child poverty remains unacceptably high in Ireland. Many find it difficult to believe that poverty exists for children at a time when this country is perceived to have great financial wealth. Government statistics indicate that one in seven children live in consistent poverty and almost one in four children live in relative poverty.Poverty among children manifests itself across a range of areas that go beyond income. The longer a child is poor, the greater the impact on the life chances of the child and the subsequent deprivation in later life. Growing up in poverty affects the natural development of a child, including his or her social, educational and personal development. Many children who live in poverty drop out of education at an early age. Speakers already pointed out that the route out of poverty is through educational opportunity and being in a position to use the opportunity presented by the education system.Child poverty has been repeatedly described as a denial of the basic rights of a child to an adequate standard of living. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child is often referred to in this Chamber. It refers to the right of all children not to live in poverty. The convention provides that every child has the right to an adequate standard of living, adequate income and accommodation, education and health care and the necessary supports and services. All children have a right to the material and other resources necessary to allow them to experience a childhood free of poverty and deprivation and to reach their full potential as adults.Ireland ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1992, thereby committing itself to implementing the convention's provisions to the maximum extent of its available resources. Repeatedly, in respect of various issues, we have raised the failure of the State and the Government to ensure the commitments under this convention are honoured. Our economic resources have grown enormously in the past decade. Ireland is now in a far better position to implement those commitments in full.The Government has separately committed to reduce the numbers of children living in consistent poverty to less than 2%. Moreover, a commitment was given in the national anti-poverty strategy to end child poverty completely by 2007. Will the Minister outline how the Government plans to achieve this target? The realisation of this commitment necessitates the implementation of appropriate policy measures. Given that the Government's goal date is 2007, this is the last opportunity to allocate the necessary resources to honour its commitment. I am glad the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is in the House. If he has an opportunity to contribute, he might deal with the attainability of the targets in the national anti-poverty strategy.The elimination of child poverty should be moved to the top of the agenda of political and economic objectives and it should remain there. Like any other national objective, it requires sustained and comprehensive action, supported by the allocation of significant resources. Achieving the goal of ending child poverty by 2007 is a challenge that can be met, but only if the effort is a matter of national and political priority for the Government.The most recent statistics on the incidence of child poverty in Ireland, from 2003, indicate 14.6% of children live in consistent poverty. This means some 148,000 children were identified as living in houses with incomes of less than 60% of the national median income and experiencing enforced deprivation in respect of one or more of eight basic deprivation indicators. These indicators are: no substantial meal for at least one day in the past two weeks; no heating at some stage in the previous year; debt problems arising from ordinary living expenses; inability to afford two pairs of strong shoes, inability to afford a roast dinner once a week; no meal with meat, chicken or fish, or the vegetarian equivalent, every second day; inability to afford new clothes; and inability to afford a water-proof coat.In 2003, approximately 23.9% of all children were at risk of poverty. This represents 242,000 children, almost one in four. This is the official EU definition of income poverty, which in Ireland is referred to as relative income poverty. According to the EU's evaluation, therefore, almost one quarter of Irish children is at risk of poverty. In addition, research indicates that the depth of relative income child poverty has increased, with a greater percentage of children now living in households with incomes of less than 40% of average disposable income.The statistics I have quoted are taken from the EU survey on income and living conditions, EU-SILC, published by the Central Statistics Office in 2005. The EU-SILC replaces the living in Ireland survey which was conducted by the Economic and Social Research Institute between 1994 and 2001. Within the EU, Ireland performs poorly in terms of comparative child poverty rankings. In 1999, the average EU-15 child poverty rate was 19% but the corresponding figure for Ireland was 21%. By contrast, Denmark and Finland, for example, had levels of 6% and7%, respectively.For lone parents, the EU-15 average income poverty rate was 38%, compared with the figure of 44% for Irish lone parents. The EU-15 average poverty rate for families with three or more children was 25% and Ireland was again above average with a rating of 27%. We are consistently above average in terms of the EU test of child poverty. Ireland has one of the highest rates of poverty among developed countries, ranking third highest in the United Nations human rights development index for 2005, which measures the extent of poverty in 18 OECD countries.Children in Ireland are twice as likely to be poor as adults. Once in poverty, Irish children usually remain in poverty well into adult life. The groups of children particularly at risk of experiencing poverty and social exclusion are those who live in welfare dependent or low income households, live in lone parent households, live in families of four or more children, have disabilities, are from the Traveller community; are from asylum seeking families, are from migrant and refugee families; leave school early or leave the justice system or health board care. Two particularly vulnerable groups are children living in lone parent households and in asylum seeking families.Th EU-SILC survey identified 14.6% of children as living in consistent poverty. However, the percentage of children in poverty varies depending on their household composition. One parent households have the highest consistent poverty rate at 32.6% and are three and half times more likely to live in consistent poverty. A specific difficulty arises in regard to life opportunities and support for children in one parent households. Children in lone parent families also face a disproportionate risk of being in relative poverty. Households with one adult with children face a 42.3% at risk of poverty rate compared to around 15% of households with two adults and one to three children. The children of single parent households are three times more likely to live in poverty than a family with two or three children.Lone parent families reported the highest deprivation levels for each of the indicators I mentioned. Some 33% said they could not afford to buy new clothes, 31% experienced debt problems arising from ordinary living expenses and 24% said they had to go without heating at some stage in the past 12 months due to a lack of money.Recent studies highlight the level of poverty and indebtedness experienced by lone parent families. Some 70% of Money Advice and Budgeting Service clients are in receipt of social welfare and, of those, nearly one third are in receipt of the one-parent family payment. This is a major issue related to the one-parent family payment which often is not highlighted. Society often perceives one parent families as almost living off the State. I have often heard people referring to such families as sponging off the State. That perception is totally at odds with the real position in terms of the life opportunities and poverty levels experienced by the children of those families. That is also the experience of the parents in those families but we are specifically dealing with statistics developed to show the level of poverty experienced by children of one parent families. Support to increase income for lone parents is vital. As matters stand, most lone parents cannot afford to work while remaining on the one-parent family payment and due to low educational attainment will not get work which pays enough for them not to be in receipt of the payment.The Minister has stated on numerous occasions that the Government views employment as the key route out of poverty, a view with which I agree. However, one third of children in relative income poverty in 2001 were living in households headed by a person in employment. While parental employment has to date successfully lifted many children out of poverty, there are limitations to this approach. Some parents cannot work or are only able to obtain low waged employment which does not yield sufficient income to adequately support their families.Research clearly shows that Government intervention to combat child poverty can make a major difference. Societies which do most to look after people will, over time, improve the capacity of people to look after themselves. The countries with the lowest child poverty rates in the OECD are those which allocate the highest proportions of GNP to social expenditure. Ireland currently lags behind the OECD average in its expenditure on key services such as education, housing and health care. For example, in regard to expenditure on early childhood education and care, Ireland invests less than 0.2% compared to the OECD average of 0.4% — only half the level of investment of the OECD average.The Combat Poverty Agency concludes in its 2005 report, Ending Child Poverty, that:—Ireland invests relatively little in subsidised services for families with children—Ireland's comparative ranking on child support plummets after services are factored in, and—Housing costs are disproportionately burdensome for families with children. . .The agency calls for improved services for families with children in the area of early childhood education and development, health care, housing and family services.Concerns that cash transfers to households on behalf of children may create work disincentives for parents and-or be siphoned off by adult members for their own use are not substantiated by research. This was discussed earlier in the debate. Income support measures which protect people from poverty appear to empower people to get back into the workforce rather than create a disincentive to their doing so. The real position does not gel with the often accepted view that if cash incentives are given to people in receipt of lower incomes, they hive it off their children; rather the opposite is the case, it incentivises them to improve their position.I urge the Government to prioritise the introduction of a new mechanism to support the most vulnerable children. As an interim measure, supporting children through the child dependant allowance must become a key focus. I pay tribute to the End Child Poverty Coalition for its excellent report, Child poverty in Ireland 2005: An Overview, which was available last year.

I welcome the Government's decision to introduce the new child care strategy in advance of the expiration of the previous one and the subsequent announcement by the Taoiseach of establishment of the new office of the Minister for Children.Deputies will be aware that I have worked for some time across the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science. My experience made me keenly aware of the complexity of the cross-cutting issue of child care policy, the difficulties surrounding the delivery of multi-agency programmes and the need for a more integrated approach through the location of child care under the remit of a particular Minister.An important part of the Government's child care package announced on budget day is the novel decision to introduce a major new payment to parents of young children in the form of the early child care supplement and this Bill gives effect to that decision. The early child care supplement which will be administered by my office is an additional payment of €1,000 to parents in a full calendar year, in respect of all children aged under six years. The payment will be effective from 1 April and will be a direct, non-taxable payment of €250 paid per quarter year, in respect of each eligible child. For the purposes of this calendar year, three payments will be made because the legislation is now before the House. The payment is intended to assist parents with the high cost of caring for children, especially in their early years. The administrative arrangements for the new payment, affecting some 350,000 children, are being put in place and I expect the first of the payments, which would be due at the end of June 2006, to be paid in August. In general, payments will issue early in the month following the end of each quarter. It is the intention to issue the first payment in August 2006 for the quarter from April to June with a further payment in October for the quarter from July to September. Every effort will be made to make payments for the last quarter of 2006 which runs from October to December in December. That is the hope but that period does not expire until the end of December. It is expected that similar arrangements, although somewhat more rapidly executed, will apply in the calendar year 2007. I thank my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, for the extensive discussions we have had on this subject and for the fact that his Department has put in place a payment mechanism for the payment.As with any other payment scheme, care is taken at the planning stage to ensure that it will operate in a streamlined way. This is done to facilitate the recipients of the payments in order that, for instance, they can have the payment paid directly into their bank accounts or through a post office system if this is their preference. It is also done to ensure efficient administration by Government and keep the necessary operating costs of schemes and programmes to a minimum, in the interests of good government.The early child care supplement deliberately does not distinguish the income or employment status of parents. Some might be critical of this feature, but the Government believes it is right that parents should have choice when it comes to child care. It is not the role of the State to tell parents which child care arrangements are best suited to their families, rather it is for the State to support them in whichever such arrangements are appropriate.It has also been put on record that the Government's estimated cost of the early child care supplement was based on the take-up of child benefit and includes migrant workers' children who remain abroad. Like any payment, the future costs of both payments have always been subject to several variables, including future birth rates, the number of children who travel with their migrant parents and take-up of the scheme. Both schemes will be monitored, but the possibility that take-up will increase in the future should not prevent us making a payment now that will support parents.Deputy Neville cited extensively a document dealing with the ending of child poverty. That is an objective to which we all subscribe realising which requires practical decisions. The commentary on the recent budget, of which this Bill is an aspect, described it as a substantially redistributivist budget. I think I am right in saying that the Combat Poverty Agency confirmed that view and said that it will have a significant impact on those with very low incomes. The early child care supplement is one aspect of the budget's redistributivist character.I welcome the significant increase in child benefit for which this Bill provides. Child benefit supports all parents towards the cost of rearing and caring for their children, irrespective of income or employment status, and represents a major expenditure commitment by the Government to the cost to parents of child care. The increases will apply from April 2006 and child benefit will increase by €8.40 per month for the first two children, to €150 per month, and by €7.70 per month for the third child and subsequent children, to €185 per month.Another important measure for parents introduced in the budget was the increase in paid and unpaid maternity leave by four weeks from 1 March 2006. This will be increased by a further four weeks from March 2007, bringing the overall duration of paid maternity leave to 26 weeks, and the total duration of unpaid maternity leave to 16 weeks from March 2007. These increases will enable mothers of new-born children and adopting mothers to take six full months of paid maternity leave from 2007. My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, has signed into law the orders increasing the duration of maternity and adoptive leave.Childminders are an important sector of our child care services and for many parents are the preferred option. It is important that we recognise this resource and support it. The Government has introduced a new childminding relief which is provided for in the Finance Bill 2006, now on Committee Stage. As a result, where an individual minds up to three children in the minder's own home, no tax will be payable on the childminding earnings, provided the amount is less than €10,000 per annum. If childminding income exceeds €10,000, the total amount will be taxable as normal under self-assessment.To avail of the exemption, an individual will be obliged to make an annual tax return of the childminding income and to notify his or her local city or county child care committee of the childminding service. The Social Welfare Law Reform and Pensions Bill provides for the inclusion of childminding income in the PRSI system where the income is declared for the purpose of the childminder tax exemption. This has the advantage of including the childminder in the social protection system provided through PRSI.The Government examined this issue at some length and it was decided correctly that the attachment of PRSI to this income would ensure that many mothers who care for children in the home would not fall outside the social welfare net. It is an important decision in principle and an appropriate signal in this area. While childminding is an informal sector, it is important as a minimum that it be brought into the social insurance scheme so that those who engage in childminding can benefit from the right to earn an old age pension and other such social welfare entitlements.Child care has been at the forefront of this and the previous Government's policy since taking office in 1997 and much ground work has been laid in that time through the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06.The development of a coherent child care policy in this time enables us to take a long-term view of the issues which need to be tackled and we are in a position to adopt a more strategic approach to the delivery of services and meeting the demands of parents. The Government's recent decisions on child care represent a comprehensive and timely response, both in terms of the even greater commitment to funding for child care and the establishment of a truly cohesive approach to the delivery of child care services under the new national child care strategy for the period 2006 to 2010.One of the cornerstone elements of the new strategy is the national child care investment programme 2006-10. The new programme is effective from I January 2006 and succeeds the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06. Unlike its predecessor, the new programme is entirely Exchequer funded and the Government has committed €575 million to the programme over its five-year term. The Government has not waited for the expiry of the previous programme to launch the new five-year investment programme, which further demonstrates its commitment to the provision of quality child care.The new programme aims to provide a proactive response to the development of quality child care supports and services which are grounded in an understanding of local needs. It will build on the existing programme and has several ambitious targets, including the creation of 50,000 additional child care places, with 5,000 after school places and 10,000 pre-school places aimed at three to four year olds; improving the quality of early childhood care and education services, including part-time, full day care, school age child care and childminding; supporting families and breaking the cycle of disadvantage; and supporting a co-ordinated approach to the delivery of child care which is centred on the needs of the child.These are ambitious targets which include the creation of many new additional trained child care personnel. I am committed, however, to ensuring that we meet these targets and objectives in a way that takes account of the needs and best interests of children.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I welcome the opportunity to make some remarks on this Bill, some of which others have made but which I will reiterate. The reform aspect of this Bill is long overdue and I compliment the Minister on introducing it. I do not know whether he would like to be associated with Lloyd George as a reformer, but he was the last person to engage in major reform of this area. The pensions aspect of the Bill is also long overdue.Among the many important statements the Minister made is "payments alone will not solve our social problems, that is why we must go behind the payments and tackle the causes". We must never be complacent or self-congratulatory about what we do in the social welfare area. Much has been done and the targets are ambitious, which is right. There is a danger when talking about social welfare that we automatically mention poverty.I agree with the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, that the budget has had significant redistributive effects, as many recognise. An elderly constituent of mine told me recently that he could not afford to live anywhere other than Ireland because the supports for the elderly were so comprehensive and good that he would not attempt living anywhere else.The Department of Social and Family Affairs is among the most progressive, reforming and radical Departments. I have had the pleasure of listening to the insights of many members of the Department's staff over several years and hope they continue the reforming work in which they are engaged.There are several significant aspects of the Bill but in the interest of using my time productively I will skip over some of the remarks that might have been made earlier to focus on those that interest me.The Bill aims to ensure that older people, especially those who are most vulnerable, have decent pensions and security in their later years. It also allows for those reaching pension age but who wish to continue working to be encouraged to do so and to be appropriately remunerated for their work.I draw the Minister's attention to anomalies which still remain, including a matter not directly within his area of responsibility. Those on community employment schemes are precluded from continuing those schemes after the age of 66 years because they have then reached pension age. I am aware of a number of organisations, especially those dealing with elderly people, disability groups in my constituency and the senior citizens' parliament, which campaign in this area. The retention of certain social welfare entitlements while continuing on schemes such as community welfare schemes, needs to be examined. The combining of non-contributory pension payments for those over 66, other than carer's allowance, into a standard and enhanced contributory pension scheme is a good idea.The introduction of the child care supplement is an important measure. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has confirmed that those who participate in childminding will benefit from PRSI and other payments. This was a concern expressed to me by the National Women's Council. This has important knock-on effects in terms of maternity benefit and I compliment the Minister.The Minister is aware of my concern about the short timeframe being allowed for the changeover to the swipe card system. A person changing to the use of electronic collection of their benefits will be forced to collect the benefits between Thursday and the following Tuesday, which is four working days. Not many of us are so organised that we can manage to collect something within four working days. I ask the Minister to undertake further examination of that issue. It has been suggested to me that it was previously possible to allow three months to elapse before the collection of payments. Such a length of time may no longer be required but a number of additional weeks would be appropriate.The Minister has intentions to introduce further reforms in the area of services to lone parents on which I compliment him. I urge him to be progressive and radical in that area. Apart from enduring more than the usual hardships of parents, lone parents endure deprivation which others do not. As a teacher I know that many of them left school early and involuntarily in many cases. I compliment the Minister's Department on the initiatives introduced over the years, such as the back to education allowance and the vocational training opportunities scheme, VTOS. These schemes have proved to be very beneficial in taking people out of poverty and providing them with opportunities for employment and further education. I ask the Minister not to restrict the availability of the back to education allowance because education is the one way of providing greater opportunities for people.The child dependant allowance is a hardy annual which I raise every year. This allowance is not part of this Bill but I advocate at every opportunity on behalf of that payment. It has not been increased in a number of years. Even though we have had discussions on it, I have not been able to persuade the Minister or his Department of the need to look again at the child dependant allowance. I suggest there are strong arguments for retaining and increasing it. I ask the Minister to use the opportunity in the next budget to do so.The Pensions Ombudsman reported on construction industry employees. For whatever reason, people working in the building industry are tempted to play fast and loose with the system of taxation and PRSI and this seems to be endemic in the industry. One and two-person operations are being made to register as sub-contractors and self-employed. It is unrealistic to expect such workers to be able to manage accounts and make VAT returns and fulfil the responsibilities of self-employment. A great number of these workers are generally young and, like professional footballers their high earning capacity is short. They are tempted to think there is no life after 40. I ask the Minister to consider closing off as many loopholes as possible to ensure exploitation cannot take place.The living alone allowance has not been increased in a long time. It is difficult to convince departmental officials that this payment should be increased. There are unique reasons this allowance ought to be increased and it remains to us to persuade people. I ask the Minister to examine this payment. I compliment the Minister on his campaigning zeal in this area and look forward to co-operating with him in further radical measures.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. I welcome those changes which the Minister proposes. It is only proper that I would so. I also acknowledge some of the structural reforms which are particularly welcome. I welcome the increase in child benefit and respite care, the raising of the income threshold for one-parent family payments, and the extension of the duration of carer's benefit. These are important changes in the right direction.I wish to make some general points about the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. I will use this as a departure point to some comments which the Minister, Deputy Brennan, will have heard me make before. The Minister of State described the intention of the Bill as favouring redistribution. I hope this is so and that it is but the beginning.The classical debate on social policy took place in the 1970s and 1980s. The debate in Britain was between Professor Titmuss and Professor Acton and discussed which models of social policy should prevail. Should it be the model that simply dealt by way of residuum with the consequences of an economy which spun away separate from the society and should it pick up the casualties? Should it be merit-based in which people are asked to provide for themselves? Professor Titmuss advocated a model that should be redistributionist. If it was to be such, it accepted that the economy as structured was inherently a creator of inequality in its tendency. This debate was not abstract and only available to and having implications for those of us who were academics in those years. It had a practical implication in regard to how, for example, one was to provide for pensions. That infamous parliamentarian who will go down in history as one of the blackest people of all time, Margaret Thatcher, became involved in the pensions issue as follows.A problem arose in terms of the market model based on merit in regard to pension contributions, in so far as highly qualified women on high incomes who had left the labour force for the purpose of child rearing found, on returning to the workforce, that their pension entitlements were calculated on an average basis on their latest earnings. In other words, women who had achieved a particular professional point before they left work discovered, on their return to the workforce after rearing their families, that they came back at a lower level than they were on at the point of departure. In turn, the averaging that took place between that point and their retirement left them with unequal treatment in regard to pensions.This anomaly in regard to averaging arises in regard to the Department of Social and Family Affairs, particularly in terms of those people who worked for a brief period in the 1950s, a point already made by Deputy Penrose. Between 1955 and 1960 one never had fewer than 45,000 people per year leaving Ireland. If one worked in Ireland for a year, for example, in 1954 and then left in 1955, and if pension entitlements on one's return from England 20 years later are calculated under an averaging mechanism, those forced out of the country through the absence of opportunity here in the 1950s will be inevitably penalised. One cannot deal with this either, for example, by arguing one could have acquired credits or benefits in England because, in many cases, some of the people who exploited the Irish in Britain were Irish themselves.This is not a party political point — it would arise with any Minister dealing with this matter. When I was in Britain I remember noticing the difference between those who were working on the lump and Irish contractors who drove in Rolls Royces to Old Trafford, dropping off on the way to the Conservative Club but who had not properly looked after many hundreds of their fellow Irishmen in regard to social welfare contributions. This brings me to the point about the Pensions Ombudsman's report which reveals quite a scandal in terms of the large number of construction workers who are left unprotected. This simply has to stop.I come to the choices facing the Minister and I want to be positive. I regard the spirited intentions of the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to be redistributionist as more idealistic in intention than practical in achievement. One has to make choices. The choices fall to those of us on the Opposition benches as well, as to which model we follow. I get the impression the Minister, Deputy Brennan, possibly shares my view in regard to this. In the same way as Fukuyama has been converted from neoconservatism, the Minister has mitigated his market model.

I suggest the best way to approach social policy is from the model of citizenship. From a model of citizenship one will immediately find oneself moving towards the choice between the three options I specified earlier and going towards accepting the principle of universalism. The Government has my support, for example, in regard to the provision of child benefit. Any child in this country, irrespective of where he or she was born, should be entitled to benefit. I think we can agree on that. If one accepts that principle of universalism it is ridiculous to become involved in projected costs.At the other end of the life cycle is security in old age. If one accepts the principle of universalism and one wants to be able to include all citizens who are vulnerable over a certain age, again one has to make choices. In between, one has special categories, including those with special needs but also those who are in long-term care relationships with those with special needs. It is only by accepting the moral purpose of citizenship and the general principles of universalism that one can provide for all of these categories.One can do so in the most efficient manner possible. Social policy studies show that every time one starts qualification schemes for different kinds of benefit there is a crucial threshold which one passes where the cost of vigilance begins to exceed the benefit being transmitted. In some cases it is simply wasteful. This argument does not stand up at all — that if one makes universal provision those who are well entitled to make a contribution should be making that contribution and one has operated in a regressive manner. One always has to balance against that, the enormous bureaucratic nightmare one is creating. Even benevolent intentions are frustrated in the sheer cost and mechanism of ensuring vigilance in schemes.The research is most interesting where this has been studied such as in Scandinavia, for example. I am anxious to be positive in what I say. When one looks at social protection expenditure as a proportion of gross domestic product we are second lowest in Europe but it is very high in countries like Sweden. Studies show that the nearer one goes towards universal provision and to redistribution models, the fairer and more efficient it works out over the long term.Those who are at the interface of dealing with people who operate the system provided by the Government for those citizens in need have very difficult tasks. I urge the Minister to seriously look at the giving of discretion in regard to particular cases. While we must have full legal accountability and while we may all take Ministers to task — it is correct that we do so — at the same time cases arise that are not just simply anomalies, they are ones in which it is appropriate to have discretion if one is to fulfil the spirit of the legislation.An interesting shift is taking place in regard to the powers being given to the Pensions Ombudsman, in that he can take a decision without waiting for the completion of the internal dispute resolution mechanism. That should be a model for several other areas in regard to social welfare reform. Given the element of trust involved, this would also improve the quality of the process within regional, district and local offices where people are dealing with citizens often in a very stressed condition.I have not come across any published evidence that suggests any of the social care environments we need for children, those with special needs, or the elderly, are provided by the market. They simply are not. This is a role of the State, which is incredibly important, and the State must decide whether it will act in an interventionist way by being consciously redistributionist, as outlined in the Titmuss model, which is the one I favour.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.The ambition of the European Union to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has been, and continues to be, a key objective of the development of the European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP. The tasks to be carried out under ESDP, the so-called Petersberg Tasks, are defined in the Amsterdam treaty as "humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking".Our participation in the ESDP and in the Petersberg Tasks has been endorsed and supported directly by the Irish people in the referendum on the Treaty on European Union and the subsequent referenda on the Amsterdam and Nice treaties. Our participation in the ESDP is also fully in accordance with our traditional support for the United Nations and our obligations as members of the international community to respond to crises, events and humanitarian disasters wherever they may occur.Ireland supports the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. To this end, I established the interdepartmental group to examine all issues relating to Ireland's potential participation in an EU-led rapid response capability. The group reported to me in November 2005 and since then its report has been considered by the Cabinet sub-committee on European affairs and, informally, by the Government.On the basis of the study and informal discussions at Government level, I have authorised my officials to open discussions with potential partners on Ireland's participation in a battle group. In co-operation with like-minded nations, we will seek to contribute to the development of the battle group concept and, through this, to remain at the forefront of developments within the international community in supporting international peace support operations. With my recent announcement, 23 of 25 member states have signalled their intention to participate in battle groups.My intention would be to identify specific options on participation and then return to Government for a formal decision. In the first instance we intend to talk to Sweden, which is the framework nation for the Nordic battle group. We have identified a range of potential offers ranging from smaller niche capabilities up to an APC mounted light infantry company group of approximately 200 personnel plus support elements.While there have been some preliminary informal discussions with Sweden regarding potential participation, to date there have been no formal discussions with any EU member state. As such, I am not in a position to state what will come out of these discussions. However, arrangements have been made for a formal meeting between representatives from the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces of Sweden and Ireland on 10 March in Stockholm to discuss possible Irish participation in the Nordic battle group.As members will appreciate, the Nordic battle group was organised some time ago and I understand that most of the core elements are already in place, with Sweden contributing the core manoeuvre battalion. In addition, battle groups covering the period out to 2010 have been announced and on this basis I expect that our contribution in the period to 2010 is likely to be limited. However, this will be a matter for ongoing discussion with other member states over the coming months, in particular, Finland and Austria with whom we have had some initial informal exploratory discussions.There are no plans for the involvement of Naval or Air Corps assets, although individual members of the Naval Service or Air Corps may be deployed on overseas peace support operations as they have been in the past. Any commitment to a battle group will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time as set out in the White Paper on Defence.There is no question of Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality being compromised by the participation of Irish troops in battle groups. Participation imposes no obligations concerning international or multilateral defence, nor does it give rise to constitutional issues. Any move to a common defence would be for decision by the European Council acting unanimously and in accordance with member states' constitutional requirements. At present, there are no proposals for such a move.In any event, Ireland's position is clear. The amendment to Bunreacht na hÉireann in October 2002 precludes Ireland from participating in a common defence. As a consequence, the Irish people would have to amend Bunreacht na hÉireann before Ireland could take part in a common defence.Any decision to participate in any battle group mission will be a national sovereign decision, decided through our own national decision-making process on a case-by-case basis. In this regard, I have reiterated on many occasions that our participation in peace support operations would continue to require UN authorisation. Participation in battle groups will not diminish this requirement in any way. Ireland's basis for participation in missions undertaken by the EU is grounded in the legitimacy conveyed by the UN Security Council. This will not change. The triple lock of UN, Government and Dáil approval will remain in place.

Will additional funding be required and, if so, will it come from the present resources of the Defence Vote or will additional resources have to be obtained elsewhere? When will the Minister bring forward legislation? Will the Minister confirm what legislation, if any, is necessary to implement this proposal?Will the report the Minister was given in November be made public? If it is to be published, when will it be made available? In his reply, the Minister stated that he did not have formal discussions with any of our EU partners but did he have informal discussions with them? Why did we pick Sweden and, it appears, that country alone? I am not saying there is anything incorrect in that as we have served with it in Liberia. It strikes me, however, that in view of the Good Friday Agreement, the so-called special new relationship with our nearest neighbour and the fact that it speaks the same language, we should have consulted the British on joining them. In the recent past, we have served alongside British forces in Cyprus. It would be much easier from an interoperability viewpoint to deal with the British who are very near to us.I understand from the Minister's statement that Ireland will not be involved in such a battle group before 2010. If I am wrong, the Minister may correct me. Will the Minister not agree that the triple lock mechanism will give rise to efficiency? It is time for the Government to examine this neutrality rubbish we have spoken about. Ireland is not neutral so it is time we decided what our foreign policy should be. We should be mature enough to make such decisions in this House. I realise that the Minister is a bit concerned about scaremongering from certain quarters.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Deputy Timmins has certainly raised a number of important questions. First, the funding question has arisen before. In the short term at least, I do not anticipate any increase in funding. We will stay within our limit of 850 troops and will operate from that. In other words, our total overseas commitment will not exceed our present limit of 850 troops.Second, we will also insist on the principle under which we operate in the EUFOR and KFOR operations, namely, that costs will lie where they fall and each country will meet its own costs.Third, our participation in a battle group, if it is deployed, might only last for 30 days. The maximum will be only 120 days. There will not be much extra cost involved when the battle group is on stand-by during that six-month period. If a battle group happens to be deployed we will of course have to meet the usual costs of deployment, sustainability, nutrition, overseas allowances and medical care. We will also have to meet the costs of bringing troops back. We do not expect, however, that it will add significantly to costs. Irish troops are well equipped for missions up to and including chapter seven missions. That is precisely the type of mission we are operating in Liberia at the moment. It is generally agreed that the force's assets are sufficient to provide adequate protection.I hope to introduce the necessary legislation before the summer recess to enable Irish troops to go abroad for training. It will change the definition of the UN resolution slightly to incorporate the type of resolutions they intend to introduce. They will be the major changes, although there will also be one or two other minor amendments.The Deputy asked about the publication of the report but as we are still working from it, I do not think it would be appropriate to publish it yet. Perhaps when I have gone to Government with a formal decision on joining a battle group, I will consider the Deputy's request to publish the report.The Deputy also asked about other countries with which we have had discussions. I am told that we have had informal discussions at official level with Austria and Finland. I met the British Defence Secretary, Dr. John Reid, who came over to see me just before Christmas. The question of battle groups arose in conversation but I understand the British have their own. They are providing a single nation battle group while we will be part of a multinational battle group. We have joined with Sweden because to all intents and purposes, we are effectively in a battle group with that country.The Swedish-Irish contingent is the rapid response unit of the United Nations contingent in Liberia. In effect it is a battle group in theatre. What it is doing and has been doing differs little if at all from what the battle groups we now envisage will be doing. We have traditionally worked with the Swedes. We are familiar with their system and they are familiar with ours.It is not correct to say, as Deputy Timmins did, that we will not be doing anything before 2010. The general format for multinational battle groups up to and including 2010 has been agreed, so any contribution we make between now and 2010 will most likely be in a niche capacity. Following our discussions with the Swedes in Oslo on 10 March, I expect us to be able to move ahead straight away, perhaps have our contribution to a battle group ready before the end of this year and possibly even participate before the end of the year, should such a battle group be deployed and should we be on standby at that time.The triple lock is not necessarily an impediment to our participation in battle groups. There is no doubt that in some cases, everyone might agree that a battle group should be deployed and Ireland will not be able to participate because the United Nations resolution has not been passed. That is a fact and that situation can occur. However, the Government is reflecting the will of the people when we say we will act in accordance with the United Nations resolution. That is and will remain Government policy. I point out to Deputy Timmins that it has been said to me by some of my counterparts in Europe that in certain situations, countries participating in battle groups will not want to go to a particular troublespot because of some historical problem or historical baggage. They would not be able to participate for that reason. It is not just the absence of a United Nations resolution which can preclude involvement in a battle group.The important point is that all battle groups will have a built-in redundancy provision for situations where one or more participants cannot participate for one reason or another. That will be part of the organisation of multinational battle groups.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	220	While the Minister is a very able person, instead of answering questions he makes speeches. It is very hard to figure out what answer he has given to the question. Will the Minister give details of the new legislation that is required to allow Irish troops participate in the new EU battle groups? Will this legislation be published and when does the Minister hope to have it enacted? Will he give further details of the partnership arrangements being sought with Sweden? Traditional Swedish neutrality, while similar to our own, has differed from the Irish interpretation of neutrality. Does this represent an evolution of our own neutrality in the direction of the Swedish model?The maintenance of the triple lock is the Labour Party's greatest concern. I know the Minister has been at pains to stress it will not be affected. However, given the length of time it takes to achieve a UN mandate, a Government decision and Dáil backing, is it possible that international pressure will be exerted on Irish troops to enter into a battle group before each of these has been achieved?The extent to which Irish neutrality has been compromised remains to be seen. It is clear that Irish neutrality has entered a new phase.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	221	My answer was a bit long. I was trying to reply to all the different issues raised by Deputy Timmins.We hope to have the new legislation published and passed through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the summer recess. That is our plan. The new legislation will enable the Irish Government, without having a UN sanction, to send people abroad for training. It is also intended to enable the Government to deploy troops, which it cannot currently do, on a humanitarian mission. For example, we found recently with regard to the tsunami and the flooding situation in New Orleans that we had to ask for volunteers for such humanitarian missions. The Attorney General advises us that under Irish law, we do not have the right to order people abroad on such missions. In most of those cases there is no international crisis so accordingly there is no UN resolution.Under the Defence Act 1960, as amended in 1993, we are entitled to deploy troops, provided the requisite requirements are met, on a UN established mission. Deputy Sherlock is aware that, increasingly, the UN is subcontracting out, so to speak, some of this work to regional agencies such as the EU or the Organisation of African States. That is called an authorised mission. It is not established directly by the UN but authorised by it. We are advised by the Attorney General that the wording of the defence legislation probably extends to an authorised mission, although we are taking a chance on that. However, we have noticed in recent times that the UN tends to use different language such as "support" or "calls on to support". We will ensure that such a situation is covered and that our legislation will enable us to participate in a mission where the wording used is not "established" or "authorised" but perhaps "calls on" or "supports" and so on.With regard to Deputy Sherlock's question about Ireland having a different model of neutrality to that of Sweden, I do not know what the Swedish model is. However, a UN resolution is not a legal requirement for the Swedes to deploy troops abroad. However, I understand it is a political requirement. The Swedes would be very slow to deploy troops on a foreign adventure without the sanction of the United Nations.Deputy Sherlock raises a good point about international pressure. If we are in a situation whereby a battle group is ready to go and the United Nations resolution has not been passed, will we be under pressure in terms of the battle group not being able to operate because we cannot go? That is precisely why, in the discussions in Oslo on putting together these multinational battle groups, there will be built-in redundancy. There will be provisions to cover a situation whereby one or more participants in the multinational battle group cannot participate for one reason or another. That will be an essential feature of multinational battle groups. Otherwise the situation envisaged by Deputy Sherlock would arise.We have a situation whereby there is a fixed number of troops, a fixed number of countries with a fixed contribution to a particular battle group. We might contribute perhaps only 20 explosives and ordnance personnel. The UN resolution might not have been passed, everything is ready and people are about to be slaughtered, but the battle group will not be able to move because we cannot send our 20 people owing to the lack of the UN resolution. Such a situation would apply tremendous pressure and compromise the integrity of national decision-making. That is why there will be a built-in redundancy provision so that someone else can step in during such a situation.Deputy Sherlock also asked about our neutrality. That will not be compromised in any way. Traditionally, Ireland participated in international peacekeeping missions in the traditional way whereby the United Nations contacts various countries and deploys a group. Recently, the United Nations has been contracting out work to the EU or the Organisation of African States, for example. The deployment of battle groups is simply an extension of that. Various situations have arisen in recent times where, collectively, civilised countries have not been able to act quickly to prevent slaughter and massacre and to save people's lives. The battle group concept exists to meet that type of situation.Ireland will look at each case. The battle groups are designed to carry out the Petersberg Tasks. If we think that any battle group of which we are part is being asked to do anything which constitutes common defence, going to war or anything of that nature, we will not participate. It will be decided case by case and within the terms of Bunreacht na hÉireann which specifically prohibits us from becoming engaged in common or neutral defence.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	222	Following a number of questions in the Dáil on this matter, including some from Deputy Finian McGrath, I undertook to have the military archive examined in relation to the Niemba ambush and to revert with the findings.The question arising was whether Trooper Browne was killed at the Niemba ambush or survived for a few days and was killed near a village where he was foraging for food. A recently published book, The Irish Army in the Congo 1960-1964: The Far Battalions, outlines the second version and draws on material from the unit history for its account. This differs from the long held understanding that nine members of the Defence Forces died at Niemba.Accordingly, I requested the military authorities to examine the relevant files and they have returned with the following information. The unit history referred to, which was written six years after the event, holds many differing accounts of how Trooper Browne met his untimely death and does not attempt to reconcile them. It includes an account that Trooper Browne survived past the initial action for two days and was killed approximately three miles from the site of the action. However, this information was not included in the Dáil replies because, I am informed, it is not supported by any independent sources.In November 1961 the Tribunal de Première Instance d'Elizabethville convicted five Baluba tribesmen of killing Trooper Browne and eight others on 8 November 1960. Information from Baluba survivors in Manona hospital in 1960 led investigators to believe Trooper Browne was killed at Niemba and his body had been removed from the scene by the ambushers. It was a Baluba custom to bear away from the field of battle their most courageous victim. It was decided that, on the balance of probability, Trooper Browne died on the battlefield in an attempt to save his comrades' lives. What remains incontrovertible is that Trooper Browne died, directly or indirectly, as a result of the Niemba engagement.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I thank the Minister for his response and commend the work of the Irish troops serving with the United Nations, particularly their role in dangerous global conflicts.The Minister's contention that Trooper Browne died at Niemba is disputed by two survivors of the massacre and the officer in charge of the search party, which failed to find Browne in November 1960. Have the Minister's officials made any attempt to contact the two Niemba survivors, Mr. Joe Fitzpatrick and Mr. Tom Kenny, to ascertain their opinions? If not, why is that the case?The Minister stated Trooper Browne's body was removed from the scene and added it was a Baluba custom to "bear away from the field of battle their most courageous victim". This is incorrect. A retired Swedish army officer who worked as an interpreter at Niemba for the Army stated there were some pictures of mutilated bodies but, in all cases, the remains were left on the spot and it was quite unlikely the Balubas would carry away a whole body, as it was more normal to take away body parts for medicine, strength and eating.In light of the disparity of opinion on the Niemba controversy, will the Minister commission an independent assessment of the known facts rather than an Army inquiry in the interests of historical accuracy? Will the Minister and his officials revisit the book The Irish Army in the Congo 1960-1964: The Far Battalions by Mr. David O’Donoghue? They should study this book carefully as the strong evidence therein must be examined by an independent person to bring closure for the families involved.

The Army has done so and I have outlined the reply it communicated to me. I cannot answer the Deputy's question on whether the Army spoke specifically with the two survivors but I will check and return to the Deputy on the matter.I am not an expert on Baluba customs but have informed Deputy Finian McGrath of what I have been told. It is the understanding of people who are more familiar with these issues than I that the Balubas carry away the body of the most courageous opposing warrior. I do not know whether it is the tradition to carry part of the body only.Before we commit ourselves to an independent investigation or the like I will accept the Deputy's suggestion to have the relevant people in the Army revisit the matter to specifically deal with the points he raised, including speaking to the two survivors. If Deputy Finian McGrath wishes, I will return to him on the matter in writing.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	229	The levels of female membership of units of the Permanent Defence Force, as advised by the military authorities are provided in the form of the following tabular statement.There are currently 528 female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force. The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, namely, the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and Reserve Defence Force, and the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. This means women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses and promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, my predecessor decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 162.5 cm, or 5 ft. 4 in. This height requirement also applies to male recruits. The Defence Forces actively encourage female applicants, for example, by advertising, recruitment fairs and school visits. Where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis. Stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel. When the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at mixed or all female schools, every effort is made to provide a female speaker. The number of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 244 at the end of 1997 to 528 at present. This constitutes an increase of more than 100% in the number of females serving over this period.On 5 August 2005 I wrote to the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and a number of outside organisations seeking their views and recommendations as to how more women might be encouraged to enlist in the Defence Forces. All of their replies have been received, the last on 17 January 2006, and are being examined in my Department in order to proceed to the next phase of the operation.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I propose that officials, both civil and military, of the Department of Defence will meet representatives of each of the organisations that made submissions, the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association, PDFORRA. These meetings will consider ideas and suggestions and explore possible improvements or changes to the programme of recruitment to encourage more females to join the Defence Forces.BRIGADEUNITTOTALDFHQDFHQ71 SOUTHERN BDE1 BDE MP COY31 CAV SQN51 FD ARTY REGT101 FD CIS COY91 FD ENG COY31 LOGS SP BN141 S BDE HQ1012 INF BN233 INF BN1031 RES FD CIS COY14 INF BN29KILWORTH CAMP1NO 1 SCTY COY1TOTAL 1 SOUTHERN BDE1192 EASTERN BDE2 BDE MP COY52 CAV SQN102 E BDE HQ32 FD ARTY REGT62 FD CIS COY22 FD ENG COY12 INF BN122 LOGS SP BN927 INF BN185 INF BN11DFHQ CIS COY4DFSM6EQUIT SCH12LOGS BASE HOSPITAL12MC KEE BKS COY11TOTAL 2 EASTERN BDE1224 WESTERN BDE1 INF BN1628 INF BN94 BDE MP COY14 BDE TRG CENTRE34 CAV SQN34 FD ARTY REGT74 FD CIS COY74 FD ENGR COY14 LOGS SP BN124 W BDE HQ96 INF BN20USAC1TOTAL 4 WESTERN BRIGADE89DFTC1 AMD CAV SQN53 INF BN9AD REGT10CSC6CSSC13DFTC HQ8DFTC FCA HQ1DFTC MP COY7LBC7MIL23SSU20TOTAL DFTC109AIR CORPSAC CIS SQN2AC COLLEGE4AC HQ2NO 1 OPS WING8NO 3 OPS WING2NO 4 SP WING2NO 5 SP WING3TOTAL AIR CORPS23NAVAL SERVICEFLOTILLA — LE AISLING3FLOTILLA — LE AOIFE2FLOTILLA — LE EITHNE6FLOTILLA — LE EMER3FLOTILLA — LE NIAMH5FLOTILLA — LE ROISIN4FLOTILLA — RELIEF POOL1GEN LIST NS2NS COL13NS HQ1NS OPS COMD10NS SP COMD9TOTAL NAVAL SERVICE59

The former Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, reduced the requirement from 5 ft. 5 in. to 5 ft. 4 in. but he also reduced the requirement for males to the same height. The Defence Forces have put forward the case that a certain height requirement is needed for carrying loads but there is no scientific evidence on which to base this requirement. I am sure some of our top international male and female weight-lifters are shorter than 5 ft. 4 in. The Minister should examine the research on the body mass index carried out in his constituency in the former Thomond College.Does the Minister agree the average height of women is less than that of men? If the entry requirement is 5 ft. 4 in. for both genders, it discriminates against women as a far greater percentage of women than men cannot apply for the Defence Forces. Does the Minister understand my point? He has a mathematical brain and it should not be a difficult issue to grasp.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I plan to discuss the contents of the reports with my officials, the Army and the representative organisations RACO and PDFORRA. I have no problem with publishing their contents at that stage. I expect the discussions to take place shortly.The internal debate on the medical barrier to further reducing the height requirements for female applicants continues. As Deputy Timmins states, medical evidence suggests it would be dangerous for people of a lesser height to engage in this type of work. I have asked the Army to examine the latest scientific findings, re-evaluate the situation and consider the type of tasks members of the Army would be asked to undertake. This may allow us to overcome this difficulty. Men tend to be taller than women but the number of women who join the Army is in proportion to the number of applicants.How can we encourage more women to apply? Women constitute approximately 5% of the Irish Permanent Defence Force compared to 9% in the United Kingdom, 14% in the United States and 13% in Sweden and France. We must increase the Irish figure. I recognise that the height requirement is a barrier to women joining. I have asked the Army to report to me on how the workload may be altered to accommodate more women if findings do not change.

His death was the subject of a UN board of inquiry and an Irish contingent board of inquiry as well as a military police investigation. The coroner for north-west Donegal also held an inquest into the death of Private Barrett from 5 to 8 September 2005. The jury in the inquest returned an open verdict.I met Mrs. Barrett, who was accompanied by her solicitor, on 4 October 2005. During my meeting with Mrs. Barrett I gave her an undertaking to have the interaction between my Department and the Defence Forces and her and Private Barrett's family reviewed by an independent person.On 28 October 2005 I appointed Mr. Sean Hurley to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death. I received his report on 2 February 2006.Mr. Hurley has conducted a thorough inquiry and has provided a detailed and frank report. It is clear and concise and covers the issues raised with me by Kevin Barrett's family. Mr. Hurley examined how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin Barrett's death and identified some clear failings and shortcomings. Copies of the review were provided to the Barrett family and its legal advisers on 3 February 2006, and the full report was published on my Department's website on 6 February 2006.I accept the recommendations and conclusions contained in the report and I assure the Barrett family that I will act on these. Important lessons have been learnt for the future and errors that have occurred in the handling of this tragic case, outlined by Mr. Hurley, must never be repeated. Mr. Hurley acknowledges that some of these have since been addressed in the new Guidelines for Dealing with Bereaved Families introduced by the Defence Forces in 2001. These guidelines will be reviewed to include Mr. Hurley's recommendations.On receipt of Mr. Hurley's report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide for me his views on any possible assistance the Garda Síochána could provide. A Garda officer has since been assigned to the case and is examining my Department's files and the Defence Forces files on the case to determine whether the Garda Síochána can provide assistance in the matter.I repeat my apology to the Barrett family for the pain and suffering they endured following Kevin's tragic death.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	233	The Minister's reply is somewhat disappointing as I had hoped it would be more positive. Mr. Hurley's report made some clear, specific recommendations on what should happen next. Will the Minister state whether Mr. Hurley's recommendations are being implemented? Mr. Hurley's report is damning and raises serious questions on the manner in which the Defence Forces operate. The Minister must show leadership by immediately establishing a new investigation, which the Barrett family has campaigned for. Mr. Hurley's report vindicates this campaign.The report covered the manner in which the Department treated the Barrett family. The Minister has met the family and many questions remain unanswered about the manner of the death, the way in which the body was treated after the death and the reason an open verdict was returned in the original investigation. The Barrett family has had no closure on the death and I ask the Minister to make every effort to have these issues addressed.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Concerning Deputy Sherlock's first question, it is my intention to implement the recommendations in the Hurley report. The majority of the report concerns the interaction between the family, the Department and the Army. Some improvements had been made since 2001 but Mr. Hurley recommends further changes and these will be implemented. I discussed these with the Chief of Staff as recently as today.Regarding Mr. Hurley's recommendations for an investigation, it was concluded that the original investigation was incomplete and that there was probably room for a further investigation. He did not state that a Garda investigation or a military court of inquiry was the appropriate method of investigation. A number of options were suggested.My preference, and that of the family, would be for a Garda investigation. A Garda superintendent is examining files to assess whether a Garda investigation is warranted. I spoke to the Garda Commissioner and I await the recommendations of the superintendent before deciding on the format of the investigation.I agree the Barrett family has had no closure and it is a matter of continuing trauma. I spoke to Mrs. Barrett today and arranged to meet her following my return from Liberia. At that stage I expect to have the Garda findings.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Is the Minister prepared for a new investigation into this matter?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Yes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	237	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6, 52 and 166 together.The Easter Rising of 1916 will be commemorated by a military parade in Dublin on Sunday, 16 April 2006. Preparations for the parade, as announced by the Taoiseach last October, are being made by the Defence Forces. Approximately 2,500 personnel representing all branches of the forces together with representatives of ex-service personnel and veterans of UN service will be included. The parade will also include members of the Garda Síochána, representing their service abroad with the United Nations. A fly-past by the Aer Corps is also envisaged.The parade will depart from Dublin Castle and will pass through Dame Street, College Green and O'Connell Street. There will be a reading of the proclamation outside the GPO and appropriate military honours will be rendered. The event will be televised live and it will be possible to view the parade along the route from Dublin Castle to O'Connell Street. I will be present on the viewing stand at the GPO.This 90th anniversary of the Easter Rising will also be marked by a wreath-laying ceremony in Kilmainham Gaol earlier that morning and by a Government reception at Dublin Castle that evening. Officials of my Department and officers of the Defence Forces are represented on an interdepartmental working group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, which is overseeing all the logistical arrangements for the parade and associated events. This group is meeting regularly and includes, inter alia, representatives from the Garda Síochána, Dublin City Council, the fire services and the Office of Public Works. Many logistical issues such as the parade route, road closures, health and safety regulations and publicity must be addressed and the group is dealing with these issues.The group is also dealing with the issue of invitations to the viewing stands outside the GPO. The invitations being issued for the ceremonies this year include the relatives of the 1916 leaders and volunteers who were killed in action in 1916 based on the list used for the annual Arbour Hill commemoration.As the House can appreciate, there are space limitations in O'Connell Street which restrict the number of places on the reviewing stand to approximately 900 people. Provision must be made for the categories which normally, in part or in whole, make up the invitation lists for State events. These include the Government, the Council of State, Deputies, Senators, the Judiciary, the diplomatic corps, semi-State organisations, social partners, national cultural and sporting organisations and the universities.On the invitation of the Taoiseach, all parties in the Oireachtas have nominated spokespersons to offer advice on the appropriate scope and content of a 1916 centenary commemoration committee to be put in place in coming years. I understand that the first meeting of this group will take place next week.

Does the Minister agree that a central part of the preparations and celebrations should be to take the 1916 Proclamation as a yardstick of how we have progressed as a nation? Does the Minister believe that this Government guarantees the equal rights and equal opportunities of all of its citizens? Does he believe this Government cherishes all of the children of the nation equally?How does he think the men and women of 1916 would feel about our Taoiseach, who spends €550 a week on make up? That is more than the average industrial wage.

That was my question. I am somewhat surprised and relieved, given the Minister's past performance. I expected that he would lead our Defence Forces up O'Connell Street, perhaps brandishing a pistol, pointing it at the cameras——

Will the Minister state why the committee has not met to date, despite many promises? Many of my colleagues were told the committee would meet. There has been no such meeting.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	259	The question was about the organisation of the 1916 celebrations and I intend to confine my reply to that matter specifically. I outlined already to Deputy Gormley those who will march in the parade. It will be Defence Forces, ex-servicemen, United Nations veterans and members of the police in recognition of their service abroad. As I do not fall into any of those categories, ipso facto I will not march.The other matters are completely beside the point. Regarding the question on why the committee has not met, I attempted to organise a meeting this week. Representatives of Sinn Féin, the Technical Group and Fine Gael were all prepared to accommodate it. Unfortunately, the Labour Party's nominated person, Deputy McManus, was not available. She thought the notice was too short and that is fine. We will arrange the meeting for next week.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	260	Briefly, regarding Question No. 52, I did not catch the statement which the Minister made. Has the inaugural meeting of the planning group involving representatives of the Houses of the Oireachtas taken place? If not, why not?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I stated that I tried to organise it for this week but due to the Labour Party's spokesperson being unavailable, for understandable reasons, it will take place next week instead.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	262	I welcome the concept and plan to commemorate 1916. Does the Minister agree that part of the celebrations and commemorations should include all political persuasions, inside and outside the House, and ensure that all traditions and all religions, including Catholic, Protestant and dissenter, are involved in the celebration? Does the Minister agree that Independent Deputies and members of the Technical Group will also have an important role to play on this committee?Does the Minister accept that successive Governments have turned their backs on the 1916 commemoration during the past 30 years? This is sad for our country and nation, when compared with the celebrations in France and Independence Day in the United States. We should celebrate it, particularly with regard to issues of equality.Part of any celebration or commemoration, especially in light of the teachings of James Connolly, should be programmes, projects and investment targeted at the most disadvantaged of our society. That would be a true commemoration of the men and women of 1916.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	263	I am sure people of all persuasions and religious beliefs and none will be able to join in celebrating the sacrifice of the men of 1916. In so far as celebrating the other traditions, we will also have a commemoration for the people who died in the battle of the Somme in the first week of July. The Government will be represented on the annual national remembrance day as usual. I agree with Deputy McGrath that Independent Deputies and their representatives have an important part to play. That is why the Taoiseach decided they should be part of the steering committee. I look forward to hearing their contributions.I do not agree with the Deputy that successive Governments turned their backs on the situation for the past 30 years. It was an annual event until 1971, when the Government decided to discontinue it because of the difficulties in Northern Ireland. I take the Deputy's point about France and the United States. However, they did not have a similar situation to what we had in 1971. I was not involved in politics at the time. I understand the Government was advised that it was inappropriate to celebrate 1916 with a military parade at a time when part of this country was engaged in major strife. We have decided to revive the tradition and I am glad of that.Regarding focusing on disadvantage and wider cultural events, Deputy McGrath or his representative on the steering group will be able to input. We are reviving a tradition and a ceremony that took place up to 1971, which was a one-day operation involving a military parade followed by a reception in recognition of the people who participated and their relatives. What Deputy McGrath mentioned is appropriate. However, it is more appropriate to the centenary celebrations, which will be a major event and will continue for more than one day. We look forward to hearing the Deputy's contributions in the committee.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	264	I agree that the 90th anniversary of the 1916 Rising should be marked. The Minister's party probably discovered how many people watched its Ard-Fheis through the number of people who immediately afterwards picked up on the announcement. When I heard it I was concerned that it would be just a military parade. That would have reflected only an element. The fundamental reason it should be celebrated is not the event itself, but why it took place.My grandparents took part in the Rising in the Four Courts, and I have done some research into my family history. I would like to see more done in the context of a solid archive rather than a military history. There is substantially more that could be done. If one wants to find out about people who participated in the Rising, one must go to approximately six or seven different locations, including the archives in Kew, outside London. The material held there would be more appropriately held in this country so people in the lower echelons can find out about the Rising without having to travel to the UK.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for her support and I take her point. As it is unfortunately only a one-day event the military parade will be the centrepiece. Other events will include the wreath-laying ceremony at Kilmainham Gaol. There will also be an opportunity for a social occasion in the afternoon for invitees and relatives of those who participated. We will meet them and they will be invited to the State reception in Dublin Castle that evening. Other events not necessarily on the day will include the moving of The Asgard to the National Museum, the unveiling of a plaque in the Garden of Remembrance to people who died in United Nations service and the production of commemorative stamps both for the Battle of the Somme and the 1916 Rising. I take the Deputy’s point about the archives and the difficulty of research. It is a good point and has been mentioned to me before. I have asked my officials to look at it and will renew my conversation with them in light of the Deputy raising it. If she wishes I will write to her about it in the coming weeks.

It is inappropriate that it be just a military parade. It is a pity civic society is not being encouraged to be involved in the 90th anniversary. Hopefully steps will be taken as we go towards the 100th anniversary to ensure civic society in all its forms will be involved. When does the Minister intend to produce a list of the events the State is organising for the 90th anniversary? It is just over a month away and the Minister does not know all the details, which is a pity from the perspective of getting society involved. People have full diaries. Hopefully in the next few years the event will go beyond the single day and a military parade. That was fine in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s but when we can have huge parades involving civic society on St. Patrick's Day we should ensure something similar or bigger is held on future anniversaries of the Rising.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I take the Deputy's point. I cannot announce all the events because there is a window of opportunity in the afternoon of the day itself. The parade will take place in the morning followed by a reading of the Proclamation of the Irish Republic outside the GPO. At approximately 7 p.m. there will be a State banquet in Dublin Castle. We had envisaged Government members meeting relatives of the survivors in a social setting.

I would have been available to attend today's meeting of the centenary committee. I understand the Minister is chairman of that committee. The centenary is almost ten years away. Perhaps we could put the centenary committee back a few weeks until after Easter lest there be any confusion. The Government has organised the events for the 90th anniversary. While there is a certain urgency on the part of the Department of the Taoiseach to have a meeting, we have waited 90 years and another three or four weeks will not matter. The Minster will be away next week. It might suit to hold the meeting after the 90th anniversary celebration lest the centenary committee take the blame for the contention associated with this year's celebrations. Are any of the people who were in the GPO in 1916 still alive? I know the half-brother of one of them is still alive.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	275	We want to give the committee representatives an input into the immediate event. They may come up with some useful suggestions for the afternoon rather than the high-society event. Next week I have a meeting with the President of Liberia and have to visit our troops there and see the situation. People from the Taoiseach's office will chair the backup committee and I will be ably represented at that meeting by my intelligent and versatile colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche. I do not know whether anybody who was in the GPO in 1916 is still alive.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Will the committee include representatives of all the parties?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	277	Yes it will include representative of the Labour Party, Fine Gael, the Technical Group and Sinn Féin. I thank everybody, Deputies Ó Snodaigh and Timmins, representatives of the Technical Group and Deputy Gregory who kindly agreed to change their schedules to be available today. Unfortunately Deputy McManus was not available so I did not want to go ahead in her absence.

#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	284	I welcome the return of the parade. As there is a full day's celebration planned does the Minister feel it would be fitting that the principles and aspirations of equality of opportunity and cherishing all the children of the nation equally for which the men of 1916 fought, and as outlined in the Proclamation, would have a central and fitting role in the one-day 90th anniversary celebration? I am sure the committee will examine this issue in greater detail for the 100th anniversary. To have a solely military approach to the 90th anniversary is wrong and does not commemorate in a fitting way what the men and women of 1916 fought for. Would the Minister look for some way that this aspect of the heroism of those people could be commemorated to make it a fitting 90th anniversary celebration?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	285	We are reviving what went before until 1971, an annual celebration the centrepiece of which was a military parade. We have the chance to change it. On the Deputy's suggestion that we do something in addition to the military parade to commemorate the principles underlying the Proclamation, I am open to suggestions. We have a window of opportunity in the afternoon after the military parade and before the State reception. I am open to practical suggestions on how that can be done.

How does the Minister feel that the Ireland of today measures up to those ideas? Does the Minister think — this is a genuine question — that the men and women of 1916 would be happy if they were to see the Ireland of today?

If the Deputy has a practical suggestion to make on how we should commemorate those principles, I will be quite prepared to listen to it. He can make suggestions either directly to me or through the committee.If the 1916 men were to come back today and see the wonderful and terrific strides we have made over the years, they would be proud to see we are one of the wealthiest countries in Europe. We are a country that cherishes all the children of the nation.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 23 and 69 together.Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the cadetship competition, apprenticeship competition, general service enlistment or direct entry competitions that are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments. All applicants for each of these entry streams are required to meet qualifying criteria.The question of the recruitment of foreign nationals to the Defence Forces is not a new one. Defence Force regulations have always allowed for the recruitment of ethnic minorities and foreign nationals to the Defence Forces. However, the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are not directly comparable. My Department is not specifically targeting the recruitment of ethnic minorities for the Defence Forces at present. Current emphasis is on ensuring that there are no barriers to ethnic minorities or foreign nationals joining the Defence Forces. I have recently made changes to the cadet competition to broaden the entry criteria, thereby making it easier for qualifying foreign nationals to apply for cadetships.In addition the Defence Forces equality policy, which was recently produced and formalised, underpins equality legislation. The policy states that the Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in all employment policies, procedures and regulations and will operate in an environment without discrimination in areas provided for by the Equality Acts. The policy also ensures that the principles of employment equality are employed in recruitment, promotion, training and work experience. All regulations and administrative instructions concerning service in the Defence Forces will be set out in a manner consistent with the equal opportunity policy, which will be reviewed with the Defence Force regulations on an ongoing basis by the Deputy chief of staff — support — to ensure compliance with best practice and to maintain a working environment in which all members of the Defence Forces are treated in a manner consistent with equal opportunities.At the moment the primary focus in recruitment is to attract people with the core competencies required by the Defence Forces. Any specialist linguistic skills or cultural knowledge requirements identified by the chief of staff can be addressed through recruitment or through personnel development. My Department and the Defence Forces are fully committed to ensuring that all who wish to join the Defence Forces, including ethnic minorities and foreign nationals, are given the opportunity to do so.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The need for the Defence Forces to encourage recruitment among non-nationals is urgent. The Minister has not given us any idea of what efforts are being made to do that. The efforts in this regard by the Defence Forces must be contrasted with those of the Garda Síochána, which has a make-up that is much more representative of modern Ireland. There is an obligation on the Defence Forces to follow suit. Will the Minister therefore increase the embryonic diversification campaign that has begun to make the Defence Forces much more ethnically representative? What practical steps is he taking in that regard.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	294	As I said, our emphasis at the moment is to prevent people of foreign and ethnic origin from being discriminated against when they apply to join the Defence Forces. I take Deputy Sherlock's point about the efforts being made by the Garda Síochána, but the Garda is a different type of organisation from the Defence Forces. Whereas we need gardaí who can relate to people in ethnic communities, who can speak their language and know their customs, the same considerations do not apply to the Army. If, as occasionally happens, the Army needs people with certain language skills and knowledge of certain cultures, that is an operational matter for the chief of staff. He has assured me that the Army can get all the people it needs in that regard through the ordinary recruitment process.I take on board what the Garda has done, but the Army faces a different situation. The development of a multi-ethnic society presents challenges for us all, including the Defence Forces. For the moment, we will observe what lessons can be learned from the policies that the Garda Síochána is pursuing. However, I am advised by those who have operational charge for such matters that there is currently no need for a specific recruitment campaign to increase the percentage of non-nationals in the Army.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 8, 14 and 39 together.The Government task force on emergency planning has worked since it was set up in 2001 to co-ordinate emergency planning and response arrangements across the Departments that would lead and support the State's response in an emergency. The task force continues to meet regularly, most recently on Wednesday, 8 February, which was two weeks ago today. The membership of the task force includes Ministers, senior departmental officials, senior officers of the Defence Forces and Garda Síochána and officials of other key public authorities who have a lead or support role in Government emergency planning.The Department of Agriculture and Food is represented on the task force, which it has briefed on avian flu developments most recently on 8 February. This issue is now a standing item on the task force's agenda and the situation will continue to be monitored and reviewed at future meetings. My colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, who is responsible for dealing with the threat posed by an outbreak of avian flu, has introduced a range of measures aimed at minimising the risk of the virus being introduced to Ireland. Both she and her Department are keeping their contingency arrangements under constant review and refining them as necessary. Her Department's approach is informed by the most up-to-date scientific and veterinary advice available. Only last week the Minister appointed an expert advisory group to advise her as to the adequacy of the control measures in place.The task force meeting on 8 February was also briefed by a representative of the Department of Health and Children on the plans being put in place to deal with any possible influenza pandemic. My colleague with lead responsibility in this area, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, is addressing the various issues that may arise. A detailed plan for response to an influenza pandemic was prepared in 2004. This plan is being updated to reflect the most up-to-date advice of the influenza pandemic expert group and the World Health Organisation. An interdepartmental standing committee chaired by the Department of Health and Children will meet on 27 February to consider the many cross-cutting issues that may arise.The Government task force on emergency planning will continue to be briefed and updated on these matters and on related emergency planning issues on a regular and ongoing basis.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Is the Minister aware of Tom Clonan's recent study, which suggested that if a Stardust incident were to recur the city's accident and emergency units would be full within 20 minutes and would find difficulty in coping? Tom Clonan has carried out a number of studies indicating we would be unable to deal with a major emergency. Will the Minister comment on that?For a possible flu pandemic, is the Minister satisfied that we have sufficient stocks of antivirals for members of the Defence Forces, who would obviously be on the front line in dealing with such an emergency?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I am familiar with the work to which Deputy Gormley referred but I do not agree with that conclusion. We have a detailed twofold plan that specifies how the various aspects of the public would deal with a specific emergency and provides a number of specific disease-related plans for dealing with an outbreak of pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, smallpox and so on. Therefore, I am confident we would be able to deal with that. Mr. Tom Clonan, for whom I have great regard is not accurate in that assessment. On the possible outbreak of an influenza pandemic, the answer is that I am satisfied. The position with anti-virals is that the Government has decided we need sufficient stocks to cater for about 25% of the population initially. That would be about a million shots. We have 600,000 already and are expecting delivery of another 400,000. There is a pharmaceutical ingredient called oseltamivir phosphate powder, which is designed to treat children between the ages of one and five. We are awaiting delivery of a substantial consignment. It has been agreed that additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza, should be stockpiled. Arrangements for the purchases of this additional stock are being finalised. The timeframe for delivery is under discussion with the suppliers.

I have grave reservations, however, about an immediate or sudden crisis. To give one example, on 13 February on the M50 there was a crash involving a couple of trucks. Fortunately no one was fatally injured but the whole motorway closed for a few hours. I do not know whether the Minister's emergency task force will look at something like that. If not, will he say why it took so long for a helicopter to get into the air to try to start diverting traffic?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	299	I am not familiar with that specific incident, though I can make inquiries. One thing I have emphasised strongly for the emergency task force, which it does now on a regular basis as people such as Mr. Tom Clonan acknowledge, is that it conducts exercises. There have been quite a number involving crashes and pile-ups, train and car crashes etc. We saw the emergency services in action in the tragic situation in County Meath where a number of school children were killed and injured. Everybody agrees, including the parents of those children to whom I spoke on the day I went there, that the emergency services worked very well in practice. However, the job of the emergency task force is to continue to refine and develop its response to an emergency. To do that properly, as Mr. Clonan has pointed out and I agree, we have to conduct regular exercises. We have conducted exercises on nuclear fall-out and various other matters. One of the main types of exercise we conduct, however, is related to the fall-out from a crash, whether a road accident, train crash or whatever. We are continually exercising in that regard. I do not know what happened, as regards the incident to which Deputy Timmins referred.

A report has shown that a helicopter medical service that is available on a North-South basis is essential. It would mean such a helicopter would be available together with a fully staffed crew, in effect a flying intensive care unit comprising doctor, medic etc., to go to the location of an accident. I agree that new helicopters are being brought on board. However, if those helicopters have a multitude of tasks to do, they will not be available when they are needed in such an emergency and lives will be lost. Lives have been lost and I can give the Minister the figures to prove that. Also, the equipment they carry reflects their multipurpose role, so they are not capable of doing the job that should be done. Lives have been lost, accordingly. Will the Minister comment on that because the helicopters he has are not dedicated and have many other jobs to do? As a result there are many incidences where people died on the side of the road because the proper stretchers were not available and so on. These are matters of public record. Does the Minister agree we need a dedicated helicopter emergency medical service?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	303	My information is that the air rescue service is working very well. I am not aware of any instances, especially, where people died because of any fault or slowness in the services. When we were operating a helicopter rescue service using Army aircraft rather than the current arrangement, we ran out of capacity to provide a full 24-hour service because of industrial action — the Air Corps version of blue 'flu. Because of that we had to change that system. I am told the new system is working very well. If Deputy Cowley has particular examples where he believes people suffered further injury or even death, as a result of helicopters not being available in time, I invite him to communicate them to me, privately.

The Beaumont study has shown that it can be up to 12 hours before a helicopter comes and people have died. A young lad from the west with head injuries after a road traffic accident died because of a delay in transferring him to Beaumont Hospital in Dublin. A tourist died on the side of the road because a helicopter was delayed in arriving at the scene. There are many examples I will be pleased to give the Minister.

#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am grateful to the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with the opportunity to raise this very important matter.We all agree breast cancer is a terrible killer. There is no known way to prevent it. However, it is very treatable if detected early, according to the BreastCheck website. Unfortunately, health apartheid exists here, where half the population has had a service since 2000. The death rate from cancer can be cut by 20% to 30% by breast screening women aged 50 to 64. This has happened in Northern Ireland where between 1994 and 2000 the breast cancer rate fell by 20%. The same has happened in Scotland, the USA and all over Europe except for the south and west of Ireland. I have been spearheading a campaign for the national extension of BreastCheck for some years now.Some 700 women die from breast cancer every year. About 100 need not have died, but did, in the south and west. The figure is at least 65, but due to the 30% factor, it is more than that — because of the negligence of Government to extend BreastCheck nationally. Based on those figures more than 300 women will die before BreastCheck is extended to the south and west. It is a national scandal. Today in the newspaper, Professor Michael Kerin, who previously directed the BreastCheck service, but who now works at University College Hospital, Galway, says that one in five women with cancer on the east coast have had mastectomies — he previously worked at the Mater hospital in Dublin. However one in every two women in the west has a mastectomy, and that is a disgrace.In my maiden speech in the Dáil in 2002 I spoke of the need for BreastCheck. In February 2003 I arranged for the BreastCheck board and executive to appear before the Joint Committee on Health and Children. On 28 March 2003, together with the cancer campaigner, Ms Jane Bailey, I organised a march on the Dáil for the national extension of BreastCheck. The national extension of the programme was announced within 48 hours of the march, but we are still waiting for it. Professor Kerin is scandalised. He says the lack of a free screening service means that many women in the west have advanced disease by the time the cancer is diagnosed. The lump is much bigger. I know families where loved ones have died because of the lack of BreastCheck and it is a terrible tragedy. Exactly 296 women have died already since 2000 because of the lack of BreastCheck. Another 260 will definitely die in the south and west. It need not be like this, however. Why does the Government not do something about it?On 11 February 2003, the Galway Clinic offered a BreastCheck service to the Government. If this offer had been accepted, 195 women who are now dead would be alive today. Their families would still have their mothers, aunts, nieces or grandmothers. The Government declined the offer because the clinic was offering a digital service, while the BreastCheck service was analogue. BreastCheck has now changed over to a digital service so there is no excuse to delay the extension of the programme.If a drug were discovered that could save the lives of 260 women, we would all want it to be made available. However, all that is needed in this case is money. It will be 2009 before all eligible women will be screened and the cycle completed even though BreastCheck will come on stream in 2007. Surely BreastCheck can be fast-tracked to ensure that the lives of at least some women can be saved. It would even be worthwhile making use of the service offered by the Galway Clinic or using the National Treatment Purchase Fund.In 2003, the chief executive officer of the Western Health Board, Dr. Sheila Ryan, stated it was unfair of any health board member to underestimate the Government's commitment to the BreastCheck programme. She stated she expected BreastCheck activities in the west and south to commence in mid-2005, but it is now 2006.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	309	I thank Deputy Cowley for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the opportunity this afternoon to set out the current position in respect of the BreastCheck programme and, in particular, to the extension of the programme to the remaining counties in the country.The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children met Professor Kerin last year in respect of the roll-out of BreastCheck and the need to commence it as soon as possible. BreastCheck has advised the Department of Health and Children that an exact date for the commencement of screening will be announced during 2006 following receipt of planning approval for the new assessment facilities required and as the staff recruitment process proceeds. BreastCheck is working to secure the earliest possible commencement of screening in 2007. Staff recruitment commenced on 18 November 2005. All the resources necessary to meet the timelines for the commencement of the roll-out have been made available.The national breast screening programme commenced in the eastern and midland regions in February 2000. Screening is offered free of charge to women in the 50 to 64 age group in these regions. The extension to the south east commenced in 2004, following the opening of a new €5 million dedicated screening unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Dublin. A mobile unit is now providing screening for women in Wexford. Screening commenced in Carlow recently and will be extended to County Kilkenny during this year. The expansion to the south-eastern counties will result in an additional 18,000 women being invited for screening.Planning is under way for the roll-out of the screening programme to the remaining regions in the country. The Department's letter of determination to BreastCheck for 2006 provides for an allocation of €13.693 million. This includes revenue funding of €2.3 million to, inter alia, provide for the recruitment and training of staff to commence the national roll-out of the screening programme in 2007. An additional €200,000 is being made available for improvements in radiographer ratios in the regions covered by the current programme. Late last year, a once-off capital grant of €500,000 was made available to purchase new digital mammography machines as part of BreastCheck’s replacement programme of analogue equipment. An additional once off capital grant of €280,000 was also made available to upgrade information technology equipment.The national roll-out of the BreastCheck programme to remaining counties is a major priority in the development of cancer services.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	311	The expansion of this service will ensure that all women in the relevant age group throughout the country have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment where required. A capital investment of €21 million has been earmarked for the construction and equipping of two static clinical units, one at South Infirmary, Victoria Hospital, Cork and the other at University College Hospital, Galway. This investment will also ensure that mobile units are available to screen all women in the relevant age group throughout the country.The design process for the two new units is progressing. The applications for planning permission for both clinical units have been lodged with the relevant local authorities and decisions are expected in March. It is anticipated that the design process, including the preparation of tender documentation, will be completed by mid-2006. Following the selection of contractors, construction of the two units will commence. As I have said, BreastCheck is confident that the target date of 2007 for commencement of the roll-out will be met.Capital funding for the facilities at Cork and Galway has been identified under the capital investment framework 2005 to 2009 and both developments will be progressed simultaneously. Funding in the region of €3 million has also been earmarked for the relocation and development of the symptomatic breast disease unit at University College Hospital, Galway. This unit will be developed in tandem with the BreastCheck development.Since 1998, cumulative revenue funding of approximately €60 million and €12 million capital funding has been allocated to support the programme. Up until the end of December last year, the number of women screened by BreastCheck was in the region of 245,000. It is estimated that the cancer detection rate is approximately 6.7 per 1,000 screened and, to date, more than 1,639 cancers have been detected.

It has been the subject of several parliamentary questions over recent months.This case does not involve a prospective deportation but rather a transfer from this country to Belgium. The person in question, Jeannette Fampuma, is a native of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. She was subjected to severe and inhuman treatment in her native country approximately one year ago. She was raped, beaten and subjected to every kind of degrading treatment that could be meted out and is severely traumatised as a result. She has been refused refugee status and it has been determined by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Refugee Applications Commissioner that the best way forward is transfer her to Belgium.I do not agree that this is the best course of action. Her medical and physical condition is such that she should be treated here on humanitarian grounds. This is the medical advice of her doctor. She is under the care of her sister who is a qualified nurse and has been granted residency and works here. As a humanitarian, the Minister should examine her case and ensure that there is no repetition of what happened last week when four or five gardaí arrived at Ms Fampuma's sister's house looking for her while she was in hospital receiving life-saving treatment.There are many other courses of action open to the Minister other than attempting to enforce a transfer order in such a case. This woman's life has been endangered several times in the past. She has suffered incredible pain and trauma, which she is reliving. Her doctor has said that it would be criminal to remove her from hospital at the moment. I ask the Minister of State, who is a compassionate and caring person, to take the initiative and ensure she is allowed to remain in the country for the duration of whatever treatment is required, that we, as a caring and compassionate country with a good reputation, are seen to take this initiative without fear or favour, and that nobody else approaches her until she has regained full health.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	317	I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am replying on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I refer the House to the replies that the Minister gave to Questions Nos. 149, 181 and 249 on Thursday, 26 January 2006, Thursday, 9 February 2006 and Thursday, 16 February 2006, respectively, in respect of this case.As this case comes under the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation (Council Regulation) (EC) No. 343/2003, I should briefly explain the workings of the regulation. This is intended to prevent the phenomenon of so-called asylum shopping across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application. At the same time it guarantees applicants that one State will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of "refugees in orbit", a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, can, on the basis of the relevant criteria, request another state to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.The person concerned arrived in Ireland on 14 October 2005 and claimed asylum. Following investigation, it was determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, Belgium was the appropriate state to process her application as she had already made an earlier asylum claim there on 4 April 2005. She appealed this to the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal but the original determination to transfer was upheld. She was kept informed of developments throughout the course of her asylum application in Ireland and was made aware from the outset of the consequences of her case coming under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation. The applicant was informed in writing that it was open to her to make written representations to the commissioner before a determination was made on the possibility that her case might be examined under the Dublin II Regulation. Chapter 4 of the information leaflet for applicants for refugee status in Ireland refers. No representations were received.

#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	319	I will follow up the matter on the basis of what the Deputy has said. However, I am replying on behalf of the Minister.Belgium accepted responsibility for the case on 2 December 2005, and a transfer order was signed on 11 January 2006 requiring the person concerned to return to Belgium. The order issued to her on 16 January 2006, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, on Monday, 23 January 2006. She presented, as required, and was requested to present again on 26 January 2006, to make final arrangements for her flight to Belgium which had been booked for the following day, Friday, 27 January. However, she failed to present as required and is now classified as having evaded her transfer. The Belgian authorities have been notified and an extension of time of up to 18 months to effect the transfer has been sought in accordance with Article 19.4 of the regulation.In the meantime, her legal representative, the Refugee Legal Service, RLS, has been in correspondence with the Dublin II transfer unit of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform stating its client is in hospital and has submitted medical reports setting out the nature of her illness and the care she is receiving. The Minister is not disputing the medical reports presented by the RLS, but medical reasons alone are not criteria under the regulation for processing her asylum claim in Ireland.The Minister wishes me to repeat again that this person's transfer will be dealt with in a sympathetic and humane way and her medical needs will be made known, in advance, to the Belgian authorities. If necessary, medical escorts to accompany her on her transfer flight will be provided. The Minister is satisfied the Belgian health and social services are well capable of dealing with her medical needs.Belgium, and not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum application of the person concerned. Indeed, it is for the Belgian authorities to assess the protection needs, if any, of the person concerned. The Minister wishes to point out again that the applicant is not being removed to her home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo, but to Belgium, to have her claim considered there. Belgium, like Ireland, is a party to and thus bound by the same international obligations and human rights instruments prohibiting refoulement. The current development of a common EU asylum policy is predicated on the full and inclusive application by member states of the 1951 Geneva Convention relating to the status of refugees and its 1967 New York Protocol, thus maintaining the principle of non-refoulement. Council Regulation (EC) No. 432/2003 is based on this common policy and all regulation states are considered safe for returning third country nationals. The Minister is, therefore, satisfied that any protection needs arising in this case can be suitably dealt with by the Belgian authorities.Having regarded these considerations and the fact that Belgium is responsible under the Council regulation for the examination of her asylum application, the transfer cannot be deemed to give rise to refoulement. Any unnecessary delay in effecting her transfer to Belgium will only deny her the opportunity of an early examination of her asylum claim and the affording of international protection to her, if required.In summary, the person concerned made an earlier asylum application in Belgium on 4 April 2005. The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner has determined, and the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal has upheld an appeal, that Belgium is the country responsible for processing the application and Belgium has accepted its responsibilities for the case.

A young man was taken into Garda custody in Store Street Garda station on 2 June. He was taken from the station unconscious to the Mater Hospital on the same day. He was in a coma for a couple of months in that hospital, never regained consciousness and died.The Commissioner subsequently established an internal inquiry under Superintendent Oliver Hanley into the circumstances surrounding the death. Superintendent Hanley was a serving officer in Store Street Garda station for approximately 20 years prior to this date. The commissioner did not provide an independent external person to conduct the inquiry. The report of the superintendent has been produced and it has been sent to the Minister and the Director of Public Prosecutions. I received a reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 17 February to the effect that the Director of Public Prosecutions had considered the report and he did not propose to effect a prosecution in the matter.The next step is the coroner's inquest. A preliminary hearing took place last Friday and the matter will be dealt with again on 2 March. It will be impossible to move forward on 2 March because to date the Garda and the coroner have not produced documentation in this regard. The initial Garda report has not been provided and the final report conducted by the superintendent has not been provided to the solicitor of the family. No clothing or other items belonging to the deceased have been provided. It is scandalous the family of the deceased must go to court to get the items of clothing, have them forensically examined independently and get the Garda reports. When the coroner's inquest takes place, it will not be an inquiry in its own right because it just deals with the proximate circumstances, who died, when they died and where they died.One must examine the requirements under the law, particularly the requirements under the Constitution, which require that there would be an investigation under Articles 38 and 40 in regard to someone who died in circumstances of this nature, and under the European Convention on Human Rights, which we transposed into law in 2003. Article 2 requires that any death in State custody must be inquired into.There has been an internal Garda inquiry, which is not in any sense a neutral investigation. There will be a coroner's inquest, the scope and functions of which are extremely limited in terms of medical grounds, and there is no information so far as to how a young man in the prime of his life should have died so suddenly after his arrest. Under the Police Act 1924, the Minister established an inquiry into the Brian Rossiter case in Clonmel. This inquiry is under way and deals with the case of a young man of 14 years who died in a Garda cell in Clonmel. I expect the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider the establishment of a similar type of independent investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the death of Mr. Wheelock.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	323	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I am pleased to respond to the matters raised by the Deputy. Before doing so, however, the Minister has asked me to refer to the tragic human circumstances of this case. The late Mr. Terence Wheelock was found hanging in his cell in Store Street Garda station on 2 June 2005. He was removed to the Mater hospital where he died a little more than three months later. The Minister expresses his deepest sympathy to the Wheelock family for its loss following the death of this young man at the untimely age of 20. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam.A detective superintendent from outside the relevant Garda division was appointed immediately after the incident to carry out a detailed investigation into all the circumstances surrounding the arrest, detention and removal to hospital of Mr. Wheelock. The Minister requested the Garda authorities to furnish him with a report on the matter and a copy of the investigation file was received by him on 2 February 2006. That file was also submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions who issued instructions that no prosecution should ensue.According to this report, Mr. Wheelock, along with three others, was arrested at approximately 12.10 p.m. on 2 June 2005 in connection with the offence of unauthorised taking of a vehicle under section 112 of the Road Traffic Acts 1964 to 1994 and conveyed to Store Street Garda station. One of the others arrested was also conveyed to that station while the other two were conveyed to Mountjoy Garda station. Upon arrival, Mr. Wheelock was processed, subjected to a search and placed in a cell in accordance with standard procedures. A firm of solicitors nominated by him was contacted on his behalf.When checked shortly after 2 p.m., he was apparently alive and well. At approximately 2.40 p.m., however, he was found suspended by a ligature, which in turn was suspended from a permanent fixture in the cell, an alarm buzzer panel. The ligature used was the cord from the waist band of his tracksuit. He was taken down, cardio-pulmonary resuscitation was commenced and an ambulance was called. Notwithstanding these efforts, Mr. Wheelock died in the Mater hospital some three months later.The Wheelock family, through its solicitors, declined to co-operate with the Garda investigation and to allow access to Mr. Wheelock's medical records. Consequently, the Garda report was unable to countenance specific issues that might arise therefrom. It contains, however, 61 statements from members of the Garda Síochána, prisoners held in Store Street station at the same time and other relevant persons as well as a report from the chief State pathologist, Dr. Marie Cassidy.I understand an inquest into Mr. Wheelock's death opened on Friday, 17 February 2006 but has been adjourned until 2 March. An inquest is an independent inquiry to ascertain the cause of death and the coroner has statutory duties and powers, including the power to call witnesses, in regard to the holding of an inquest. He or she cannot consider questions of civil or criminal liability. The Minister will consider the matter further when the inquest has been completed and a verdict returned. At this stage, however, he is not disposed to make any further comment on this case.Every death arising from injuries occurring in Garda custody is a serious matter and I assure Deputies that it is taken seriously by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. There has not been a satisfactory and standardised mechanism in the past for dealing with issues of this type but the Minister has taken steps to address this. In future, the new Garda ombudsman commission will be obliged, under section 102(2) of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, to ensure there is an investigation into any matter that appears to indicate to it that the conduct of a member of the Garda Síochána may have resulted in the death of, or serious harm to, a person. Work is progressing apace on the establishment of the commission and the recent report of the Garda Síochána Act implementation review group, chaired by Senator Maurice Hayes, expresses satisfaction with the transitional arrangements for the establishment of the commission. A full copy of the group's report is available on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	324	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue and the Minister of State for responding. Since I became a Member of this House in 1997, I have consistently raised the need to upgrade the sewerage scheme in Adare, County Limerick. The development of the village and community is severely restricted by the condition of the sewerage scheme which is overloaded. There are great opportunities for residential and tourist development in the village but these are being frustrated and restricted. Any investors wishing to complete developments have been advised that the sewage disposal system prevents such investment.Adare is an extremely attractive village, perhaps the most beautiful in Ireland, but its vibrant tourism industry is being restricted. Any proposals to improve the tourist product of Adare and the opening up of further tourist attractions are being totally discouraged as promoters are advised that planning permission cannot be considered owing to the existing sewerage scheme's limitations. Proposals to extend a local hotel have been frustrated. The hotel is anxious to increase its capacity in terms of the number of bedrooms but this is being discouraged by the planning authority.A new town development plan is being drawn up by Limerick County Council. This plan will be sensitive and will complement the image and atmosphere of the village. If carried out, it will improve the commerce of the town and enhance local service providers. It will be a much better village as a result. An improved sewerage scheme is vital in achieving these objectives.Adare is served by a combined sewerage scheme constructed in 1914. The existing sewage treatment works were constructed in 1946 to serve a population of 600 persons. It now serves a population of 1,000, however, and discharges poorly treated sewage into the River Maigue. The sewerage works provide little treatment and they discharge almost raw sewage into the river. The fisheries board is very concerned about this and has informed Limerick County Council on numerous occasions that it could be prosecuted. The only saving factor is that the River Maigue is tidal in this area and quickly removes sewage from the discharge area.The history of sewerage improvement works goes back 30 years. In December 1975, the existing system was surveyed and a proposal for adequate sewerage facilities was made. In October 1978, a report was prepared by the council's consulting engineers. Their report was completed in 1979, considered by a meeting of Limerick County Council in that year and subsequently sent to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for approval in May 1979.The council received approval for the preparation of contract documents for the scheme in early December 1981. The tenders for site investigation were submitted to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for approval but such approval was not forthcoming. This preliminary report went out of date, regardless of all the work done, with the passage of time. In July 1986, in the meantime, land was acquired for sewage treatment works and wayleave and rights of way were obtained. In November 1992, contract documents for subsoil investigation were forwarded to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government for technical assistance and in February 1993, a certificate of planning was submitted to the Department. The plan was costed in June 1993 at £3.73 million.In 1998, Limerick County Council informed me that it was proposed to engage consultants to revise and update the reports for re-submission to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I was also informed that any of the original route maps of this scheme would be considered out of date. I was informed in November 2000 that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government had given approval to progress planning of the scheme and that the council was in the process of appointing consulting engineers to update the 1978 preliminary report of the scheme, which was substantially revised in 1985. I was further informed that the revised preliminary report would be completed by 2001.On 26 January 2005, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, informed me in this House that the Patrickswell-Adare sewerage scheme would commence construction in 2005. This did not happen and the Minister failed to honour his promise. On 9 March 2004, the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, informed me that the Adare sewerage scheme was approved for construction under his Department's water services investment programme 2003-2005. This Minister also failed to honour his commitment.On 3 February 2003 the Minister, Deputy Cullen, informed me in this House that Adare sewerage scheme would commence construction in 2003 and that the revised preliminary report was approved in July 2002, yet nothing happened. Following several telephone calls, I was informed by Limerick County Council today that contract documents have been in the process for 12 months and are due to be ready by Easter. If the Minister of State advises me that a sewerage scheme will be constructed in Adare this year, he will understand I might be sceptical about that. Nevertheless, I await his reply and, hopefully, his commitment to ensuring that it is done.With regard to the provision of sewerage schemes, the Government has failed west Limerick. Adare, Patrickswell, Askeaton, Glin, Shanagolden, Foynes, Athea, Dromcollogher and Kildimo, all in urgent need of upgraded sewerage schemes, yet none has been provided.

Towns and villages such as Athea, Askeaton, Foynes, Glin, Shanagolden, Kilmallock, Dromcollogher, Hospital, Pallasgreen and Bruff can look forward to new or upgraded sewerage schemes.Many areas will also benefit from improved water supplies from the major upgrade planned for the Clareville water treatment plant, improvements to the Shannon Estuary water supply scheme and extensions of the Limerick county trunk water mains. In total, almost €158 million has been allocated under the programme for water and sewerage schemes in Limerick.With regard to Adare, the Minister, Deputy Roche, is pleased that the Adare-Patrickswell sewerage scheme is approved to commence construction in 2006 in the water services investment programme at a cost of over €9 million.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	328	This is the fourth year in succession I have heard that.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	329	The two locations have been combined into a single project to avail of the economic benefits offered by the completion of the Limerick main drainage treatment plant at Bunlickey. Pumping effluent from both locations to Bunlickey will avoid the more costly option of either upgrading the existing obsolete treatment plants or constructing new replacements. It means less running costs for Limerick County Council in the long term.Limerick County Council received approval from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government last year to appoint engineering consultants to prepare contract documents for the scheme. The Minister understands that the consultants are now working on the contract documents and that the council has received tenders for site investigations. The results of these investigations are an essential component of the contract documents on which contractors base their prices for the construction of the scheme. In addition, approval has issued to the council's proposals to procure the scheme on the basis of a conventional type contract rather than as a design-build-operate contract.The scheme is needed to facilitate development in both areas and the Minister understands that some developers had contacted the county council with proposals they considered would help to advance the works more quickly. It would be a matter for the council, taking into account public procurement roles and value for money issues, to decide on the merits of such proposals and, if it decided to proceed with them, to submit the details to the Department for approval. The Department would not stand in the way of any approach that would help to expedite the scheme, subject to the necessary safeguards I mentioned.The Minister, Deputy Roche, can assure the Deputy that when the council's contract documents are submitted to his Department for approval they will be given early attention. The necessary funding has been allocated for the scheme in the Department's water services investment programme and, like the Deputy, we are anxious to see work on the scheme start at the earliest possible date.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	333	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 21, 25, 26, 30, 33, 35, 38, 43, 47, 49, 51, 53 and 64 together.The ambition of the EU to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises has, and continues to be, a key objective of the development of the European security and defence policy, ESDP. The tasks to be carried out under ESDP, the so-called Petersberg Tasks, are defined in the Amsterdam treaty as "humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking." Our participation in ESDP, and in the Petersberg Tasks, has been endorsed and supported directly by the people in the referendum on the Treaty on European Union, TEU, and the subsequent referenda on the Amsterdam and Nice treaties. Our participation in ESDP is also fully in accordance with our traditional support for the UN and our obligations as members of the international community, to respond to crises, events and humanitarian disasters, wherever they may occur.Ireland supports the development of the EU's rapid response capability in support of UN authorised missions and is positively disposed towards participation in the rapid response elements in this regard. To this end I established the interdepartmental group to examine all issues relating to Ireland's potential participation in an EU-led rapid response capability. The group reported to me in November 2005 and, since then, its report has been considered by the Cabinet sub-committee on European affairs and, informally, by the Government.On the basis of the study and informal discussions at Government level, I have authorised my officials to open discussions with potential partners on Ireland's participation in a battle group. We will seek, in co-operation with like-minded nations to contribute to the development of the battle group concept and, through this, to remain at the forefront of developments within the international community in supporting international peace support operations. With my recent announcement, 23 of 25 member states have now signalled their intention to participate in battle groups.My intention would be to identify specific options in relation to participation and then return to Government for a formal decision. In the first instance we intend to talk to Sweden, which is the framework nation for the Nordic battle group. We have identified a range of potential offers ranging from smaller niche capabilities up to an APC mounted light infantry company group of approximately 200 personnel plus support elements. While there have been some preliminary informal discussions with Sweden, regarding potential participation, to date there have been no formal discussions with any EU member state. As such, I am not in a position to state what will come out of these discussions. However, arrangements have now been made for a formal meeting between representatives from the Departments of Defence, and Foreign Affairs, and the Defence Forces of Sweden and Ireland on 10 March in Stockholm to discuss possible Irish participation in the Nordic battle group. As the Deputies will appreciate, the Nordic battle group was organised some time ago and, I understand most of the core elements are already in place, with Sweden contributing the core manoeuvre battalion. In addition, battle groups covering the period out to 2010 have already been announced and, on this basis, I would expect that our contribution in the period to 2010 is likely to be limited. However, this will be a matter for ongoing discussion with other member states over the coming months, in particular, with Finland and Austria with whom we have also had some initial informal exploratory discussions.There are no plans for the involvement of Naval Service or Air Corps assets although individual members of the Naval Service or Air Corps may be deployed on overseas peace support operations as they have been in the past. Any commitment to a battle group will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time set in the White Paper on Defence.In the event that we participate in a Nordic battle group we would be the only participant with a legal requirement for a UN mandate. That said, many member states acknowledge that it would be politically desirable, if not a political imperative, to have a UN mandate for any battle group deployment.I am fully satisfied that our participation in the battle group concept in no way weakens or undermines Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality. I have reiterated on many occasions that our participation in peace support operations would continue to require UN authorisation. Participation in battle groups will not diminish this requirement in any way. Ireland's basis for participation in missions undertaken by the EU is grounded in the legitimacy conveyed by the UN Security Council. This will not change. The triple lock of UN, Government and Dáil approval will remain in place.Participation in a battle group imposes no obligations in relation to international or multilateral defence. Participation of our troops in individual missions will be decided on a case-by-case basis within the framework of our national decision-making process. I would like to stress again that any decision to participate in any mission will be a national sovereign decision.As part of its study the interdepartmental group recommended changes to current legislation in light of the increasing range of operations where military forces can play a role and the need for increased interoperability and training so as we can be more effective and more efficient once deployed.It is important to the development of capabilities and the ongoing training of the Defence Forces that they can undertake training overseas and learn from best practice in other countries. While not conclusive, the study raised possible questions as to whether Defence Forces can be sent on such overseas training. This training is essential to the development and maintenance of high standards in the military and our existing peace support operations, where we work alongside many other armies.I intend to introduce amending legislation to put this issue beyond doubt. Moreover, in light of developments since the Defence Act was amended in 1960 to provide for participation in UN peace support operations, for the avoidance of doubt, I also intend to update the wording in the Act to more closely reflect current practice in the formulation of UN Security Council resolutions endorsing peace support operations. The triple lock requirement of UN, Government and Dáil approval will stand.I also propose to provide for the participation by Defence Forces personnel in humanitarian operations in response to natural and man-made disasters such as the tsunami in south east Asia or the earthquake in Pakistan. Currently personnel must volunteer for service with a civil undertaking, in the same manner as any ordinary citizens and cannot be deployed at the behest of the Government.These issues are important and must be addressed. The requirement for this amending legislation arises irrespective of our participation in battle groups. It is my hope, with the co-operation of the Oireachtas which I expect will be readily forthcoming, to have the necessary legislation enacted before the summer recess.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I propose to take Questions Nos. 10 and 37 together.I am aware that there were some media reports along these lines last year. The military authorities advise me that they have no knowledge of any serving Permanent Defence Force personnel, who are on career breaks from the Permanent Defence Force being in Iraq. Nonetheless, at the time when these media reports appeared, the military authorities wrote to all personnel who were on career breaks and reminded them of the conditions under which their career breaks had been granted.I also understand that in July 2004 the deputy chief of staff, support, sent a routine circular to general officers commanding and to formation commanders reminding them of the conditions under which a career break may be granted and that personnel granted a career break may not engage in any activity whatsoever that may bring adverse publicity on the Defence Forces or that may bring the Defence Forces into disrepute.It must be emphasised that the Defence Forces would act upon any information which indicates that any person was acting in breach of the conditions of the Permanent Defence Force career break leave of absence regulations. A career break may be declared invalid if used for a purpose other than the three categories specified under the schemes, which are leave for domestic responsibilities, further education or travel abroad.In submitting applications for special leave under the career break schemes, personnel are required to specify the purpose of the career break and the period for which it is being sought. All personnel on career breaks remain subject to military law in accordance with the provisions of sections 118 and 119 of the Defence Act 1954 as appropriate.All personnel applying for a career break must note that they understand the conditions governing the granting of special leave for career breaks, as specified in Defence Force Regulations and Instructions.As a condition of their special leave on a career break, personnel are required to undertake to notify the deputy chief of staff, support, of any change of address for correspondence purposes within one month of such change and to respond promptly to any correspondence from the deputy chief of staff, support, concerning their intentions on the expiry of a career break, or on any other matters concerning their career break, and to return to duty on such date as is determined in accordance with the conditions of the respective career break schemes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	335	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 20, 29, 57, 61 and 70 together.The background to the engagement of Dr. Lieberthal arises from the Defence Forces policy of providing medical care for personnel serving with large contingents overseas. In the case of missions such as Lebanon and Liberia it is the practice to send medical officers as part of the contingent.Given the arduous nature of the Liberia mission, with troops undertaking frequent long-term patrols away from base, it was deemed necessary to have two doctors with the battalion. The mission in Liberia is, of its nature, a peace enforcement one. This resulted in a situation whereby medical officers who had been recruited prior to 1993 could not be detailed to serve there and could only be selected to serve there as volunteers. These requirements coupled with a general difficulty in recruiting and retaining doctors in the Defence Forces created a situation whereby the medical officer requirements for the mission could not be fully met among the doctors serving at that time.Following a tender competition involving a number of agencies, a contract was placed with Medicare Solutions Limited, Unit 15D Oakcroft Road, Chessington, Surrey, England. The contract was initially for a period of three months commencing on 1 June 2004 and was subsequently extended to February 2005. Following a further tender competition, a fresh contract was placed commencing 1 March 2005. During this time Medicare Solutions had supplied a number of other doctors for periods lasting from a few weeks to three months. This contract expired on 31 December 2005. As and from 1 January 2006 the Defence Forces have been in a position to provide doctors from within the medical corps. The services of the agency are therefore no longer required. The procedure for selecting suitable individual doctors was that candidates were identified by the medical corps from the curriculum vitae supplied to the Department by Medicare Solutions which had expressed an interest in working with the Irish military contingent in Liberia.This selection was made on the basis of the professional qualifications and particular clinical experience of the various applicants as per their individual curriculum vitae. Dr. Lieberthal was selected to replace another previously selected candidate who had decided not to proceed to Liberia at very late notice. There appeared to be nothing whatsoever untoward in the curriculum vitae supplied in respect of Dr. Lieberthal, who was interviewed by telephone by a senior officer of the medical corps.Dr. Lieberthal was first appointed for a three-month period from 8 December 2004. He was retained in Liberia until 31 December 2005, when the overall contract with Medicare Solutions expired. He worked in a civilian capacity and provided primary military medical care services to troops, that is, largely care of the routine general practitioner type. He also provided a similar level of medical service to the contingent of Swedish military personnel. In this connection Ireland and Sweden provide an integrated quick reaction force to the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL. Both nations are co-located at Camp Clara, Monrovia. They share certain logistical and welfare facilities. This includes the Irish medical facility, which is staffed by both Irish and Swedish medical personnel. The Swedish medical contingent included one doctor.It was only after the contract had expired that it came to the attention of the military authorities that Dr. Wynne Lieberthal had been struck off the South African medical register by the Health Professions Council of South Africa in July 2004 after their investigation of various charges brought against him under the relevant South African legislation. As the first priority was the welfare of the troops who were attended to by this man the director of the medical corps contacted each person who had served in Liberia during the period in question alerting them to the situation and advising them of the measures the medical corps were putting in place to deal with any concerns they may have.As a result any Defence Force member treated by the person concerned and who wished to discuss any aspect of his or her treatment with a medical officer was invited to consult his or her local military medical officer or alternatively to contact the special medical hotline established by the Army medical corps. To date there have been six calls to this hotline.Legal advice is being sought as to the performance of the specialist medical recruitment agency engaged to provide suitably qualified doctors who either had or would be expected to fulfil the requirements of the Irish Medical Council. It would not be appropriate to anticipate the outcome of this advice and possible follow-up action at this stage.In connection with the overall situation I would like to make the point that arrangements for the engagement of doctors to provide medical cover for Irish troops serving with UNMIL were made under the pressure of having troops deployed in a hostile environment. In particular Dr. Lieberthal was hired as a last minute replacement for another doctor who could not take up duty.It was preferred but not necessary that doctors engaged for service in Liberia would be registered with the Irish Medical Council. They only had to apply on taking up duty. As such registration is a lengthy process, a number of the doctors engaged finished their tour of duty without being registered. Therefore, the fact that Dr. Lieberthal's application was still being processed at his departure was not considered unusual. It should be pointed out however that in the first instance the person himself should not have commenced work based on falsehoods.The overall position in relation to the recruitment of medical officers is being urgently reviewed with a view to ensuring that medical services available to contingents serving overseas are of the highest quality.

Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the following table.The main commitments are to the United Nations Mission in Liberia, UNMIL, with 426 personnel, to the NATO-led international security presence, KFOR, in Kosovo, with 213 personnel and to EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 56 personnel. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, UN, the European Union, EU, and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, OSCE. Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, the EU and NATO.With regard to future participation by the Defence Forces in UNMIL, our plan is to withdraw the Irish contingent towards the end of this year. The UN itself is due to review the operation in March with a view to downsizing and we will examine the issue further in the context of that review and of our own threat assessment. It had been anticipated that a reorganisation and scaling-down of KFOR would take place in 2004. This had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March 2004 in Kosovo. The phased withdrawal of the Irish contingent was planned as part of this reduction in KFOR presence and was to have been completed by October 2004. However, having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo, and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, both myself and the Minister for Foreign Affairs are agreed on the importance of maintaining an Irish presence in the western Balkans in 2006.There is no plan to alter the Irish contribution to EUFOR's Operation Althea in Bosnia and Herzegovina over the next 12 months. Ireland's commitment under the United Nations stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS, is 850 which represents 10% of the total Army strength. This is the figure set in the White Paper on Defence and is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas operations. There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS and any contribution to EU or UN missions will be met within the context of the 850 ceiling.Ireland receives requests from time to time in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case by case basis. To date in 2006, no such requests have been received from either the United Nations or the EU.Numbers1.

The reorganisation of the medical corps, which was effected as part of the Defence Forces review implementation plan in November 1998, redirected the focus of military medical care from a predominantly hospital based service to one in which primary, occupational and field support would continue to be further developed.The medical corps facilities are as follows: St. Bricin's Military Hospital, Dublin, three military medical facilities, MMF, located in Cork, Athlone and the Curragh and 17 medical centres, one in each of the other permanently occupied military barracks. St. Bricin's Military Hospital and the three military medical facilities have associated infirmaries for the care of living-in personnel, largely recruits and other training course students, who may become injured or ill. There are appointments for a physician as well as X-ray, pharmacy and screening audiometry facilities. Physiotherapy facilities are available at St. Bricin's Military Hospital and the MMF in Cork and the Curragh.The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training. The range of services provided by the medical corps includes: a military occupational medical service; a primary medical care service; a secondary medical care service; a preventive medical service; provision of medicines and dressings; dental services; a field medical service; training; maintenance of medical records; and medico-legal services.The statistical information in relation to capacity as at 26 May 2005, the latest date for which figures are available, is provided in the following table. The establishment for medical officers — doctors — in the Permanent Defence Force is 47. The current strength of medical officers — doctors — is 21. Two of these medical officers are on leave of absence without pay. Four are serving on a short service commission of which two are serving in Liberia.The services of civilian general practitioners are regularly engaged to provide primary care when medical officers are not available.

His death was the subject of a UN board of inquiry and an Irish contingent board of inquiry as well as a military police investigation. The coroner for north-west Donegal also held an inquest into the death of Private Barrett from 5 to 8 September 2005. The jury in the inquest returned an open verdict.I met Mrs. Barrett, who was accompanied by her solicitor, on 4 October 2005. During my meeting with Mrs. Barrett, I gave her an undertaking to have the interaction between my Department-Defence Forces and her and Private Barrett's family reviewed by an independent person.On 28 October 2005, I appointed Mr. Sean Hurley to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence-Defence Forces and parents and family of Private Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death. I received his report on 2 February 2006.Mr. Hurley has conducted a very thorough inquiry and has provided a detailed and frank report. It is clear and concise and covers the issues raised with me by Kevin Barrett's family. Mr. Hurley has looked in detail at how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin's death and has identified some clear failings and shortcomings. Copies of the review were provided to the Barrett family and their legal advisers on 3 February 2006 and the full report was published on my Department's website on 6 February 2006.I accept the recommendations and conclusions contained in the report and I assure the Barrett family that I will act on these. Important lessons have been learnt for the future and errors that have occurred in the handling of this tragic case, outlined by Mr. Hurley, must never be repeated. Mr. Hurley acknowledges that some of these have since been addressed in the new Guidelines for Dealing with Bereaved Families introduced by the Defence Forces in 2001. These guidelines will now be reviewed to include Mr. Hurley's recommendations.Immediately on receipt of Mr. Hurley's report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide me with his early views in relation to any possible assistance that the Garda Síochána might be in a position to provide. A Garda officer has since been assigned to the case and is currently examining my Department's and the Defence Forces files in the case with a view to determining whether the gardaí can provide any assistance in the matter.I want to repeat my apology to the Barrett family for the pain and suffering they endured following Kevin's tragic death. I also want to thank the Barrett family for their patience and co-operation in the preparation of this review. I have asked to meet with the family in the coming weeks, after they have had sufficient time to consider the report.

This limit was set in April 2002 based on the professional advice of the medical corps and the actual experience of training units. The advice at that time was that, having regard to the nature of the job and of the duties of military service and the training exercises undertaken by members of the Defence Forces, persons of shorter stature are more likely to incur back and lower limb injuries. A key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. Inherent in this physical requirement is the ability to carry heavy loads and execute physically demanding tasks in training and on operations. The personal load carrying equipment and personal weapon place considerable strain on the musculosketal system. The advice in 2002 was that the recommended height requirement of 162.5 cm, 5 ft. 4 in., for entry is the minimum necessary to meet the demands of military life.As I indicated to the House on 29 September 2005, that requirement is being kept under constant review. I have asked the military authorities to report to me on it. I will review the height requirement in the light of that report.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash for the years 2000 to 2004 — the figures for 2005 are currently being collated — was as follows:Year20002001200220032004Total number of escorts2,2852,4882,5162,3352,425Cost of Escorts€5.7m€6.57m€6.87m€6.5m€7.5mPay accounts for about 54% of the total costs of providing cash escorts. The non-pay costs include security duty allowance, subsistence, transport and aerial surveillance costs. The breakdown of these costs, on average is as follows: security duty allowance — 7%; subsistence — 8%; transport — 28%; aerial surveillance — 3%.An annual contribution of €2.86 million has been paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts. This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces. Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.As the Deputy may be aware, I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers' Federation, IBF, in relation to this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of cash escorts. Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May 2005.This agreement, which is for a five year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts. Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December, will be paid the following year on or before 1 June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year-end. The first payment under the new system will be paid in June 2006.I have, at the banks' request, agreed to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks' budgeting and accounting timeframe. In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of €1 million, payable before end 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement. Therefore, in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of €2.86 million plus the additional €1 million making a total contribution of €3.86 million. The costs for the banks in any future year will be determined by the actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of the cash escorts in the previous year and thus are not available at this time. The payments by the banks will be paid directly to my Department.We have now agreed a very open and transparent system for agreeing the costs in respect of the Defence Forces and this should stand the test of time. The agreement resolves the issue of the banks' contribution in respect of cash escort costs for the foreseeable future.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I express my condolences and sincere sympathy to the families and friends of those who died as a result of the Rising Sun fishing tragedy. I am aware of the criticism levelled by Comhairle Fo-Thuinn at Naval Service diving capabilities, which is unfounded and unwarranted.The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime search-and-rescue services within the Irish search-and-rescue region. The role of the Defence Forces in search and rescue involves the provision of services to civil authorities as and when required.The Naval Service provided support to the Irish Coast Guard in this search and recovery operation by way of ships and personnel, including 15 divers and a diving officer. A naval ship acted as on-scene commander vessel and enforced the Irish Coast Guard-imposed exclusion zone.The naval diving section is governed by clear diving rules and regulations which mirror those of other military and commercial professional diving entities. The equipment used by the naval diving section is the most modern available, having been upgraded in 2004. The Naval Service has trained its own divers since 1983 in accordance with international best practice for both military and commercial diving, and in addition Naval Service divers have trained with other navies in various forms of military diving. Furthermore, as Ireland does not have equivalent commercial diving training and accepts the UK qualifications, Naval Service divers are also qualified by the Health and Safety Executive in the UK to dive and supervise all forms of air diving. That training is to ensure that Naval Service diving is up to date with regard to equipment and procedures in use in commercial diving nationwide.The Naval Service diving section has considerable experience in search and recovery operations and does its utmost to the limit of its resources while remaining cognisant of health and safety requirements. Naval Service professionalism and dedication in such difficult situations are unquestionable, and I am satisfied that the diving capabilities of the Naval Service have not been found wanting.

An airspace change proposal submitted to the Irish Aviation Authority by Weston Airport Limited in 2005 includes the use of instrument navigation aids to assist the arrival and departure of aircraft in accordance with instrument flight rules. Use of those landing aids would result in flight paths which would penetrate military airspace. The Irish Aviation Authority has convened a group, in which my Department and the Air Corps are represented, to examine the implications of the airspace change proposal. Discussions are ongoing.My principal concern regarding Weston Aerodrome is the maintenance of safe and functional airspace in which military flight training and air operations can continue on a 24-hour basis. Changes in operations at Weston will require a risk assessment by the Air Corps to ensure that current levels of safety for military air operations are maintained or improved.

The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200.While the Office of Public Works has identified a suitable site in Newbridge for the Department's new headquarters, negotiations on the acquisition of the site have not yet been completed.A total of 385 personnel, of whom 64 are currently serving in the Department, have volunteered to relocate to Newbridge.

I intend to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting. The strength of the Permanent Defence Force, the number of female personnel by rank and the strength of the Reserve Defence Force, as advised by the military authorities, is provided in the following tabular statements. The figures provided are as at 31 January 2006.The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time through the United Nations stand-by arrangements system, UNSAS. While that may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above that level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources. Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within that context.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	345	In December 2005, a contract was signed with Mowag GmbH of Switzerland for the supply of 15 additional Piranha armoured vehicles to the Defence Forces. The company has already provided 65 Piranha APCs to the Defence Forces in recent years. Under the contract, Mowag GmbH will supply 15 vehicles, nine of which will be fitted with a Kongsberg remote weapon station with a 12.7 mm machine gun, and six will be fitted with an Otomelara turret armed with a 30 mm cannon. The 15 vehicles will be used mainly in the surveillance and reconnaissance roles on overseas missions. The contract value is in the region of €36.5 million, including VAT. Deliveries will all take place in 2007. Payments under the contract will extend from December 2005 to January 2008. The signing of the contract is another significant boost for the Defence Forces and a further indicator of my commitment to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are fully equipped with modern equipment, which enhances their safety in carrying out their roles.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	346	The question of retention of personnel in the Naval Service was tackled through reforms introduced through the Defence White Paper of February 2000. Those reforms were the result of a series of earlier studies between 1990 and 1999. The reforms implemented were part of a five-year plan that has just been completed. The plan included the following: restructuring of the Naval Service organisation to ensure that the vast majority of personnel had a "sea to shore" rotation providing periodic posting to shore-based appointments for sea-going personnel; monitoring of each individual's sea-time to ensure they are aware of their own number of sea-going days; a patrol plan which specifies when ships are due to be at sea throughout the year, facilitating planning of personal time by each individual; improved rates of sea-going allowance; and a very effective personnel support system, PSS, that provides support for individuals who may have family welfare problems. In addition, personnel serving on ships have additional leave when serving afloat — 15 days for other ranks and 12 days for junior officers. The impact of sea-going is well understood by naval personnel at all levels. The system for managing sea-going by the individual is working well. The personnel support system offers professional support to personnel who have personal or family difficulties.The Naval Service endeavours to operate a planned approach to the sea-shore rotation of personnel, based on a two-year period of commitment to sea-going duties, followed by a two-year period ashore subject to the exigencies of the Naval Service. However, where there are shortages of skilled personnel within the Naval Service, it may be necessary for personnel to carry out sea-going duties more frequently.The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that, when fully implemented, all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment, followed by two years in a ship-based sea-going appointment. In that regard, I should point out that two years in a ship-based sea-going appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea. On the other hand, some Naval Service personnel are keen to spend more time at sea and, where possible, they are accommodated. Overall, the broad range of strategies adopted by the Naval Service, including continuous recruitment, direct-entry officer schemes, direct-entry technician and internal technician schemes, focuses on achieving sufficient numbers of trained personnel so that the planned approach to sea-shore rotation, based on the two-year cycle, is maintained. That helps to ensure that Naval Service personnel do not spend unduly protracted periods at sea.I am aware of the difficulties regarding the deployment of certain technical Naval Service personnel, especially engineering staff, engine-room artificers and electrical artificers. The position is that the number of such appointments in the Naval Service was increased following the reorganisation of the Naval Service.Given the specialist nature of those additional positions, it was not possible to fill them all until such time as personnel had completed the necessary training. It was always accepted that it would take several years for all appointments to be filled by suitably qualified people.While the increased number of specialist appointments could not all be filled instantly, thus creating some unavoidable transitional difficulties, I am assured by the military authorities that the arrangements now in place to provide suitably trained and qualified personnel should see an early improvement in the situation.More generally, an annual level of discharge of 129 in 1999 has fallen to a sustainable level of around 60 per annum in the last three years. That figure includes discharges of recruits at an early stage of training and involuntary discharges for reasons such as medical classification. The Permanent Defence Force operates fixed-term contracts for enlistment. Some personnel retire on age grounds or when they have secured a service pension entitlement. Other individuals will decide, for their own reasons, to take up employment elsewhere. The Naval Service establishment is 1,144, and the current strength is 1,082. There is an ongoing intake of recruits. Overall retention in the Naval Service is good.

While it would be inappropriate to comment on the details of the investigation, it can be confirmed that a member of the Defence Forces has been interviewed in the course of the investigation. As the investigation is continuing and several lines of inquiry remain to be completed, it is not possible to determine when the investigation will be concluded.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The office of emergency planning was established in my Department to promote the co-ordination of emergency planning functions across all Departments and other key public authorities and to oversee the emergency planning process in general.In pursuing these objectives, I chair the Government task force on emergency planning, which comprises those Ministers as well as, or instead of, those senior officials of Departments and public authorities which make a key contribution to the emergency planning process.It is the top-level structure giving policy and direction and which co-ordinates and oversees the emergency planning activities of Departments and public authorities. It promotes the best possible use of resources and compatibility between different planning requirements.An interdepartmental working group on emergency planning comprises officials representing Departments and public authorities with lead or principal support roles in Government emergency plans. The task force charges this working group with carrying out specific studies and developing particular aspects of emergency planning. The working group is the vehicle through which expertise is shared between Departments and public authorities on emergency planning. The working group continues to address emergency planning matters to reduce the potential impacts of emergencies on this State.The office of emergency planning supports my Department's emergency planning objective and the Government task force on emergency planning. The office chairs the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning. The lead responsibility for specific emergency planning functions remains with the relevant Departments.Emergency plans are co-ordinated by the various lead Departments at a national level and through the local authorities, including the fire service, the Health Service Executive and the Garda divisions at local and regional levels. Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces are: the provision of aid to the civil power, meaning in practice to assist, when requested, the Garda Síochána; and assistance to other civil authorities. The various components of the Defence Forces are active in this regard, providing such assistance as is appropriate in specific circumstances. These plans and arrangements are kept under constant review.The Departments and key public authorities involved have particular responsibilities under a number of strategic areas of Government emergency planning and regularly report on developments and progress at meetings of the task force. The objective of the Government is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to any large-scale emergency. As chairman of the task force, my approach continues to be that responses must be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in all the response arrangements. Review and refinement arrangements will ensure co-ordination of all those responding so that, should we be unfortunate enough to experience a large-scale emergency, we will be in a position to mount a credible response.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I will attend the meeting of the European Defence Agency steering board in defence ministers' formation in Innsbruck, Austria on 7 March 2006. While the formal agenda for this meeting has not yet issued, among the issues expected to be discussed are: the setting up of the 2006 European Defence Agency's college of auditors to audit the agency's 2005 accounts; discussion of the chief executive's report on current activities and issues; and a review of European defence research and technology on the basis of a memorandum from the agency to the steering board.The steering board is the principal decision-making body of the agency on which the 24 participating member states are represented. Denmark does not participate under its general opt-out on decisions with defence or military implications. The overall aim of the agency is to support member states in their efforts to improve European defence capabilities in support of European security and defence policy.I believe the agency is an important forum through which the EU can seek to improve competitiveness and efficiency in the defence equipment sector, which has been notable for fragmentation and duplication. While Ireland is not a major consumer of defence equipment in relative terms, I believe that we should encourage developments which improve market efficiencies or which may yield some economies of scale for equipment procurement for the Defence Forces.The main focus of the European Defence Agency is not increasing defence expenditure, but rather, obtaining better value for existing spending levels and securing improvements and greater efficiency, particularly in the area of research, technology, manufacturing and procurement. Ireland has advocated that the EU should prioritise the development of qualitative aspects of capability development. I am aware that this view, and a recognition of the need for greater efficiency and effectiveness in defence expenditure, is shared by many of my ministerial colleagues at EU level, at a time when the majority of member states, including Ireland, has no plans to increase their defence spending.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The only detailed records retained by the Defence Forces on the employment of civilian personnel abroad refer to the civilian doctors supplied by Medicare Solutions Limited for service with the Irish UNMIL contingent in Liberia. Medicare Solutions Limited was the medical agency contracted by the Department of Defence for this purpose. The contract was initially for a period of three months commencing on 1 June 2004 and was subsequently extended. Medicare Solutions Limited supplied a number of civilian doctors for periods lasting from a few weeks to three months. This contract eventually expired on 31 December 2005. As and from 1 January 2006, the Defence Forces have been in a position to provide military medical officers from within the medical corps. The services of an agency are therefore no longer required.The procedure for selecting suitable individual doctors was that candidates were identified and selected by the medical corps from curricula vitae supplied to the Department by Medicare Solutions Limited, in respect of those doctors on their books who had expressed an interest in working with the Irish military contingent in Liberia. Selection was done on the basis of the professional qualifications and clinical experience of the various applicants, as per their individual curricula vitae.The Defence Forces have from time to time directly employed some local people in a civilian capacity with missions overseas. These civilians however were in various ancillary occupations such as interpreters, cleaners, etc.

Her Department will continue to keep the level of risk under assessment taking account of the most up to date veterinary scientific and ornithological advice available. In the event of an outbreak of the disease in this country the Defence Forces will, of course, provide assistance in a support role as requested subject to the exigencies of the service and within available resources.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The context of my remarks related to the need for the UN to be able to respond rapidly to emerging crises, particularly in the context of the development of battle groups. Significant effort is being invested by EU member states to make available two battle groups on standby each semester to undertake rapid response operations in accordance with the Petersberg Tasks. The UN, which is strongly supportive of the development of rapid response elements by the EU, recognises itself the need to be able to bring these instruments into effect quickly as crises evolve. I am satisfied that, where such crises arise, the necessary political will, will be forthcoming to ensure the UN can respond with appropriate speed and determination.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I wrote to the Law Society of Ireland at the time of the initial queries regarding solicitors' charges in Army hearing loss litigation. In my letter, I asked the Law Society what plans it had to deal with any complaints regarding charging by solicitors in these cases. The Law Society clarified that it was the statutory body responsible for dealing with such complaints and that it had procedures in place in this regard. The society has power to order a solicitor to repay any excessive amount charged and is anxious to investigate any complaints made against solicitors. Since October last, 71 inquiries have been received by my Department from plaintiffs regarding the fees paid to solicitors in respect of Army deafness cases. Generally, these queries refer to the amount of the award or settlement and the costs paid.As a matter of course, my Department advises the individual of the amount of the settlement or award, and the date on which payment issued. In addition, the amount paid by the State in respect of plaintiff costs, and the date of such payment, are also advised. In responding to inquiries from plaintiffs, we also advise them that they are entitled to obtain details of the costs in their case from their solicitor under the provisions of section 68(6) of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994. These provisions oblige a legal representative to provide a summary of the legal services provided and the amount of expenses incurred in the provision of these legal services as well as details of all charges that have been recovered. We also advise that the Law Society of Ireland is the statutory body entrusted with responsibility to investigate complaints against solicitors by a client and that the Law Society has procedures in place in this regard.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	357	In July 2004 the Reserve Defence Force implementation plan was officially launched. This plan, which will be implemented over the period to end 2009, sets out an ambitious programme of reform and modernisation for the Reserve that will enhance both Reserve Defence Force capabilities and Permanent Defence Force-Reserve Defence Force interoperability. The new reserve organisational structures came into effect on 1 October last and the reserve is organised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force. In addition to the reorganisation, other aspects of the plan are also progressing on schedule. The equipment programme is being implemented with the Steyr rifle programme ahead of schedule and the support weapons programme progressing on schedule. The training programme is progressing on schedule with many of the training syllabi revised and approved. Work will continue in this area over the course of the plan.Although I am satisfied that the implementation process in on schedule to date, further work must be completed in the remaining period of the plan. The reorganised reserve will provide the necessary platform for implementation of other aspects of the plan. The development of the integrated element of the reserve as well as the development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified reserve personnel for overseas duties, are important elements of the plan that require continued work over the period to end 2009.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 66 together.Ireland has participated in UNMIL since December 2003 following a decision of the Government on 24 June 2003, and the subsequent approval by Dáil Éireann of the necessary enabling motion. Since then, the UN Security Council has authorised the continuation of UNMIL for successive periods and the Government has approved continued Irish participation.Ireland, together with an infantry company group from Sweden, provides the quick reaction force, QRF, to the UNMIL force commander. The Irish contingent comprises 426 personnel. The QRF initially acted in a pathfinder role, going into the countryside, stabilising the situation, establishing contacts with local leaders and preparing the ground for the follow on deployment of the larger UN forces. Once this was completed, the QRF became the rapid response element within UNMIL responding to any crises that arose within the area of operations and supporting deployed contingents through long range patrols into the countryside. While it has been a difficult mission, particularly in terms of the operating environment, it is working very well for the Defence Forces.On 19 September 2005, the UN Security Council, acting under chapter VII of the UN charter unanimously adopted Resolution No. 1626 extending the mandate of UNMIL until 31 March 2006. The resolution further authorised UNMIL to deploy personnel to Sierra Leone to provide a continuing security detail for the special court for Sierra Leone in Freetown; to deploy an adequate number of military personnel to Sierra Leone; and, if and when needed, to evacuate the security detail, as well as officials of the special court for Sierra Leone, in the event of a serious security crisis. The special court is an independent tribunal established jointly by the UN and the Government of Sierra Leone in 2002 to bring to justice those who bear greatest responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Sierra Leone after 30 November 1996, at the height of that country's civil war between 1991 and 2002.On 11 November 2005, the UN Security Council further extended UNMIL's mandate to include the apprehension, detention and transfer to the special court for Sierra Leone of the former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, in the event of his return to Liberia. In September 2005, the UN requested Ireland's support in expanding the area of operations of UNMIL to include Sierra Leone and in particular to allow Irish troops to be made available for extraction operations should there be a requirement to evacuate the staff and detainees of the special court of Sierra Leone in Freetown. A joint Irish-Swedish reconnaissance team visited UNMIL and Sierra Leone between 9 and 13 November 2005. The purpose of the visit was to assess the situation on the ground, with a view to making a recommendation on supporting the proposed operation. The key issues for consideration by the team were threat analysis, command and control and logistic support. On foot of the reconnaissance report, the chief of staff of the Defence Forces advised that the envisaged operation in Sierra Leone, should it come to pass, was within the Defence Forces competence to perform from within the resources presently deployed in the QRF. The Irish contingent assumed its additional responsibilities in late December 2005 following Dáil approval on 15 December 2005.UNMIL is providing a permanent guard of 250 personnel of the Mongolian contingent at the special court. In late January 2006, Irish and Swedish troops of the QRF conducted rehearsals of the extraction plan, without difficulties, and with the full support of all the Sierra Leone and UN agencies involved. The political climate in Sierra Leone is assessed as calm. The Secretary General of the UN has indicated that there will be a review of the UNMIL mission in March 2006, and depending on the political and security situation in Liberia at that time, a downsizing schedule for the UNMIL mission will be agreed. From the outset the Government has signalled its intention that Defence Forces involvement in UNMIL would not exceed two to three years in duration and the United Nations has been advised accordingly. The Defence Forces, together with its Swedish partners will, therefore, conclude their service with UNMIL by the end of 2006. The UN has been advised accordingly.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 65 and 68 together.The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces — Army, Air Corps, Naval Service — including the Reserve Defence Force and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. This means women are eligible on the same basis as men for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments and educational and training courses and for promotion. All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts. To encourage increased participation by women in the Defence Forces, my predecessor decided in March 1998 to reduce the height requirement for all female recruits to 162.5 cm or 5 ft. 4 ins. This height requirement also applies to male recruits. The Defence Forces actively encourage female applicants, for example, advertising — where possible, all graphical advertisements and booklets produced for the Defence Forces show both male and female personnel and emphasise that all applicants are assessed on an equal basis; recruitment fairs — stands at recruiting fairs are generally staffed by male and female personnel; and visits to schools — when the Defence Forces are invited to give talks at all female or at mixed schools, every effort is made to have a female speaker.Over the past eight years, the strength of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 244 at the end of 1997 to 528 at the end of January 2006. This constitutes an increase of more than 100% in the number of females serving over this period. On 5 August 2005 I wrote to both the Department of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform along with a number of outside organisations seeking their views and recommendations on how more women might be encouraged to enlist in the Defence Forces. All the replies have been received, the last on 17 January 2006 and they are being examined, after which, I propose that officials, both civil and military, of the Department of Defence will meet with representatives of each of the organisations who made submissions as well as the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers and the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association. These meetings will consider the ideas and suggestions to see what, if any, improvements or changes can be made to the programme of recruitment so as to encourage more females to join the Defence Forces.

It is reasonable and appropriate for states that are members of both organisations to ensure similar standards, procedures, training regimes, command and control arrangements etc. apply uniformly across both organisations, as it would be extremely difficult to operate two different standards regimes within a single set of forces. In this regard, as is stated on the Finnish Department of Defence website, there is a level of complementarity between the arrangements for the NRF and the EU battle groups. Within the EU battle group concept, it is provided that the battle group on stand-by for a particular semester will be available solely for deployment on EU operations and will not be committed or available for other duties.

Its remit is to promote awareness and knowledge of food safety issues on an all-island basis.I am not aware of complaints in relation to recruitment procedures. However, I am advised that Safefood has received two complaints in relation to the appointment of a co-ordinator for a research network on cryptosporidium. The co-ordinator's role attracts a grant of €10,000 per annum for a period of five years to facilitate the setting up and maintenance of the research network but it is not considered by Safefood to be a contract of employment. Both complaints are currently being processed by the appropriate employment equality machinery — one within this jurisdiction and one within Northern Ireland.

As part of this provision, funding of €10 million has been made available to address core under-funding and core staffing issues in services provided by the voluntary sector. The Health Service Executive has been asked to allocate this funding on an equitable basis, having regard to the needs of people with disabilities. I expect that the executive's consideration of these needs will take into account any urgent case for funding of necessary services.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Avian influenza, bird flu, is an infectious disease of birds caused by type A strains of the influenza virus. The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian influenza in birds and mammals other than humans. That Department has contingency plans in place and all questions relating to these plans should be referred to my colleague the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan.The health sector's role in relation to avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. My Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context and there are ongoing meetings between officials to discuss issues of mutual concern. The Department of Agriculture and Food is also an active participant in my Department's influenza pandemic expert group.The overall aims of pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity, and to minimise the resulting disruption to society. However, the consequences of a global pandemic are still likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects. The Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning on a number of fronts; the influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance and the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice. This work is being progressed through working and implementation groups established by the Health Service Executive within the following functional areas: surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines and antivirals, etc., communications, laboratories and materials management.The Department of Health and Children has established a standing inter-departmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic, for example, border controls and suspension of travel, travel advice, school closures, suspension of other gatherings, possible security issues etc. This committee will assist the Department of Health and Children with planning for such an emergency and will also be available in the event of an emergency arising.The main treatment for pandemic influenza is antiviral drugs. Antivirals can shorten the duration of the disease and alleviate symptoms. They are usually not considered effective after 48 hours from the onset of illness. Recommendations for the stockpiling of antivirals are kept under constant review by the influenza pandemic expert group.An emergency supply of over 45,000 treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu®, was purchased in 2004. A further 1 million treatment packs of Tamiflu® are being stockpiled. This quantity is sufficient to treat 25% of the population. Some 600,000 packs have already been delivered and the remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered this year.Arrangements have also been made to procure a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, oseltamivir phosphate powder, to treat children aged between one and five years of age. It has also been agreed that additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza®, should be stockpiled. Arrangements for the purchase of this additional stock are being finalised.The H5N1 vaccine could offer some protection against an H5N1 flu strain. Arrangements are being made to procure a strategic stockpile, which could be used as a first line of defence for priority groups, such as key health care workers and other essential workers, pending manufacture of a vaccine against the exact pandemic flu strain.Vaccination will be the primary public health intervention in the event of flu pandemic and our plans to deal with a pandemic call for vaccines to be provided to cover the entire population as soon as a vaccine is available. Since pandemics occur when a new flu virus emerges to which people have no immunity, the vaccine can only be manufactured once the new strain emerges. Despite developments which are taking place at international level seeking to expedite the pandemic vaccine production process, it is anticipated that it will take at least four to six months from the time a pandemic flu strain emerges to develop and manufacture a vaccine. The Department of Health and Children is therefore actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	371	The administration of the civil registration service, including genealogical and family research is statutorily a matter for an tArd-Chláraitheoir, Registrar-General. I have made inquiries with an tArd-Chláraitheoir and the following is the position.The Civil Registration Service has been engaged in a major modernisation programme in recent years. This provided for the computerisation of all the historical records, the development of a computerised registration system and major legislative reform. This has been a major investment designed to enhance the service available to the public and to make it more responsive to today's needs.The primary function of the service is to facilitate the registration of vital events and to provide certified copies of entries in the registers to the public when required. These certificates may be required for a wide variety of purposes, both legal and administrative. The service does not engage in genealogical research but is, of course, aware of the importance of its records to those interested in family history and genealogy.The increase in fees, which came into effect from 5 December 2005, is the first increase in 19 years and the average increase in respect of certificates is 44%. The increase in respect of a photocopy of an entry in the register, including the search fee, is 57.9%. The cost of living increase as per the consumer price index increased by approximately 68% during that period.

Funding is allocated through the Traveller health units in each Health Service Executive area. Travellers and Traveller organisations are involved in partnership with Health Service Executive personnel through each Traveller health unit in the development of Traveller health services and in the allocation of resources.My Department and the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety in Northern Ireland are jointly committed to carrying out a Travellers' all-Ireland health study to develop and extend the information collected in a 1987 study of Travellers' health. The results of this study will inform the development of future health services for Travellers. Tenders for the conduct of this study have been received by my Department and it is expected that the study will commence later this year.

Following detections by Revenue Commissioners' officers, a number of publicans have been successfully prosecuted for such offences in the last few years. However, there is no evidence that this problem is widespread or increasing. Strengthened offence and penalty provisions were introduced in the 2005 Finance Act to deal with such offences.In addition, representatives of the Irish spirits trade have recently voiced their objections to the introduction of a tax stamps system. For producers and processors there would be the additional cost of installing and maintaining the stamping machinery and technical difficulties leading to reduced efficiency for bottling and other packaging. There would also be a burden for importers who would have to either arrange for the stamps to be affixed in the country of origin, or for stamping and repackaging after importation. At present the costs to the trade would be disproportionate to the risks of illegal sales. It is not proposed to introduce tax stamping for alcohol products at this stage. However, the situation will be kept under review.

The purpose of the review is to consider whether the list of events designated in 2003 should be amended. As part of the review I initiated a public consultation process. My Department also wrote to sporting organisations and broadcasters. I have received submissions from event organisers, broadcasters and members of the public via written submission, e-mail and on an Internet forum. A report on the review is being prepared in my Department and I intend to complete the review shortly.If, following the review, I decide to amend the list of designated events, then, in accordance with the provisions of the Broadcasting (Major Events Television Coverage) Act 1999, I will publish my intention to do so and seek the views of interested parties. This would involve a further formal consultation with event organisers and broadcasters. EU approval would also be required before I could lay an order before both Houses of the Oireachtas to give effect to the designation.The designation of events as events of major importance to society provides a right of access to qualifying broadcasters, that is, broadcasters who provide near universal coverage, to provide coverage of a designated event on free television services subject to normal commercial considerations for broadcasting rights.

While any capital expenditure by Bord Gáis Éireann is subject to my approval, given with the consent of the Minister for Finance, the actual cost is commercially sensitive information in a liberalised market. BGE financed this project from its own resources and did not receive any State or EU funding. There was no deferral of the annual dividend payment. Consent under section 39A of the Gas Act 1976, as amended, to construct the Galway spur pipeline was issued by the CER in August 2002.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The current legislative debate on immigration reform in the US Congress involves differing approaches and strongly held opinions. Some members of Congress, for example, are strongly opposed to any proposals which would allow undocumented people the opportunity to regularise their status. Another point of divergence surrounds discussion of the length of time which bearers of a new category of worker visa, were it to be introduced, might be permitted to remain in the US. Some US legislators argue that the period of residence must be finite while others, such as Senators Kennedy and McCain, believe — as we do — that bearers of such worker visas should have open to them a path to permanent residency. It is clear that achieving the necessary compromise remains a formidable challenge.The Government will continue to lobby intensively on this issue in the critical period ahead, including over the St. Patrick's Day period, emphasising our support for measures that would allow the undocumented an opportunity to regularise their residency status. In this regard, we will continue to make known our support for the inclusion in any final compromise legislation of the key elements of the approach put forward by Senators Kennedy and McCain.There is, of course, considerable legal migration by Irish people to the US prompted in part by transfers within US companies but also, increasingly, by the needs of Irish companies establishing a presence in the US. In 2004, over 18,000 non-immigrant worker visas were issued to Irish citizens, with most of these sponsored by their employers. There are possibilities for renewal of certain categories of worker visas.The network of Irish immigration centres is a valuable resource in providing information and advice on possible options. These centres are located across the US and work closely with the embassy in Washington and with our consulates-general in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco. Their work is strongly supported by the Government, including through substantial annual funding.Against a background of huge domestic sensitivity in the US on the immigration issue, the Deputy can be assured that the overall situation is receiving the most rigorous ongoing monitoring and assessment.

However, significant work has already commenced on the rationalisation of occupational health and safety legislation generally. For example, the Health and Safety Authority is currently considering submissions received on foot of the public consultation process for draft updated safety, health and welfare at work — construction — regulations and new draft safety, health and welfare — general application — regulations, which include updated proposals on the use of work equipment generally. I understand from the Health and Safety Authority that there will be requirements on employers concerning the use of all machinery in these new regulations. Such requirements will be based on the principles of hazard identification and risk assessment.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The legislative provisions on late claims for social welfare payments are set out in section 241 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 and in statutory instruments. These provisions set out the times within which a person must claim the disqualifications which apply where a claim is made late and the circumstances in which the time limits may be extended. All late claims are determined in accordance with legislation. It is a requirement that persons claim their entitlements within a specific period and if they fail to do so, a statutory disqualification is incurred.Lack of knowledge by itself is not regarded as a sufficient reason for not claiming in time. The Department publishes information leaflets as widely as possible and advertises changes of legislation in the national press. Information offices are located throughout the country for people to make inquiries as to their entitlements. Information is also available through the wide network of citizens' information centres under the auspices of Comhairle. Decisions on late claims are made by a deciding officer who must consider what is a reasonable level of knowledge to be expected in the particular case and each case is examined on its own merits.Since 1997, a number of improvements have been made to the provisions relating to late social welfare claims. For instance, prior to 1997, arrears of contributory pension claims were limited to either three months or six months before the date of claim. However, following changes in legislation, arrears can be paid in full on claims made on or after 1 January 1997 for 12 months in the case of old age contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance, retirement pension and widow's and widower's contributory pension. Where a claim under these schemes is more than 12 months late, the period of backdating may be extended and payment made on a scaled basis.The legislation also provides for payment to be made on foot of late claims in the case of a range of other schemes for a period of six months prior to the date of claim, provided there was good cause for the late claim. In the case of invalidity pension, backdating up to six months is not dependent on good cause. In the case of child benefit, payment can be made from the date of entitlement where good cause existed for the failure to claim on time.The legislation now provides for relaxation of the restrictions on backdating late claims under all schemes apart from unemployment benefit, unemployment assistance, farm assist and supplementary welfare allowance. The legislation also provides for further payment to be made, up to the level of full retrospection, where circumstances warrant, where: the delay was due to incorrect information having been given by my Department; illness or force majeure prevented a person from claiming earlier; or the person is dependent on the arrears of payment to relieve financial indebtedness.Limitations on backdating claims are long-standing features of social welfare provisions both here and in other jurisdictions. These limitations serve a number of purposes, which vary with the nature of the benefit involved.A common purpose in all schemes is to facilitate financial management. If there were no limitation on backdating, the State could be faced with an accumulated liability in respect of long-delayed claims. Another factor is the need to exercise supervision and control functions concerning entitlement to payment. It is necessary to establish that all conditions governing a scheme were satisfied during the period for which backdating of payment is sought.Payments which are means-tested are also subject to limitations regarding back-dating, on the basis that need is the fundamental requirement for entitlement and delay in claiming such payments may not be consistent with a need for such support.The provisions relating to late claims have been subjected to close scrutiny over the years. I am satisfied that the current provisions strike a reasonable balance between, on the one hand, the need to exercise supervision and control of claims, and the requirements of sound financial management and control of public expenditure and, on the other hand, the need for appropriate recognition to be given to cases of genuine hardship or difficulty.A social welfare overpayment occurs when a person is paid in excess of his or her entitlement. A deciding officer of the department determines the period and amount of the excess payment. It is departmental policy to maximise the recovery of moneys overpaid in order to give due regard to the interests of taxpayers and social insurance contributors who finance social welfare payments. In determining the actual amount to be repaid and the method of recovery, the Department takes into account the circumstances of the person overpaid and the circumstances in which the overpayment occurred. Persons are given the opportunity to give their views on the assessment of the overpayment and the proposed method of recovery. They can also bring to the attention of the Department any facts or circumstances they consider relevant to the recovery of the overpayment. In addition the amount of the overpayment to be repaid may be deferred, suspended, reduced or cancelled depending on the circumstances of the case.If recovery of an overpayment is to made by making deductions from ongoing social welfare payments, the agreement of the person concerned is first sought if the arrangement for recovery of the overpayment would result in the person's weekly social welfare payment falling below the supplementary welfare allowance rate appropriate to them.

Rent supplement is not payable to people in full-time education. However, an exception is made for people who are in receipt of certain social welfare payments on a long-term basis who wish to return to full-time education in order to progress from welfare to work. Neither I nor my Department has any function in determining entitlement in individual cases.The executive has advised that it has thoroughly examined all information available to it about the circumstances of the person concerned, in considering her application for rent supplement in her college location, and has determined that she is not eligible on the basis that she is a full-time student. It has further advised that this decision has been upheld by the executive's designated appeals officer.
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	395	The Deputy will be aware that the case in question has been a subject of previous correspondence in relation to the person's entitlement to a reduced rate contributory pension. The question at issue at this stage relates to entitlement to credited contributions, retrospectively for periods spent outside the workforce.PRSI credited contributions are an integral part of the social insurance system. The primary purpose of PRSI credits is to secure social welfare benefits and pensions of insured workers by covering gaps in insurance where workers are not in a position to pay PRSI, such as during periods of unemployment, illness or caring. In order to qualify for social insurance credits a person must have previously worked and paid PRSI at the ordinary or modified rate of contribution, must have paid or credited contributions in the last two contribution years and must show evidence of underlying entitlement to the contingency giving rise to the credited contribution, such as illness, unemployment or maternity. In addition, credited contributions are provided in particular circumstances for periods of studying or training or when undertaking work as a volunteer development worker.If, at any stage since starting work, a claimant develops a gap of more than two complete tax years in his or her social insurance record, he or she will not be entitled to credits and will need to return to work and pay PRSI contributions for a further 26 weeks before eligibility for credits is restored. Contributions paid at Classes S, J, K or M cannot be used to satisfy this condition.Separate arrangements have been put in place to protect the long-term social insurance pensions of men and women who spend periods outside the workforce for caring purposes under the homemakers scheme. A scheme providing the option of making voluntary PRSI contributions also exists which allows previously insured workers to maintain their entitlement to long-term benefits such as old age pension.The range of opportunities available to insured workers to maintain and build a contribution record is quite comprehensive but consistently reinforces the underlying premise that credits are linked to a temporary detachment from the labour force. Previously, as now, quite a number of women who were not in receipt of a social welfare payment, for example because of means, but who can shown an underlying entitlement to that payment were awarded credited contributions. There is no scope to award credited contributions retrospectively in the circumstances outlined.

To that end a number of targets, specifically for travellers, have been set in the plans covering these areas.My Department, through the office for social inclusion, OSI, has responsibility for overseeing the implementation and co-ordination of the NAP/inclusion process. The next NAP/inclusion, to cover the period 2006-08, is due in September this year. An extensive consultation process has been undertaken, aimed at informing the development of the next NAP/inclusion. This process highlighted the fact that Travellers' issues should remain a priority in the new plan.The NAP/inclusion consultation process informs policy makers and social partners considering social issues and contributes to the formulation of realistic targets in the next social partnership agreement, NAP/inclusion and national development plan. My Department is represented on the high level group of senior officials which is overseeing progress on Traveller issues. As far as the social welfare system specifically is concerned, my Department has set out in its customer service charter and action plans the commitments, in terms of service delivery, for all customers including those who are members of the Traveller community.Groups such as Travellers can access services such as the employment support services, including the back to education and the back to work schemes, in the same way as for other members of the community. These supports aim to help people access employment or to enhance their education so as to improve their opportunities for employment and training.

Search and rescue services are provided through a combination of emergency response services provided by the coast guard and other services provided by a number of charitable and voluntary organisations dedicated to search and rescue.The principal air and sea rescue resources in Ireland are Coast Guard 24-hour, all-weather helicopters based at Dublin, Waterford, Shannon and Sligo Airports, over 50 coast guard units around the coast, RNLI Lifeboats and the community inshore rescue service. The Irish Coast Guard is also assisted, when required, by the Irish Air Corps and the Irish Naval Service. The Irish Coast Guard and its UK equivalent, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, co-operate in air and sea rescue should the need arise.The Irish Coast Guard co-ordinates air and sea search and rescue operations, including those services provided by charitable and voluntary organisations. It also ensures that appropriate personnel, training, equipment and facilities are in place among its many declared resources. Coast guard rescue co-ordination centres at Dublin, Malin Head and Valentia and a nation-wide communications network are positioned and equipped to receive distress calls and co-ordinate response to incidents around the coastline and sea areas.

With new sections of the major interurban routes being opened, the length of continuous motorways is expanding especially on routes such as the M1, the M-N4 and the M-N7. I recently asked the NRA, which has responsibility in the area, to review its stated policy of avoiding the placement of service areas on motorways. It has indicated that the provision of service areas on motorways and dual carriageways at intervals of approximately 50 to 60 km is one of the options under consideration by it.

Unless a penalty is expressly specified in respect of a particular offence in the road traffic Acts, the general penalty applies. This is a maximum fine of €800 for a first offence and a maximum of €1,500 for a second or subsequent offence. Where a third or subsequent offence is committed within any period of 12 consecutive months, the court can impose a maximum fine of €1,500, and-or up to three months imprisonment.The vast majority of the financial penalties which apply under the road traffic Acts were revised in 2002 and details of the monetary penalty in respect of each statutory provision are set out in section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. The level of fine that may be imposed in any individual case is at the discretion of the courts. Details of monetary penalties set post-2002 are contained in section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2003, in sections 18, 19, 23, 30 and 34 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and in section 138 of the Railway Safety Act 2005.

When a search and rescue helicopter is only carrying a casualty as well as its crew it is permitted to land at an unapproved site in accordance with international search and rescue regulations. These search and rescue regulations are international safety regulations which adhere to the highest emergency and safety standards and as such the IAA is not in a position to amend them.

The level of service at this test centre is generally consistent with service levels in other centres. The allocation of driver testers to test centres is kept under review having regard to the demand for tests.As part of a package of measures to deal with the backlog of driver testing applications, my Department is in the process of recruiting extra driver testers. A total of seven staff members from the Department of Agriculture and Food have commenced training as driving testers in my Department and, subject to passing the course, will be based in various regional locations around the country, including the Cork region.My Department is also in the process of recruiting ten driver testers through an open recruitment competition organised by the Public Appointments Service. It is anticipated that successful candidates will commence training in April and will commence testing in June 2006.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	404	While the European Commission has recommended that all EU member states should move to introduce a blood-alcohol limit of 50 mg per 100 ml of blood, there are no legislative proposals at EU level for harmonisation of blood alcohol levels.The position of the Government on drink driving policy is set out in a comprehensive manner in the road safety strategy 2004-06. This recognises our priority is to improve compliance with the existing 80 mg per 100 ml of blood limit rather than move to new limits. We apply an 80 mg limit with very strict application of driving disqualification. Lower blood-alcohol limits operating in some countries do not necessarily attract such strict penalties.The statistics indicate that those detected for drink driving have blood-alcohol levels well in excess of the legal limit. Some 89% of blood and urine specimens and 81% of breath specimens analysed in 2003 by the Medical Bureau of Road Safety were above the alcohol limit for driving. However, it is more worrying that over half of those who failed blood or urine tests and almost one third of those who failed breath tests had alcohol contents at least twice as high as the legal limit. The limit, therefore, is being ignored by a core number of drivers who refuse to obey the law.I will introduce legislation during the current Dáil session for the purpose of extending the basis for which a roadside breath test can be requested. The question of reducing the limit will be kept under review but the priority at present is to increase the chances of being breathalysed and heighten the deterrent effect.

A working group comprising motorcycle interests has been considering the appropriate standards that will apply in this area and the standards that instructors must comply with. Overseeing the introduction of such training will be the responsibility of the proposed road safety authority. Primary legislation is necessary to facilitate the introduction of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists and the necessary amendment to the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004 will be brought forward as soon as practicable.In order to ensure that a high standard of instruction is available to drivers proposals developed by my Department for the regulation and quality assurance of driving instruction will involve a test of the competence of individual driving instructors. A working group comprising representatives of my Department and of instruction interests has formulated the design of the standards that a driving instructor must meet. The standard will set out criteria for entry to the driving instructor profession and the three part exam comprising a written exam, a practical driving test and a test of instructional capability that instructors will have to pass in order to be registered.Responsibility for implementing the standard of driving instruction and establishing a register of driving instructors will be with the proposed road safety authority. I am considering what arrangements will be put in place to oversee implementation of the standard in the context of the establishment of the authority. As part of this process the standard referred to above will form the basis for a consultation document to be issued in the next few months which will set out the requirements that driving instructors will have to comply with in order to be registered.

The RDTFs work in a partnership manner, similar to the local drugs task forces, and are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sectors and elected public representatives.Following the assessment of regional plans submitted by the RDTFs, approvals were granted in September 2005 and allocations totalling just under €5 million on an annual basis, exclusive of a contribution towards administrative costs, were made to the ten regional drugs task forces. Work on the implementation of the projects identified in these plans then commenced. To date a total of €659,120 has been drawn down by the RDTFs. Details of the allocations and spend of the ten RDTFs are set as follows.

The details are given in the following table.Travellers are one of a number of target groups that benefit under the community development programme. While a significant number of the 185 projects within the programme would identify Travellers among beneficiaries of their activities, services, 20 projects specifically focus on providing Traveller support. Training courses, support groups, provision of information, work experience, and child care provision are examples of the type of supports typically made available.The local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, aims to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion through the provision of funding and support to local partnerships. Area partnerships and community partnerships across the country run programmes and courses that specifically target the Traveller community under the LDSIP. These include projects that meet the needs of Traveller men concerning stabling, training and economics of their horses and also acts as a forum for development work with Traveller men; primary health care training, preparing Traveller women to be health promotion workers in their community and also works with Traveller men, through training; dedicated homework clubs for and youth workers for Traveller children; projects that aim to provide family support and educational opportunities for Travellers; and active citizen initiatives. Also, Navan Travellers workshop, a community partnership set up with a primary focus on the Traveller community, received €168,000 through LDSIP in 2005.My Department is also represented on the high level group on Travellers' issues, whose report is due to be published shortly.

Compensation is normally paid only where my Department requires the compulsory slaughter of a herd or flock, which it does not in the case of an outbreak of mycoplasma gallisepticum.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	412	Decisions on the future of sugar beet growing in Ireland for sugar production are a matter for Irish Sugar Limited and the growers concerned, having regard to all relevant factors including the reformed EU sugar regime. The new regime provides for compensation arrangements, including restructuring aid in the event of a decision to cease sugar production. To qualify under the restructuring scheme, the sugar processor would have to renounce the sugar quota and close a sugar factory. To be eligible for the maximum rate of restructuring aid, the factory being closed would have to be fully dismantled. Definitive arrangements for the operations of the restructuring scheme must await adoption of the Commission's implementing rules.The question of establishing a biofuel manufacturing enterprise based on sugar beet would similarly be a matter for commercial decision for interested parties. There is no quantitative restriction on the growing of sugar beet for biofuel production purposes. The budget announcement by the Minister for Finance of a major extension of excise relief on pilot biofuel projects should encourage the production of crops for the manufacture of liquid biofuels.The Commission intends to include sugar beet among the crops eligible under the energy crops scheme. As part of the EU strategy for biofuels, it is intended to review the operation of the energy crops scheme during the coming year and in that context I will be seeking to have the scheme made more attractive for farmers.

The primary basis for the law regarding public order offences is the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994, which modernised the law in this regard. Furthermore, because of my concerns about the abuse of alcohol and its contribution to public order offending and broader social problems, I brought forward tough new provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003. One of the provisions of the Act is to broaden the application of the temporary closure order penalty, which was originally introduced to combat underage drinking, to cover also convictions for a series of offences, such as a licensee supplying intoxicating liquor to drunken persons and permitting disorderly conduct on the licensed premises.The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 has also been enacted, the main purpose of which is to provide the Garda Síochána with additional powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking. It does this by providing for the closure of premises such as pubs, off-licences, late night clubs and food premises where there is disorder or noise on or close to the premises, as well as the making of exclusion orders on individuals convicted of a range of public order offences, in addition to any penalty they might receive under the 1994 Public Order Act. Operation Encounter, an ongoing operation introduced by the Garda Commissioner in 2002, addresses public disorder and anti-social behaviour by targeting offences under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, 1994 and the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1988 and 2003.I am informed by the Garda authorities that local Garda management is aware of the ongoing anti-social behaviour problems in Leixlip village at weekends. The Garda authorities have recently served notices under section 4 of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 on the owners of two fast food outlets in the area. The local authority also has the power to introduce by-laws restricting the consumption of alcohol on the street.In addition to regular patrols, a Garda van is deployed every Saturday night specifically tasked with tackling the problems outlined by the Deputy. This enforcement activity by local Garda personnel is supplemented by the divisional task force and traffic corps personnel as well as the district patrol car and detective unit.I am also informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength, all ranks, of Leixlip Garda station at 31 December 1997 and 31 December 2005 was 11 and 25, respectively. This represents an increase of 14, or 127%, in the number of gardaí allocated to Leixlip Garda station during this period. Levels are constantly monitored and reviewed to meet the policing needs of the area. Local Garda management is satisfied with the current personnel levels in Leixlip.

His claim for refugee status was considered under the process then applicable and was refused by the asylum division of my Department. He was notified of the decision on 1 March 2000. His subsequent appeal was refused by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and he was notified of this recommendation by letter on 14 November 2000.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 the person concerned was also informed on 14 November 2000 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of him. He was, in accordance with the Act, given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons he should not be deported but be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before the order was made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order. Representations setting out reasons he should not be deported were subsequently received. I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision. This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.

The father, accompanied by a then five year old child, arrived the following April 1998 and made an application for asylum. The mother gave birth in the State in February 1999 and they sought permission to remain on that basis. Permission to reside based solely on their parentage of an Irish born child was granted in August 1999. In July 2003 a visa application was made on behalf of the person in question, a now 16 year old female, to enable her join the family in the State, but this application was unsuccessful.Following the decision of the Supreme Court in the cases of L & O, the separate procedure which then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish born child ended in February 2003. The Government also decided that the general policy of allowing such parents to be joined in the State by other family members would no longer apply. Accordingly, the immigration division of my Department does not generally approve visas in respect of such visa applications.As stated in my reply to the Deputy's Parliamentary Question No. 180 of 9 February 2006, it is open to the person concerned to submit a new application for a visa. However under Government policy as outlined above it cannot be assumed that a visa would be granted. Any new application would need to clearly show special circumstances over and above those of others in a similar situation which would warrant a special concession in this case. Arrangements are being made to ensure the safe return of the passport to the appropriate address.

Since the organisation was established in 1892, these Land Registry maps, now numbering about 32,000 active sheets, have been kept exclusively in paper format.I am also informed that these Land Registry map sheets are available for inspection within the public offices of the Land Registry between the statutory public office hours of 10.30 a.m. and 4.30 p.m., Monday to Friday, excluding public holidays, on payment of a fee of €2.50, as prescribed by land registration fees order.I am further informed that maintaining and providing access to these unique maps in paper format carries certain limitations and overheads and a programme is currently underway to convert the entire map base into digital maps. Contracts to digitise the existing paper map record and to build a new computer system for storing, maintaining and processing the new digital maps were awarded in June 2005. The development, testing and implementation of the new computerised digital mapping system is now nearing completion and the projected "go live" date is 28 April 2006. At that stage, customers of the Land Registry who subscribe to the office's on-line system known as the electronic access service, EAS, will, for the first time, be able to view the Land Registry maps for the entire country on-line and conduct electronic inspections and associated index inquiries. Access will also be provided for customers who visit the public offices operated by the Land Registry.This project also includes a programme to digitise each of the registered boundaries of the 2.4 million or so parcels of land registered in the Land Registry. This is a considerable undertaking, which will take an estimated five years to complete. However, the work is already well underway and the first county — Westmeath — is expected to be complete by 28 April 2006.The Land Registry also maintains maps of individual registered land parcels known as "filed plans". Originally, these documents were maintained as paper records only. However, as a result of a major programme of computerisation between 2001 and 2004, these documents were converted into electronic format and have, since then, been available to customers of the Land Registry who use the EAS. It is also possible to order official copies of these filed plans and other Land Registry records on-line through the EAS, by post and through attendance at the public offices.

My Department, through the probation and welfare service, commenced funding the project on 1 January 2004, at an annual cost of €400,000. Prior to that date, funding was provided by the Department of Education and Science from the children at risk fund.My Department agreed to commence funding the project on condition, inter alia, that the project would be a pilot for day centres, provided for under the Children Act 2001; referrals to the project would be from the courts; and the project would work to its full capacity, that is, five young people in attendance at any given time.It was anticipated that this project would become a pilot day centre as provided for under the Children Act 2001. However, in order to meet the day centre requirement of the Children Act, a number of changes were required to the existing services being provided by the project. Unfortunately, I am informed that the project was unable to meet those requirements. I am further informed that since January 2004 until its closure in December 2005, the project only dealt with six referrals of young people who were before the courts.I am advised that at a meeting held on 2 December 2005, the board of management concluded that the project was no longer viable and that the company would cease trading on 8 December 2005. I should also point out that the board of management of the project requested that the substantial funding which had been invested in the project by my Department be utilised in the future to provide alternative programmes for the same target group within the catchment area. I am glad to say that the probation and welfare service is currently in discussion with a locally based project regarding the provision of a service under the terms of the Children Act 2001.I am also advised by the Department of Education and Science that all schools in Dublin 11 have access to educational psychological assessments for their pupils, either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, of the Department of Education and Science or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, that is administered by NEPS. Vocational schools in that area have access to the psychological service provided by the City of Dublin VEC.A small number of schools in Dublin 11 do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them. In those cases, schools may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS and NEPS will pay the psychologists fees directly for this assessment. Details of this process and the conditions that apply to the scheme are available on that Department's website.I am further advised that NEPS provides assistance to all school communities that experience critical incidents, regardless of whether or not they have a NEPS psychologist assigned to them. Also, in respect of all schools, NEPS processes applications for reasonable accommodation in certificate examinations for the State Examinations Commission.

Under the Act, it is an offence to have any knife, or any article which has a blade or which is sharply pointed, in any public place; to be in possession of a knife, or any weapon of offence, while on any premises as a trespasser; to produce, in a manner likely to intimidate another person, any article capable of inflicting serious injury in the course of committing an offence or in the course of a dispute or a fight.A member of the Garda Síochána may arrest, without warrant, any person who is, or whom the garda, with reasonable cause, suspects to be, in the act of committing any such offence. In so far as the offence of possessing a knife, or any bladed or sharply pointed article, in any public place is concerned, it shall be a defence for a person to prove that he or she had good reason or lawful authority for having the article in their possession.Where a number of people are congregated in a public place and a breach of the peace is occurring, or a member of the Garda Síochána believes is likely to occur, a garda may search, without warrant, any person suspected of possessing a knife, or any bladed or sharply pointed article. Furthermore, a garda may search any one of a number of persons present even if he or she has no reason to suspect that any particular person present possesses a knife or other offensive weapon. A person found guilty of the illegal possession of a knife or other offensive weapon may be fined up to €1,270 and imprisoned for up to five years.

Indeed, the number of PLC places approved for 2005-6 is up by more than 1,600 on the 2004-05 level. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. Government support for the sector is evident not only in the expansion of approved places and teachers, but also in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998. Tuition fees for PLC courses are waived. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as in higher education. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some €23 million in direct support. PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplemental non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005. It is evident that Government commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant.The McIvor report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve at a minimum the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million. This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education. It must be recognised that PLC provision is only one aspect of my Department's overall strategy in the field of further and adult education.In their consideration of the needs of the PLC sector into the future, my officials have been examining, inter alia, the non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of PLC providers. Future decisions on funding in this area will be taken in the light of the prevailing priorities and the totality of demands for resources across the system. When their deliberations have been completed further discussions with the relevant stakeholders will be necessary.

Under current arrangements the enrolment figure required for the appointment of a mainstream class teacher in a Gaeltacht school is the same as that which applies in the case of an ordinary primary school. However the figure required for the retention of a mainstream class teacher in a Gaeltacht school is lower in the case of posts up to and including the 12th mainstream teacher, relative to ordinary primary schools.I am aware of the unique position of primary schools situated in Gaeltacht areas and of the particular problems that they experience as a result of losing teaching posts. This retention policy has applied to Gaeltacht schools since the 1999-2000 school year. Officials in my Department are preparing the revised staffing schedule for the 2006-07 school year and this will be issued to the boards of management of all primary schools shortly.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	439	As the Deputy is aware, I have already stated that the senior cycle Irish curriculum will be reviewed as a matter of priority, with a view to ensuring that students achieve greater competence in both oral and written Irish and making learning the language more enjoyable for all students, male and female, at both ordinary and higher level. The review will examine the syllabus content and assessment methods and make recommendations in respect of these. The NCCA is also examining the Irish syllabuses for the junior certificate as part of its review of junior cycle.It is my belief that both curriculum and assessment are powerful levers for improving students' interest levels in individual subjects and in raising their levels of achievement. It is not my intention to propose extra tuition time for leaving certificate Irish.

Under these Acts, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institutes are matters for which the governing bodies and management staff are responsible.Under the provisions of the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999, institutes may seek delegated authority from the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, allowing them to validate and make awards in their own right in line with HETAC policy, criteria and procedures. In September 2004, Dundalk Institute of Technology was awarded delegated authority from HETAC to make awards up to and including level 9 on the national framework of qualifications. In accordance with HETAC's delegation of authority, the institute validates all programmes through the established academic quality assurance procedures.My Department has sought clarification from Dundalk Institute of Technology on the issues raised. I understand the two programmes in question are being validated through the institute's own academic quality assurance procedures and in accordance with the delegation of authority granted by HETAC. In the event of either or both of these programmes not being validated by June 2006, the institute will inform prospective students and advise them of their right to exercise a change of mind option.I understand the position in regard to students who commenced their studies in food science in the current academic year is that they were offered places on a higher certificate course with the possibility of progressing to add-on ordinary and honours bachelor degrees. I further understand they were informed that an ab initio degree in food science is in the process of being validated and that they would have the option of transferring to this degree course if and when it is validated and approved.My Department will liaise with the institutes of technology in the coming weeks regarding the approval of their operational programmes and budgets for the next two academic years, 2006-07 and 2007-08.

In order to consider the matter thoroughly, a review of second level education provision in the area is under way. This review is being carried out in consultation with the school authorities, which will take into account factors such as current and projected pupil numbers at the school, the likely impact of housing developments and existing provision in the general area. A decision will then be taken on how best to provide for current and emerging needs and, if necessary, site acquisition will be initiated.

The functions of the NCSE, as set out in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 are: to disseminate to schools, parents and such other persons as the council considers appropriate information relating to best practice, nationally and internationally, concerning the education of children with special educational needs; in consultation with schools, health boards and such other persons as the council considers appropriate, to plan and co-ordinate the provision of education and support services to children with special educational needs; in consultation with schools and such persons as the council considers appropriate, to plan for the integration of education for students with special educational needs with education for students generally; to make available to the parents of children with special educational needs information in regard to their entitlements and the entitlements of their children; to ensure the progress of students with special educational needs is monitored and that it is reviewed at regular intervals; to assess and review the resources required in regard to educational provision for children with special educational needs; to ensure a continuum of special educational provision is available as required in regard to each type of disability; to review generally the provision made for adults with disabilities to avail of higher education and adult and continuing education, rehabilitation and training, and to publish reports on the results of such reviews, which may include recommendations as to the manner in which such provision could be improved; to advise all educational institutions concerning best practice in respect of the education of adults who have disabilities; to advise the Minister in regard to any matter relating to the education of children and others with disabilities; to consult with such voluntary bodies as the council considers appropriate, being bodies whose objects relate to the promotion of the interests of, or the provision of support services to, persons with disabilities, for the purposes of ensuring their knowledge and expertise can inform the development of policy by the council and the planning and provision of support services; and to conduct and commission research on matters relevant to the functions of the council and, as it considers appropriate, to publish in such form and manner as the council thinks fit the findings arising out of such research.More than 70 special educational needs organisers, SENOs, have been employed by the council since September 2004. They have been deployed on a nationwide basis, with at least one SENO being deployed in each county. The role of the SENO is as provided for in the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004. While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections relate mainly to the statutory assessment and education plan process for which the Act provides. These cannot come into effect without the NCSE having an opportunity to present an implementation report to my Department, which it must do before 1 October 2006. The council is currently engaged in a consultative process with a view to the submission of the implementation report.

At present, almost all five year olds and half of four year olds attend junior infant and senior infant classes in primary schools. Outside of junior classes in primary schools, my Department's main role in the area of early childhood education focuses on pre-school provision for children from disadvantaged areas, Traveller children and those with special needs.The bulk of pre-school places are financed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which has provided unprecedented levels of funding for child care in recent years. The Department of Health and Children also provides grants to child care groups, including community groups in areas of social and economic disadvantage.A Government decision was made in December 2005 to establish an office of the Minister for children. The decision to establish the office of the Minister for children will bring together the relevant staff working on the range of functions in the Departments of Health and Children, Justice Equality and Law Reform, and Education and Science, to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young persons. A new early years education policy unit has been established in my Department and it will be co-located in the office of the Minister for children in accordance with the Government decision. Decisions of a policy nature relating to early childhood education will now be pursued as part of the overall strategic policy framework developed by the office of the Minister for children.The new action plan for educational inclusion — delivering equality of opportunity in schools, DEIS — which I launched in May 2005, aims to concentrate early childhood education actions on those children, aged from three up to school enrolment, who will subsequently attend the 150 urban or town primary schools participating in the new school support programme and identified as serving the most disadvantaged communities. The identification process is nearing completion and we anticipate being in a position to issue an invitation to selected schools to participate in the new integrated school support programme shortly.The Department of Education and Science will work in partnership with other Departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing child care programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated way. A strong emphasis will be placed on adding value to the work of other providers by embedding quality early learning within child care provision.The Early Start programme is a pre-school intervention programme targeted at three to four year old children in areas of social disadvantage. With this programme, young children can experience an educational programme to enhance their overall development, help prevent school failure and offset the effects of social disadvantage. The Early Start pre-school project was established in 40 primary schools in designated areas of urban disadvantage in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Waterford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.My Department currently funds 46 pre-schools for Traveller children with 48 pre-school classes. In the special needs sector, there are currently 15 pre-school classes for children with autism located throughout the country. In addition to this, 12 stand-alone autism facilities that provide an applied behavioural analysis, ABA, model of response to children with autism cater for a number of children of pre-school age. My Department has also sanctioned the establishment of a pre-school for six children with hearing impairment on a pilot basis. In addition, the Department provides a home tuition grant to a number of pre-school children with autism.

Membership of the council was agreed in 2001 following consultations with relevant representative groups, including gaelscoileanna, Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta and Comhdáil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge.The council is composed of: one chairperson nominated by the Minister; three nominees of Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta; three nominees of gaelscoileanna; two nominees of teachers — one each from a Gaeltacht school and a gaelscoil; two nominees of parents — one each from a Gaeltacht school and a gaelscoil; two nominees of school management — one each from a Gaeltacht school and a gaelscoil; four nominees of teacher unions — two each from primary and post-primary school; two nominees of the Minister; one nominee of Foras na Gaeilge; one nominee of Comhdháil Náisiúnta na Gaeilge; and two members co-opted by an chomhairle, such members to have a particular knowledge of and expertise in the study and research of the Irish language.With regard to the nominations of teachers, parents and school management, it was agreed with my Department that the nominations would be a matter for gaelscoileanna and Eagraíocht na Scoileanna Gaeltachta, subject to the proviso that the elected persons would be members of a board of management of a gaelscoil or Gaeltacht school.The first four-year term of office of the chomhairle is due to end on 11 March 2006. It was agreed at the autumn 2005 meeting of the chomhairle, at the request of two organisations, that the nominations for future elections in regard to the parent, teacher and management representatives of Gaeltacht schools and gaelscoileanna would be organised directly by the chomhairle. A document outlining a five-stage process was approved at the board meeting of 24 November 2005 and is accessible at www.cogg.ie.These rules were prepared by a sub-committee and later approved by the board of the chomhairle but, as the election progressed, it emerged they were not sufficiently detailed to deal with a number of issues which subsequently arose. Given that there has not been sufficient time for these specific issues to be discussed and agreed in advance of the election, I have agreed to extend the term of office of the current board for a further period as an exceptional matter. This will allow time for the chomhairle to engage in detailed discussions with the relevant interests to allow for the election procedures to be specified in greater detail and agreed with the parties concerned.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	449	Details of the number of exemptions from Irish granted at primary level are not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy. In the period October 1998 to December 2005 the number of exemptions granted from the study of Irish at primary level was 10,117. Of these, 83% were granted to pupils who had assessed learning difficulties. Some 9% were granted to pupils on the basis that their primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland and 8% were granted on the basis that they were pupils from abroad who had no understanding of English when enrolled and who would be required to study one language only, Irish or English.In the school year 2004-05 there were 19,327 post-primary students with an exemption from the study of Irish. The total number of new exemptions granted at post-primary level in each of the last five years is as follows: year 2000-01- 4,332; year 2001-02 — 4,451; year 2002-03 — 5,296; year 2003-04 — 6,550; and year 2004-05 — 6,588. Virtually all of the exemptions in this period are attributable to the two categories of assessed learning difficulty or students from abroad without English proficiency.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	450	The provision of a safe learning and working environment for both students and school staff is the fundamental responsibility of the school management authorities. In 2004 my Department working with the State Claims Agency decided to assess existing safety standards in schools and provide a structured approach, including the provision of funding, to address any deficiencies identified. The Review of Occupational Health and Safety in the Technologies in Post-Primary Schools was published in December 2005 and addressed potential and actual issues in a large number of areas, including room design and size, fire safety, machinery safety, training and the need for appropriate signage.The review provides valuable guidance to school management authorities and also serves as a reference document for schools to assist them in monitoring progress and in planning for further health and safety improvements. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I allocated €25 million in funding to address the key safety issues in specialist technology rooms of which €20 million was issued to schools in 2005 with the balance of €5 million due to be paid this year. This funding will enable schools to either purchase new equipment or to upgrade existing equipment as appropriate in respect of the technology subjects and to provide adequate safety signage and personal protection equipment.

The upgrading of their equipment, which is continuing, is designed to ensure that the Defence Forces have the necessary equipment to undertake specific roles, including supporting Chapter VII missions under the charter of the UN, involving robust peacekeeping and peace-making.I do not envisage the Defence Forces buying any particular equipment in the context of its possible participation in battlegroups. Participation in battlegroups will not involve increased investment in the Defence Forces to acquire additional capabilities which are not central or key to our primary taskings in peace support operations, defence of the sovereign territory and support to the civil power and the civil authorities, as set out in the White Paper on Defence. Any offer to a battlegroup will be in the context of these capabilities.In terms of training, some level of joint training with other battlegroup elements will be an imperative. The extent of any such joint training, any additional training requirements and whether training will extend to exercising is a matter for decision by battlegroup participants.

There are no plans for the involvement of Naval Service assets in overseas missions, although individual members of the Naval Service may be deployed on overseas peace support operations, as they have been in the past. Moreover, any commitment to a battlegroup will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time as set out in the White Paper on Defence.

The barracks in question were located at Ballincollig, Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare and Islandbridge, Dublin. The value of sales and disposals completed to date in respect of the six barracks the subject of the July 1998 Government decision, together with additional military property which was surplus to military requirements, is in the region of €90 million.The increased level of expenditure on equipment for the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service was made possible by the Government's decision that pay savings arising from the reorganisation of the Defence Forces set out in the White Paper of 2000, along with proceeds from the sale of surplus properties, would be reallocated for investment in modern facilities and equipment.Investment in new equipment for the Defence Forces is provided for under various subheads of the Defence Vote relating to defensive equipment, mechanical transport, aircraft, ships and naval stores, engineering, communications and information technology equipment, etc. All elements of the Defence Forces, the Army, Air Corps, Naval Service and the Reserve have benefited from the investment in new equipment.Over the past six years, in excess of €200 million has been expended on the purchase of 65 armoured personnel carriers and the Javelin missile system for the Army, new patrol vessels for the Naval Service and new trainer aircraft for the Air Corps.The programme of investment is continuing. Early last year, I signed contracts for six new helicopters for the Air Corps costing over €60 million, two of which have already been delivered and are in operational service. Planning is well under way on the replacement programme for the next Naval Service ships to reach the end of their economic life. A contract was signed in December 2005 for an additional 15 armoured vehicles from Mowag in Switzerland at a cost of €36.5 million. The 15 APCs will be delivered in 2007.A tender competition for the replacement of the existing FN 9mm Browning automatic pistol is now in train. It is expected that an order will be placed in the first quarter of 2006. In addition an order has been placed for the provision of 400 general purpose machine guns for delivery this year.There are also ongoing acquisitions of modern equipment for use by soldiers on operational duties. A tender competition was held in 2005 for the provision of body armour for the individual soldier. An order has now been placed for 6,000 units for delivery this year. In addition, a separate tender competition for helmets was also held in 2005 for the acquisition of 12,000 helmets. An order has now been placed for the helmets, which will also be delivered this year. A tender competition will also be held shortly for an individual load carrying system for soldiers and it is expected that this system will also be available by the end of this year.Side by side with the investment in equipment there has been an unprecedented level of expenditure on infrastructure in the Defence Forces in recent years, also made possible by the Government's decision. Almost €200 million has been spent between 1999 and 2005 on the capital investment programme for the upgrade of barracks to provide the Defence Forces with modern accommodation, operational, training and recreational facilities. This year's Estimate for my Department includes €21.8 million for such capital works.It is evident that massive steps have been taken in recent years to modernise Defence Forces equipment and infrastructure and that substantial efforts are continuing on both fronts. The continuation of investment in infrastructure and equipment for the Defence Forces remains a top priority for me.

The general situation in Ireland is that we are substantially reliant on foreign based materials recycling infrastructure, which accounted for 73.8% of recycled waste in 2004.It should be noted that clean segregated materials are a sought after resource which are freely traded under EU and international law. The Environmental Protection Agency stated in the National Waste Report 2004 that, "the export of recyclable waste materials is a trade that cannot be inhibited by member states". The OECD Decision of C(92)39 Final on the control of trans-boundary movements of wastes destined for recovery operations notes that the recovery of valuable materials and energy from wastes is an integral part of the international economic system and that well established markets exist for, and can contribute to, the collection and processing of such materials within member countries.While international trade in waste is consistent with Government policy in so far as it supports improved performance in recycling, the Government also recognises the value of a more developed recycling infrastructure in Ireland. A market development group was established by the Government in 2004 to identify market opportunities for materials recovered for recycling. A market development programme will be developed by the group in 2006.

Section 183 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides for notification of any proposed disposal of land by a local authority to the elected members of that authority, who may resolve that the disposal should not be carried out or that it should be carried out in accordance with terms specified in the resolution. This notification was made to Limerick city councillors in the case referred to in the question in March 2004.A local authority is required to obtain the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to a proposed land disposal only in cases where the price or rent involved is not the best reasonably obtainable. The local government auditor, in the context of the accounts of Limerick City Council for the year ended 31 December 2004, has scrutinised the value obtained from this land disposal and requested Limerick City Council to get an independent market valuation on this site. The auditor's report for 2004 notes the conclusion of that independent valuation that the price paid by the developer for the 0.44 acre site in 2002 was the full market value, having regard to the exceptional price achieved on the open market for a larger and superior shaped site adjoining the subject property.

Details of allocations to individual county councils under the scheme will be announced shortly.The administration of the scheme in its own functional area is a matter for the relevant county council. Each council has responsibility for decisions regarding eligibility and subsequent selection and prioritisation of schemes, subject to the terms of my Department's local improvements scheme memorandum, which issued in February 2002, and circulars which have issued from my Department regarding the scheme.

Section 9 (5) of the Housing Act 1988 allows a local authority to include on its waiting list persons who are living outside their functional area and who in the opinion of the local authority are in need of housing.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	463	My Department issued a circular letter on 25 January 2006 reminding local authorities of their obligations under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 to begin the procedures to take in charge the public services of housing estates once these are completed to a satisfactory standard, where they are requested to do so by the developer or a majority of the residents of the housing development. The circular letter also clearly stated that the existence of a management company to maintain elements of common buildings, carry out landscaping, etc., must not impact upon the decision by the authority to take in charge roads and related infrastructure where a request to do so is made.The position remains that once housing developments are taken in charge, it is the local authority's responsibility to maintain public infrastructure such as roads, footpaths, sewers, water mains and public lighting.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The report, Service Indicators in Local Authorities 2004, showed that 10,176 complaints regarding unauthorised developments were investigated by planning authorities. As this was the first national report on service indicators, no comparable information is available in respect of 2003.In my Department's annual planning statistics, which are based on information returned by planning authorities, the number of prosecutions and convictions for unauthorised development in 2003 and 2004 is as set out in the following table.20032004No. of prosecutions for unauthorised development9161,562No. of convictions196158It should be noted that the figure for convictions is not directly relatable to the figure for complaints or prosecutions, as judgments may be given in a particular year in respect of complaints or prosecutions initiated in a previous year and complaints or prosecutions initiated in a particular year may not decided until a subsequent year.It should also be noted that the number of complaints received by a planning authority in regard to unauthorised developments may be resolved through the issuing of warning letters or enforcement notices; only a small number of cases require to be prosecuted through the courts. I expect that the 2005 figures will be available by July 2006.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-02-23 00:00:00	Prelude	465	My Department's responsibilities in regard to Travellers are to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial framework in place within which local authorities, relevant voluntary bodies, and Travellers may provide or be assisted in the provision, management and maintenance of accommodation for Travellers.The legislative framework is provided by the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998, which requires that all relevant local authorities prepare, adopt and implement programmes for the accommodation of Travellers. The full cost of works associated with the construction of new Traveller-specific accommodation and the refurbishment, to modern standards, of existing Traveller-specific accommodation is funded by my Department.Under the first programmes, which covered the period 2000 to 2004, considerable progress was made in improving the accommodation position of Travellers. An additional 1,371 families were accommodated in permanent accommodation by or with the assistance of local authorities; the number of families on unauthorised sites was reduced from 1,207 at the start of the programmes to 601 at the end of 2004. During the course of these programmes a total of €130 million was provided by my Department to local authorities for the provision and refurbishment of Traveller specific accommodation. This is in addition to expenditure on standard local authority accommodation in which Travellers are also accommodated.Currently, local authorities are in the process of implementing their second programmes for the period 2005 to 2008. A total of €37 million was provided to local authorities in 2005 for the provision of new Traveller-specific accommodation and the refurbishment to of existing Traveller-specific accommodation. I will shortly be in a position to announce the funding available for 2006. Figures from the local authority annual count of Traveller families, which provide one measure of progress under the programmes, are being compiled in my Department and will be published shortly. I expect these will show that progress in the provision of accommodation for Travellers is continuing.In addition to this full and comprehensive package of measures already in place I required local authorities, when adopting their 2005 to 2008 programmes, to specify annual targets for the provision of accommodation for Travellers. Progress towards meeting these targets will be closely monitored by the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee and each local authority's progress will be measured against them on an annual basis. I expect a comprehensive report from that committee on these in due course.In addition to providing the capital cost of Traveller accommodation, my Department also recoups 90% of the costs incurred by local authorities in employing social workers and housing welfare officers working with Travellers. Financial support is also provided to local authorities towards the costs of management and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation. Expenditure in this area has amounted to over €27 million since 2000. A study is currently under way to highlight issues arising in regard to the management and maintenance of Traveller-specific accommodation, with a view to assisting local authorities to improve their activities in this area.My Department continues to take an active part in the high level group on Travellers, which is working to ensure that there is improved co-ordination in the delivery of all services, including accommodation, to Travellers.
