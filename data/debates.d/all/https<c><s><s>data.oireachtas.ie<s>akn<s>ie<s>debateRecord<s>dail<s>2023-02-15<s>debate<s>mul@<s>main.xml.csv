#MattCarthy	unknown-#MattCarthy-party	unknown-#MattCarthy-dob	unknown-#MattCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	1	I am renowned for my brevity so I will try and keep it that way. I sincerely thank the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, for taking this debate. It relates specifically to the issue of respite services in Cavan-Monaghan. She will agree that respite can make a huge difference for the family of a child with disabilities. It is good for the child, it is good for the parents and it is good for the siblings. It is an essential relief that ensures families can continue caring for their own child at home, but with a break to address other responsibilities, catch up on sleep, and provide everyone with a bit of respite. There are a number of issues with respite services in Cavan-Monaghan. For example, there are no such services at all for children in County Monaghan. When the service in County Cavan operates, it operates very well, but it only operates every second week for children. There is also a particular issue relating to the criteria-statement of purpose used by the HSE in Cavan-Monaghan. This is relatively new information to me. While I had often made representations and inquiries on behalf of families seeking respite for their children, I was unaware that different criteria are being used in different regions to determine whether a child can access respite services. In Cavan-Monaghan, the HSE has the strictest criteria-statement of purpose for respite care. It states a child must have a diagnosis of moderate or severe intellectual disability to be even considered. That is not the case in neighbouring counties. For example, according to the HSE response to my parliamentary questions, in counties Sligo and Leitrim the eligibility for a child to access respite care is that the child is known to the children's disability network team, CDNT, direct approval has been made by the children's referral committee and the HSE respite co-ordinator must complete a determination of needs assessment. In counties Louth or Meath, a committee in place bases its decision on the following rationale: children who access services in their respective CDNT, children in the care of the Child and Family Agency, Tusla, and children who live with families where there are multiple instances of disability. Importantly, it also includes children who present with significant behavioural challenges. Essentially, children and their families are being discriminated against based on where they live. When it comes to disability services, above all else, that is not tolerable. I am dealing with one particular family and it is an acute case. The child does not meet the criteria that have been set out for moderate or severe intellectual disability. However, the child has disabilities and profound behavioural and other issues. The child and the family need support. They are going through a horrendous time. The child has not been able to access appropriate education, despite repeated efforts. The family is also going through other issues. Another family member is sick and in long-term hospital care. The Minister of State can imagine the pressure the child's mother is under, yet none of that is taken into consideration in respect of respite care. I have been told by the HSE that it is reviewing the criteria issue. Will the Minister of State give a commitment that it will be expedited, and will she agree to meet with this family to hear first-hand how the current policy is impacting them?

Yes, I will agree to meet the family concerned. I will also take this matter up, before I meet with the family, if the Deputy will give me the case details. While he may feel this just applies to the Cavan-Monaghan region, as far as I am concerned, it is hard to believe and credit in the 21st century that the behavioural barrier is still in place in a lot of places around the country. Depending on the particular provider or organisation, its mission statement might be that it only supports individuals with mild to moderate intellectual disabilities but does not stipulate that it will support children who have behavioural issues. Recently myself and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle read an article from Galway regarding a family who needed access to respite. We know the value of respite. Respite can never ever be underestimated in its value to support a family. Deputy Carthy's area of Cavan-Monaghan is quite an anomaly in the context of the country. Children's respite care is provided every second week for both counties out of one building, the Annalee View Respite Centre. I cannot fault the staff there but they can only do it every second week. It is my ambition to address the lack of children's respite care in the Cavan and Monaghan area. The Deputy happens to be in community healthcare organisation, CHO 1, which covers a large number of counties. It covers Leitrim, Donegal and Sligo as well as Cavan and Monaghan. We have a plan to address children's respite services. Our first move was to source funding for Little Wonders Early Intervention Centre to allow it to provide after-school services for children in early years services with a preschool element. We have put something in place since I met the Deputy last year. That was put in place in September 2022. The plan is to scope out a proper, fit-for-purpose house to meet the needs of children that will have two front doors. One door will be for children who have mild to moderate issues and can have easy compatibility with other children. The second front door will be for children with complex medical and behavioural needs who might not be compatible with other children. We are using this model on the east coast and it is working well. We need to have a service that, rather than providing 840 bed nights in an entire year, is working seven days a week, 52 weeks of the year.

We are at one in respect of where we need to get to and I welcome that. However, for the family I am dealing with now, time is of the essence. I fear that childhood is being impacted and also the well being of the family. If one was to try and make this family's life more difficult, sometimes the responses of the agencies could not do a much better job. One of four children was attending a day respite care service in County Westmeath every Saturday and the child got word without any notice that their placement was being discontinued because they were considered not to be compatible with the service being provided. The Minister of State can imagine the conversations that we are having with this family. That is why I welcome the fact that she has committed to meet with them. We recognise how difficult these issues are but they need to be expedited. I welcome what is being talked about regarding building and expanding the services. The provision of more beds is crucially important. There needs to be a full-time, 52-week of the year operational facility in both Cavan and Monaghan. These are two large counties and I can promise the demand will be met As a matter of urgency, we also need the criteria to change to allow for discretion in the decision-making process. Anybody who has an ounce of compassion, never mind common sense, will agree that in this instance, there has to be a mechanism for this child to have respite care and for the family to have this support. The discretionary element is simply not there at the moment. I urge the Minister to talk to the appropriate officials to change that in the first instance. I will send her the relevant details on to the matters I have raised.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	4	Later on, and not because we are having a Topical Issue debate this morning, I am meeting CHO 1 officials as part of my monthly meetings. I will bring up the point about the discretionary element the Deputy has raised. In the case that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and myself are aware, the child was not on the radar whatsoever of the disability manager in that region. I will raise that in my meeting with CHO 1. Discretion is required. Children should not need a diagnosis if the CDNT knows that a family is in crisis. The circumstance for the carers has changed and the carers need support. The mother must be at the end of their tether trying to support her partner and the other children and still have a child who needs 150% support. The Deputy is correct to raise this matter. Discretion is required at all times and compassion needs to be part of it. In order for the relationship not to break down and in order for us not to have emergency cases where children end up going into full-time residential care, which is not what anybody wants, we need to support the family and the siblings. If the child is non-compatible with the other four, we need to make other arrangements. We need to be flexible and pragmatic. That is my ask of the HSE. Farming children out from one county to another is not how we do business. It is all supposed to be about closest to home, building that relationship and ensuring the children have the support in their own community. Sending a child from Cavan or Monaghan down to Westmeath is not good practice. It tells me that the CHO is under-resourced and does not have enough funding to support the children in its own area. We have a similar situation in County Meath. It is hilarious to think that all the providers in Dublin buy properties in Meath but Meath is not able to fund or support any of its own. We are changing that this year. I will look to do exactly the same with the children's services in the Cavan-Monaghan area
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18333	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	5	The Minister has previously addressed this but I wanted to raise again the issue of access to ophthalmology services in the CHO 4 region, which covers County Kerry, north Cork, north Lee, south Lee and west Cork, which is presenting challenges. More than €200,000 has been spent on private providers in this area in the past while and more than 3,000 children are still waiting for ophthalmology intervention in the area. It appears that recruitment continues to be a significant issue. On 2 December 2022 I received correspondence from the South/SouthWest Hospital Group on foot of representations I made by way of a parliamentary question, where I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, the number of staff, the grade and the length of service of each member currently assigned to ophthalmology services across Cork hospitals and the number of vacancies in the same hospitals. I was told that there were approximately 39 whole-time equivalents in Cork University Hospital, CUH, but that the number of vacancies for whole-time equivalents is two. For South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital, SIVUH, it is 25 with a vacancy rate there of 2.7 whole-time equivalents while in the Mercy University Hospital, MUH, the number that came back is zero. The Minister told me that the South/SouthWest Hospital Group has advised that it "expects the new operating theatres will be opened in March 2023". Will the €5 million ophthalmology unit will become operational in March, as has been articulated in the past? What comfort can the Minister of State give to those people who are seeking to access public services now that the required number of vacancies will be filled? I fully appreciate that the HSE will spend considerable amounts of taxpayers' money on waiting list initiatives but the cost to the Exchequer of waiting list initiatives is increasing dramatically. In November 2021, 39 patients were referred to one of these lists at a cost of €15,000 while in June last year, 559 patients were referred to a private company at a cost of €83,000. If we want to get people through the list, that is fine and I do not think anybody has any issue with that but is not good value for money when we have a unit costing €5 million that is supposed to be for public service sitting there and there are still recruitment issues into the public service. We do not want to see a continuation of a waiting list initiative by private providers when it can be done through the public realm. It all boils down to the 3,022 children waiting for ophthalmology interventions I represent. That is a significant number. I seek comfort from the Minister of State that what the taxpayer has invested in will become operational.

On behalf of the Minister, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Government accepts that access to appropriate care is an important part of maintaining optical health. The HSE provides these services in hospitals and in the community. This includes specialist clinics for complex issues and routine testing by optometrists. Cork Kerry Community Healthcare currently operates paediatric community ophthalmology services across counties Cork and Kerry. The staffing profile of this service includes community ophthalmology physicians, optometrists, orthoptists and nursing staff - I apologise I am getting caught with the words this morning. Recruiting staff to these highly specialised areas can be challenging. However, the need for these specialist staff is recognised by the national clinical programme for ophthalmology. As the Deputy said, ophthalmology services are also provided at three Cork hospitals, namely, Cork University Hospital, the South Infirmary Victoria University Hospital and the Mercy University Hospital. These services combined employed just over 65 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2022. At that time, more than four whole-time equivalents required recruitment. A regional eye care service is currently under development to serve the area. This involves collaboration between Cork Kerry Community Healthcare, the South/Southwest Hospital Group and the SIVUH The service will be based at the new primary community care centre in Ballincollig and will provide a designated specialist infrastructure for community procedures related to ophthalmology. These will be performed by the multidisciplinary team, which includes multiple grades of staff. This will allow maximum use of skills to deliver the best outcomes for children and adults. The project is in line with the national clinical programme for ophthalmology, which recommends the integration of hospital and community care, and that clinicians and care providers work in teams. Efficient operation of such multidisciplinary teams will be essential to delivering primary eye care. Standards of clinical care will be maintained by clear governance structures and clinical audits. A community-based model will improve access to care and will also alleviate some of the pressures on hospital services. The positive effects of a community-based approach can be seen in CHO 6, CHO 7 and CHO 9, where primary care eye teams have been introduced. The teams have made a substantial impact on waiting lists in these CHOs. Their community-based treatments allow hospitals to focus their resources on more complex cases. The building in Ballincollig is operational and ready for equipping to deliver the integrated eye care service. This awaits funding approval from the HSE. However, stakeholders will meet tomorrow, 16 February 2023, to discuss what elements can be operationalised from within existing resources. I feel I have not answered the question. I feel I had a better answer on a previous occasion I responded to a similar Topical Issue matter. I will listen to the Deputy's response.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	18333	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	7	The Minister of State is sending a message back to the machine and the system. I appreciate that. I also appreciate the fact that she is taking this issue on behalf of the Minister and answers are not always readily provided to her. I take some comfort from the fact that the building in Ballincollig is operational and ready for equipping to deliver the integrated eye care service. That gives me grounds for some hope. However, there seems to be a juxtaposition in the reply because the Minister of State's next sentence mentioned that the integrated eye care service "awaits funding approval from the HSE". She also said the stakeholders are meeting tomorrow. I am not directing this at her per se but in her reply, she said the building in Ballincollig is operational and ready for equipping. I need to know if it is going to be fully funded. The ophthalmology unit based in SIVUH, which cost €5 million, is not operational. I need some comfort for the people I represent in the CHO 4 area in order that I can assure them there will be seamless access to services, whether on a community basis or at consultant level. The Minister of State made reference to the involvement of community. There is greater scope for community opticians to become involved in all of this but what they are telling me is that the €23 they get per medical card patient is not worth their while, given the associated administrative burden. Some people are leaving the system. If we are talking about a front-door system, where the front door is a GP or community optician, we must make it financially viable for community opticians to be able to deliver more. They cannot do that at €23 per patient because it does not reflect the cost of providing the service.

The Minister and I appreciate that access to appropriate and timely optical services is a concern for many residents of Cork and Kerry. This is the second time I have answered on this. I assure the Deputy that ophthalmology is a priority issue for the Minister and his Department in 2023. He wants to see reform in this area to ensure people receive the service they require. I mentioned the HSE in my response and said that funding is an issue. Perhaps the fact that the service plan has not been signed off on or has not yet been completed and handed over to the HSE means that is the parcel it is awaiting. Reform in the area includes making the best use of the skills of many talented optical clinicians who live and work in Ireland. The Minister accepts that recruitment continues to be an issue and is liaising with the Minister for Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science with the intention of seeking an increase in the number of professionals trained in optical services. This will be needed, along with targeted recruitment, to increase capacity in the healthcare system and, looking forward, he is eager to see the expansion of community-based care. This will require increased integration between hospital and primary care providers. Success will depend on innovative, effective models of care that make the most of our resources. The collaborative work on the Cork-Kerry regional eye care service has been impressive. This progress offers reassurance that other such patient-centred services can be established in the future. Departmental officials will continue to liaise with Cork Kerry Community Healthcare to monitor the progress of the proposed eye care service. My take away from what the Deputy said relates to the financial viability of community opticians and the role they can play. Perhaps it is something we should look for in CHO areas without such specialist teams.

Outside Dublin, an average of 30% of tourism accommodation has been provided. In the north west, an area with which the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is familiar, the average is as high as 60%. In places such as Rosses Point, it is 100%. In places such as Bundoran, it is approximately 75%. On average, throughout the north west and along the Wild Atlantic Way, the figure is 60%. There are particular issues in areas outside Galway city and Sligo town. As the Minister of State will be aware, 2019 was the last proper year for tourism before the Covid-19 pandemic. We had tourism revenues of €5.2 billion. A reply to a parliamentary question I tabled referred to a direct correlation between every euro spent on accommodation for tourism and money in the economy. According to the Minister, an additional €2 to €3 falls to interdependent businesses within the economy for every €1 spent on accommodation. The same reply stated that while the Department does not have specific research, it is reasonable to say that if we have a 30% reduction in accommodation, there will be a 30% reduction in revenue. That would be in the region of €1.3 billion. Given the disproportionate amount of tourism accommodation involved - between 60% and 100% of the beds in the north west - we are going to suffer a disproportionate impact when the season begins next month. That is a major problem because our economies are hugely dependent on that eight-month season, including restaurants, bars, activity providers, local shops, supermarkets, personal care providers, including hairdressers, and so on.There is going to be a need for a specific scheme to support these businesses. Otherwise, they will quite simply go under.  The other area on which there will be an impact is seasonal employment. Thankfully, we now have the Atlantic Technological University, ATU in our region but many from the region are students in Dublin, Galway, Limerick, Cork and elsewhere and they depend on seasonal employment to save money to cater for their exponentially rising accommodation, living and transport costs and so on. When I raised this with the Tánaiste some weeks ago, I regret to say that he was decidedly dismissive of it. The Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, according to replies I received some weeks ago, has no plans for an intervention. The problem is that we will be here in July talking about something, long after the horse has bolted. I very much hope that the Minister of State will respond positively, alongside his Government colleagues. An all-of-government approach is needed to ensure we have Covid-style supports for the wider business community and seasonal employees who are going to be adversely affected by this reality.

The Deputy has raised the issue of support measures for businesses and individuals dependent on seasonal tourism that may be adversely affected by the reduction in capacity this season due to hotels and other tourism accommodation being used to house international asylum seekers and Ukrainian people fleeing war. I am familiar with every part of the Deputy's constituency and know full well the impact of tourism. He made a strong case regarding the impact that the lack of tourist accommodation will have on such an important sector of the economy of his constituency, particularly in the coastal areas. We are approaching the first anniversary of the start of the war in Ukraine. Since then, Ireland has welcomed 90,000 people between those fleeing Ukraine and other international protection applicants. Of these, more than 70,000 have required State-provided accommodation. This is the largest humanitarian operation ever undertaken by the State and the people, and tourism accommodation has played a significant role in response to this crisis. Tourism is one of the most important indigenous sectors and the use of tourism accommodation to meet humanitarian needs, while necessary in the short term, has led to concerns for everyone involved in tourism. The availability of tourism accommodation has knock-on impacts for other tourism businesses and businesses in the wider local economy. Officials in my Department are engaging with a range of Departments, with input from Fáilte Ireland, to ascertain how best to mitigate the potential impacts on the wider tourism ecosystem of long-term use of tourism accommodation. Analysis is being done on those towns or areas most impacted by the unavailability of tourism accommodation. The Deputy made a strong case on behalf of Sligo, Rosses Point and Bundoran in particular, but also other areas of his constituency.  The strong early recovery of inbound tourism to Ireland last year was welcome but it is fair to say that the tourism industry faces a number of challenges. The industry was disproportionately affected by Covid-19. Hotel capacity, energy costs and labour shortages will continue to challenge the industry this year but, despite the challenges, it has stepped up in a substantial way. In budget 2023, the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media secured €15 million in additional funding for overseas marketing of Ireland. As global competition heightens, sustaining extensive marketing campaigns will be vital to support the ongoing recovery effort, building on the initial inbound tourism demand seen in 2022. The budget also contains an additional €15 million for a range of industry initiatives, including €3 million for a continuation of the investment in skills development and retention and €2 million for domestic marketing. The Minister also secured additional funding of €3 million to allow Fáilte Ireland to continue its work in the area of sustainability. Tourism agencies are working hard to help those in the tourism sector. Tourism Ireland will roll out an extensive and targeted programme of activity in 2023, with a total marketing budget of €78 million. A wide range of promotional activities will be undertaken as well, working with the tourism industry at home and the travel trade overseas to facilitate sales. In addition, Fáilte Ireland will announced its plans for 2023 next week, which will include work in the areas of recruitment and retention of staff and sustainability. The Deputy will be aware of the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which is designed to support businesses with their energy costs over the winter months. The Minister
has received extensive feedback on this scheme from the tourism sector, both in written form and at a recent meeting of the hospitality and tourism forum, which she co-chairs with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney. This feedback has been shared with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael McGrath. Deputy Martin is also aware that the retention of the 9% VAT rate is to the forefront for tourism businesses and individuals right now. The industry views on this were clearly expressed at the recent hospitality and tourism forum meeting.

I know these answers are prepared in advance and I know much of the content already. We know what is being done at the moment but more needs to be done. A strategic approach must be taken to this. I have given examples from my constituency and I have no doubt that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and the Minister of State can give examples from theirs. Indeed, all constituencies are feeling the same proportional impact. The Minister of State said that this is the largest humanitarian effort that Ireland has ever made. Despite the equivalent obligations on Denmark, for example, its effort is half that of ours as a proportion of the population and there is a reason for that. I hope the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be able to facilitate me in contributing to tomorrow's debate on the overall co-ordination of these matters. It is worth noting that since 11 December, the number of Ukrainian refugees welcomed to Ireland went up by 8% but in Denmark it only went up by 0.6%, even though Denmark is much closer to Ukraine. It makes one wonder. In addition, the Minister of State mentioned the 9% VAT rate. Its retention is an absolute imperative. All things being equal, if there was no war and so forth, there may have been a case for bringing that back up in a buoyant, post-Covid tourism market that we would have been able to look forward to but that is done now. We are going to have to support the sector with the 9% VAT rate. I am aware of the energy relief scheme and welcome it but a strategic approach must be taken to support all businesses dependent on tourism in the country. In a welcome way, we are ingratiating ourselves with the world and the European community through our efforts. However, those efforts are not being matched in other countries. We have capacity issues that ultimately, I regret to say, may force us to pause our efforts in solidarity with Ukraine. Again, I restate my hope that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle will be able to facilitate a few words from me tomorrow on that debate.

The work that has been done by the State and the people in welcoming refugees, particularly from Ukraine, over the past year has given a tremendous reputational boost to this country and that will have impacts across the economy and society to the benefit of everyone. We have done the right thing and we will benefit from that, apart from giving benefit to those most in need at this particular time. The Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is acutely conscious of the importance of the tourism sector, particularly in the regions. Tourism accommodation has a significant multiplier effect for businesses and she acknowledges that accommodation stock being taken out of the market brings a multiplicity of challenges, as outlined clearly by the Deputy. The Department has, both at the senior officials' group on Ukraine and beyond, communicated the potential challenges arising for the tourism ecosystem, particularly in those parts of the country, such as the Deputy's constituency, where high proportions of the tourism accommodation stock are directed to humanitarian purposes. A more detailed analysis of the scale of those challenges is being undertaken and will inform decision-making in this area, as will his contribution this morning. The Minister consistently engages with and takes on board the views of the hospitality and tourism sector, particularly around the need to avoid a cliff edge in support and she will continue to engage on this with Government colleagues.

Thankfully, students have been able to return to lectures and laboratories this week but, unfortunately, data from the cyberattack have been published on the dark web. I ask the Minister to outline the extent of the attack, including whether people's personal details have been compromised.Local people have been asking about the data. MTU has some 13,000 students and over 1,000 staff. People have outlined concerns about the possible publication of their data. In addition to current students, there are tens of thousands of past students and staff and also parents who have been paying fees. They are also asking if their personal information has been impacted and at what point they will know about that. I understand the HSE is issuing notices to people impacted by the cyberattack on its systems a year and a half ago. Many would have assumed that if they had not received correspondence by now, they were in the clear regarding that attack, so some were surprised to get a letter. How soon can people affected by the MTU cyberattack expect to be notified? Will a date be provided beyond which they can assume they are clear in the clear or are safe? In addition to personal information, there could be research information, material the college was researching and information relating to intellectual property, preparation for patents, etc. Is any such intellectual property involved? Has it been encrypted, published or compromised in any way? Will the Minister clarify that? Past students seeking to engage in further education or make job applications may wish to access their data for transcripts. Is such information encrypted or is it accessible? Will the Minister outline the extent of the damage in that regard? A recent International Data Corporation, IDC, survey of companies of various sizes across the US and Europe indicated that despite 85% of them having a playbook, preparation or recovery plan to deal with a cyberattack, 46% had been successfully attacked in the past three years. This figure refers only to companies that know they were attacked and admit it. Two thirds were forced to pay a ransom. The MTU attack is, unfortunately, not an isolated indecent. It seems that many different areas and organisations are being hit by ransomware. The same survey found that 43% of respondents had been hit more than once. What measures are now in place at MTU and other colleges to ensure they are protected from future cyberattacks? What measures are being taken with other colleges? Has the Minister met them to ensure they are prepared? As I outlined, a cyberattack does not happen in isolation and steps such as exploratory probing efforts will often be taken beforehand. Was the MTU cyberattack caught on the first alert? Did the university's security system alert it? What happened in the case of any earlier probes? Did they go unnoticed or were they disregarded?

This has been a stressful and worrying time for students and staff in the Munster Technological University campuses in Cork. I thank all of the staff in MTU for the incredible and tireless work they have put in over the past ten days in very difficult circumstances. We need to be clear that cybercrime and cyberterrorism are ever-present and growing threats to the safe operation of our institutions. The Deputy provided figures that show how prevalent cybercrime is becoming. It is a crime and we should always see it as such. It is an attempt to extort money through intimidation. In many ways, it is using a new technology to carry out old crimes, namely, theft and extortion. Following the significant IT breach in Munster Technological University, my Department has been engaging with relevant stakeholders to understand the extent of the breach and its impacts on MTU students and staff. In my second role as Minister for Justice, I have been keeping in contact with the Garda about this and I am conscious of its ongoing efforts in this regard. MTU is working closely with the National Cyber Security Centre, NCSC, in relation to the breach. It is appropriate when a breach happens in any institution that it immediately connects with and plugs into the NCSC. MTU staff and students who may have been affected will now receive specific communications from MTU and all staff and students have been advised to remain extra vigilant to potential phishing attacks by email or SMS or other unsolicited communications. MTU has engaged specialist forensic services to review the nature of the data compromised and track any data that may leak online. The honest answer I must give to some of the Deputy's questions is that the work by specialist forensic services in analysing the exact extent of the data that may have been taken is ongoing. An interim High Court injunction has been granted which prohibits the sale, publication, possession or other use of any data that may have been illegally taken from the university's systems. MTU has contingency plans in place for such an event and this means that core systems such as email, HR, finance, payroll and others are unaffected by this breach and continue to operate as normal. This has enabled the majority of MTU staff to continue working remotely and a return to teaching, which commenced on Monday of this week. MTU students and staff have been advised to check their email accounts and campus notice boards on a regular basis for guidance and updates. Further information and advice on how to spot and protect yourself against phishing attacks are available from the National Cyber Security Centre. MTU has taken swift action to respond to this issue and should be commended on that. I assure MTU and its staff and students that we will work closely to support them in every way we can. On the Deputy's overall point, it is important that we recognise that cybercrime is a growing reality globally and in Ireland. As a result, we need to continue to beef up and further resource our structures to protect people, where possible, from such crimes. I am pleased to say that last year my Department confirmed significant multi-annual funding for cybersecurity resources to HEAnet to build cyber-resilience across our third level system. These resources will help equip HEAnet to expand the reach of its ICT security services offering to all eligible HEA client members, including institutions across the tertiary education system. The Department is also now providing funding to mobilise a sectoral security operations centre and security incident event management service via HEAnet to the education sector to mitigate the risks associated with cyberattacks through a consistent and comprehensive 24-7 detection and response capability. The 24-7 piece is important because these attacks are often timed to happen at weekends or during downtimes and bank holidays. We allocated €750,000 in 2022. I am pleased that, through the Estimates process and the Government's renewed focus on the issue of cybersecurity, an additional €3 million - a significant increase - has been allocated in 2023 for the development of cybersecurity services. Recurrent funding to the HEA, which is disbursed to individual institutions, can also be used for enhancement of IT systems.

An bhfuil an tAire tar éis bualadh leis na coláistí eile? Cad iad na céimeanna atá á mbaint amach chun é sin a chinntiú? Attacks like these do not happen in one go. There are often exploratory attempts beforehand. Was that the case with MTU? Was the attack detected on the first alarm? If there were earlier attempts, how were they viewed or dealt with? What is known about them? Is the attack over at this stage? We have seen that data have been published on the dark web. Is there further information that will be published? Are encrypted data being released? If so, has it been possible to measure the extent of that? Where are the next steps? It is hugely important that support services are available to colleges and institutions in the event of an attack. I welcome the additional funding in that regard. Will additional funding be provided if these institutions need additional equipment in the years ahead? It is too early to be able to say what the cost will be. Will the Minister be able to put in place support for colleges and institutions to take those measures?

I will try to get it from MTU if it is aware of it. The status of the attack is that the damage is now done and data have been taken. It is now about forensic analysis and providing information to people. The work is ongoing, with the forensic analysis under way. I am pleased the college is back open and I commend MTU staff and students in this regard. A huge body of work went into it. Impacted staff and students will shortly receive a specific letter of contact from MTU. In the meantime, the advice is to follow the general cyber hygiene advice on changing passwords and being extra vigilant. All support, advice and funding required by MTU on this matter will be provided. I am very pleased that MTU plugged into the National Cyber Security Centre and liaised with An Garda Síochána. I am conscious that there is work going on in this area. We will continue to work closely on this.

and— the Government's refusal to join other EU countries in leaving the Energy Charter Treaty should be condemned; andcalls on the Government to:— introduce targeted price caps, which would cap prices for average energy use by households and businesses, as soon as possible;— immediately introduce a windfall tax on energy companies and use that money to support struggling consumers and businesses;— commit to reviewing the proposed cap on market revenues for non-gas electricity generators before its proposed June 2023 expiry date with a view to extending it until 2024; and— announce its intention to immediately leave the Energy Charter Treaty.Soaring energy costs are causing turmoil in households and businesses all over the country. Price increases have been relentless, with some energy companies increasing their prices on five separate occasions last year. This maelstrom of price rises can make people feel dizzy, and it is hard to keep track of exactly how high prices are becoming when they are increasing or seem to be increasing every other day. Energy companies are boiling us alive and hoping we do not notice. Worse, they are charging us exorbitant prices for the pleasure of being boiled. Since there is so much opacity regarding price rises, it is important for us to be clear here today. We need clarity so we can truly appreciate just how far and fast energy prices have risen in this country. According to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, Irish residential customers were paying between 15 cent and 18 cent per kilowatt hour for electricity in 2021. In 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine, prices rose by up to 35 cent per kilowatt hour. Last month, these rates spiked to between 43 cent and 45 cent per kilowatt hour. That indicates a rise from 15 cent to 45 cent per kilowatt hour, meaning that energy costs have tripled in two years. On average, residential customers are now paying €4,300 for energy per year. There is no indication that this is the upper limit. In fact, prices could go even higher. There is no precedent in modern history for the speed at which energy prices have increased and the exorbitant prices now being charged. Never before were families expected to pay so much just to ensure they could cook their children a modest meal and keep them warm. Energy is not an optional extra. It does not entail discretionary expenditure that can be excised from budgets to save cash. People and businesses need it to survive. Parents are now enduring extreme stress and worry every day. They are worried about how they will continue to heat their homes and feed their families. Businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, have been hit particularly hard and some have seen their bills quadruple. Many otherwise viable businesses are now contemplating closure simply because they cannot afford to keep the lights on. The price rises being foisted on families and businesses are unprecedented, but so too are the profits being generated by rapacious energy companies. Yesterday the Taoiseach told my colleague Deputy Shortall that Irish energy companies would soon be posting enormous full-year profits for 2022. We can assume that this was a warning to prepare us for more obscene profits from a sector that is merrily profiteering on a war. If their half-year profits are anything to go by, it will be a bumper year for energy companies. In the first six months of last year, the ESB troubled its profits, and Bord Gáis Energy's profits increased by 74%. Profits at the Corrib gas field also trebled in the first six months of 2022. Profits at non-gas electricity generators, such as wind farms, are up to six times higher than expected. Meanwhile, the Government's windfall tax, which the Minister responsible for energy, Deputy Eamon Ryan, committed to in August and on which the EU signed off in September, is nowhere to be seen. The last we heard from the Minister, he was still drafting the legislation to underpin it. Other EU countries, such as Germany and Spain, have already managed to introduce a windfall tax, and they did it in December. Italy's windfall tax was introduced in March 2022 and collected €4 billion by December, yet here in Ireland we have to wait. Yesterday, the Taoiseach told us the windfall tax would be ready in a matter of weeks. I hope that promise is delivered on. I have a question for the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, on which I would really appreciate a response. Is Ireland in contravention of the EU regulation underpinning the windfall tax? Article 14 states member states shall adopt and publish measures implementing the contribution by 31 December 2022. If that is the case, Ireland has missed the deadline and is in contravention of the regulation. Profiteering from a war is immoral and grotesque, and the Government must stop facilitating it. In tandem, it must now act to constrain prices and provide tangible reliefs for households and businesses. The Social Democrats introduced this motion because we are deeply concerned about the Government's approach to the energy crisis. It opted for the blunt instrument of electricity credits at the start of this crisis. Credits were first announced in December 2021 because we were told there was no time to do anything else. The Government said it wanted to get the money to people fast and that credits were the easiest way to do it. Fast forward to budget 23 last autumn and the credits were again relied on as support mechanisms. Now we are talking about what amounts to a mini-budget in the spring. We are again told credits will be used as the preferred energy support. More than a year has passed since energy credits were first announced but the Government remains trapped in emergency mode. There has been no evolution in its policy and no recognition that, as this crisis develops, so too must its policy approach. The worst thing is that the Government's policy approach is clearly not working. At the end of December, nearly 260,000 energy customers were in arrears. The Government's temporary business energy support scheme is so convoluted that it is functionally useless. Just €26 million has been drawn down by businesses from the €1.2 billion available under the scheme. The Taoiseach admitted yesterday that this was just a fraction of what the Government had expected and said the Minister for Finance had gone back to the drawing board, but only to the extent that he is going to tweak a scheme that is really an abject failure. While the Minister busies himself painting lipstick on a pig, businesses are going under. What we need is a policy shift, not cosmetic changes. Targeted energy price caps for both households and businesses are the only guaranteed way to keep prices down and ensure certainty about costs. This would not be a blanket cap that would reduce the cost of energy in an unlimited or uncontrolled way. It would mean families and businesses would be supplied with energy at reduced rates to meet their average energy needs. Any energy use in excess of this amount would be charged at market rates. It is a cap that can be budgeted for. How do we know this? It is because the Germans have already done it. Unlike an unlimited cap, it does not disproportionately benefit wealthier households and it incentivises energy conservation. Yesterday, when Deputy Shortall raised this with the Taoiseach, he tried to pillory the idea by associating it with Ms Liz Truss, who we all accept was no economic guru. Another Government Deputy derided it as a Tory cap. I can only charitably assume that Ministers and Deputies on the other side of the House do not know what they are talking about. Either that or they are being wilfully obtuse. The attack lines from the briefing memos in Government Buildings will have to be revised. The Government can accuse the Germans of many things but fiscal recklessness is not one of them. Is the Taoiseach really saying the Germans are writing blank cheques for energy companies or emulating Ms Truss's disastrous Brexiteer economics? Maybe he is really saying the Irish Government does not have the fiscal acumen or ability of the German Government and therefore cannot implement what it has done. The automatic reflex of the Government is to malign constructive suggestions from the Opposition rather than engage with them on their merits. It is a reaction that repeats itself with depressing regularity.The Minister for the Environment, Climate and Communications committed to a windfall tax in August 2022 and the EU authorised its introduction in September 2022. Why has it not been introduced yet? What is the delay? Many small and medium enterprises are on the brink of closure. Shops, cafés, restaurants and other businesses in west Cork have been under severe pressure. I cannot emphasise enough how important these retailers and hospitality are to towns and villages across the country. They are economic engines in rural communities and vital sources of employment. The skyrocketing electricity and energy bills are terrifying for family-owned and small businesses, and this is in addition to rising insurance premiums and the rising cost of food and transport. There is a pressing need to provide targeted supports for SMEs. The Government's temporary business energy support scheme is demonstrably not fit for purpose and just €26 million has so far been drawn down from a budget of €1.2 billion. The Government's response so far shows a lack of consultation with families and businesses, and no awareness of the suffering families are enduring or the uncertainty SMEs are facing. We are arguing for proven social democratic measures. A windfall tax will work in tandem with a targeted price cap to ensure that energy companies cannot price-gouge, thereby protecting households and businesses. These measures should have been introduced months ago. Why the delays? Where are the Government’s priorities?

I will read back on the blacks and the content of the presentations so far by the Social Democrats. In my response, I want to set out some of the actions the Government has taken to protect people in this time of unprecedented high energy prices, to answer questions on some of the issues around the windfall taxes which we will be introducing in line with European legislation, as promised by me and other Government colleagues late last year, and also briefly to refer to the Energy Charter Treaty, which was rightly a subject for discussion in the motion and on which I am happy to share our thoughts and reflections. First, we have to recognise that we are in unprecedented times because energy is being used as a weapon of war, prices are at a multiple of their historical average and Russia is using gas, oil and coal as a lever in its war in Ukraine. We have to resist that and make sure we protect our people and support the people of Ukraine as we do so. It is important that we describe what has been happening to the prices in the market. The most important factor affecting electricity prices in Ireland is sustained high international energy prices since the second half of 2020. Data supplied by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, indicate that average electricity and gas household bills have increased to a combined total of over €4,000, which is an increase of some 80% compared with the figure before the Russian invasion. In the aftermath of the invasion, at its peak during August last year, wholesale UK natural gas spot prices were trading at over 600 pence a therm, which is some 13 times the pre-pandemic average level of 50 pence a therm. Due to high gas storage levels, warmer than normal winter conditions and policy efforts to reduce natural gas demand across Europe, wholesale gas prices have fallen dramatically and are currently well below the peak values of last year. However, those wholesale prices are still trading at some 150 pence a therm, which is three times their historical, pre-pandemic levels. It is important to note that Ireland faces a particular challenge in this regard as we are a price-taker in international markets and Irish electricity and gas prices have historically been higher than other European countries due to long-standing drivers such as geographical isolation, a dispersed population base, very high fossil fuel dependency and our small market scale. The best long-term approach to insulate consumers from volatility on international wholesale energy markets is to invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy, expand interconnection with neighbouring European markets and deepen the internal market in energy. That is what we are doing at scale and at speed. In line with higher wholesale prices generally, wholesale electricity and gas prices rose steeply in the first quarter of last year and have remained high since. The recent reduction in wholesale gas prices in Europe is very welcome, although prices remain significantly higher than pre-crisis levels. With wholesale energy costs accounting for a significant percentage of total supplier costs, a sustained period of falling wholesale gas prices can lead to retail market price reductions. However, supplier hedging that results in a significant proportion of energy purchased several months in advance may impact the ability of suppliers to reduce prices, notwithstanding the decline in the wholesale cost of gas. Due to different forward hedging strategies of energy suppliers before this winter, my Department anticipates that we will not see prices falling until early next year. That will depend on what each supply company’s hedging policy is but we cannot anticipate an immediate reduction because the gas they are using was bought forward at times of much higher prices. A more sustained period of lower wholesale prices will be needed before we see both gas and electricity prices falling significantly. I want to highlight the extensive response of the Government, given those high prices, to protect our citizens over the last 12 months. We pledged some €2.4 million in a package of supports during 2020. There were also a significant number of other measures, although I will not have time to go through all of them. With regard to energy credits, I disagree with Deputy Cairns. I believe this action is a very successful and correct way of protecting our people at a particular time. It was joined by targeted measures, particularly in social welfare, to target the most vulnerable and, according to the ESRI and others, that combination showed us protecting the most vulnerable through this very difficult period. We will continue to do that as we wind down the measures, which we need to do to give us a budget capability to provide the social welfare measures that we need. I will move on to the key issue in the motion, with which we do not disagree, which is the introduction of both a temporary solidarity contribution and a cap on market revenues. We are going to do that. It is a European-wide phenomenon. At an extraordinary meeting of the EU Energy Council on 9 September last in Brussels, which I attended, it was agreed that we would have to address the extraordinary situation of energy prices in Europe, to agree to advance work on possible emergency measures to mitigate the impact of high prices on consumers and to support demand reduction for gas and electricity to strengthen the EU's winter preparedness. Following the meeting, Ministers noted the contribution provided by the Commission and invited the Commission by mid-September to propose additional measures, including the capping of revenues on inframarginal electricity producers with low cost of production, a proposal incentivising co-ordinated electricity demand reduction across the EU, and the design of emergency liquidity measures that would ensure market participants have at their disposal sufficient collateral to meet marginal calls. It was expected that this would address increased volatility in futures markets. On 22 November last, the Government announced the decision to introduce measures to address windfall gains in the energy sector through the implementation of Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 on an emergency intervention to address high energy prices. We decided to place a cap on all market revenues of non-gas electricity generators. We set that cap at €120 per megawatt hour for wind and solar, which goes much further than the EU regulation figure of €180 per megawatt hour, in order to fully capture windfall gains while maintaining appropriate future investment signals. We are going to ensure that excess revenues will be collected and used to support electricity consumers. The cap on market revenues will operate from December last year to June this year, as set out in the Council regulation. We have decided to implement the temporary solidarity contribution to apply to taxable profits which are more than 20% above the baseline period from 2018 to 2021. They are now subject to a rate of 75% windfall tax and losses from previous years will not be considered in the calculation of taxable profits. The legislation to enact this Government decision is being progressed by my Department. Significant stakeholder engagement with other Departments, CRU, EirGrid and industry has been conducted to inform policy design and to make sure we have a practical implementation that works. In addition, a large body of economic and financial analysis and regulatory impact assessments have been conducted by the Departments and the Government's economic evaluation staff to provide evidence to inform the policy. The proceeds to be collected from the implementation of Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854 are highly dependent on the level of wholesale gas prices over the coming winter. Estimates as of February of this year are that the proceeds collected will range from some €280 million to €600 million.It is at the lower end of the range signalled by Government in November last year, which went from €300 up to €1.9 billion, with the primary reason being the reduction in wholesale gas prices. It is important to remember that the further the wholesale price falls, the lower the proceeds will be. I have other issues which I wanted to set out in our energy poverty action plan but given the short timeframe available to me, I will conclude on the issue of the Energy Charter Treaty. This Government has real concerns, and has expressed strong views within the EU, on the compatibility of the Energy Charter Treaty with the Paris climate agreement, and on the Energy Charter Treaty's dispute resolution mechanism, which allows investors to sue states party to the treaty for failing to protect energy investments, in particular fossil fuel energy investments in the context of decarbonising energy systems. We believe these views carry more weight in international negotiations by advocating them as part of the EU. To date, Ireland has not announced a withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty because a majority of EU member states, and the European Commission, are still signed up to the treaty while a modernisation reform process of the treaty is being negotiated. The Government continues to reserve the option of supporting a co-ordinated withdrawal from the treaty if it is not modernised to align with the Paris Agreement, does not address our concerns, or does not support the international effort to decarbonise electricity systems and promote more renewable energy. Ireland will continue to keep that position under review and will work with EU partners to reach a common position. If a decision is made for a co-ordinated exit of EU member states from the treaty, Ireland will support that position. As I have highlighted, we are working on a range of measures to protect our country at this time, to support international efforts to restore security and to decarbonise the energy system.

A combined €204.24 billion in profits meant last year was a fantastic year for the shareholders of BP, Chevron, Equinor, ExxonMobil, Shell and TotalEnergies. The shareholders received €102.6 billion in dividends last year. In the midst of a war in Ukraine and an energy crisis across Europe, which has left families cold and in a panic about how they will pay bills, those profits are not only obscene; they are a blatant example of war profiteering. In the first half of last year, the ESB made a profit of €390.3 million. When it was asked why its costs were not dropping alongside wholesale prices, a spokesperson stated that there was a lag of 18 to 24 months before consumers would see the rates reduced because suppliers hedge the costs for the upcoming year. When wholesale prices go down, there is a lag. However, when wholesale prices go up, Electric Ireland is very quick to act. In fact, the company increased rates three times last year, in May, August and October. There were further profits of €560 million last year for the Corrib gas fields and €677.87 million for Bord Gáis Energy, the profits of which are expected to triple this year to €2.04 billion. All of those profits have human faces behind them. These are the faces of families across the country who are being stretched beyond their limits to keep up with spiralling energy costs. Upwards of 40% of households in this country are in fuel poverty and that figure was produced before the winter utility bills were considered. The number of people applying for once-off, urgent and exceptional needs payments has increased by 75%. As we have already heard, consultants in the Mater Hospital are warning of older people developing hypothermia. Nearly 140,000 households across Ireland are behind on their gas bills before the January bills have even come in. There has been a 30% increase in registered vulnerable customers and the financially vulnerable are not included in this. Barnardos has reported that one in three parents skipped meals or reduced portion sizes last year so that their children would have enough to eat. One in ten families is using food banks. Huge energy costs are also heavily impacting businesses, 44% of which are predicting a downturn in profits within the next 12 months. An overwhelming majority of businesses, some 69%, are worried about energy costs, a figure which is the third highest globally. It is absolutely unacceptable that these energy companies are permitted to rake in these profits, doing untold damage to the environment as they go, at the expense of the citizens of this country. Windfall taxes urgently need to be introduced for them to be effective. Can the Minister give us a definite timeline on that? The European Energy Charter Treaty needs to be scrapped. As long as it remains in place, with this Government's support, fossil fuel companies will block any measures to limit their profits. ExxonMobil helpfully illustrated the imminent danger of the Energy Charter Treaty by initiating proceedings against the EU in December to attempt to prevent the introduction of windfall taxes across the block. That gives us a very good example of the kind of thing we have been talking about in a more general way in relation to investor courts. It is slightly different but it is really in the same family of things. It shows the kind of might that corporations have against democratic institutions. This Government needs to take a stand by withdrawing from the treaty, with immediate effect, and by stating clearly that we refuse to be held to ransom by unethical, greedy and energy companies that are profiteering. We saw something yesterday on the news about people's greater level of acceptance of onshore energy and wind farms. People are accepting of this because they can see that we need energy security and they are also accepting in relation to price. We have to see that price reflected in their bills. We are not seeing that and we need to see it as a matter of urgency.

I want to respond to the Minister's comments. There were two things lacking in his comments and responses. As Deputy Gannon foretold, the Minister gave us a list of the different measures the Government is taking but what we did not get was a timeline for the implementation of a windfall tax. We have no timeline on that at all. I ask that in his concluding remarks the Minister gives us an actual timeline as to when a windfall tax is going to be brought in; it is long overdue. Second, there was no substantial response to our proposal for targeted price cap measures along the lines of what has been introduced in Germany. We need to hear from the Government if it is going to take that proposal; if not, why not; and what its position on that is. The point just made by my colleague Deputy Catherine Murphy about the Energy Charter Treaty is very well made. It is disappointing that the Government's position on this has been so weak. Let us be clear about the treaty and what it entails. It means that the Irish Government, the Irish State and the Irish people can be sued by an energy company that is reliant on fossil fuel not only for money they have invested to date, in terms of fossil fuel infrastructure, but on the basis of future unearned profits. This is colossal. There needs to be a real position of leadership from the Government on this. It is not enough for the Government to fall behind on this matter and say it is under review and under consideration. There is a 20-year lead-in to get out of the obligations under that charter. Given where we are with climate change and fossil fuels, we needed to be out of that energy charter years ago. At the very least, we need the Government to lead on this now. It is not compatible in any way with our Paris Agreement climate change objectives. We need to show leadership on this and indeed, on any other international treaties, the likes of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, which allows for investor courts and for the Government to be sued by energy and fossil fuel companies for future unearned profits. We need to ensure we do not get into any further commitments on that. We see the huge profits of some of these multinational companies, such as ExxonMobil, which made a profit of €51.5 billion last year. As my colleague Deputy Gannon has said, €5.8 million was being made every hour last year. We should not be signed up to any of these treaties that give these companies any leeway at all. I raise one specific point with the Minister in terms of district heating systems. As I know both Ministers will agree, we should be encouraging the use of these systems. They can be sustainable. What has happened to people living in housing reliant on district heating systems during this energy crisis has been an absolute disaster. They face the sharp end as systems have been reliant on gas and they have been charged commercial rates of gas, which has led to a situation whereby social housing tenants, in particular, including those on prepaid meters, have been put in a particularly difficult position. In one area of my constituency, 20% of social housing tenants have been cut off from prepay meters and have no access to hot water or heat through their district heating systems. They do not have alternatives. I have raised this matter with the Government on multiple occasions and it has not been addressed. This is leading to inhumane conditions for people, in particular those on lower incomes, some of whom have long-term illnesses. This has led to a situation whereby people who are renting in social housing cannot take a hot shower because they are cut off from water. They are now washing in basins. I do not need to remind the Minister and Minister of State that it is 100 years since we started installing baths in social housing in the city so that people would have access to that basic facility in their homes and would no longer have to wash in basins. Due to the fact that the Government has failed to act on the issues affecting energy prices, in particular people in district heating systems, there are now substantial numbers of people back to washing out of basins. The Government will not act on that. It is not doing anything about it. Its response is to say the matter is under review and it will do something about it in the future. It is being looked at, but we need emergency measures now to restore people's access to the basic humane conditions that the rest of us take for granted. I urge the Minister and Minister of State to act on our motion, respond to the points we have made and act for the particular group of vulnerable social housing tenants who have been totally left out in the cold and ignored by the Government.

Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil freisin leis na Social Democrats agus leis an Teachta Whitmore as an rún seo a chur os comhair na Dála maidin inniu. This motion is timely. The cost-of-living crisis bears down on workers and families, and we all understand that. The recent spike in inflation has largely been driven by the steep rise in energy prices fuelled by Russia's illegal invasion of Ukraine. This has resulted in households facing energy bills the likes of which they have never faced before. Electricity and gas bills are stretching household finances right to the very brink. Over the past two years, the average gas bill has increased by 140% and the average electricity bill by 111%, a doubling of bills for families. Many of them have been unable to absorb these costs without having to make cuts elsewhere and many others have been forced to scale back on basics such as food or simply turn the heating off. The figures released by Barnardos last week, which should shock all of us, reflect this. One in ten parents surveyed are now visiting food banks to feed their children and one in three are going without meals. Energy price rises have hit the living standards of these very households. The impact on middle- and low-income households has been the most severe. The price shock has also been felt by thousands of people who are reliant on gas and home heating oil and there is no doubt that the Government has failed abjectly to provide certainty to households as energy prices spiral and are expected to remain high in the coming months. Across Europe, governments have intervened, recognising that the energy market is broken, in order to protect and support households from the price shock. Over the Christmas break, an energy price cap was introduced in Germany and the Netherlands. Energy price caps have also been introduced in France, Austria, Luxembourg and Poland. This is happening across Europe, yet the Government refuses to provide to Irish households the certainty that is being provided to households throughout Europe. Instead, Irish households have faced sky-high energy bills and are set to face more in the months ahead. The motion calls on the Government to bring forward an energy price cap. Sinn Féin proposed one for some time before the budget. It is something the Government could and should have done, but refused to do. We know energy companies are taking in massive profits on the back of spiralling energy prices. Energia made profits of €112 million last year. Shell recorded its highest profits in history, $40 billion, while BP recorded massive profits of $28 billion. For a year, Sinn Féin has called on the Government to bring forward a windfall tax on the super-profits of these companies. How galling is it for Irish households to know that for months the Minister for Public Expenditure, National Development Plan Delivery and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, and Fine Gael opposed taxing the windfall profits of these energy companies? It is galling that their priority in government was to protect the profit margin of the shareholders of massive energy companies while Irish households suffered under the strain of massive energy bills. Is it any wonder that workers and families are suffering due to the cost-of-living crisis when the instinct of Fine Gael is always to look after the profit margins of the multi-billion euro energy companies at the expense of ordinary people? Sinn Féin supports the motion because it is what we have called for for a year and is what Fine Gael says should not happen. We welcome that the motion has been tabled today and the Government is finally moving on one aspect of it. The Government should have introduced an electricity price break to support households, protect them from spiralling energy costs and provide them with certainty. For months, the Government has acted to protect the windfall profits of energy companies instead of taking action to end price gouging and profiteering off the back of the war and address the misery of Irish households. It is long past time for the Government to put the interests of workers and families first and to take action.

Sinn Féin has advocated an energy price freeze for some months. It is welcome that the Social Democrats support that move. It would provide certainty and the maximum protection for consumers. Coupled with a windfall tax, it is the most effective way to tackle the disgusting profits and practices of big energy companies. An energy price break has been introduced in several EU member states. Over the Christmas break, energy price caps for 2023 were introduced in Germany and the Netherlands, as well as in Austria, France, Luxembourg and Poland. The question of it undermining conservation could easily be addressed in a number of ways such as, for example, applying the price break only to average household electricity consumption or a household's consumption the previous year, as is the case in the design of the scheme in Germany. The Government will not oppose the motion, but has no intention of introducing an energy price cap because, time and again, when push comes to shove and action is measured over spin, it will protect the profits of big energy companies. After all, it was the greatest opponent of energy windfall taxes despite the fact that Shell announced $40 billion in profit last year, the highest in 115 years. BP announced profits of $28 billion and Exxon Mobil profits of $56 billion. Closer to home, Vermilion, the operators of Corrib gas, made $102 million in one quarter. They are eye-watering figures. While hiking charges for ordinary customers Centrica, or Bord Gáis, said its earnings in 2022 will be eight times its 2021 earnings. Energia increased its profits by 50% in 2022. ESB made €390 million in the first six months of last year. This is simply obscene. The Government opposed market reforms as a European level. When the EU toolbox provided for price caps and windfall taxes as far back as October 2020, the Government stood steadfast in opposition to it. In June 2022, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, said it was the wrong move. In August 2022, the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, said windfall taxes would undermine Irish energy independence. Such is the paucity of vision from Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party that they could not see that and act on behalf of ordinary consumers. Instead, they are eventually brought kicking and screaming when the European Union moves. That is a feature of every intervention the Government makes. It is the last one to move in the European Union. It will not lead; it will follow and resist positive proposals.

I will read the Minister's words back to him. He said if a decision is made for a co-ordinated exit of EU member states from the treaty, Ireland will support that position and withdraw. It is the same in respect of windfall taxes. While the Iberian countries of Spain and Portugal moved, the Government resisted that. Today, instead of delivering €1.9 billion, he has told us the windfall tax will deliver €280 million because of his delay.

This is a shocking indictment of the Government's complete failure to tackle the cost of living crisis for ordinary families and individuals who should be at the core of policy. Last year, Eirtricity, which is supposedly a 100% renewable electricity provider, increased its profits by 221% in the first six months of the year alone. The Minister more than anyone else should know the price of wind did not go up last year but without decoupling gas and electricity prices, there is no reward for people who choose to use renewable energy to power their homes. These price increases cannot be justified. The Minister is in charge. PrepayPower, which increased its energy prices seven times in the past two years, saw its profits rise by over €8 million in 2022. We are talking about some of the most vulnerable customers in the State who have waited months for the Government to explain how its winter disconnection ban will apply to them and who have no choice but to use meters because they are so vulnerable. Barnardos reports that one in ten parents used a food bank in the past 12 months. The Taoiseach may dispute this because it is does not look good for him and does not suit his narrative but these are the facts. This is what is happening on the ground. Poverty is being forced on parents and children in this State. We have not seen this for a very long time. It is not just about people struggling to pay their rent or electricity bills. Parents are now unable to send their children on school trips or pay their children's club membership fees. This is having a much more profound effect on all these people. There are people who are profiting from the poverty and misery of ordinary people and this is happening on the Minister's watch. This Government is allowing this to happen. Deputy Doherty has been advocating a windfall tax for over a year. Fine Gael has fought it tooth and nail. Shame on the Green Party for allowing the profiteers, the big energy companies, to get away with it.

You only had to listen to Midwest Radio this morning to hear people ringing in and talking about bills that used to be €250 but are now €1,000, €1,200 and beyond. They know they are being fleeced and they feel helpless to protect themselves from those that are allowed to exploit the war in Ukraine and make billions on the backs of ordinary workers and families. In my local area, the Corrib gas field's profits are estimated to be €556 million for the first six months of 2022. So much for our natural resources belonging to the people of Ireland. The Government has dragged its feet on bringing in a windfall tax. Now it just a windfall tax on oil and gas companies, not electricity companies. People cannot understand this. In its public statements, the Government has intentionally confused the issue. The Government's response to growing anger was to claim it would apply a windfall tax on energy companies. Despite multiple statements in the Dáil and in the media, I had to seek a response in writing from the Minister where he confirmed that electricity companies will face no windfall tax.

The Government is acting as a spectator and is allowing this to happen. It is not right. People are living in a hell of fuel poverty and energy deprivation. This is what has been allowed to happen. Will the windfall tax be applied to the profits of electricity companies for 2022 and will it be redistributed to those who have been fleeced? If so, when will it be done?

This is disaster capitalism at its best. Earlier this month, Shell announced that it made a profit of €40 billion last year while last week, BP announced that it made $28 billion in profit. Deputy Doherty already mentioned this to the Minister. It is disgusting that these companies are making massive profits while workers and families are struggling to pay energy bills. It is time to end the energy rip off that is forcing people into hardship by redirecting the profits of the big energy companies that are profiting from this crisis. The Government must introduce the windfall tax to cut these obscene profits. It cannot sit on its hands any longer. The money raised from this tax must be redirected into the pockets of hard-working families, who are at breaking point. Constituents who recently had air-to-water heat pumps installed in the midlands retrofit programme have contacted me. They are happy with the heating system but because their 20-year-old doors and windows were not replaced, they are effectively heating their gardens. We need joined-up thinking. I have seen bills of up to €600 per month for electricity in a three-bedroom semi-detached house. It is simply not sustainable. It needs to be addressed urgently, particularly for older people and those on fixed incomes. The motion also calls for a review of the proposed price cap on non-gas electricity generators. This is something we support as it would ensure that record profits from coal, oil and renewables are addressed. We previously called for the decoupling of the price of electricity from the price of gas. This has been resisted by the Government. The motion calls on the Government to announce its intention to leave the Energy Charter Treaty immediately. This treaty was ratified in the 1990s and has no place in the post-Paris Agreement world. The treaty's investor-state dispute settlement clause has enabled fossil fuel companies to sue governments for policies that aim to phase out or curb the use of fossil fuels. Last year, the oil firm Rockhopper successfully sued the Italian Government for over €200 million. Senator Boylan has led the charge on this and introduced a motion last year to withdraw from this treaty. Poland has already left the treaty while other countries are considering it. We need to lead rather than follow on this. The planet depends on it.

It was slightly less than edifying to see the senior Minister appear to make light of some of the pleas from the Opposition. It does not surprise me coming as it does from that particular quarter. I note that the Minister did not stay for the full debate as he has left the Chamber. Sinn Féin will support this motion. We are on record for a long time as calling for an energy price break and a windfall tax on energy companies, which are making super-profits not just an ordinary level of eye-watering profit. They are making super-profits and were doing this in advance of the war in Ukraine. The war in Ukraine has increased the super-profits these companies make. You have to place those super-profits made by these fantastically wealthy companies as facilitated by the Government, which the Green Party tells us it is so proud to be a member of, against the shocking statistics released by Barnardos this week where they told us that one in ten parents had to visit a food bank. Part of the reason why they visit food banks is because there are certain bills in a household that are non-negotiable. You have to keep the lights on and the children warm so, therefore, you must put your pride in your back pocket and go to a food bank; you have to pay your bills and feed your children so you take whatever help is there. There is no shame in a person visiting a food bank. The shame is on the Government that created the conditions under which people have been forced to visit food banks.There is no shame in not being able to pay your bills; the shame is on the Government for not recognising that people are struggling and in desperate circumstances. Energy price hikes hit those on low and fixed incomes the hardest. The Minister of State knows this, and yet they are the ones at the business end of decisions taken by the Government, who feel as though they have been forgotten, who hear Ministers and other representatives of the Green Party on the media almost delighting in the fact people's habits have changed because the price of energy has increased. Of course, they have changed from being habitually or occasionally warm to being unable to stay warm in their own homes. That is not something to be proud of, nor is it something they should be ashamed of. The shame is on the Government. We welcome the points in the motion relating to the Energy Charter Treaty. I commend my party colleague Senator Boylan not just on the work she has done in the Seanad on this but also on the considerable work she continues to do. In fact, I think most people would not even have heard of the treaty were it not for the work and leadership provided by Senator Boylan on this matter. While the Government has not been sued directly under the treaty, it has probably been influenced by the threat of legal action, including the failure to revoke existing fossil fuel exploration licences, as was reported in the Irish Independent. In his opening remarks, the Minister said, "If a decision is made for a co-ordinated exit of EU member states from the treaty, Ireland will support that position" and withdraw. Have they not for a moment considered providing a modicum of leadership on this, or will they just sit back and wait for the grown-ups to make decisions as though they are children sitting at the small table, waiting for the adults to take a decision? The Government should lead on this.

I thank the Social Democrats for bringing forward the motion. We in the Labour Party are happy to support it in full. Today marks 12 and a half months since we introduced a Labour Party cost-of-living motion that proposed, among other things, the introduction of a windfall tax, so we have had similar debates previously. In the months since the debate on that motion was held, the price of energy has more than doubled, with an enormous negative impact on so many households. During that same period, however, we have seen record profits for oil and gas companies. Shell recorded a profit of $40 billion, its highest in 115 years, while BP’s profits doubled to $28 billion. In that time, we have missed a full year’s opportunity to recoup money from the profits of fossil fuel oligarchs and magnates. These are much-needed funds that could help to ease the burden of the cost of living for many families and households. In his opening remarks, the Minister conceded that the Government will introduce such a tax but there has been no indication of when that will be or, indeed, of any urgency about it. Will the Minister of State give us on clarity on this? It is essential. The energy bills crisis is an attack on people’s pockets on all fronts. Households’ domestic bills are rising, leaving less and less left over at the end of the month, along with businesses’ overheads. SMEs are finding it harder and harder to pay salaries and energy bills, putting jobs at risk. Throughout the country, we are already seeing closures. I am increasingly hearing from employers that are citing the rising cost of energy as an immediate threat to their business and to the livelihoods of their staff. Notwithstanding the untargeted cash injections in the form of the energy rebates from the Government, it seems adamantly passive in its role in this crisis. As I said, there is a tacit acceptance that a windfall tax will be introduced but no sense of urgency and no clarity as to when. The Government does not appear willing to press the EU on the timing of a windfall tax and is playing a game of wait and see when it comes to the Energy Charter Treaty. It will not even examine temporarily nationalising the Corrib gas field to control energy prices, as we in the Labour Party have suggested on a number of occasions. Crucially, it is running down the clock, and is unwilling to take action, on the enormous prices customers in district heating schemes are being charged, with costs for those people continuing to spiral month on month. In my view, district heating exemplifies the Government’s reluctance to face up to private interests, the disjointedness of Government climate and energy policy, and the real-life effects on ordinary households of the failure to act. I have heard from many people in my constituency living in apartment complexes who are paying increasingly high rates of bills, in some cases thousands of euros, for energy they are not even using. For one constituent of mine, her latest bill stood at €1,700 for two months for a family of four. She pays 56.3 cent per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT, yet the Bord Gáis residential rate is 13.13 cent per kilowatt hour, excluding VAT. Through no fault of their own, therefore, and despite cutting down on her energy use, she is overpaying for her family's energy use by a factor of four. I have made several representations about this issue, but the response has always been merely to reiterate that the regime is under review. One constituent wrote to the office of the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, in recent weeks to ask when she would see change. The response stated that technically it is her supplier who is the purchaser rather than her, giving rise to a commercial rate. We can imagine her reaction to that response. It simply did not pass muster with her, as it would not do with many others who are scrimping and saving to pay bills. If an apartment block's management company is unwilling or unable to renegotiate a contract, the residents are left with these extortionate bills. This is a clear example of Government failure. I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	39	I thank the Social Democrats for this timely motion. As my party colleague and party leader, Deputy Bacik, said, the Labour Party brought a motion to the floor of this House in January 2022, more than 12 months ago, demanding action on what was then a cost-of-living challenge, which very quickly became a cost-of-living crisis. The Minister of State will recall that motion was tabled a month before Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, when the cost-of-living challenge was clear. The rate of inflation was already on the rise, including in respect of energy costs. There was clear evidence at the time that energy companies were, even before Putin's illegal invasion of Ukraine, posting extraordinary profits as bills for customers continued to climb without showing any sign of abating. We called then, because of the super-profits companies had posted in 2021, for the imposition of a windfall tax on the hyper-profits of energy companies. That was well over a year ago, before the invasion of Ukraine. Ministers played a game of cat and mouse with me for several months until last summer, when they finally agreed that the proposition of a windfall tax on the excessive profits of energy companies ought to be introduced. That was a full six months after the Labour Party had first called formally in this Chamber for the introduction of such a regime. In the meantime, of course, bills rose endlessly. There were between 50 and 60 electricity bill increases in that period. That picture grates with people because, for example, the owner of Bord Gáis, Centrica, is on course to triple its profits for this financial year to almost €1.8 billion. Revenue at the Corrib gas field, for the first nine months of 2022, was up €1.3 billion. Likewise, profits at the ESB soared last year, with revenue up by €1.5 billion to June 2022 compared with the same period in 2021. What really grates is that Electric Ireland, a company owned by the ESB, increased its electricity prices by more than 11 cent per unit last August, and this is the same company that told us yesterday that even though wholesale prices are reducing, it could be 18 to 24 months before bills get back to what we might describe as normal. We can understand, therefore, the public anger and frustration as to the delays in introducing a windfall tax on the hyper-profits of these extraordinarily profitable companies, which continue to raise their prices and hammer consumers. Why the delay? It is extraordinary. Austria, on 18 November 2022, introduced a windfall tax, while the Czech Republic did so on 4 November 2022. Greece, on 3 November 2022, established a 90% windfall tax on energy companies to be used to help its citizens to pay rising energy bills.Portugal proposed a 33% windfall tax on excess profits on 21 December 2022. Romania did so on 28 December; Slovakia on 22 December; and the Tory party in the UK, a party that did not want to introduce a windfall tax in the first place, introduced taxes on excess profits. When is the Government going to move? When will it provide the resources that we need to insulate people as best we can from the worst excesses of this problem?

The main reason we have a cost-of-living crisis is profiteering and privatisation. That is what needs to be addressed. People Before Profit first tabled a motion in the House in October 2021 calling for the introduction of price caps on energy, gas, oil and electricity. We have been calling for approximately a year and a half for the introduction of a windfall tax on the energy companies that are making obscene profits while real human beings suffer. The Government has done nothing except throw a few totally inadequate crumbs back at people in electricity credits and fuel allowance increases that do not go anywhere near dealing with the enormous hike in energy costs and the cost-of-living crisis that people are suffering. Hundreds of thousands of people are in arrears. If the Barnardos survey is even close to accurate - and I think it is and all the evidence suggests it is, despite the Taoiseach’s attempts to put question marks over it - there are hundreds of thousands of people who are now dependent on food banks such is the level of hardship they are suffering. We need to remind ourselves what is at stake for ordinary individuals. I raised the case this week in a slightly different context because some people are being hit in multiple directions by the cost-of-living crisis. This was a couple in their late 50s where the husband used to work but then he was diagnosed with early onset Alzheimer’s. As a result, he can no longer work and his wife cannot work because she has to look after her husband. They had a HAP arrangement while he was still working so they have to pay a massive top-up on top of the inadequate HAP payments that they receive to cover the rent on the place that they live. As a result they are in significant arrears on their rent and energy bills, neither of which they have any prospect of paying because they are on basic social welfare payments. They go for an exceptional needs payment and they get a fraction of what is necessary to cover their rent arrears, which will just build and build, and the arrears on their energy bills. What are they supposed to do? This is somebody who is sick and his carer, but there are no answers because the Government will not deal with the fundamental problem, which is profiteering. The scale of the profiteering is absolutely obscene. The five biggest oil and gas companies in the western world saw their excess profits jump to €134 billion. This is extraordinary profiteering by these companies on the back of the misery of families like that or another family I brought up this week. This is a couple where the wife has cancer and has been on illness benefit but does not even get the fuel allowance. The husband cannot turn down the heating because she is sick so their bills are building up but they are not entitled to the fuel allowance because they are on what is called a short-term payment even though she has been on it for several years and has cancer. This is the suffering that people are enduring as a result of the gross profiteering, which is matched here in Ireland with the extraordinary profits being enjoyed by the ESB whose profits surged to €390 million in the first six months of last year with revenues up to €3.7 billion from €2.2 billion the previous year. These are absolutely enormous jumps in profits while real human beings are suffering misery.  What needs to happen? We have argued for nearly a year and a half for the introduction of price caps and for a windfall tax but to be honest, I think we are beyond that. We need to renationalise the energy sector. There is no justification for the energy sector being run on a for-profit basis because privatisation has been a disaster. The Government tries to blame the Ukraine war for the current situation but the facts are absolutely clear. Ever since we had the privatisation of energy in this country, energy prices, including electricity prices, have consistently shot through the roof. It is unconscionable that we can see these obscene super profits being made on the backs of the misery, hardship and suffering that ordinary people are experiencing with many people being driven outright into poverty. This is even in terms of the utter inconsistency and injustice of the tariffs they are being charged. I have raised the issue of district heating, as have others here today. People are being charged multiples of the unit cost per kWh than other people are being charged. It is utterly unjustifiable in the current situation. What does the Government do about it? Zero. Zilch. Nothing. It talks about it.  Over the weekend, it was reported that multinational companies are getting significantly lower price rates for their energy than our residential customers or even small businesses here which are being charged multiples of what big multinationals are being charged. It seems the energy companies can charge lower unit rates when they want to but there is no consistency and no fairness so some of the biggest and most profitable companies are charged significantly less for their energy than the struggling homeowners who are being crushed by the cost-of-living crisis. How is that addressed? The entire sector should be nationalised. Obviously, you pull out of insane treaties such as the Energy Charter Treaty where states allow energy companies to sue them if they do not make enough profits, which is unbelievable but is symptomatic of the way in which we have handed over the energy sector to private, for-profit companies and, tragically, the Green Party is going to do the same with our offshore wind energy, which is an even bigger disgrace.

We decided to get rid of energy producing methods that we had such as the power stations in the midlands before we had an alternative in place. What we are finding now is that we have been preaching about how to heat our homes and do all the things that are green, which comes from all sides of the House, without looking to see where the energy was going to be produced from under the green methods. When considering Derrybrien, which is not functional because of a planning mess, one might ask: what are we at at all? In my constituency, there are people who built their houses and got their mortgages and were told not to put in a chimney and that they must put in an air-to-water heat pump. Now they are getting bills for up to €1,200 for these air-to-water systems they are putting in. The €200 electric credit that the Government is giving to them pales into insignificance when that is going on. I was told yesterday that the SEAI has told builder providers that they can no longer sell back boilers or solid fuel stoves because they are not what we should be doing.We are forcing people to put in heating that is all dependent on electricity. It is causing huge concerns for people. If people with electric vehicles have to charge their car at a public charging point, it costs double what it cost this time last year.  We are bringing people on a journey without knowing how we will reach the end. We do not have the resources in place. From the SEAI point of view for the warmer homes schemes, people are told there is a delay and they have to wait up to a year for somebody to come out to do a bit of work. In the meantime, they have draughts in their house. They go to the local council to get draughty windows replaced but do not get replacement costs if they are double-glazed already. The council will only deal with single-glaze windows. We have many policies and reports to say everything will be fine. Regarding the farming situation, I was in Roscommon at a protest on Monday about the cost of producing our sheep and the lack of support from Government. Every night these farmers are out in their sheds with the lights on. They are looking at the lights and thinking about what the electricity will cost. They have to do that in what I would call the maternity ward for the next month to make sure the lambing season is carried out as efficiently and safely as possible. There is no regard for any of that when we talk abut policies and reports and everything we need to do. We have gone too far too quickly without realising there is a transition period of up to 20 years before our houses are warmer and we have a proper supply of green energy in this country. It will take time. We keep talking about the potential offshore, yet I do not see one pylon off the west or any place near it for the next ten years. Those are the problems we have. We need a dose of reality. Let us not put the cart before the horse. Let us make sure people are protected.

That is an incredible fact. Statistics we in Aontú have through parliamentary questions have shown the Government is quids in and making massive amounts in VAT on energy. VAT on electricity last year reached a record level of €381 million, up 40% on 2021. VAT on petrol, diesel, solid fuels and liquified petroleum gas has increased nearly 30% in a year in which families were hit and hurting the most. The Government is taking more in increased taxes than it is giving back in energy credits. That is incredible. The Government is lauding itself for giving energy credits to hard-hit families but is taking more out of their pockets to give them that money. At the same time, energy companies are making supernormal profits. Shell made a record profit of $40 billion last year. BP reported a record profit of $28 million last year. The ESB made nearly €400 million profit in the first six months of last year. It is an incredible thing to have the State quids in during an energy crisis and these private and semi-State companies quids in while people are suffering so much. People woke up this morning to the news that wholesale electricity prices fell 41% in the final quarter of last year. Those prices are now 17% lower than in the last quarter before the war in Ukraine. We have the lowest wholesale electricity prices at a time people are being gouged on the electricity prices they are being charged in their homes and when large companies are achieving far lower prices for electricity than the normal family living at home. This is one of the most unequal and unfair electricity and energy markets to have existed for decades and is happening at a time people are suffering most. The market the Minister of State is standing over, has organised and that exists under his Government is allowing for supernormal profits to be created and massive taxes to be gathered when people are finding it hard to heat their homes, older people are spending half the day in bed to stay warm and people are going to food banks to be able to feed their children. How can the Minister of State stand over that? I have been trying to work this out. The Government has been so slow and is saying it is difficult to create a fair and equitable windfall tax, yet the Italian Government has created a windfall tax that collected €3 billion last year. The British Tory Government managed to create a windfall tax that collected billions of pounds sterling last year. On the decoupling of the price of electricity from that of gas, the Government has said it cannot do it because it is a European competency but Spain and Portugal have decoupled those prices to make it cheaper for their people. I understand Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have previous in allowing this terrible division to exist but why is the Green Party doing it? Is it in that party’s interest to keep the price of fuel high? Is it that party’s objective to keep high energy costs in the State to reduce the consumption of energy? Is the Green Party putting its objective of reducing fuel consumption ahead of a family’s ability to heat their home?

The motion calls, as ours did last November, for a windfall tax, or what we termed: "an excess profit "solidarity tax", as provided for in EU regulation 2022/1854 upon all/any companies and permanent establishments operating within the oil, gas, coal and refinery sectors in Ireland, which include the Corrib gas field, and give these funds back to consumers to help pay for energy bills". Unfortunately, Ireland cannot obtain tax revenues from companies that do not operate here, such as Chevron or Exxon Mobil, but we can raise extra tax and revenues from oil and gas companies that operate here and we fully support that.  With gas and electricity prices at record highs, there has been much talk of a windfall tax on energy companies as a way to address the energy crisis and, thankfully, our motion on this last year won the support of the Dáil. However, we need an update from the Government as to how we are coming closer to implementation following the announced limit on the revenues of non-gas energy generators at €120 per MWh for wind and solar generation and €180 per MWh for oil- and coal-fired generation.  There are a few things the Government can do to help households this winter. First, it should commit to keeping the 9% VAT rate on gas and electricity indefinitely, or even reduce it to 5%. That rate is due to revert to 13.5% soon. When people talk about the winners from the energy crisis, they forget the Government is one of them. VAT is levied on the net price of goods and services so, as the cost of gas, petrol, diesel and electricity has gone up, so has the Government’s tax take. It also needs to make plans for another energy credit to be paid to all householders this spring and summer and to look at taking a greater dividend from the ESB next year, which would help pay for the energy credits.

I see the Government is accepting it but that is all it will do with it. It will spin it then after that. Why will they not look after the people? From ordinary people, working people and families in their homes to community centres, schools, small butchers and hairdressers, everybody is being crippled with energy costs. I, like the second-last speaker, am convinced, given the Government’s inertia to act and the massive profits it made last year on fuel, which were more than any other year, that it is a Green policy to make it expensive and a luxury item for people so they cannot use it. I have businesses every day of the week on to me. Trying to deal with these companies is impossible. One time there was a manager or somebody to talk to; now it is all emails and they are gone to the hills. They are gouging people.  A wonderful hotelier, 60 years in business, was on my local radio this morning. He spoke to me last week. John and Liz Nallen run the Hotel Minella.It will be impossible to keep the doors open of they do not get fair play from the gas and electricity suppliers. Trying to get to meet somebody is almost impossible. There is no respect for those people and the amount of work they do for charity or the number of organisations that do work for charity. They are all being hammered. Meanwhile, the Government's policies are to line the pockets of the fat cats. The Minister of State is doing this to support the two parties; I know that. It will benefit the fat cats whether it be CRH or across the board in big business. The oil companies that fund the parties indirectly have the Government in their pockets. The Government is doing it now with this new crazy idea. Somebody called it a journey the Government is bringing people on; it is bringing them down a cul-de-sac. It is a bóithrín with no end and people will find a big pond at the bottom of it and that will be the end of them. The Government just does not get it with its fanciful policies. Why do we not have wind turbines out at sea? Why have we not got the proper policies in place? The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, does not have the money or wherewithal to do it. Shame on the Government.

This is no disrespect to the Minister of State, but where in the name of goodness is the Minister, Deputy Ryan, today? Why could he not be here to debate this very important matter? Why could he not be here to answer questions and give his viewpoint? It is for the same reason he cannot go on any of the national broadcasters. He is afraid to face the people. He is afraid to answer questions from people on the Opposition side who have very valid questions on behalf of the electorate. We have fair and honest questions we want to put before him about his failed policies and fanciful ideas and his absolute, if the Minister of State will excuse me using the word, and it is polite word, raving antics. I would call him out to come into the Chamber when there is a debate like this and man up a small bit. He should face his responsibility as a senior Government Minister and answer the God damn questions we have to put before him. The Dáil passed a similar type of motion in the Dáil last November, which was tabled by the Rural Independent Group, instructing the Government to act to reduce electricity prices for households, small businesses and farmers. We welcome the fact that this motion has been brought before the Minister of State today. We have to see a reduction in the cost of energy because of a simple fact. Why are we paying 50% more for energy in Ireland? Why does it cost 50% more to produce energy here than anywhere else? Why in the name of God did the Government not go ahead with the Shannon LNG facility to give us surety of supply? It should give us a chance and for God's sake try to let us have a bit of independence. The message this Government is giving people is that we should use more electricity and produce less of it at a higher cost.

I believe Bord Gáis Energy is expected to have €1 billion extra in its coffers this year than it had in 2021. Yet, representatives from Barnardos are in the audiovisual room in LH2000 this morning with a book called, Food Insecurity in Ireland: Impact on Children and their Parents. The Minister of State should look at it and go to the audiovisual room. Children are going hungry. Why? Parents are trying to pay the bills, and doing without themselves, because of excessive energy costs. Local businesses are going out of business because of the increase in costs in keeping the fridges on and the doors open. The Government has ignored it. Its responsibility lies with the protection of the children in this country - the next generation to come - and the people of Ireland. All the Government has done is tax us out of existence. It had €5 billion leftover that it said came from corporate tax. It did not all come from corporate. It came from increases in energy and fuel costs where the Government took 50 cent in every euro. It is taking taxes at 9% but because they have inflated so much, it is actually up 50% in taxes on electricity costs from this time in 2019 and 2020. The inflated costs are what is wrong. The Government is getting more tax and saying it is helping but it is giving pittance. It has let the people of Ireland go hungry. This will be on the Government's watch. It will be brought to account come election time.

I thank the Social Democrats for bringing it forward. Last month, Europe's gas prices returned to pre-war levels yet citizens' bills continue to soar while energy companies make eye-watering profits. The Government has not only allowed this to happen but it has actually facilitated it. I warned of this back in September when speaking on budget 2023. I warned that by giving out three instalments of energy credits, we will be putting money straight into the pockets of the energy companies. At the time, I asked why energy companies would ever reduce their prices when they know the Government will not only let them keep rising but will actually pay them when they do it. It is five months later and here is the proof - gas prices have gone down and energy companies are paying less yet not a single energy company or supplier has reduced its prices to their customers. Why? Because they know the Government will facilitate any ridiculous rates they decide to charge. The reality is that we paid for Shell's record-breaking profit of €36 billion last year, which is more than double what it raked in in the previous year. It is absolutely despicable. Profiteering on a war is unethical and wrong. Instead of taking power away from these profit-hungry immoral companies, the Government has instead subsidised them at the expense of its own citizens. I heard a quote on radio today that rings very true. Someone said gas prices rise like a rocket but drop like a feather. That is the reality of the situation everybody is facing here. On the radio this morning, people were talking about how ESB prices are fixed for the next two years. This is absolutely incredible stuff. It is incredibly frustrating to see the detrimental impact energy prices are having on people and businesses in my constituency of Donegal. Many businesses in the county were forced to close their doors due to the struggles they faced in paying energy bills. I fear that many more will follow after what has been a very difficult winter for many small businesses.  The motion put forward today rightly points out the fact that there is a risk of an energy crisis coming, and a jobs crisis if businesses begin to close. The people of this country are already enduring a cost-of-living crisis. The last thing they need is yet another crisis to join the endless cycle of crises in the country. Citizens are struggling enough. Food banks are becoming increasingly frequent and sought after in rural communities as families struggle to put food on the table. It is devastating and we cannot continue to pay this way.

The cost of energy is a crisis for many in the country. The Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, states that 40% of households are now living in fuel poverty. Many are cutting back on heating to afford food or cutting back on food to afford heating. Just as we see the costs of the crisis come out of people's wages, we see the mega-rich and megacorporations make billions in profits. The massive amounts of money people are having to pay for energy and groceries is not just disappearing into thin air; it is disappearing into profits. Shell's profits doubled in 2022 and ExxonMobil made €51.5 billion in the same period. These soaring profits saw billionaires' fortunes increase by €2.7 billion per day. This is not just while people struggled to pay bills and pay for groceries, it is because of it. These companies are making billions off people's backs. We need to put an end to this by capping the prices and taxing the profits through a windfall tax. France capped its gas and electricity prices at 4% last year. Its inflation was 6% last year; ours went up to 9.2% and above. Germany introduced targeted price caps on about 80% of average energy use. Meanwhile, our energy bills have doubled. Inflation has put a massive squeeze on how far everyone's wages go and it is vital we bring in caps to help fight it. I go to my local shop owner at the corner every morning to get the paper. Practically every day I go in, he asks why there are not price caps with regard to energy as this would help keep things on an even keel. We should leave the energy charter treaty. The fact that we are signed up a treaty that allows the fossil fuel companies that are causing the mass destruction of life on this planet to sue our Government for affecting profits is obscene. It is a political feature of this Government to support investor courts, like we have seen with the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, and Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP. Allowing companies to be able to sue sovereign governments for loss of profits is both morally wrong and a disaster for any attempt to end the profiteering and greed. According to Oxfam, profiteering has caused at least 50% of inflation increases in Europe and the US. It called this a cost-of-profit crisis; I call it a cost-of-greed crisis. The rich have made billions off working-class people struggling to pay rent and energy bills and put food on their tables. We should take every opportunity to stop and reverse these massive profits and price increases.I support the creation of a windfall tax on the profits of the fossil fuel and energy companies, but I also support the calls from Oxfam for a wealth tax on billionaires and the mega rich to reverse the massive inequality and poverty this crisis has contributed to and accelerated. I support the motion.

The Government has not given any timeline as to when it will introduce a windfall tax on energy companies, some of which have made obscene profits and especially on the backs of a war just on the fringes of the EU. As the motion tells us, ESB's profits in the first six months of 2022 more than tripled to €390 million. The operating profits at Bord Gáis Energy increased by 74% in the same period. I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy Smyth, that not only do we need a timeline, we need a commitment from him to implement a windfall tax as soon as possible. We can argue about the amounts of tax the Exchequer will pull in, but it is crucial that the tax is put in place. Taxation is not only about revenue. It is an instrument that every government has at its disposal to help ensure greater fairness and greater equity in our fiscal system so that those who profit more pay more. We are often told how progressive the tax system is in this State but that counts for nothing unless we take the necessary steps to impose those windfall taxes and help restore the confidence of citizens in our taxation system. People are outraged to see energy costs rising overnight as gas prices increase but remaining at a shockingly high level when gas prices have fallen. People have no faith in the system and windfall taxes would help to restore that balance. I fully support the call for Ireland to announce immediately its intention, like France, the Netherlands Germany and other European countries, to leave the Energy Charter Treaty.

It is very welcome to see a constructive set of proposals around a very serious problem that is facing us all. I am happy to see that. It is a form of constructive opposition. When I look at the motion I see that the Government agrees with most of what is in it. I will first address some specific questions that were raised by some Deputies. Deputies O'Callaghan and Harkin asked about the timeline on windfall taxes. The windfall divides into two types of tax, the first being a solidarity charge, called a solidarity contribution, which applies to organisations that own oil and gas reserves. The idea of this charge is that it will be levied on excess profits from the extraction of oil and gas, and that it would be applied according to the profits that are made. Ireland has decided to levy this at a rate of 75%, which I believe is one of the highest, if not the highest, in the EU. I believe that some other countries went for a 30% rate while we decided on a 75% tax on excess profits on the extraction of oil and gas. The Deputies have asked when this would apply. It applies for the years 2022 and 2023. In other words, it does apply retrospectively to last year's profits. We must know what those profits are before we can levy the tax, so we must wait for the company accounts and so on before we can levy that contribution. The other half of the windfall taxes is the cap on revenues of non-gas electricity generation. For example, this could be a wind farm that finds it is able to sell electricity at 20 cent or 30 cent per unit whereas previously it had only been selling it at 10 cent per unit, and yet its costs had not changed whatsoever. Or, if a company managed to obtain a really unjustified profit that could be traced back to a war it is not a very noble way of making money and therefore we have decided to limit those profits. The guidance we got from the EU was that we could, for example, sell it at 18 cent a unit as the maximum price that a non-gas electricity generator could charge for the electricity it produces. Rather than set that at 18 cent the Government has decided to set it at 12 cent for the maximum amount they can charge. Again, this is a much more stringent approach than most of the EU. In some contributions from Deputies they felt that our ambition was not far enough or that we were not implementing windfall taxes to the extent that other countries were. I genuinely believe that in both of those cases having a 75% tax on excess profits of oil and gas and setting a maximum price for non-electricity generators to sell electricity at 12 cent represents an ambitious approach. To those Deputies who are worried that the money would be spent elsewhere, the money has been legally ring-fenced by the EU. One question arose from Deputy Whitmore around whether Ireland is in contravention of the regulation from the Commission. I can confirm that we are not. We have been in contact with the Commission about this. The Government decision to implement this was taken on 22 November 2022. Deputy Canney worried that we are moving too fast on the electrification of the economy and that oil boilers and gas boilers should not be banned. They are not banned yet although I expect that the public sector will not be reinstalling oil and gas boilers as soon as possible. Why should one arm of the State be paying to retrofit heat pumps and remove oil and gas boilers, and cementing that, while at the same time another arm of the State is still installing them? Clearly, we must have some sense there. At the same time I take Deputy Canney's points on his concern that we must have a just transition, that we must help people to move along, that we need to bring people with us, and that we need to make sure we are not putting people into difficulty as we move. At the same time, I believe it would be wrong to say that we are moving too quickly. Deputy Pringle is worried that subsidies could support high prices and he pointed out that with electricity credit and so on there is a chance that adding money into the system can result in companies obtaining excess profits. The Deputy is absolutely right to be worried about that. We have to make sure that our interventions do not lead to excess profits and are not just snapped up by companies. That is the real fear with setting a cap on the price of electricity sold to consumers rather than a cap on the price that electricity generators can sell their electricity. They are different kinds of caps. Consider the example in Germany where the consumer price cap has, so far, cost them €80 billion. The problem with this is that it does nothing to limit the profits of the companies that are generating electricity. In Ireland the majority of the gas that comes into the country is imported. We are reliant on the overseas supply and the foreign price of gas. If we impose a cap on companies that are selling electricity to the consumer in Ireland, which is generated with imported gas, then we will have to subsidise them in order to allow them to continue to do that. The subsidies could be huge and it provides no incentive to reduce profits. We do, however, have control over the oil and any gas fields that are in Ireland, and we have control over any body generating electricity within the State. We can impose caps on how much they charge to sell and we can avoid the possibility of them making excess profits. The implementation details on the windfall charges are likely to be legislated for in the coming weeks. I expect the revenue from that will be in the hundreds of millions of euro. Previously, there were higher estimates of how much money could be brought in by a windfall tax. They were just based on higher future prices for gas and oil. As the price of wholesale gas has gone down the estimates for how much money will be brought in by windfall charge went down. It will still be in the hundreds of millions of euro. It will be significant and it will be ring-fenced. The Government, of course, is deeply aware and concerned by the pressure on people and business in Ireland among unprecedented high energy prices. It is a priority for the Government to provide supports to alleviate this. Intensive work is being undertaken and will continue to be undertaken to address the challenges faced by consumers. The Government is examining a wide range of future supports for consumers. This includes the evaluation of price caps. We are not ruling out anything, including price caps, in the approach we intend to take. We are examining what is possible and trying to make sure that we do not end up subsidising companies. Energy market developments are monitored, and Departments are working to support households and businesses to meet their energy costs. As previously outlined, the Government introduced a suite of measures worth €2.4 billion in 2022 to assist households with their energy costs, and budget 2023 provided for a further €2.5 billion in one-off measures to support households with the rising cost of living. I will not go through all of them, as there are at least ten. In April and May 2022, 99% of eligible domestic electricity accounts were credited with the electricity costs emergency benefit payment. One more of those payments is due next month. The number of domestic electricity accounts in receipt of the first credit is 2.15 million, which means that 99.1% of all eligible customers have now had the credit applied to their account. The Government has also increased funding for supports such as the fuel allowance, reducing VAT on gas and electricity bills, reduced excise duty on petrol and diesel and a total allocation of €267 million, of which €202 million is carbon tax receipts, to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland residential and community retrofit schemes in 2022. The energy poverty action plan, published in December 2022 in response to rising energy prices, sets out a range of near- and medium-term income, social protection and consumer protection support measures. This plan provides for the establishment of a €10 million fund to further support people in, or at risk of, energy poverty in 2023. There is also a provision in the plan to legislate to extend the definition of vulnerable customer to include financial vulnerability, which will extend the protection against disconnection for non-payment of account for a longer period over the winter. The Government has expressed strong views within the EU on the Energy Charter Treaty, ECT, and continues to reserve the option to support a co-ordinated EU withdrawal from the Energy Charter Treaty if it is not modernised to align with the Paris Agreement, address concerns about the ECT's dispute resolution mechanism and support the international effort to decarbonise electricity systems and promote more renewable energy. The Government will implement Council Regulation (EU) 2022/1854, which seeks to address the windfall gains in the energy sector by collecting excess revenues from those companies that have unexpectedly benefited from the high prices and to redistribute the revenues to alleviate pressure on affected energy consumers. The proceeds from the implementation of this Council regulation, including the temporary solidarity contribution and the cap on market revenues of non-gas electricity generators, will go towards financial supports to households and companies heavily affected by soaring energy prices. It may also be used to help support investment in areas such as renewable energy. The Government has provided, and will continue to provide, supports to people and businesses affected by the unprecedented high energy costs.

It is the key driver of the soaring cost of living that continues to affect every household in Ireland. However, we know that its impact is not indiscriminate. Low- and middle-income households are disproportionately affected by the soaring cost of living, as they spend a higher proportion of their budget on energy, food, and housing. This is borne out in the latest figures, which show that 40% of households are now estimated to be living in fuel poverty, nearly 270,000 customers were in arrears on their energy bills at the end of last year and the number of parents using food banks has doubled from what it was last year. This is the devastating reality of life in Ireland for so many workers and families, and while customers' bills soar, energy companies are making bumper profits. In the first six months of 2022, the ESB's profits more than tripled to a staggering €390 million. During that same period, Bord Gáis Energy's profits increased by 74%. To add insult to injury, both companies imposed multiple price hikes throughout last year. Despite wholesale energy costs decreasing in recent months, not a single energy company or supplier has reduced its prices. In fact, we are told it could be months, even next year, before household energy prices drop. The unbridled profiteering we have seen in recent years cannot be allowed to continue. The market is utterly failing customers. The State must step in, as it should have done long ago. Hard-pressed customers cannot wait any longer for the drop in wholesale gas and electricity prices to be reflected in their bills, not least because there is no guarantee that wholesale prices will drop for a sustained period. There are too many variables, including the very uncertain situation in Ukraine. That is why a new approach is urgently required. That is exactly what the Social Democrats propose in today's motion. The Government's failure to commit to price caps is indefensible. What is desperately needed is a targeted energy price cap, one which would cap the price of average energy usage for domestic customers and businesses. This approach would ensure that everyone gets their essential energy needs met at an affordable price and, crucially, that wealthier households do not disproportionately benefit. I urge the Minister of State to give our proposal immediate consideration. This is not a blanket energy price cap like the one introduced in the UK, with no upper limit on the amount of discounted energy. It is a targeted measure that would also incentivise energy conservation. Alongside targeted price caps is the urgent need to introduce a windfall tax on energy companies. It is a scandal that energy companies continue to profiteer from a war. The Government's reluctance to respond rapidly has been very disappointing. It is almost six months since the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, first announced his intention to introduce a windfall tax, yet we are still waiting for the necessary legislation as record profits go unchecked. Many households and businesses are at breaking point. They cannot absorb the soaring energy costs any longer. I very much welcome yesterday's announcement of the Government's intention to introduce a windfall tax, however late in the day. The key point is that households must be the main beneficiaries of this tax. In this respect, there is a strong case for a targeted price cap, as called for in the motion. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, to give this proposal urgent consideration. Will he assure the House that the fact that the Government is not opposing the motion today is meaningful? We look forward to further detail in that regard.
#JenniferWhitmore	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-party	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-dob	unknown-#JenniferWhitmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	54	The Minister of State's response to the Social Democrats proposal for a targeted price cap does not make sense. He says that he is reluctant to do this because the profits of energy companies could skyrocket. Those profits are skyrocketing now, and we are seeing people suffer. We are seeing businesses go under, parents who cannot feed their children and elderly people who are suffering from hypothermia because they are afraid or unable to put on their heating. The reason the Social Democrats proposed the price caps in the manner outlined is that they would be applied in conjunction with a windfall tax. We must have those two elements in place. We must limit the prices energy companies charge consumers. That would give clarity and certainty and remove the fear people have about the bills coming through their letterboxes every few months. At the same time, we must have caps on the profits. We must have those two elements in play. I am surprised the Government does not seem to understand that. There is not one big solution to this crisis. A number of measures must be put in place to fix and help people deal with it. The non-gas electricity cap to which the Minister of State referred is to apply from December 2022 until June 2023. By the time it is in place, we will probably be past June. In addition, it does not deal with the huge profits made by wind companies from January to November of last year.How will the Minister of State deal with those profits? Will he allow wind companies to make those huge profits on the backs of households throughout the country? That is unacceptable. The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, stated that we are in unprecedented times and that energy is being used as a weapon of war. While Putin may have started that race, the energy companies have picked up the baton. They are now using the war as an obscene way of making profits off the backs of vulnerable people. It is often said that in the midst of every crisis lies a great opportunity. Those energy companies have identified that opportunity and they are maxing out on it at the expense of our most vulnerable people. Companies will do what companies do. Their objective is to make money for their shareholders. It is the responsibility of the Minister of State and the Government to protect vulnerable people and to regulate what those companies can do to ensure that our most vulnerable people are not exposed to their profiteering. The Government is failing in that. The Government was behind the curve and behind the game in every element of this. The Minister of State talked about the windfall tax. Those measures were meant to be in place last December but they are not. The windfall tax on electricity generators will only be in place for a measly six months. The Minister of State talked about including financially vulnerable people and consumers in the Government's definition of vulnerable when it comes to disconnections. That was meant to be in place for winter 2022. It still has not been done. Every single measure the Government brings in is delayed. Every week that those measures and bringing in those policy changes are delayed means more and more people are being put under pressure, more businesses are going under, and more families are stressed and unable to feed their children. That is not acceptable. We expect the Government to plan, to future-proof and be prepared, and not deal with this in a reactive manner. The Government needs to put people and our small businesses first and make sure that corporations are not the ones wagging its tail.

I record that the 221+ group, working with the Minister for Health, alongside my colleague, Deputy Cullinane, and Deputy Kelly, have agreed an appropriate wording for an amendment to that Bill. I commend and thank all of them for that work. It has been most constructive and very much welcomed by the 221+ group. The cost-of-living crisis is impacting on households. People struggle to keep up with soaring bills across the board. Many people, three in five, according to a report from Deloitte, have no money left at the end of the month. People are now very worried about the months ahead. Times are especially hard for those on low pay whose wages have been outstripped by soaring costs. A report published by the Mandate trade union today presents the stark reality faced by many working in the retail sector. We see two thirds of retail workers earn less than €450 a week and only 20% of them earn more than €500 a week. The main reason for this is that many workers are not able to get the hours they need to make a decent living. Sharp practice by some employers denies additional hours to workers when they become available, forcing many close to the breadline. We are living through the biggest squeeze on household incomes in 40 years. Rents are through the roof, mortgage repayments are soaring, energy bills are out of control, grocery bills are increasing sharply and childcare fees are sky high. How can someone on a low or middle income get by? The answer is with very great difficulty. Many are on the brink. I spoke to one retail worker this morning who told me about the stress and pressure that she is under. Here is what she told me:I work hard but I just don’t get the hours I need to live with any security. Things were bad already, but we were just about getting by. Since the rise in living costs, I am having real trouble paying my bills. We’re really worried about being able to keep up the mortgage now. I don’t have a hope of putting any money away for a rainy day or if something goes wrong. The money isn’t there. I have colleagues - people who put in tough shifts - but they are now choosing between putting food on the table or paying the electricity bill. There is so much uncertainty and worry. It’s really tough going.Léiríonn tuarascáil Mandate go bhfuil oibrithe ar phá íseal faoi bhrú ollmhór de réir mar a leanann an ghéarchéim sa chostas maireachtála ar aghaidh. Ní mór don Rialtas pacáiste tacaíochta a thabhairt chun cinn chun an chinnteacht atá ag teastáil a thabhairt do theaghlaigh. The cost of living is devastating for people but just as it did last year, the Government is moving far too slowly in responding. Like last year, the Government is failing to give workers and families the clarity and certainty they need. In the last couple of weeks, the Government refused to back mortgage relief measures and refused to legislate to ban extortionate rent increases. When I asked the Taoiseach yesterday about extending the eviction ban, he came up blank. People are struggling now. They want to see a plan from the Government that will help them make it through the difficult months ahead. People are worried now. I ask the Taoiseach to give them the certainty they need today. I ask him to lay out clearly what actions his Government will take as the cost-of-living crisis continues to bite hard.

I met her many times in Dublin and also in the context of the British-Irish Council. I always found her to be an impressive, competent, articulate and thoughtful politician, a true European and a friend of Ireland. Certainly, she will always be welcome at our table. Táimid fíorbhuíoch de Nicola Sturgeon, Céad-Aire na hAlban. Is polaiteoir cliste, misneach agus láidir í. Bhí sí mar chara na hÉireann agus cara na hEorpa. Maidir le ceist an Teachta, tá an costas maireachtála an-ard in Éirinn anois agus tá a lán teaghlaigh agus daoine faoi bhrú. Rinne an Rialtas go leor agus cabhróidh an Rialtas sa todhchaí freisin. I acknowledge the fact that many people are suffering as a consequence of the rising cost of living. As the Deputy previously acknowledged, people appreciate that the factors driving it are largely international, including high energy prices, the war in Ukraine and a prolonged period of monetary policy that has now given rise to a high level of inflation. The Government has taken many actions to date. We will continue to act in the coming months to help people with the cost of living. Unfortunately, it will not be possible to fully compensate people for rising costs. We will do that as best we can for those on the lowest incomes and those who need the most help. However, it will not be possible for us to do it for everyone as, ultimately, anything we do is done with taxpayers' money and has to be recouped from people and businesses in the long run. It is worth once again putting on the record the 25 interventions the Government has already made to help people with the cost of living. These are: an autumn double payment of weekly social welfare and pension payments; a double payment of child benefit; a €400 fuel allowance lump-sum payment; a €500 working family payment lump-sum payment; €500 for people with disabilities, people who are blind and people on the invalidity pension; a €200 lump-sum payment for people in receipt of the living alone allowance; €500 for carers; a Christmas bonus double payment for pensioners and people on social welfare; in the past few weeks, a €12 a week increase in pension and weekly social welfare payments, which is the largest single increase since the mid-2000s; the largest ever expansion of the fuel allowance scheme, with a particular focus on people over 70; increased income thresholds for the working family payment; the expansion of hot school meals; an increase in the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance; two fuel allowance lump-sum payments; an energy credit of €200, with another €200 being paid at the moment and a further €200 to come in March; a reduction in student fees; a 25% reduction in childcare costs; a rent tax credit; a reduction in public transport fees; a reduction in the cost of the drugs payment scheme; and reductions in VAT and excise duties.A lot has been done, but we acknowledge that inflation is still high, that prices continue to rise and that we will need to act again in the coming weeks to help people with the cost of living through the spring and summer. Ministers will meet this week with a view to making a decision at Cabinet next Tuesday on further actions we can take. Finally, I have not yet had a chance to read the Mandate report but I have seen the summary. The Government is committed to making work pay better and ensuring that efforts are rewarded. There was a 7.8% increase in the national minimum wage only a few weeks ago. We think that will actually exceed the inflation rate for this year, and that will result in a knock-on increase for others on low pay. Statutory sick pay is now a reality, workplace tips and gratuities are now protected, we have had the additional public holiday and we are now moving towards a living wage over the next four years.

I have absolutely no doubt but that she will continue always to advocate for the country and the people she loves. Nicola, beir bua agus beannacht. The Taoiseach gave me a very studied non-answer to my question, unless he is contesting the reality that three in five people report that they have no money left at the end of the week, or unless he is contesting the fact that those on low and middle incomes are struggling badly and need answers from him now as to what he is prepared to do now, not retrospective self-praise, which, I remind him, is in the end no praise. I have asked the Taoiseach to set out specifics. People are struggling with the cost of their mortgages, they are struggling with the cost of their rents and their energy bills are now sky-high. As for groceries, it is widely reported that people are making choices between food on the table and the electricity bill. Will the Taoiseach please be more specific and set out in his view what needs to happen to support these struggling families?

I will be able to be specific in a few days' time, once we have made those decisions. I do not think it is unreasonable of me to point out what has been done. It would be a more gracious Opposition leader who would be willing to acknowledge what has been done. I have pointed out what has been done. I have been a bit concerned as I have listened to some of the things the Deputy has said over recent weeks. We have stood opposite each other in this Chamber again on only a few occasions so far this year, and in that period the Deputy has proposed an uncosted energy price cap, she has proposed to reopen historical compensation schemes, she has proposed to refund what she says are illegal nursing home charges to a cost of up to €7 billion, she has proposed to increase the rent tax credit and she has proposed mortgage interest relief. None of that can possibly add up. People in Ireland have a good education system; they are able to add and subtract.

She has been undoubtedly a powerful force in Scottish politics throughout that time. I wish her well personally following that surprise announcement. The Taoiseach has acknowledged that people across the country are struggling despite the Government's measures introduced in the budget last year. We in the Labour Party predicted last October that there would need to be a mini-budget or a series of further measures implemented by the Government in the spring in order to deal with the cliff edge so many households face now as they see one-off measures come to an end. The Taoiseach has said he will meet with Ministers later this week and will make recommendations to the Cabinet on Tuesday. We are likely, therefore, to see in coming days a drip-feed of leaks emerge from the parliamentary party meetings of Government parties. We are likely to see kites flown and the Government testing the waters to see which proposals are politically expedient and which are not. I hope I am wrong in that prediction but I think it is very likely. However, it would be an insult to households across Ireland who are simply powerless at present. They are unable to plan for the future because they simply have no clarity or certainty from the Government on what will be included in what it is not calling a mini-budget but what will undoubtedly be some sort of cost-of-living package of measures. We are already hearing stories about what may be introduced by the Government but we need clarity. I will give the Taoiseach an example of a household in my constituency which simply cannot withstand this non-stop kite flying and needs urgently to see clarity from the Government. I raised this case earlier today during the debate on the windfall tax. My constituents, a family of two adults and two children, received a heating bill recently. Despite having been away for three weeks over the two-month billing period, their district heating bill for those two months alone stands at €1,700, a shocking figure. They cannot afford to wait weeks without knowing with any clarity what will come from the Government to assist them. Other constituents of mine, a single mother and her child who are housing assistance payment, HAP, tenants, have been forced to turn off their heat and hot water altogether because they cannot afford the extortionate bills. With seriously cold weather due to arrive at the end of this month and a "beast from the east" predicted, that mother, and so many others, cannot afford weeks of kite flying from the Government. We have heard from so many other constituents. One family cannot pay off their tracker mortgage, which is likely to have risen by over €450 per month with the new interest rate increases. They say they simply cannot afford to cut back on anything else. Right across the country people are struggling. What we need to see is clarity from the Government now as to when the mini-budget will be announced and what its measures will include. Will they be targeted, as Social Justice Ireland has called for, or will they be simply a series of more universal measures which are unlikely to make any real impact for the families I am talking about who are struggling and are in such a dire state of paralysis because they simply do not know how they will meet their spiralling bills?

We will not have a mini-budget. That is not necessary. The budget set out the fiscal parameters for this year, and anything we do or announce between now and the next budget will be done within the confines of those parameters. However, we have some room to manoeuvre. There has been an underspend on the temporary business energy support scheme, TBESS, which means we will be able to do more for business. We have some reserve funds. We will also have revenue coming in from the windfall tax on energy companies. That allows us some room for manoeuvre within the budget parameters of this year. There will be no requirement at all for a mini-budget between now and budget 2024 in the autumn. I take the Deputy's point about kite flying and speculation. I do not want to say anything today that might raise expectations that end up being dashed next week.

They will be targeted because pensioners, people on low incomes and people in receipt of social welfare payments are suffering the most from the rising cost of living, particularly because groceries and energy costs have gone up the most. There will therefore be targeted measures and there will be a welfare element to this, as I said on Sunday. There will, however, be universal measures as well because all households, including middle-income households, are experiencing the rise in the cost of living, and I do not think it would be right to tell middle-income families that they are being left out and that we are doing nothing for them.

This sounds like a mini-budget. If there is a finance Bill, it sounds very much like a mini-budget. I am glad that the Taoiseach has confirmed that there will be clarity on Tuesday. Will we have a Dáil debate next week? Are people likely to know next week what the nature of the measures will be, which ones will be targeted and which ones will be universal? It would be reasonable to give legislators in this Chamber some indication of a timeline for the introduction of these measures. I agree with the Taoiseach that speculation is unhelpful. There has been speculation on things like a 30% tax rate, for example. These kite-flying suggestions are simply not helpful in the context of struggling families and households. I want to finish by referring to the Mandate report that was launched today. I was glad to meet Mandate earlier and to hear directly from it about the stark examples and situation of so many of its members, 64% of whom earn below €451 per week. That is in a context where, in Dublin, average monthly rents are €2,324 per month. This figure illustrates the shortfall for so many people who simply cannot afford even to pay rents, let alone meet the other bills that are spiralling. I ask the Taoiseach to give us clarity on the timeline for next week now that we have established that next Tuesday will be critical.

We will make decisions no later than the Cabinet meeting next Tuesday, we will inform the Dáil and the public next Tuesday and then any legislation that has to be done between now and 28 February will be done. I know we will have the Deputy's co-operation with that matter. On the Mandate report, as the Deputy knows, we are moving from a national minimum wage to a living wage. This is year one of the four-year process of doing that. I understand that in its report, Mandate points out that a lot of retail workers would like to earn more by working longer hours but the banded hours contract system prevents them from doing that. I believe in rewarding work and in making work pay more. If people want to work longer hours, they should be allowed to do so, provided it is not a breach of the working time directive. On foot of the report Mandate has published, the Minister of State with responsibility for employment affairs and retail business, Deputy Richmond, will be happy to sit down with Mandate, hear it out and see how he can respond in a meaningful way.

That is 40 less than the EU average of 318 per 100,000. Since these 2016 figures were compiled, Ireland is reported to have increased its population to over 5.1 million people as of April 2022. A recent report based on Garda website figures and freedom of information requests shows the Garda to population ratio to be 241 gardaí per 100,000 of population. That is another reduction of some 38 gardaí per 100,000 of population. In recent weeks and months there have been daily headlines such as: "Revealed: the 42 garda stations without any full-time officer". Another headline stated:Garda morale is at a low as a ‘culture of fear’ pervades the force. One in three of the officers who left last year resigned rather than retiring on age, health or other grounds.We used to have a problem in not having enough patrol cars but now we do not have enough gardaí to drive them. We read such headlines every day. Some 450 gardaí left the force last year and the Taoiseach's statement to Deputy McDonald yesterday was that there was enough funding in place for Garda retirements and resignations to be taken care of. However, there are only 89 gardaí in training. Was the Taoiseach's statement yesterday accurate? Deputy Varadkar has been in government since 2017, either as Taoiseach or Tánaiste, and the declining numbers are a crisis. Every town in the country is showing signs of this failing. There is no point in setting up drugs task forces or committees to make recommendations that cannot be implemented because the gardaí are not available. There is no point in passing laws to address these issues either. This same recruitment and retention crisis exists across many of our Government Departments, all of which are getting worse. If money is not the issue, we need to look at the structure and management of same. I asked the Taoiseach last week to review the reason Garda transfers were taking so long and he was quite flippant in his response. My information is that gardaí who are driving five hours per day to serve active duty are ready to resign from the force. While I welcome the announcement from Commissioner Drew Harris that the Garda will conduct exit interviews from now on, it is akin to closing the stable door when the horse has bolted. If you listen to any of the representative organisations or associations, the problems are well pronounced, but it seems that no one in charge is listening. Can the Taoiseach give details of what long-term plan is in place to ensure Garda numbers grow with the population and are retained in line with European norms?

In order to do so, we need more gardaí and we need to properly train and support them. We also need to invest in our Defence Forces, the Courts Service and the Irish Prison Service. I appreciate that gardaí are working hard, they are under a lot of pressure and their jobs are much more challenging than they would have been in the past for lots of different reasons. We need to increase the number of gardaí we have. In the budget we allocated enough money to recruit 1,000 new gardaí this year. That has to take account of the fact that there will be retirements, as there always are, and that there will be resignations, as there always are. However, it will still be enough to see a net increase in the number of gardaí this year, and that is what we expect and anticipate to happen. There was a slowdown in recruitment due to the restrictions brought in due to Covid and we will now see recruitment speed up. That is happening already. I met the Garda Commissioner about this before Christmas and I have spoken to the Minister, Deputy Harris, about it as well. In any comparisons we make, we have to bear in mind that the Garda does not just consist of sworn officers but that there are also Garda staff. Increasingly, we have Garda staff being employed and they are freeing up gardaí for front-line duties, which is of particular importance. The number of gardaí in the country fell to about 12,000 back in 2015 and that was after a period of austerity and retrenchment. By the end of last year it had gone up to 14,000 but I appreciate that is in the context of a rising population and we have to adjust for that, not just when it suits us but for all metrics. Our target is to get up to 15,000 gardaí. On resignations, roughly 100 or so gardaí resigned from the force last year, which is roughly a 1% resignation rate. We live in a different world from the one we had five, ten or 15 years ago. Now it is typical in an organisation to see resignation rates of 5% or 6%. We have full employment and people are less interested in the job for life so a 1% resignation rate is not particularly high, either by international standards or when you compare it with other organisations. However, exit interviews are useful and I am glad they will happen. On transfers, I am sorry if I did not answer the Deputy's question appropriately last week. I do not know the detail of that particular issue but if she wants to give me some more information on it, I would be happy to take it up with the Minister, Deputy Harris, who can then talk to the Commissioner about it.

While 100 resignations may reflect only 1%, the reality is that if the job was good enough I am not sure we would have any resignations. We need to carry out the exit interviews immediately and we also need to listen to the representative organisations. In County Wexford, Rosslare has seen increased and exponential growth because of Brexit. We have 550,000 passengers coming through the port. In 2022, we had 200,000 freight units come through. However, we have seen no increase in resources, despite numerous business plans being put forward by the hierarchy in the force in Wexford. We have seen a 75% reduction in gardaí in Courtown - from four gardaí to one - even though it has seen population growth. Bunclody is a sizable town, although it is not a town as named in Wexford. It is a big area, but we have reduced capacity in the Garda force there from eight to four. It is not good enough. We have drug issues all over this country. It is not just Wexford but it is all over the country. The front of our local newspaper carries a story every week on the increase in crime. I ask the Taoiseach to take that in hand.

That involves increasing the number of gardaí and investing in our Defence Forces, the Courts Service and the Irish Prison Service.It also involves dealing with the underlying causes of crime which are very much linked to poverty and deprivation, and other matters too. We are making a priority of this. As I mentioned earlier, the Garda is funded in the budget to recruit 1,000 gardaí this year. We believe this will be more than enough to cover retirements and resignations. That will lead to a net increase in the number of gardaí this year as we move towards the target of 15,000. Only this week, I will be having a meeting on the issue of Garda stations. A number of projects have been held up for far too long in different places in the country and we are trying to get movement on them as well.

Before I begin, I acknowledge the great work that has been done by an advocate and, indeed, a patient of neurology herself, Dr. Rosie Mangan, from County Offaly. Rosie attends hospital, and has to travel to Dublin four times a week. She is an advocate, as I say, and has launched a campaign, Right to Rehab. I acknowledge that lady's great work, some of which I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware of. Indeed, I am sure the Taoiseach will be aware that neurological conditions which affect the brain and spine are the leading cause of disability throughout the world and include many common conditions such as stroke, migraine, epilepsy and acquired brain injury in addition to certain rare and genetic conditions. According to the latest data to hand, almost 24,000 Irish people are on a waiting list for a neurology outpatient appointment. The number of people on the neurology outpatient waiting list is continuing to rise, with the number waiting more than 18 months increasing by 30% in the past year. In fact, there is also a shortfall of 100 neurology nurses in Ireland based on official national and international guidelines relative to population. It is in that context that the Patients Deserve Better campaign was launched. It is being promoted by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, which is an umbrella group of non-profit organisations advocating for the rights of 800,000 citizens living with a neurological condition. Today I want to focus on one particular ask, and that is the need for a dedicated community neuro-rehabilitation team for community healthcare organisation, CHO, 8, which includes my constituency of Laois-Offaly, where just one in every two neurology patients has access to services. A community neuro-rehabilitation team for CHO 8 was recommended in the implementation framework for the national neuro-rehabilitation strategy 2019-21 but no team has been funded despite implementation of this framework being a commitment in the current programme for Government. These multidisciplinary teams provide access to key specialist supports, including physiotherapy, speech and language therapy, neuropsychology and occupational therapy, for people living with a range of neurological conditions including acquired brain injury, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and rare neurological conditions such as motor neurone disease and Huntington's disease. We can only imagine what a deficit in services means for those directly affected by such a diagnosis but for their families and loved ones who have to travel to St. James's Hospital in Dublin three or four times a week because there are no local services, it is simply appalling. Will the Taoiseach work with the Minister for Health to commit to the delivery and prioritisation of a neuro-rehabilitation team for Laois-Offaly and the wider CHO 8 area?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	80	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue of neurology services, generally and particularly in CHO area 8 and in Laois-Offaly. It is a specific question about a specific branch of medicine in the Deputy's part of the country, which is the midlands. I do not have a detailed note on it right now but I will try to get the Deputy more information in writing this week or next week. What I can say in broader terms is that we acknowledge that neurology services are nowhere near the standard that they should be. The budget for this year provides additional funding for community-based neuro-rehabilitation teams. I am not sure if CHO 8 will be one of those but we will try to come back to the Deputy with more information over the next couple of days. One of the issues that we have had a difficulty with is recruiting consultant neurologists around the country and that has caused waiting lists to rise in some parts of the country. We are now at the point where we have a new consultant contract, which is being offered. I understand the Irish Medical Organisation will ballot its members on that. The Irish Hospital Consultants Association will survey its members on it. We hope to be in a position to offer that in a matter of weeks. It is a very attractive offer financially. It requires consultants to phase out private practice in public hospitals and commit to the public health system. It also amends working practices so that we can get more value and make sure more patients get seen. That is a significant reform that the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has pretty much got over the line and will bring us a big way towards achieving the vision in the Sláintecare report. We are also training more advanced nurse practitioners. As somebody who has worked in the health service, I know the excellent work that advanced nurse practitioners do. The more of them we can train, the better. The same goes for clinical nurse specialists. Finally, I would like to mention to the House that while we do not have the exact figures yet, we are in a position to say that we are now making progress in terms of waiting lists overall, albeit certainly not in every specialty and not in all parts of the country. As the House will be aware, in the Sláintecare report we more or less said that nobody should be waiting more than three months for a procedure or to see a specialist. We all acknowledge there will always be people waiting a few weeks, but nobody should be waiting more than three months or so to see a specialist or to have a particular procedure done, and there are Sláintecare targets in that regard. The end of year figures for 2022 would indicate that the number of people waiting more than that three-month benchmark in Sláintecare has fallen by somewhere between 4% and 10%. That is against a backdrop where we see waiting lists rise north of the Border, in Britain and across the world, against the backdrop of Covid and against the backdrop of a cyberattack. It shows that we are finally making some meaningful progress in terms of waiting lists. We intend to build on that this year.

I want to acknowledge the work done by Senator Victor Boyhan, who brought forward an excellent motion on this issue in the Seanad. There is cross-party support. Deputies in all parties, as I said, have raised this, as have Senators. It is something that has to be got to grips with. The Taoiseach mentioned that the budget provides for funding for neuro-rehabilitation teams. CHO 8, which includes Laois-Offaly, is without doubt one of the worst. It has to be prioritised because patients are being failed. If just one in every two patients is getting access to a service, particularly when it involves a serious condition such as a neurological condition, it has to be prioritised. I would stress to the Taoiseach that a neuro-rehabilitation team needs to be delivered in Laois-Offaly and the wider CHO 8 area. I acknowledge that approximately 3,230 additional neurology outpatient appointments were due to be delivered by 2022 through once-off funding. The problem with once-off funding is that it does not provide a patient pathway. It is not long term. It is not consistent. What we need here is long-term vision and consistency.

I am advised that we have funding this year for 23 neuro-rehabilitation nurses. These will be permanent positions, not once-off ones. As I mentioned in my earlier reply, we have a new consultant contract that is being offered. I hope the bodies that represent doctors will accept that. It will allow us to take some significant steps forward in terms of retaining and hiring specialists in neurology and other areas over the next couple of years. In relation to CHO 8 which, I appreciate, covers Laois-Offaly, and is the priority of the Deputy's question, I do not have a detailed note on that here. I do not want to give the Deputy information that might not be correct. We will correspond with the Deputy over the course of the next week and give her any more information that we can.

Of the eight courts with the longest waiting times, six have no refuge or safe accommodation provision in their counties.The Government speaks about an epidemic of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence but there is no urgency in its actions. We welcomed the third strategy but publishing a document alone will not prevent abuse or protect victims. We cannot wait for the establishment of the new agency to address the absence of safe accommodation in nine counties. Courts cannot prevent abuse if they do not have judges to hear the domestic violence cases. When will the heads of Bill for the new agency be published? Will safe accommodation be delivered this year for the counties currently without any refuge provision?

We want the voice of the service user, the drug user, to be central to the deliberations of the citizens' assembly on drugs. As a matter of course, a special committee will be set up following the deliberations of the citizens' assembly. That is how these matters tend to play out. Will the Taoiseach commit to viewing the deliberations and findings of the citizens' assembly on drugs in good faith and to the Government moving to implement the findings of the citizens' assembly and the special committee because this is a crucial issue for so many people in our country?

These recommendations will be sent to an Oireachtas committee that will study them in a bit more detail and report to the Oireachtas and Government as to what the next steps should be. It is always the case that we accept the recommendations from a citizens' assembly in good faith, but it is never the case that we will say in advance that we will accept any recommendation it makes no matter what it is. In fairness, I do not think the Deputy is asking us to do that. What will happen is that we will accept the recommendations in good faith, examine them on an individual basis and issue a reasoned response once the Oireachtas committee has done its work.

However, independent analysis of the number of homes completed and certified by the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office shows that less than 24,000 homes were built. Is the Taoiseach aware that, according to the methodology used by the CSO, its calculations on the number of new homes built may only have an 83% level of accuracy? Furthermore, in terms of the crosschecking carried out on its data, the CSO states it has a considerably higher number - 22% more - of false positives compared to false negatives? The CSO states its methodology may have a "bias towards overcounting new dwellings". Given the considerable caveats in the methodology, is there merit in using the hard data from the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office to count the number of homes completed last year?

At that point, the CSO updated its methodology. The methodology the office uses, which is published on its website, was welcomed across the board at the time, including by Deputy Ó Broin, for example, and others. I am a little bit disappointed, now that the figures are showing we are exceeding our targets, some people want to change the way we count them again. The methodology was welcomed by the Opposition at the time, particularly by Deputy Ó Broin. The CSO has issued a statement on this. I understand it states that the private firm, Construction Information Services, to which the Deputy referred, is reporting 6,000 fewer new builds than the CSO official data. Essentially, what the CSO is saying is that the system the private company is using is subject to under-coverage as it does not capture all new dwellings, particularly one-off dwellings, of which there are 6,000 to 8,000 every year. The CSO is an independent body. It is not subject to political influence and it does not spin the numbers. I think we should respect its work.

Tusla has admitted this was not true, Ms R got her son back and there has been a public apology. She is now taking a case against the State but she was shocked that the legal defence of the State Claims Agency is in contradiction with the apology issued by Tusla. She contacted the CEO of Tusla who agreed with her. Tusla contacted the State Claims Agency and told the agency that Tusla was not happy with the defence. However, the State Claims Agency is persisting with the original line of defence. This raises serious questions. How can the Government, Cabinet and State agencies hold their hands up and say, "We did wrong", yet this is ignored by State Claims Agency? This is the Government's policy of aggressive litigation in real time. I am not asking the Taoiseach to address the specific case, but will the Government will stop the policy of aggressive litigation and align the State Claims Agency with what is right and just?

Organisations refusing to take cash from people are becoming more prevalent. I am shocked and appalled by the GAA and have been writing to the association, for nearly 12 months, asking it about the situation. Elderly people, who played for and gave their lives to the GAA, worked in clubs and did everything in support of the association, cannot get into matches if they have not prebooked a ticket. They can buy a programme inside the grounds with cash. The same is happening in hospitals and in restaurants. People can make a lifestyle choice to do that, but some of these people are in their late 70s, 80s and older, in their 90s. They do not have the wherewithal to do this. Many of them are men of the cloth, bachelors and people like that who do not have family around them to do it for them. It is embarrassing that one turnstile cannot be open to them. It is a policy of Cumann Lúthchleas Gael. It is a despicable policy as far as I am concerned. It is not a good trend to be setting in our country.

We want to encourage electronic payments. By the way, many older people and bachelors use cards, phones and Revolut and are well capable of doing so.

Before the current cost-of-living increases, it was recognised that fair deal scheme payments to nursing homes were inadequate. There was an 8% increase in inflation last year and 7% is forecast this year. More and more nursing homes, especially those that are smaller and family-run, are struggling to survive, and more will close this year. What is happening is that we are losing existing capacity and while some new nursing homes are coming onstream, overall there is still a net loss of beds when bed numbers should be increased. There is huge demand and the new nursing homes are largely located in cities and larger towns while rural areas are losing their existing nursing homes. I am asking the Taoiseach to act on this.

The Government and myself as Minister of State working with the Minister, Deputy Donnelly, are completely supportive of the nursing home sector. A sum of €1.5 billion will be provided this year to support 22,500 people who avail of the fair deal. Some 80% of nursing homes are run by voluntary and private organisations. Less than 4% of these are voluntary. In the past two weeks alone, I have engaged with Nursing Homes Ireland, The Alliance, a new organisation covering County Kerry up to County Donegal that represents small and family-run nursing homes and Carriglea Cairde Services which also represents nursing homes. In addition, I am in constant consultation through my Department with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and anybody who has renewed their deed in the past three or four weeks with the NTPF, will have seen an uplift of between €40 and €90 per person, per week. Moves have been made and I was delighted to receive further support of €41 million from the Cabinet for the NTPF in last year's budget.

A few hundred thousand people in this country suffer from a rare disease while more than 6,000 rare diseases known at present and many more are undiagnosed or unidentified. I am asking the Taoiseach, as I have done previously, and the Minister for Health, both publicly and privately, about the Mazars report, the reimbursement process in this country and how we do our business. I was under the impression that this report would have been published at this stage and to my knowledge, that still has not happened. Will the Minister clarlify where the Mazars report is?

Those living abroad for up to five to ten or 15 years, likely as a result of the Celtic tiger economic crash, have reported difficulties setting up bank or credit union accounts, getting housing assistance, access to schools and college places, or even obtaining car or health insurance. Trying to start a business is also compounded by these difficulties. We need to appreciate the thousands of returning citizens and provide a one-stop shop with a range of services for returning Irish. I ask the Government to commit to assessing, monitoring, and removing barriers for returning Irish citizens and address their needs to ease their return and resettlement.

Last year alone, 30,000 Irish citizens came home. As is the nature of migration, a lot of people go abroad but a lot of people come back. At least for the past three years, more Irish citizens have returned than have left. I am not sure that will be the case this year but tens of thousands of people come home every year and they run into some real difficulties, whether it is in getting insurance, finding housing if they do not have it already, setting up bank accounts and all of those things. The Department of Foreign Affairs has done a report on this already and is looking at ways we can assist people so that when somebody comes back to live in Ireland, their experience is better than it has been to date.

The so-called cash for visas programme allowed wealthy people to receive Irish residency in exchange for investments in business or a charitable contribution. There have been serious concerns surrounding the operation of some of the investments made. For instance, last week I raised the situation of the Nuremore Hotel and Country Club in Carrickmacross where staff have not received their salaries owed and where unpaid bills have resulted in the services being disconnected. This has created concerns for the future of the hotel and a potential substantial cost to the State if insolvency follows. We are told the Government decision to close the immigrant investor programme was informed by both internal and external reviews. Will those reviews be published and will the Taoiseach and the Government commit to a full examination of the operation of this programme?

For that reason, the Minister, Deputy Harris, on advice, has taken the decision to close entry to new applicants, I think as of close of business today. Having said that, where there has been engagement with the Department already, there will be a grace period of up to three months for applications that either have come in already or have not come in yet.

No lesser person than the Secretary General of the United Nations, António Guterres, has warned we could be heading towards "a wider war". He also said that the prospects for peace keep diminishing and that he fears the world is not sleepwalking into a wider war, stating, "I feel it is doing so with its eyes wide open." He noted that scientists and security experts had moved the doomsday clock to just 90 seconds to midnight last month, and concluded: "We have started 2023 staring down the barrel of a confluence of challenges unlike any in our lifetimes." What is the Government doing to de-escalate confrontation and violence and to promote dialogue in both the United Nations and in the European Community?

I heard the Secretary General's words and I share the concerns about the escalating conflicts around the world, not just in Ukraine but also elsewhere. The doomsday clock has been around approximately 70 years now and it has always been at 20 minutes to midnight. I would bear that in mind too. I know it is three or four seconds now but when something has been 20 minutes or less from midnight for 70 years, in fairness one starts to wonder about the clock. Leaving that aside, the serious point the Deputy raises is valid. We do what we can do at European and UN level to make the case for peace but a peace has to be a just peace. I know the Deputy did not specifically raise the issue of Ukraine but when it comes to these conflicts, the aggressors need to stop and that it is the focus we have at EU and UN level.

Each local authority was asked to make a submission outlining its priority projects for that funding. One such priority project outlined by Galway County Council is for the village of Craughwell. It is a perfect example of the kind of investment needed to allow this what is now essentially a town to grow and expand and to provide new housing for the many young families in the area. It is a very attractive place to live in as a commuter town for Galway city and its development is essentially stifled right now. It is put on pause until such time as this plant is put in place.Two private independent plants are malfunctioning and creating huge issues for the residents of two estates in Craughwell. It is reflective of many rural towns and villages throughout the country. Almost a year later, when will funding under the scheme be announced?

We want to invest in our towns and villages so that every town and village can have a certain amount of natural growth. It is important that we facilitate that. As the Deputy acknowledged, €50 million in funding has been provided specifically for wastewater collection and treatment needs in villages and settlements without access to public wastewater services. Submissions have been made from Craughwell and Clarinbridge, which were sent by the Department to the EPA and Uisce Éireann last November. I am advised that the EPA and Uisce Éireann reported back to the Department only last Friday. The expert panel is evaluating the applications, including the assessments from EPA and Uisce Éireann.

It has been raised with me recently that a significant and substantial burden has been placed on people who have company cars. Unfortunately, they are put to the pin of their collar because of the new taxes that have been imposed on them if they are driving particular types of vehicles, such as a 2 l standard family-sized SUV. The tax on such vehicles has increased by approximately €6,000 per year. This is a crippling amount of taxation to be placed on working families. It is an unforeseen consequence of some of the changes in the previous budget. Can the Government consider this in the forthcoming budget, as well as during the year, as it is having a detrimental impact on the self-employed who are on the road, paying their taxes and working hard? This tax is an unfair burden on people who happen to have diesel vehicles.

This measure was introduced in the Finance Act 2019, with a lead-in period to 1 January this year. The purpose of this lead-in period was to allow fleet planning by corporate organisations that were planning leases, which are typically over three years, to enable a transition to electric vehicles and others. This is a carbon-based measure that brings the benefit-in-kind taxation regime into line with other vehicle taxation regimes, such as motor tax and vehicle registration tax, which, of course, are carbon-based. The legislation aligns the three taxes across the board with a lead-in period. I appreciate the difficulty people are facing at the moment, but the lead-in period was put in place to enable corporates to plan for their employees. I strongly encourage employees to look towards electric vehicle grants that are available to further facilitate the transition.

Hundreds of thousands of medical card holders the length and breadth of the State have no access to dental care. People with existing serious illness and deteriorating dental conditions are being denied access to care. On top of that, 5,000 primary school children in County Louth and 6,000 primary school children in County Meath have no access to regular checkups. We are now into the third year of this. How long does it take to reform the scheme? It is a scheme that should never been allowed to collapse in the first instance. People are now of the opinion that the Government is content to deprive people with medical cards access to dental care. I can only assume the same now that we are in the third year of this crisis. If that is not the case, given that we are into the third year of this, can the Minister tell us when people with medical cards can access the dental care to which they are entitled?

One of her colleagues gave an example the last time we had a debate on this of a case where a dentist refused to treat a patient under the DTSS, but took the patient back when they were in agony and willing to pay privately. I do not believe that is acceptable. The Government has a role, but dentists should sign up to the scheme and should provide treatment to people with medical cards.

In my constituency, there is a ridiculous situation whereby somebody who can work from home on a Friday is instead choosing to drive to Kilkenny simply to reduce their tax liability because they need the extra mileage. On a day when a car should be sitting in a driveway and generating no emissions, it is instead doing a 200 km round trip because the owner cannot afford to leave it in the driveway and increase the tax bill. Government policy is to reduce emissions, and that is absolutely right. However, the reality is that the new benefit-in-kind band rates and rules are incentivising higher mileage to reduce tax liability. On top of that, people with electric company vehicles are now paying benefit-in-kind. These are major costs for workers and those who require company vehicles. Can the new rules that began on 1 January be revised or reviewed?

I am happy to look at the circumstances of an individual case and have the Department examine it to provide guidance. As I said, the purpose of this benefit-in-kind legislation is to bring it in line with other taxes from an emissions perspective. I will go through the bands the Deputy separately. I appreciate that in 2019 we could not have anticipated the inflationary environment or cost of energy, which is now very different. I will revert to the Deputy on the specifics of the case she has raised.

That is why we introduced the rent tax credit in the budget to help renters with the cost of renting. One of the interesting things fin the daft.ie report released yesterday showed that for people who are established tenants, that is, the vast majority of tenants, rents went up by approximately 3.5%, which is slower than average incomes are rising and well lower than the general rate of inflation. However, rents are really high for new-to-market tenancies. Unfortunately, one of the problems with rent and price controls is that they provide at least some protection for people who are established renters but those who pay the price are those who need to move and new renters. New properties coming online are expensive. I do not know what we can do about that, other than ramp up supply and cost-rental housing. That is the difficulty with rent pressure zones.

The 11 officers in the stores and material management department of University Hospital Kerry changed their shifts and organised PPE in the hospital and in the community, as well as doing their normal jobs of organising beds and wheelchairs. Having done that, they now see workers in other hospitals have received the payment.

There are specific guidelines across hospitals. Broadly, the payment is for people working in hospitals in patient areas. For example, security, catering, cleaning and contract are all covered. The kinds of people working in an acute setting who would not be covered might include people working in an administrative office that is typically separated from patient areas. If the 11 workers to which the Deputy referred were working in areas where there would be typically patients around, they should be entitled to the payment.If the Deputy sends me a note, I will take a look.  It would be remiss of me not to point out, and I am sure the Deputy will acknowledge, that his own party proposed a €200 recognition payment whereas the workers around the system have been getting €1,000 tax-free under this scheme.

CAMHS north with a staffing equivalent of 6.3 whole-time equivalents sees 49% of referrals, while CAMHS south with a staffing rate of 7.3 whole-time equivalents sees 29% of referrals. Both services have only half the complement of staff. GPs tell me that the issue is that CAMHS south does not see ADHD referrals. I do not know what an access one diagnosis is but I am reliably informed by GPs that ADHD is an access one diagnosis. We are failing these children. GPs are left scratching their heads with nowhere to go and are contacting the staff in CAMHS north to ask what they can do. We are failing our children and a court case is coming. Can we have a solution?

Kerry received €799,000 from the fund this year. It will do approximately 15 roads. However, there are 673 applications as of today to be dealt with. These are public roads that are not taken in charge. At the rate we are going, it will take 30 years to deal with them. These roads are used by households, farmers and service providers, including doctors and nurses. These people pay their motor tax, property tax, income tax, VAT and excise the same as people in Dublin. Counties with fewer applications are getting more when we in Kerry have a Minister - the Minister for Education - from the county. The people of Kerry are entitled to the same quality of roads as the people in Dublin 4. They even provide their own water supply and septic tanks. The people of Kerry are being denied fair play. It will take 30 years to exhaust the list we have.

I think she allocated €12 million or €15 million to local authorities for that scheme in the past couple of days. I know it is a very important scheme for resurfacing and improving laneways across rural Ireland, as is the case in Dublin. It does operate in Dublin. It is open to local authorities to use their own resources from commercial rates, property tax and other sources to invest in local and regional roads. The VAT rate for the tourism and hospitality sector is due to go up from 9% to 13.5% on 28 February. No decision has been made on extending that. I will be in UHL on Friday. I look forward to the visit and hope the Deputy will be able to accompany me.

All aspects of CAMHS will be developed under the forthcoming HSE service plan 2023. The Deputy is correct. There are two CAMHS teams in Wexford. One has a very low waiting list while the other has a higher waiting list. I was able to visit Arden House in Wexford last year. One of the issues the interim report of the Mental Health Commission showed up was the difference between the number of acceptances in various CAMHS teams around the country. This is an issue we are looking at. Acceptance into CAMHS is always made by a multidisciplinary team and is a clinical decision. According to preliminary evidence I have seen from the various audits that are taking place, over 50% of referrals to CAMHS are ADHD-based. I can talk to the Deputy about this matter afterwards.

The Government Information Service, GIS, includes the Government Press Office and the merrionstreet.ie content team and works on a cross-functional and collaborative basis to provide the Taoiseach, the Government and the Department with press office and communications services; ensure strong collaboration and co-ordination among press and communications officials in other Departments and agencies; co-ordinate, amplify and create communications around Government priorities such as Housing for All, climate action and energy, Ukraine, shared island, Brexit, Covid-19 and the national well-being framework; and lead the development of Government communications, facilitate and encourage capacity-building in the area of communications and engagement across the Civil Service and public service and manage the "Government of Ireland" identity and unified web presence, www.gov.ie. There are 18.6 posts in the division, an increase of one from January 2022. This reflects the increasing workload of the Department, particularly regarding whole-of-government matters, including Ukraine, housing, shared island and climate action and energy.

During the last general election campaign, the current Tánaiste, Micheál Martin, was asked to define the Taoiseach in one word and he used the word "spin". Little did we know that a few months later, both he and the Taoiseach would be spinning around on a rotating Taoiseach deal. It is really important that we have transparency regarding how money is spent in the Department of the Taoiseach in this manner. During Covid, tens of thousands of euro was spent advertising a phase 4 reopening. Shortly afterwards, tens of thousands of euro were spent promoting a reclosing, a safe Christmas and a locking down so two separate and contradictory messages were being delivered in a short space of time. In his first outing as Taoiseach, the Taoiseach spent about €100,000 per month on this. We know the Department of the Taoiseach spent over €1 million on online advertising in 2021. Can the Taoiseach give us some information on the wages earned in the press office in his Department, including the highest wage and the average wage? Are private public relations companies employed by his Department and, if so, how much are they being paid?

On the issue of national security, we have seen serious concerns raised by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, ICCL, in the past week about the use of Hikvision cameras in the Houses of the Oireachtas. I know the Office of Public Works, OPW, is conducting a review but we require an urgent update given that other parliaments, including the European Parliament, have discontinued the use of Hikvision cameras because of concerns about Chinese surveillance of European institutions.In the past week, we have also seen a ransomware attack on Munster Technological University, with personal data released on the dark web. The refrain of national security is a vital one in this instance but, unfortunately, it is often used to stymie debate and discussion. The Taoiseach will recall I wrote to him and the Tánaiste on 14 December last about the need for national security briefings for Opposition leaders, as is a common practice in other countries. I am speaking not just about the issues I have just raised but about other concerns that have come to public attention, such as the involvement of dissident republicans in organised crime, the huge cyberattack on the HSE and very serious concerns about Russian Government operations and possible espionage in Ireland. Again, I have raised with the Taoiseach on several occasions the large number of accredited Russian diplomats located in the Russian Embassy in Dublin. I have raised with him reports that a US State Department assessment estimates Russia has covertly spent more than $300 million in recent years to influence politicians in many countries, including European countries. Personally, since I was named on the Russian sanctions list along with many others in this House, a large number of anonymous, or bot, accounts are now targeting my posts on social media. It is very observable that there is an impact from this. Does the Taoiseach agree that in a democracy, opposition leaders should be briefed on matters of national security, and put in place a system to do so? When will a new national security strategy be published and will it be debated in the Dáil? Will we get an update urgently from the Office of Public Works, OPW, on the Hikvision issue?

The problem is that people who are impacted by that crisis are often very uncertain about these fairly general announcements and need a human being they can go and see to explain the often complex and difficult circumstances in which they find themselves when they are applying for things such as the exceptional needs payment. As I have repeatedly raised along with others in this House, we do not have, as we used to, a drop-in community welfare service, where people could go and talk to the community welfare officer, or the relieving officer as they used to be known, and explain their very specific circumstances rather than having to make appointments, which may not be for a few weeks' time, or do things online, which is often difficult for elderly people or other cohorts. While it is all very well having general advertisements and announcements saying people may be entitled to this or that assistance for the cost-of-living crisis, the reality is that if there is not somebody in the community welfare office whom people can drop in to and see on the day, they often struggle and have great difficulty in accessing the supports that may be there. Will the Taoiseach do something as a matter of urgency about returning the drop-in community welfare service to every area so that people can go down on a given day, see a community welfare officer and explain their situation to him or her?

I do not know how the sums add up in respect of telling people they have to wait for additional supports while they are struggling to make ends meet, while across Departments more than 192 people are employed in communications, or PR spin to use a different term. The relationship between Departments and Ministers who are particularly bad at communicating and the large number of communications staff who are employed by those same Ministers and Departments is staggering. The Department of Transport has ten communications officers and the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications has 11. That is 21 communications staff for the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, probably the worst communicator in Irish politics. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which the Taoiseach just left, tops the poll, with 15.5 such staff members. How can we justify having almost 200 employees whose sole job is to promote the Government at a time when there are so many pressures on services and on the delivery of supports to workers and families?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	146	In respect of the questions about the communications function in my Department, I am not personally involved in any decisions on advertising, staffing or the awarding of private contracts to anyone for communications purposes. These are matters for the Secretary General. I hear what Deputy Carthy said about communications staff across Departments and I appreciate he has not had any Executive experience of serving in government. For those staff, who are almost all civil servants, they and their unions might be a little offended at the Deputy's suggestion that their job is to handle communications on behalf of politicians or Ministers. That is not the case. Ministers have one press adviser and that person is a special adviser. All the other communications staff working in a Department are civil servants and they do not promote or work on behalf of the Minister. They are there to communicate with the public and the Oireachtas. A lot of their time may be spent on communicating with the Deputy and his party - he might not realise that - and they respond to comments and questions from the media as well. As for some of the costs, the breakdown of the staff is as follows, and these are the grades at which they are paid: principal officer, one; assistant principal officer, 3.6 whole-time equivalents; administrative officer or higher executive officer, nine; executive officer, four; and clerical officer, one. On the question regarding Covid-19 communications, €2 million has been allocated for any expenditure that might be needed for Covid-19 public communications this year, although we do not anticipate it is going to be spent. In terms of online advertising, the costs incurred by the Department have fallen in recent years. The figure was €1.45 million in 2020 and, largely as a consequence of Covid, that fell to €1.1 million in 2021 and to €256,000 only last year, so the spend on Covid-related communications has been falling as the restrictions eased and as Covid has become an endemic virus. On the question of national security briefings for Opposition leaders, I will certainly give that some thought. Different countries do things in different ways. I do not get a regular, quarterly or monthly national security briefing. It tends to happen on a relatively ad hoc basis, as needed. Maybe that should change and perhaps we should give consideration to providing Opposition leaders with national security briefings as well. There is not a tradition of doing that in Ireland. I know it is done in other countries but we would need appropriate safeguards around that and absolute confidence about it. All Opposition leaders are not the same in that regard, if I can put it that way.

Obviously, that is because people have needed them, but it also demonstrates there is capacity in the system to receive applications and make payments. The system at the moment is a mixture - online, by phone and by appointment - and I think that is probably more efficient in the round than a drop-in service, but it is something for the Minister for Social Protection to work on. I will certainly let her know Deputy Boyd Barrett has raised it on more than one occasion in the House.

The public service, justice and policing reform unit is part of the wider social policy and public service reform division within the Department of the Taoiseach. The work of the unit assists me, in my role as Taoiseach, on criminal justice and policing reform, public service reform, social affairs and other related matters, assists the Civil Service management board, including the Civil Service renewal programme, and contributes to the oversight and governance of the new public services reform plan. The unit also assists the work of the Cabinet committee on social affairs and public services and the associated senior officials' group established to oversee implementation of programme for Government commitments in the areas of social policy, equality, integration and public services.The policy areas covered include gender equality, which encompasses efforts to reduce domestic, sexual and gender-based violence; area-based disadvantage, where my Department is involved in new approaches to community safety and also chairs the programme board extending the lessons from the new model of intervention in the north east inner city to other areas that experience disadvantage; and a broad range of other social affairs matters, including arts and culture, diversity, social inclusion and child poverty, migrant integration, the Irish language, and sport. The unit incorporates the policing reform implementation programme office which oversees the implementation of A Policing Service for our Future, the Government's plan to reform policing in Ireland in line with the report of the Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland. In addition, the section has departmental oversight of the National Economic and Social Council, participates in relevant interdepartmental committees and other groups, and provides me with briefings and speech material on all related matters.

It is approaching 12 years since Shane was killed by a man who should have been in prison at the time and five years since the Dáil and Seanad adopted resolutions calling for an independent public inquiry into the actions of An Garda Síochána and other State agencies both before and after Shane's death. The Taoiseach's Government at the time ignored those resolutions and instead established a scoping exercise, something no one had sought. The failures of the policing and justice system in the lead-up to Shane's death and the actions thereafter and to this day are significant not only to his family but are in the wider public interest. Will the Taoiseach please indicate that the Government will advance the establishment of the independent inquiry that is so clearly warranted in this case?

I think it is part of the wider problem of recruitment and retention in staff in key areas of the public service. I will give just two examples. If people are looking for medical priority in the housing list, often in very serious situations, they are now having to wait between six and nine months in my area just to get the application processed. For example, Leo, who is 73 years and has chronic spinal problems, is couch-surfing. He has been waiting five months for his application to be processed. Then there is another case of a couple where the husband was recently diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's. He can no longer work and the couple are in very serious difficulty with their housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancy because it was based on their previous earnings. They are trying to get medical priority but they are waiting months. I could go on through the list. The picture is similar for people who are looking to get their social housing eligibility assessed based on the new thresholds. We need to do something to ensure that staff resources are there to address these matters in local authorities.

It is on the reality of a hard border that exists for non-EU migrants on this island. For example, someone who is married to an Irish or UK national could be living in the North perfectly legally as a refugee or migrant worker but would not be able to travel to the South freely. That is something that is entirely in the gift of the Government to resolve to give these people the right to travel. Will he agree to do that and get rid of that aspect of the hard border? There is another question that relates to the British Government but that would create significant pressure. Second, does the Taoiseach agree that time spent living in the North should contribute towards demonstrating a connection with the Irish State in terms of establishing a right to citizenship and that this should be treated the same as time living in the South? This is a shared island. People in the North should be able to apply for passports. Will the Taoiseach meet with the North West Migrant forum on these issues?

Those working as occupational therapists through to speech and language therapists, for example, are different from those working in other sectors of the public service. They work in the public service first and then go into private practice. There is an issue with home care assistants who are in the old home help role. There are people who were in that role and have left it. These are valuable public services that are needed for the most vulnerable in our society. Has the Taoiseach looked at this? What is the State doing to ensure care staff are retained? They are much needed in society.

It didn't feel fair. It felt like they were violating our privacy." Workers at JD Sports in Patrick's Street in Cork have, in the last week, highlighted the fact that they are regularly asked to lift their tops and show their bare stomach area to store managers. The store says the policy is part of its campaign against shop lifting. It already has the right to search bags and jackets when workers leave the shop. There is a real power imbalance here. On the one hand, we have an international corporation which is predicted to make over £1 billion this year, while, on the other, we have a group of young workers from Cork. It would be helpful if the Taoiseach commented on this in the Dáil and perhaps indicate whether he feels if there might be a basis for some legislative change to outlaw situations such as this.

She has raised serious concerns that domestic violence victims and survivors are waiting up to four months in some cases for courts to hear safety applications. It is, in effect, a postcode lottery as to how long a woman will have to wait, ranging from 16 weeks, or four months, in Trim, County Meath, to 14 weeks in Tullamore, 12 weeks in Carlow and Nenagh and up to eight weeks in Bray, Clonmel and Ennis. This is a real concern, particularly as we are seeing such strong plans and ambitions at national level on tackling domestic and gender-based violence. The shortage of judges and the absence of consistency in approaches to these applications across different courts are really serious matters of concern. How will this be addressed? Are there plans to appoint more judges? How will these inconsistencies be solved? Finally, on Garda recruitment, can a review be carried out on what needs to be addressed to improve the attractiveness with An Garda Síochána as we are seeing shortfalls in the numbers of gardaí recruited?

She died as a result of her heart being pierced when she was only two days old. I am sure that the Taoiseach will agree that this was an absolutely heartbreaking scenario for the family. Incredibly, we have another family which has had to fight the HSE through the legal system for seven years just to achieve justice for their child. Yesterday, it emerged there was a settlement. Where is the accountability for what happened to Laoise? Where is the disciplinary action for that? Will anything happen to anyone as a result of what happened to this girl?

A scoping exercise was done. I think it was by a retired judge. I have not seen the report but I know the Minister for Justice, Deputy Harris, is very keen to publish the report as soon as possible. He wants to put the published report out there. We want Members to be able to read it for themselves so that, having read the report, they can make an informed decision as to whether a further inquiry is appropriate.I understand there have been a number of inquiries already. We are very keen to be fair to the O'Farrell family but we also need to be fair to those being inquired into. Many of them have been inquired into already and we have to bear that in mind, and the impact on them and their families. The common travel area between Britain and Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic Ireland only applies to UK and Irish citizens. It does not apply to EU or non-EEA citizens, and that causes problems for them. I have raised it in my conversations with Prime Minister Sunak, particularly in the context of the proposal to bring in an electronic travel authorisation, ETA. That would make life unnecessarily hard for EU and non-EEA nationals who regularly cross the Border. That is a concern we have. On the matters raised by the Deputy, I do not know enough about the details of that area. I appreciate he raised it with the Tánaiste when he was Taoiseach but I do not want to say something that may turn out to be incorrect without a proper understanding of it. If the Deputy sends me a short note on it or something, I will take a look into it and see if there is something practical we can do to help people to cross the Border freely, as they should be allowed to do, but does not have other implications that I may not have considered. On the general question of public service recruitment and retention, public bodies and private companies across the board are struggling to recruit and retain staff. That is true in the public and private sectors and in almost every sector of the economy, among big companies and small, well-paid jobs and poorly paid. It is a reflection of the fact we have close to full employment in Ireland, which we have rarely had in our history. It is very much an employee's market. There is no sector of our economy or society that is not struggling to recruit and retain staff at the moment. I would rather be in this position of close to full employment than there being 10% or 20% unemployment, when recruitment and retention would be much easier, but it is a problem nonetheless. What we are doing, particularly when it comes to health and social care, is increasing dramatically the number of people we train as nurses, doctors, therapists and health and social care professionals, recognising that the world has changed, people change careers and travel and, just to stand still, we need to train and recruit more than we did in the past. We are adjusting our policies to do exactly that.  The issue of Garda recruitment is linked to that. We have funding for 1,000 additional gardaí this year and that should be more than enough to cover retirements and resignations. We hope to see a net increase in the number of gardaí this year, heading towards a target of 15,000. I discussed this with the Garda Commissioner when I met him before Christmas. Recruitment slowed down greatly in the past two years because of the restrictions related to Covid. He and the Minister are confident it can increase significantly in the coming months. We need to see if that happens, but that is the position, as they are informing me. I prefer not to comment on the issue in relation to JD Sports. I am not aware of the incidents that are happening. The first I heard of it was now. There may already be labour law or other laws covering this area. I am not able to comment without knowing all the facts or the current legal position. On District Court waiting times, it is a Government priority to ensure the courts are resourced to administer justice efficiently and effectively. That is central to ensuring there is access to justice. The Courts Service works closely with the Judiciary to address backlogs and prioritise urgent work. However, a whole-of-system approach is required in order to address systemic challenges. The Minister for Justice is optimistic that both implementation of the recommendations of the judicial planning working group and the commitment by the Courts Service in its corporate strategic plan to maximise use of digital technologies to provide a more efficient and user-centred service will lead to improved efficiencies and shorter waiting times in due course. The Minister is very much aware of the delays in proceedings on vulnerable victims and it is important to point out that applications for urgent interim domestic violence orders are prioritised by the courts and are heard in the District Court on the day the application is made or at the next court sitting. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has requested a report on the disparity in waiting times between districts for family law domestic violence applications from the Courts Service. Waiting times for other domestic violence applications vary across districts but the majority hear these applications at the next sitting. Like everyone, I have seen the newspaper and media reports on baby Laoise Kavanagh. I think we all feel for the Ó Scolaí and Kavanagh family and what they have endured. For everyone in this House it is difficult to comment on an individual case. None of us knows all the details and it would take anyone a long time to be fully across all the details of any medical case of this nature. When it comes to individual responsibility, where it relates to a doctor it is done through the Medical Council and where it relates to a midwife it is done through the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland.

The Cabinet committee on the humanitarian response to Ukraine last met on Tuesday, 31 January and the next meeting is scheduled for 23 February. This committee, which I chair, works to ensure a co-ordinated approach to the State's humanitarian response to people arriving from Ukraine who have sought temporary protection here. Since the start of the war, more than 73,000 people arriving from Ukraine have availed of temporary protection in Ireland. To date we have accommodated over 78,000 people who have fled here, between international protection applicants currently in the international protection accommodation services, IPAS, system and those fleeing the war in Ukraine who have sought accommodation from the State. The Government is focused on managing ongoing pressures on accommodation and services and significant capacity challenges in the face of continuing arrivals. We are also advancing the State's move from an emergency response to a more mainstreamed sustainable approach. Such an approach will be consistent and equitable for all, in light of the high volume of people seeking asylum and the need to maximise all existing capacity. This will ensure the provision of services and assistance is in line with international obligations and consistent and equitable in terms of criteria, needs assessment and means-testing. In addition to meetings of the Cabinet committee, I have regular engagements with Ministers at Cabinet and individually to discuss matters of concern for their Departments. The Government is keeping our response to all aspects of this humanitarian crisis, in particular accommodation options, under continuous review.

That Minister of State already has responsibility for two other Departments. In order to properly deal with the ongoing problems of implementing the White Paper and the six reception centres promised in it, co-ordinating a response and getting other Departments into line in dealing with the services which have been put under obvious strain by the influx, would it not be more appropriate to at least appoint a junior Minister whose sole responsibility is for integration, rather than giving the responsibility to an already overburdened junior Minister?

The Taoiseach has given the figures. We are all conscious of the enormous welcome and warmth there is. What is lacking is a strong co-ordinated response from the Government, particularly to the accommodation of refugees and those seeking international protection. We in the Labour Party and across the Opposition, as well as in the Ukraine civil society forum, have consistently called for stronger co-ordination and more support from other Departments for the Department of the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, than appears to be the case currently and, in particular, for the appointment of a dedicated junior Minister with responsibility for the housing of refugees and those seeking protection.We need a point person, which we have pointed out on numerous occasions. I have consistently raised the need for us to have a point person who will co-ordinate information to public representatives and to whom we can furnish information on large vacant buildings. In my constituency, the offers we suggested of Baggot Street Hospital and the empty Jurys hotel at Ballsbridge, which has more than 400 rooms, are simply going into the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. There is no sense that there is any one co-ordinated point that will follow up on these offers. We hear that the International Protection Accommodation Services, IPAS, is under-resourced and simply does not have the capacity to take up offers of accommodation that have been made to it. That is very serious. We also need to see a co-ordinated national information campaign from the Government. We are seeing very worrying signs of mobilisation by the far right and the exploitation of an information vacuum by a small number of sinister actors in spreading disinformation and then protests and intimidation. We need to see a national information campaign similar to that rolled out during Covid-19 to counter the myths that are spreading. Finally, I ask the Taoiseach to take on the social media companies because their platforms are allowing misinformation to spread. They are facilitating, in some cases, violent and intimidatory protests and, indeed, attacks on public representatives. Is the Taoiseach planning to meet with Facebook, TikTok, Twitter and others about this spread of disinformation?

What measures are in place to stop this happening with regard to Ukrainian refugees who are staying in places that did not previously have refugees, for example, hotels? I was in touch with Ukrainian refugees who told me an extremely concerning story about what has been taking place at The Address hotel in Citywest in which 141 Ukrainian refugees are staying. The State is paying the hotel for them to stay there. They spoke about the extremely poor quality of food being provided to them, which is overwhelmingly fried food that is having very negative consequences for their children's health in particular. They have seen a deterioration in their children's health and in the quality of food since they moved in there on 1 July of last year. They have no capacity to cook their own food. They have no access to the kitchen and cannot have proper cooking facilities in the hotel rooms. They are now paying for this food, and since they have been paying for it they approached the management and asked whether the food could be improved and whether they could have more fruit and vegetables and so on. The approach of management was horrendous and extremely rude and brusque, including someone saying, "You need to eat less so you can be slim like me." It is a horrendous abuse of power. Then, to top it off, the three representatives of the refugees were evicted from the hotel. They were evicted from the only place they have to live because they were standing up for the refugees and negotiating with management about that issue. It is a horrendous abuse of power. What measures are in place to ensure this sort of thing cannot happen?

It looks, unfortunately, like we are about to see a period of significant escalation in the war in the coming weeks. We are in a very dark stage as the world is pouring weapons into the region at the moment. It is clear that Russia is the aggressor. It is responsible for the horrendous violence and the disaster that is unfolding. As the Taoiseach said earlier, Russia is responsible for bringing the invasion to an end. What efforts are being made, either by this Government or the European Union, with regard to seeking peace and potentially creating some opportunity for negotiations? Most wars end in negotiations. Most peace comes from some level of negotiations, but the voices for peace are invisible at the moment. Is any effort being made by the Government, either dealing directly with Russia or through the European Union, to see if peace can be achieved?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	163	I thank Deputies for their questions. When we talk about the whole issue of Ukraine and the wider migration issue, we need to put it into context. We are seeing a war on the Continent of Europe the likes of which we have not seen since the 1940s. We are seeing refugee movements across Europe the likes of which we have not seen in our lifetimes, certainly not since the 1940s. We have seen a trebling of international protection applicants from outside the European Union coming into Europe and also into Ireland. This is an unprecedented situation. I do not think we have seen as many people on the move for a very long time. The last time we would have seen something like this in Ireland would have been in the aftermath of the Famine and that was people moving out rather than in. Not far off 100,000 people have come to Ireland in the past year, either from Ukraine or other parts of the world applying for international protection. Even if we had amazing foresight two years ago and decided to build a city the size of Waterford with 20,000 houses and apartments, that would be full by now. That is the scale and the numbers with which we are dealing. When we consider it that way, we have performed very well as a country and a society. We have taken in more people from Ukraine on a per capita basis than any other country in western Europe and provided them with shelter, heat and light, accommodation, access to education and healthcare and protection. When we look back on this period, we as a country will be proud of the contribution we have made to help Ukrainians escape the terrible war that this has been visited on them by Vladimir Putin and those around him. When it comes to the appointment of a Minister of State with specific responsibility for integration, which has been proposed by Sinn Féin, or a Minister of State with responsibility for the housing of migrants, which has been proposed by the Labour Party, I am not sure if that is the appointment of one new Minister of State or two. By the way, I do not think it is a bad idea but the law sets out very clearly that we can only have 20 Ministers of State. I am not really sure what is being proposed here. Is it additional Ministers of State to bring that figure to 21 or 22 or is it that we should suppress existing posts? If so, which ones, and why? I would be very reluctant, quite frankly, to come into the Dáil with legislation to increase the numbers of Ministers of State unless I had an understanding from other parties about whether we can increase the number from 20 to something higher, which I am open to, or whether we should abolish particular positions and if so, which ones and why. If we are going to do anything on it at all, I would really seek all-party consensus on it. I do not want to come into the Chamber and propose the appointment of extra Ministers of State only to be told this is a terrible thing by the same people who would have been calling for it for months. I hope Deputy Bacik will accept that I am sincere in that regard. I want to say on the floor of the House that the response from the Government is co-ordinated. I do not think it is fair to say it is not. There is and must be a lead Department, as there must be for everything. In this case, the lead Department, appropriately, is the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. There is a co-ordinated response from Government, however. There is a Cabinet sub-committee, which I chair as Taoiseach. Senior officials from my Department are across what is going on. To give Deputies a few examples as to how other aspects of the State and the Government have helped out, as we know, the Defence Forces have provided accommodation in barracks and camps and are willing to do more. The Department of Transport provides services in the airports and ports where people arrive. The Department of Justice has a role to play as well, of course, in Border control. The Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science has and will provide student accommodation in the summer for refugees, as needed. The Department of Foreign Affairs has regular engagement with the Ukrainian and other authorities. The Department of Health has provided medical cards and health services for tens of thousands of people. The Department of Education has made sure that 14,000 Ukrainian children have been enrolled in our schools. The HSE has put forward dozens of buildings to be considered for refurbishment to accommodate migrants. The Office of Public Works, OPW, is in charge of putting in place 700 modular homes for Ukrainians this year. It is, therefore, a co-ordinated response. The suggestion that the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth has been left to do it all on its own is unfair and does not stack up when we see how many other people in different Government Departments and agencies who do work in different aspects of the State are really doing all they can to help out. I do not have any have any plans at the moment to meet with the online platforms. However, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Coveney, and Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Catherine Martin, do engage with the online social media platforms on a regular basis. I may ask them to take up the point in their particular meetings.I am aware of the complaints that have been made in relation to the Address Hotel. I understand they are being investigated. I believe we all agree that the best way to achieve peace in Ukraine is for Russia to withdraw, and if not withdraw fully from Ukraine then at least withdraw to the borders and the line of control that we had one year ago. While it is the case that from time to time EU leaders are in contact with Russia, it is not something I am doing. I have no particular relationship with President Putin. I have only met him once very briefly, but there are others who do. Those who have been in contact with him have come away with a very grim assessment that there is no interest and no willingness on the Russian side to de-escalate this conflict. We must bear in mind that it is the Russians who are firing missiles into Ukrainian cities and who are sending their drones to attack Ukrainian civilian targets. It is not the other way round. The Ukrainians cannot stop doing that. It is Russia that is occupying Ukrainian territory. What can the Ukrainians do? Should they stop defending themselves? I do not believe that is a realistic ask. I would never ask them not to defend themselves. The only prospect of peace arises when there is a change of heart and a change of minds in the Kremlin, and a willingness at the very least to pause and to pull back. That would appear to not at all be the case. In fact, they are planning an escalation and planning on murdering more people and doing as much harm and damage as they can.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	164	I move: “That the Bill be now read a Second Time." I am pleased to present this Bill to the House. The purposes of this relatively short but important Bill is to modernise and reform the current legislative basis for the Civil Defence organisation. There is a requirement to do this as the existing regulatory framework, consisting of enactments dating from 1939 to 2012, no longer provides a comprehensive statutory basis for civil defence matters. I welcome the opportunity afforded by this debate to acknowledge and to pay a warm tribute to the Civil Defence organisation and, in particular, the local Civil Defence volunteers who are based in every county in the State. As the House will be aware, Civil Defence volunteers have a proud tradition of supporting the principal response agencies in dealing with a wide variety of emergency situations such as severe weather and searching for missing persons. Civil Defence volunteers also support community events every week. In recent years, Civil Defence has played an integral role in the response to the Covid-19 pandemic and the provision of support to Ukrainians seeking protection in Ireland. During the Covid-19 pandemic, Civil Defence volunteers provided significant support within their communities in every county across the State. Approximately 9,500 tasks were undertaken by Civil Defence volunteers during this period in support of the local authorities, the HSE and An Garda Síochána. In recognition of the role played by Civil Defence volunteers during the pandemic, a specially designed medal was commissioned for the almost 1,500 members involved in supporting the national response to Covid-19. Deputies may recall the recent event held in Croke Park on the 29 November last year at which medals were presented to a large number of volunteers from all around the State. Since March 2022, Civil Defence units have been actively involved in supporting Ukrainians seeking protection in Ireland. This has included setting up and operating temporary rest centres. Volunteers have also transported Ukrainians to and from their accommodation and to meetings for school registration, medical appointments and so on. These are just some examples of the invaluable support provided by Civil Defence volunteers on an ongoing basis to local communities throughout the State. The commitment to volunteering, which is integral to the successful operation of Civil Defence, is a clear demonstration of the very best in Irish society. The purpose of the Bill, as I mentioned, is to replace the current suite of legislation relating to the Civil Defence, which comprises the Air-Raid Precautions Acts 1939 to 1946 and the Civil Defence Act 2012, with a comprehensive and updated Civil Defence Act. Civil Defence, which was established in 1951, is a State-funded, volunteer-based organisation with a nationwide footprint supporting the principal response agencies, as well as local communities. Over the years, Civil Defence has operated in accordance with the provisions of the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 to 1946. Although Civil Defence Bills were enacted in 2002 and 2012, there has been no comprehensive updating of civil defence legislation to replace the Air-Raid Precautions Acts. These enactments dating back to the late 1930s and the 1940s were framed in a very different era and are no longer adequate for the ongoing and future development of Civil Defence. The White Paper on Defence 2015 included a commitment to replace existing legislation concerning Civil Defence with a more modern aggregated legislative basis. The White Paper also stated that the future of Civil Defence will continue to be developed around its central strategic objective of supporting the principal response agencies, namely An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, in a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations. A policy document Civil Defence - Towards 2030 published by the Department in 2020 sets out the core roles and services of Civil Defence. Towards 2030 emphasised the volunteer ethos of the Civil Defence organisation. The preparation of the policy document involved consultation with all stakeholders including Civil Defence officers, Civil Defence volunteers, the Civil Defence interagency guidance team, and the principal response agencies, including local authorities who are responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence. The Bill, therefore, follows on from the commitment in the White Paper on Defence regarding the preparation of revised Civil Defence legislation and from the publication in 2020 of Civil Defence - Towards 2030. It is important to note that, although the Bill does not set out any major departures from existing policy, the new legislation ensures that there is a comprehensive legislative basis for the operation of Civil Defence. The Bill reaffirms the continuing role at a national level of the Department of Defence in managing and developing the overall strategies and policies regarding Civil Defence matters and sets out the ongoing responsibility of the local authorities for operational matters such as the recruitment of volunteers and the delivery of Civil Defence services.The legislation, therefore, builds on the long-standing and successful model whereby local authorities manage the local operations of Civil Defence with the support at a central government level of the Department of Defence. Within the Department, the Civil Defence branch, which has been based for many years in Roscrea, is responsible for civil defence matters, including the training of instructors who deliver training courses for Civil Defence volunteers around the country. As regards financial matters, I can confirm that the long-standing funding model for the Civil Defence whereby funding is provided by both the Department of Defence and local authorities will remain unchanged under this legislation. During 2022, €3.6 million in grant funding was provided by my Department to the 28 local authority Civil Defence units. Under the pre-legislative scrutiny process, the general scheme of this Bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. As part of this process, my officials made a presentation to the committee regarding the draft legislative proposals. There was also constructive engagement and discussion between committee members and my officials on the proposed Bill. Following the presentation, the committee agreed that it would not undertake further pre-legislative scrutiny on the Bill. I will now outline briefly the main provisions of the Bill. Section I contains definitions. It is a standard section that provides definitions for key terms used in the Bill. Section 2, which relates to functions of Minister relating to civil defence, sets out the responsibility of the Minister for Defence for the overall policies and strategies relating to civil defence. The section also makes provision for the Minister to undertake a range of general functions relating to civil defence, including the provision of various services in support of local authorities. The section also sets out the requirement for local authorities to comply with any directions concerning civil defence matters issued by the Minister under this legislation. Section 3 relates to the provision within specified time limits of information by a local authority to the Minister for Defence concerning civil defence matters. Section 4 relates to the establishment by each local authority of a dedicated Civil Defence unit for the purpose of providing civil defence services in the administrative area of that local authority. The section includes provisions enabling a local authority to make arrangements concerning the establishment of a joint Civil Defence unit with one or more other local authorities, as is the case, for example, in Dublin, for the purposes of providing shared civil defence services in the administrative areas of the local authorities. Any such arrangement shall be subject to the consent of the Minister for Defence. Essentially, this section provides in an updated manner for the continuation of the existing arrangements as they relate to the operation of Civil Defence units at local authority level. Section 5 relates to the employment by local authorities of Civil defence officers. The role of Civil Defence officers is important as they manage the operation of civil defence at a local authority level, including the registration, training and management of Civil Defence volunteers. The section also includes necessary provisions concerning the numbers of Civil Defence officers employed by each local authority and their terms and conditions. Section 6 relates to the appointment of persons as Civil Defence volunteers by local authorities. The section sets out that the Minister may give directions to local authorities concerning Civil Defence volunteers. These directions include: the persons eligible to be a Civil Defence volunteer; how applications to be a Civil Defence volunteer should be made; the requirement on applicants to undergo vetting by the National Vetting Bureau; mandatory conditions that will apply to a Civil Defence volunteer, including conditions concerning training, attendance and adherence to any Civil Defence code of practice that may be in place. Section 7 provides for the mandatory establishment by each local authority of a register of persons serving as Civil Defence volunteers in that local authority area. The intention is that the register will be maintained in an electronic form. Currently, local authorities are required to maintain a similar register under the Civil Defence Act. Any such register currently maintained by local authorities shall be deemed to be the register for the purpose of this Act. On the commencement of the legislation, the title of the exiting register will change from the "Register of Civil Defence Members" to the "Register of Civil Defence Volunteers" so as to more appropriately reflect the voluntary nature of civil defence. The electronic register of Civil Defence volunteers will be maintained by local authorities and will include a range of information as specified in the section. Care has been taken during the preparation of this section to reaffirm that any personal data held on the register is stored and processed subject to compliance with data protection legislation. Access to the information in the register will be strictly limited to persons specified in the legislation. The section also provides that a volunteer can inspect the register in respect of their personal information and, if necessary, seek to have any errors corrected. Data entered on the register shall only be retained for as long as necessary and in accordance with data protection legislation. In that regard, a number of legislative safeguards are included in the section to ensure full compliance with data protection requirements. In line with the provisions of section 84(12) of the Data Protection Act 2018, consultation took place with the Data Protection Commission regarding the provisions in the legislation concerning the processing of personal data held on the register. Section 8 updates existing provisions concerning the preparation by local authorities of civil defence plans. A civil defence plan sets out the key objectives and strategies of a local authority in the operation of the Civil Defence in the local authority area. The plan will be reviewed and, if necessary, updated at least every three years and the Minister may direct a local authority to make specific amendments to the plan. Under the new legislation, a local authority will be obliged to publish the civil defence plan once it has been approved by the Minister for Defence. Section 9 restates in an updated form the long-standing arrangements under which the Minister for Defence provides grant funding to local authorities in support of civil defence activities. The funding provided shall not exceed in a year a maximum of 70% of civil defence expenditure, unless prior approval is received from the Minister by a local authority. The section also provides that a local authority may, with the approval of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, incur expenses relating to civil defence. Section 10 relates to the making by the Minister for Defence of regulations concerning codes of practice for Civil Defence volunteers. A code of practice made under this section may set out matters such as: procedures relating to the suspension and revocation by local authorities of the registration of persons as Civil Defence volunteers; grievance and disciplinary procedures for Civil Defence volunteers; and the standards of conduct and integrity for Civil Defence volunteers in carrying out their duties. Section 11 is a standard provision providing that expenses incurred will be paid out of moneys provided by the Oireachtas. Section 12 is another standard section concerning the making of regulations. Section 13 provides for the repeal of the Air Raid Precautions Acts 1939 and 1946 and the Civil Defence Act 2012. I mentioned earlier that these enactments comprise the existing suite of legislation concerning civil defence matters and they are being replaced with this modern piece of legislation. Section 14 provides for a number of necessary transitional provisions which are required as the existing enactments relating to civil defence are being repealed. Finally, section 15 is a standard provision that deals with the Short Title as well as arrangements for the commencement of the legislation. In summary, while this is a relatively short Bill, it is necessary to better support the important work of the Civil Defence and the almost 2,700 Civil Defence volunteers. There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage for a more detailed discussion on this legislation. The implementation of this legislation will provide the Civil Defence with the necessary legislative basis to operate effectively and to continue to serve communities across the country. I am pleased to submit this legislation for the consideration of the House. I commend it to the House.

It is a piece of work identified in the White Paper on Defence to provide more modern aggregated legislation. Sinn Féin supports the Bill and the context in which the Bill is being brought forward. While the Bill does not propose any radical changes regarding the operation of the Civil Defence, we welcome the move to amend what is a convoluted regulatory framework consisting of enactments from as far back as 1939 to one single Bill that clearly sets out the role and responsibilities of the Civil Defence, the local authorities, the Departments and the Minister. We recognise the need for the reform and the value it can provide to the Civil Defence organisation. I thank the Department's officials who came before the committee for the time they took to answer the questions and to address the issues raised by the committee.The Civil Defence today is a much-changed organisation compared with when it was first established in 1951. The nature of its undertakings has moved from those of an organisation originally designed to be a necessary civil response to potential hazards based on the international politics of the day to one where its volunteers are deeply embedded in communities throughout the country. It provides supports not only to State agencies such as An Garda Síochána, the HSE and local authorities during local, regional and national emergencies, but to non-emergency events, including valuable community, sporting, charity and local events. I recognise the volunteer ethos of the Civil Defence, which is its hallmark, that is held in great regard. Over the years, Civil Defence volunteers have a long and proud history of assisting at community events and have been central to community support because those volunteers are drawn from that same community. Volunteers benefit, in turn, from the opportunity to develop and practise their skills outside of emergency events, raise their profile, and help to recruit new members. All this is done in conjunction with that primary role of emergency support through the major emergency management programme. I will raise a number of challenges the Civil Defence face as an organisation that are not limited to any particular geographic area. These are areas of general concern. In 2015, the White Paper on defence stated: "The life-blood of Civil Defence is provided by some 4,000 volunteers who give freely of their time and commitment." The number provided to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence when departmental officials appeared before it was 2,800. I believe the Taoiseach said 2,600.

In those intervening years, many areas have experienced a decline in numbers as the age profile of those involved increased and the number of newer or younger members remained static or fell. Many units operate out of substandard accommodation. While I acknowledge progress has been made in recent years, I am concerned that there does not seem to be any parity of accommodation in which a local unit can grow, and extend its membership, training and functions. I will raise two specific issues regarding the Bill. Perhaps the Minister will provide some clarification on these. Section 4(4) states: "Each local authority shall provide such accommodation". I am concerned that a number of local authorities are not in a position to provide accommodation, given the dramatic rise in costs associated with buildings. I encourage the Minister and the Department to actively engage with those local authorities, particularly where another State body may have unused buildings in the location that could be repurposed. Section 4(4) goes on to state: "Each local authority shall provide such accommodation and equipment as may reasonably be required for its civil defence unit". However, section 2(e) states that the Minister shall be responsible for "procuring such goods and equipment". There needs to be some clarity as to who is responsible for what equipment and when. I will highlight another area that relates somewhat to the 70:30 funding split for the Civil Defence, specifically assets, whereby the Department is responsible for 70% and the local authority 30% of such assets. It is my understanding, following committee engagement, that the Comptroller and Auditor General has no involvement and the local authority's internal audit is responsible for those assets. Appropriate resources need to be put in place to ensure this is carried out efficiently. I will move to section 5(1), which states that each local authority may, with the consent and approval of the Minister employ as many persons as are deemed appropriate. There are significant pressures on our local authorities to recruit and retain staff. That is a fact in many departments across most local authorities. We need to ensure that when decisions for hiring or reallocation of staff are being made that the Civil Defence is not left behind or somehow ignored. I ask the Minister to engage with local authorities on that issue. These Civil Defence officers are responsible for the day-to-day management of Civil Defence matters in their local authority area. They are the key link between the volunteer, community, local authority and the Department nationally. They are a vital cog in the mechanism. While each local authority should have a strong, local, consistent plan that is specific to its area, synergies can also be developed on a more regional basis around that inter-local authority co-operation. This regional approach can be developed to maximise the strengths and capabilities in different local authority areas. The Minister referenced Dublin, where this is widely practised. There are areas, such as neighbouring local authorities, that have similar needs and make similar asks of their Civil Defence units. Many will be more familiar with the Civil Defence in the context of community event support for the provision of medical cover and the like. I will be clear because we do not get an opportunity to speak about the Civil Defence. The committee has given a strong commitment that we intend to visit its headquarters in Roscrea in the next number of months. As we are here today and have the opportunity to do so, I will put on the record exactly what our Civil Defence does that many of us are not aware of because we never needed its services. It is a recognised training institute by the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council. Volunteers are certified as cardiac first responders and emergency medical technicians. A large number of staff who are employed in the ambulance service, give freely of their time to the Civil Defence to ensure that others are trained to such a level. The role it plays in missing person searches in support of An Garda and the Coast Guar is valuable and important to anybody whose family member is missing. The Civil Defence is fully licensed to use its drones, which are a quick, easy and effective way to extend a search parameter and they also have thermal imaging capability. Drone usage is not something many people would associate with the Civil Defence. It provides second-line support to our fire services. It has been very much to the fore during environmental and flooding events, which have affected the area in which I live over the years. As somebody who comes from a county renowned for its waterways, Civil Defence members have water awareness and are also certified in basic water rescue and swift water and flood first-response. That is critical throughout counties in the midlands as is its welfare service, which includes food preparation and the safety and evacuation of displaced people. The skill levels within the Civil Defence are phenomenal. These have never been maximised but this legislation could be the first step to achieving more for, and from, the Civil Defence. It collects soil samples for the Environmental Protection Agency. It is also the service tasked with taking radiation readings. The radiation service has a number of important and specific functions set out under the national emergency plan for nuclear accidents. Civil Defence volunteers are the people who will collect samples to monitor and assist in any control measures that will be needed after such an accident. I spoke of parity in accommodation but parity in training will also be important into the future as the Civil Defence develops and continues to grow. This legislation should be the first of many necessary steps for the Civil Defence. There is a strong need for local leadership and management to ensure the plans that are put in place are fit for purpose and reflect the needs of local authorities, and the openness of any local authority to work with its neighbouring authority in the best interests of what is everybody's community. Coupled with the necessary resources from the Department, and training, development and equipment, the Civil Defence will grow and will continue to deliver those vital services locally and nationally. Key to that, and this is reflective of the wider defence family and much more, is the people. The Minister mentioned the medal given to Civil Defence volunteers - they were worthy of it and it was well earned - for their contribution during the Covid pandemic. I cannot let this opportunity pass to draw the Minister's attention to the fact that no other medal has been provided to members of the Defence Forces for Operation Fortitude.

There is not a Deputy or member of the public who has not witnessed the Civil Defence at work, often at times of need or crisis. What many people do not know is that the Civil Defence is a volunteer-based organisation and that these men and women put themselves on the line in helping emergency services and local authorities deal with severe weather, flooding, major accidents and searches for missing people. They are often present and at the ready during important social and community events, such as sports events and concerts.That is probably from where the majority of people would be familiar with the Civil Defence uniform. It is with what we tend to associate Civil Defence members. However, when they are in their uniform and doing the more technical work, sometimes people may not realise they are the same volunteers and that it is a volunteer organisation. We were all made aware of the fantastic work Civil Defence and its volunteers do during the pandemic. The contribution volunteers made during the Covid crisis was huge. They were essential to our front-line emergency response to the spread of coronavirus. As someone who represents coastal towns and a coastal constituency, I know how important their search-and-rescue support is. They put their lives at risk and give up their spare time to save people and to be there with families in their time of need. They show bravery, courage and a huge amount of self-sacrifice. They ask for very little in return; theirs is a quiet enough organisation. Sometimes, however, there has been a bit of a lag in providing what they have asked for, such as the provision of training, modern equipment and appropriate accommodation. I echo the call made, reflected in the Tánaiste's remarks, that this legislation be the start of a modernisation of Civil Defence and a real, true and enduring appreciation for and recognition of the work it does. There is a need for a review of the equipment held by each unit as well as an examination of the facilities available to it. Training has to be demand-led and developed in conjunction with Civil Defence to provide opportunities for volunteers on an area-by-area basis. What one area needs another area might not, but there could be a gap to be filled in that regard. It is very unfortunate that there has been a decline in the membership of Civil Defence, particularly in light of the range of skills and the work it can do, as my colleague, Deputy Clarke, outlined. It is to be hoped this legislation will be a very important step on the road to ensuring that the training, the equipment, etc., match up. A greater focus on promoting and recruiting members into Civil Defence is very necessary. I hope that the Tánaiste will take that point back to his officials and his Government colleagues and that we will be able to see that sort of improvement in the numbers. The way in which the State treats volunteers is incredibly important. The message the State sends out to people who provide services but are not full-time staff is very important. On that, I will raise briefly a somewhat parochial issue in my area. It concerns members of the fire service who are working in Skerries and Balbriggan. They are retained firefighters, which, as the Tánaiste will know, means they are not fully employed. They do the work but they are retained, so there is a semi-volunteer aspect to it. They are registered with the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council, PHECC. They provided medical services during the Covid pandemic but have not received the Covid bonus. I ask that the Tánaiste look at this. It has been raised by me and others. It is something we need to look at because if we want volunteers, how we treat them is important, how the State treats them is important, and what they see in their own communities as to how their volunteer work is reflected is also incredibly important. I therefore ask the Tánaiste if he has time - I appreciate that he is busy - to take a brief look into this matter.

Sinn Féin supports the intention of the Bill, which seeks to introduce a newer, more rounded version of multiple pieces of legislation, some of which dates back, as I said, to 1939. Civil Defence was established in 1951 and falls under the responsibility of the Department of Defence. It has played a hugely important role in modern society. It is a statutory, volunteer-based organisation which is organised at local authority level. The nearest Civil Defence location in my area, Dublin Mid-West, is based on the Belgard Road, at the auxiliary fire service centre. In my area of Clondalkin we have a number of very active members of Civil Defence. At this point I thank Paul, Paul Jnr., Linda, Michelle and all the other local volunteers for the vital contribution they make to our community and society in general. These members give of their time voluntarily. During the Covid restrictions, as already said, Civil Defence members were front and centre in the State's response to the pandemic. They often manned vaccination centres and testing centres at great personal risk to themselves. At the time we did not know what Covid would bring. These lads went into those centres on a purely voluntary basis and did not know what would come in front of them but they did that anyway. They put the common good before themselves. When Covid measures were lifted and other organisations and front-line workers received the pandemic bonus payment, Civil Defence members were excluded from that. They were given a medal, which was very well received and worthwhile, and a round of applause. That is what they have said to me. We owe them much more than that, and I would be happy to hear the Tánaiste's thoughts as to what recognition he thinks is appropriate. One of the local members I know very well is a man called Paul Morgan Snr. Paul is stationed in the headquarters on Wolfe Tone Quay, Dublin. He has been a member of Civil Defence for the past 15 years. Prior to that he was in An Fórsa Cosanta Áitiúil, FCA, in the Defence Forces, based at Cathal Brugha Barracks. I got to know Paul as my father is a retired member of the 20th battalion in Cathal Brugha Barracks and was attached to the FCA, so I got to know the FCA lads over the years through my father. Many of them have gone on to work in Civil Defence. People like Paul and other members have given a lifetime of voluntary service to the State. Over the years I have seen Paul and others like him volunteering at events across the county, including soccer matches at Tallaght Stadium. I even remember when I ran the marathon in 2018 and was struggling on the last couple of kilometres that a couple of the Civil Defence lads I knew were on the sideline. I would not say they were cheering me on - they were having a bit of a laugh - but it was all good-natured. Without those people there, there was no way any of those thousands of participants would have been able to take pace in that marathon. The St. Patrick's Day parade is coming up and, again, without the Civil Defence workers there, with the first aid and security services they provide, it would not be able to go ahead. I wanted to mention that because often that work goes unnoticed as the people are out enjoying themselves, rightly so, on our national day. Also, Civil Defence members are proactive in bringing solutions to gaps in services in our community. I will bring Paul's son, Paul Jnr., into this. He is researching putting in place a community first responder group for the Clondalkin, Lucan and Palmerstown area. A first responder is a person trained in basic life support and the use of a defibrillator who attends actually or potentially life-threatening emergencies and is dispatched by the National Ambulance Service. Paul is seeking the support of South Dublin County Council to find suitable locations to host defibrillators. I have brought this up in the Chamber before. It is vital that any and all supports are given to Paul so he can provide this literally life-saving service. Again, all this is on a voluntary basis. It has also been brought to my attention that Civil Defence recently received funding through the Dormant Accounts Fund. That is very welcome because it will help upgrade its fleet of vehicles, but much more is needed, as was said, as regards funding for training for its members so they can upskill and keep providing the service we have. As I said, Sinn Féin roundly supports the intention of the Bill, but we should recognise Civil Defence and its local volunteers for the service they provide to the State a lot better than we do.

The main purpose of the Bill is to ensure a modern and comprehensive legislative basis for Civil Defence matters. Currently, the legislative basis for Civil Defence comprises the Air-Raid Precautions Acts 1939 and 1946 and the Civil Defence Act 2012. The current suite of legislation dating back to the 1940s does not adequately reflect the current role of Civil Defence and, consequently, there is a requirement for new legislation. The White Paper on Defence in 2015 set out the need to replace the existing legislation and to provide for more modern legislation governing Civil Defence matters. The White Paper also stated that the future of Civil Defence will continue to be developed around its central strategic objective of supporting the principal response agencies, that is, An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and local authorities, in a variety of emergency and non-emergency situations.The Civil Defence was established in 1951 and its volunteers have played a prominent role in supporting front-line responders during significant emergencies such as Covid-19 most recently, Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma, the foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001, and the Stardust tragedy in 1981 in which 48 people lost their lives. I pay tribute to the many volunteers of the Civil Defence, both past and present. It is a remarkable organisation. I acknowledge in particular the volunteers from my constituency of Dún Laoghaire who play an active role in supporting the Garda, the Irish Coast Guard, the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, RNLI, and the local authority. They were prominent during the Covid-19 response, and also during significant events and tragedies, such as fires within the county, incidents at sea and regular community events such as the Kilbogget community run. I highlight, thank and recognise Lar Griffin of the Dún Laoghaire Civil Defence for his work and that of his colleagues who do tremendous work in our area. Civil Defence volunteers are at the heart of all communities. They have a proud history and they should be supported in their work. This Bill provides for a modern and comprehensive legislative basis for Civil Defence matters. It is welcome but it must be underpinned with financial and budgetary supports. I look forward to seeing those in the next budget.

I therefore welcome this Bill to enhance the what is currently in place. I see the great work the volunteers in Carlow Civil Defence do at local level. Working with the local authority, they demonstrate the best of us. I cannot commend them enough for their work during the Covid-19 pandemic. While the headlines made it appear that blanket assistance was provided in communities, Civil Defence volunteers were a beacon of hope for many people in every county. It was great to see them receive their medals in the Carlow County Council offices in December. That was a great day for them and their families. When we were not able to go beyond our gardens during the extremes of lockdown, Civil Defence volunteers took people for medical appointments and essential medical treatment and to testing and vaccination centres. One woman rang me to tell me they brought her much-needed food when she and her elderly partner were isolating. Lifelines like this are valuable in rural Ireland. When a home is flooded in rural Carlow due to an extreme weather event or when people are snowed in, the one person on the scene with the help needed is a Civil Defence volunteer. There are so many people I meet regularly who tell me they would be lost without these volunteers. Carlow is one of the 13 Civil Defence rest centres operational for displaced persons. It cares for 62 people. I welcome this legislation which will rightly promote and support Civil Defence in co-operation with local authorities. It will also provide policy direction for the activities of the Civil Defence, the provision of training and the procurement of goods and equipment for Civil Defence purposes. These are good people volunteering for the good of others and that should always be supported, promoted and provided for. I wish all the Carlow Civil Defence people well. They are doing a great job.

Many others have detailed, far more eloquently than I will, the necessity of the Civil Defence and the fine work it has done over many years. We need to have a proper legislative framework in place for the Civil Defence and, beyond that, ensure it is fit for purpose into the future. We know the Civil Defence steps into the fray during times of extreme difficulty. We have all heard about the skill sets some of its members have and the equipment, materials and resources it can bring to bear in cases involving missing persons and for regular events that take place constantly in various areas. That could be local runs or St. Patrick's Day parades. Louth Civil Defence operates out of Dundalk. There will be a St. Patrick's Day parade in Dundalk, combined with a family fun day and music before and after, and the Civil Defence will play its part. I thank Louth County Council, Dundalk Credit Union and PayPal in that regard. This work is necessary. I may have gone on a slight tangent there. We all know about the work the Civil Defence does and that there has been a decline in recruitment. Work needs to be done on that and we need to give the Civil Defence supports. It is a voluntary organisation but it does vital work. We need to tackle recruitment at a local level. We also need a full review of the equipment and resources, facilities and accommodation available to the Civil Defence. That goes without saying. It is about the people first and foremost but then we must make sure the Civil Defence has all it needs, including the right facilities and equipment, and its volunteers can do exactly what they need to do. We also need to make sure proper plans are drawn up at a local authority level. We need a fit for purpose Civil Defence that can do all the work for which we thank it. We could not survive without it. We need to look at what Civil Defence needs locally and then give it all the supports it needs. We all accept that different areas will have different calls. On the fabulous work the Civil Defence has done, we know the local authorities, the community call and their involvement in it show some of the future trajectory for involving statutory agencies and voluntary organisations. We must put all of those pieces together properly. This Bill is the first step but we have a lot more to do.
#JohnMcGuinness	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-party	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-dob	unknown-#JohnMcGuinness-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	175	I welcome the Bill and acknowledge the huge amount of work the Civil Defence undertakes and has undertaken since 1951. It is a significant organisation in those counties that have been fortunate to have volunteers organised through the Civil Defence. I would not miss the opportunity in the debate on this Bill to pay tribute to all of those involved in the Civil Defence in Kilkenny and the work they do. It is an active organisation at county level with 42 active members, a number of whom are young. The interesting thing about the membership is that they tend to get along in the organisation. They complete all their courses and carry all of those certifications on courses with them. Then they get involved in the fire services, for example, and some of them have gone on to be paramedics and so on. Each of these individuals has a strong interest in moving on, not just through the Civil Defence but also by becoming engaged in other organisations. My local Civil Defence organisation was challenged in 2016 because it lost all of its equipment in a fire. It rented a premises and it currently uses two different locations, one to store the equipment and one to train. It recovered from that 2016 tragedy and rebuilt the organisation. Katherine Peacock, who spent four years there, did an excellent job in that. Engagement with the local authority, the Garda and the Defence Forces is key. The volunteers bring great experience to the task in hand. Some 70% of the Civil Defence's funding comes from the Department of Defence and 30% comes from the local authority. I raise the need for a purpose-built headquarters for the Civil Defence in Kilkenny where it can store all of its equipment and continue to train on-site all the volunteers who wish to become involved.They now have 15 vehicles, and they have a number of boats that can be used, both on the river and at sea. It is not an easy task when you go to recover a body and you have to be skilled and trained for that. I have seen them at first hand on the River Nore doing a considerable amount of work in this area. Search and rescue is part and parcel of what they do. I am aware that the college for the Department of Defence provides the courses but those who are involved in Kilkenny continue to train onsite and to be offered the help and guidance that they need to progress. The Dormant Account Fund was important for the organisation too - I am aware that Kilkenny got some funding through that fund - and the HSE donates it ambulances. An ambulance can cost up to €50,000 but the HSE donates them to the Civil Defence. All in all, when one packages it together one has 42 volunteers, who are skilled, who are trained and who are central in communities and who can react to any sort of issue that they are asked to deal with. During Covid, they were particularly helpful. Indeed, as the Ukrainian families arrived, they were to the fore in assisting them to settle in to their accommodation and at times to move them from one accommodation to another. They are professional in their approach in relation to all of these actions. However, like many volunteers, I would say they are exhausted. I spoke today to Ms Michelle Colclough in relation to this. They have given so much of their own time, and on top of that they have families and they have their own jobs etc. to go to. We should recognise that in some way. I am aware that the organisations, on a social level, tend to give time to having an event whereby they can recognise the work that they did, their achievements etc. but the Government should recognise it by way of providing the upfront funding that is needed to develop the Civil Defence. The way to do that is to look at those who are seeking funding for a headquarters, for further training or for further equipment and to make sure that they get it. It is an investment in a structure and in a response unit, but also in the individuals who are there, particularly young people. It is absolutely essential that we give them the credit that they deserve and that we give them the funding without having them go chase for that funding. That may not be something that can be done easily when the budgets are tight but they should not be forgotten for the work that they do. I support this Bill. I support the Civil Defence. I ask that, in Kilkenny, they would look at the situation regrading the headquarters and the various equipment that they have.

It is important legislation that is being introduced to enhance our readiness in the face of potential disasters and emergencies. The original legislation dates back to 1951. Modernisation was proposed in the White Paper on Defence in 2015. As with a lot of these reports, they are left on a shelf to gather dust so I am happy to see that this proposal has made the light of day. The Bill is designed to modernise and streamline the existing Civil Defence framework in Ireland with a focus on promoting co-operation between different agencies and stakeholders to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response to emergencies. It will establish a national Civil Defence agency which will have the responsibility of co-ordinating Civil Defence activities across the country. I believe we should be going down the same road with the fire service. We should have a national fire service instead of 31 different services. The economies of scale alone in terms of equipment purchase would be beneficial. Also, the uniformity of having everyone receiving the same training on the same equipment and following the same procedures can only serve the public better, not to mention the savings on fire chiefs that could be put back into the front-line services. Getting back to this Bill, it aims to enhance the role of volunteers in Civil Defence, recognising the valuable contribution they make to our communities. It provides for training and accreditation of volunteers as well as setting out the duties and responsibilities of volunteer organisations. The past three years have shown us the importance of being prepared for emergencies. The Covid-19 pandemic has brought many challenges and hardships and highlighted the need for a co-ordinated and effective response to emergencies of any scale. My local service in Kildare does great work and I often feel that much of it goes under the radar. It is important to acknowledge the valuable contribution they make. I suppose many people would be aware of them where there is flooding. I am thinking particularly of the Athy area of the Kildare South constituency because they would have an issue around that. It is fantastic to see local people committed to their communities. It is vital that we support them when we face episodes of unpredictable and extreme weather, including in the future due to climate change. The elephant in the room, unfortunately, is money. The Department of Defence, as others have said, provides 70% of the funding and local authorities have to come up with the other 30%. This presents obvious challenges for them given the meagre funding they receive from central Government. The local authorities must be properly funded to ensure that all services are delivered in an efficient way and to ensure that the public is being served satisfactorily.

It will bring legislation from the 1930s and 1940s into the modern practice. The Civil Defence provides an invaluable service in supporting front-line emergency services and also local communities. I echo the comments made by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, last year when he presented members with medals of recognition for the role they played in Covid-19 and said that Civil Defence volunteers should be hugely proud of the massive contribution they made during the Covid-19 pandemic. I think everyone absolutely agrees with that. Volunteers in Civil Defence do everything from assisting in responses to emergencies to providing trained people on equipment for search and rescue, supporting in medical response, radiation monitoring service, communications and community assistance. As a public representative, I know how invaluable their role as volunteers in communities is across Ireland. Over my years of dealing with Civil Defence, my experience has been absolutely positive. A number of years ago, I arranged for my then councillor colleagues on South Dublin County Council to spend a day out with the Civil Defence in its station on Belgard Road. We tried our hand at fire training and we gained so much insight into the skills and the talents that all of these volunteers have and that they utilise when it comes to responding to front-line emergencies. I was also privileged to give out annual recognition awards for members of the Civil Defence a number of years ago rewarding all of those who give so much of their time to duties. I had a motion down at the South Dublin chamber recognising their contributions to areas such as Lucan, Palmerstown, Clondalkin and the villages of Rathcoole, Newcastle and Brittas. It was great to be able to bring them into the chamber and for them to hear, right across parties, people who so appreciate the work that they do. Civil Defence supports hundreds of community events throughout the year, both nationwide and also here in Dublin under the fantastic leadership of Mr. James McConnell and his team. These include large events, such as the air show, the tall ships, concerts, festivals and sports events, but they are really invaluable when it comes to those smaller local events. I have first-hand experience of that in terms of the four districts family fun day, which I help run along with Rathcoole Community Council and which they have been such strong supporters of every year. I have attended their annual service in McKee Barracks. I was really sorry to miss this year's one, which was their first since the Covid pandemic. It is always a special occasion. It marks the enormous contribution of those who give so much of their free time in service to the country. It also, of course, remembers deceased volunteers, such as Commander Joe Fleming, who sadly passed away before his time. Locally, Civil Defence has helped so many members of my community at their time of need. They were the first people out when we had gorse fires in the forests in Saggart and Rathcoole. They were on the ground when it came to the beast from the east where heavy snowfalls saw people in the more rural parts of my constituency trapped in their homes for weeks on end.They cleared the roads and delivered people food. They were incredible during Covid-19, particularly when it came to testing and administering vaccinations. They are and were the epitome of the community sacrifice and community support that brought us through the pandemic. The work they do is absolutely and utterly invaluable. Provisions in the Bill will afford them the opportunity to strengthen what they do, to grow their ranks, to keep providing essential community and emergency responses and, ultimately, to be able to train volunteers to become lifelines for their communities.

It underpins an organisation that has been at the heart of community events in Ireland since 1951. We are incredibly proud of the Civil Defence family in County Longford, where Emma Reid is the Civil Defence officer. Throughout Covid, we saw the value and dedication of Civil Defence volunteers. We are incredibly lucky to have 25 top-drawer volunteers in Longford. It would be remiss of me if I did not use this occasion to acknowledge the Herculean efforts of Marie Hand, Padraig Croghan, Michael Heaney, Gerry Brady and Theresa McKenna, each of whom has over 20 years' service in the Civil Defence. Another four members have in excess of ten years' service each. We should not let the day pass without remembering those who gave stellar service in the Civil Defence and have, sadly, passed away. I remember in particular Stephen McKenna and John Martin who were giants of the Civil Defence movement in Longford. No event, be it community, sporting or local authority, takes place in Longford without the involvement of the Civil Defence. Members do their duty with a constant smile and a sense of community that leaves us in no doubt as to the values and qualities that define this great country of ours. We saw the Civil Defence at its best last year, as the war in Ukraine unfolded, when members were to the fore in the humanitarian operation here. They continue to provide ongoing assistance for those fleeing the war in Ukraine, with Longford Civil Defence assisting with 43 specific duties last year, most of which involved the provision and management of a rest centre. Last year, the Longford team was on call for almost 100 duties, including sports fixtures, the Longford show, the Royal Canal run, the Longford marathon, the Halloween Dead of Night Festival as well as multiple festivals up and down the length and breadth of County Longford. These people embody the very best of what this country is about. It rightly behoves me to say the people in Longford are not only very proud of this organisation but are incredibly protective of it. I pay tribute in particular to Emma Reid, our Civil Defence officer. The tradition of the Civil Defence runs deep in her family. I see first-hand her dedication and I know this, in turn, is reflected in the commitment of her team, who not only admire and look up to her but respond greatly to her leadership. It would be remiss of me if I did not remind the Minister of the need for a dedicated home for Longford Civil Defence. It recently took possession of a new comms vehicle, which will greatly assist in health and safety operations as well as search and recovery operations. All too often, the Civil Defence has to step forward and be there for families in the worst of times. Again, we see the very best of people in these situations. Longford is rightly proud of our Civil Defence. The point for the Minister to take away from today's debate is that Longford Civil Defence deserves a headquarters that befits its stellar efforts. I am confident that positive moves in this regard are under way. I would like to see the goal of a new Civil Defence headquarters for Longford achieved during the lifetime of this Government.

Our Civil Defence is highly regarded in every community. They are our neighbours and our family members. The amount of work they put into the Civil Defence is unimaginable and often overlooked. Tipperary Civil Defence, covering north and south Tipperary, has carried out amazing work all over the county, especially during the pandemic and when Ukrainian refugees arrived. Volunteers are out in all kinds of weather, be it good or bad, and go up mountains and into forests day and night. Let us be honest, in many situations, they are the first port of call when something goes wrong. For that alone, and for what they actually do, they are invaluable. The Civil Defence volunteers' ethos represents their community spirit and dedication. The amount of assistance every one of the individuals involved gives when people are in trouble cannot be underestimated, nor can their contribution to the holding of events. We can all name off events in our local areas. Volunteers really show their contribution during St. Patrick's weekend, which is in a few weeks' time. When we are out celebrating St. Patrick, Civil Defence members are there from early morning until the crowds disappear. That is when their real value is shown. With that in mind, it is only right we discuss a Bill that seeks to update legislation. It is crazy to think some of the legislation has been there since the 1930s. For an organisation that contributes so much to our local communities and across the country, it is a pity that the legislation has been there for that long and has not been changed. We must back the need for the implementation of statutory changes that would reform the current legislation pertaining to Civil Defence organisations. This is especially important given the 2015 White Paper on Defence stated that the future of Civil Defence will continue to be developed around its central strategic objective of supporting the principal response agencies in the range of call-outs to which they attend. While we are updating this legislation on Civil Defence - make no mistake; this is highly positive - I hope we appreciate that for it to be truly effective, it must be accompanied by proper engagement with the members operating on the ground. They will give the Government and Opposition parties a real insight into the work they undertake on a daily basis and how it can be best carried out. Therefore, this is really important. It is especially important in the context of section 2(2)(e), which refers to the role of the Minister in procuring goods and equipment he or she considers necessary. Such engagement must be undertaken with the local authorities and the volunteers on the ground. I am thankful the Bill has been brought before the Oireachtas and Sinn Féin looks forward to it progressing through Committee Stage.

I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill, which aims to modernise legislation that dates to the Second World War. That is probably a good litmus test for the need to modernise legislation. From the outset, I compliment the Civil Defence, both the organisation and the 2,700 volunteers. They do fantastic work. As other colleagues have said, they are an integral part of the fabric of Irish society. They provide huge support for the three principal response agencies - the Garda, the HSE and local authorities - and for charitable and community organisations. This may be controversial, but perhaps the Civil Defence is modern and effective in what it does because it is not a centralised organisation. There is a huge amount of autonomy given to the 28 Civil Defence teams around the country. They are not overly bureaucratic or overly controlled. They are probably successful not in spite of not being under centralised control but because they are not under centralised control. They have a huge amount of flexibility and latitude at local level. They are completely plugged in to the local, regional and community setup. They have probably rewritten the rule book on professionalism. We generally regard professionals as people who are paid full time. The Civil Defence has proven that one can be professional without being paid full time as a volunteer. Volunteers' professionalism relates to the standards they bring to the table rather than whether they are paid full time. The thing about Civil Defence is that it always turns up. I have never heard a derogatory comment about the Civil Defence. During a search for a missing person, an incident requiring medical support or a response to a severe weather event, they are always there. The Minister mentioned the responses to Covid-19 and the displacement of Ukrainians, which were commendable responses. I acknowledge that the Civil Defence teams are modernising their operations. Their capabilities are very effective from the point of view of drone technology. They are also very effective from a four-wheel drive point of view - they have their own tracked vehicles - and from a medical perspective. I have been to Ratra House and the college in Roscrea several times. From a medical point of view, they are very impressive in regard to paramedic and pre-hospital training.Many of the HSE paramedics and advanced paramedics are also double-hatted as Civil Defence members. I do not think many people recognise that. On the Covid-19 response, I want again to double on the fact that they got a medal awarded to them in Croke Park last year. That is an excellent thing to do and that they get some recognition for the excellent service they are providing. There is one organisation which I do not think has got the same level of recognition and that is the Garda Reserve. It has been around for approximately 20 years and its personnel have never received any kind of official medal or recognition for the great work they do. Perhaps he could speak to his Cabinet colleague, the Minister, Deputy Harris, in relation to that. I have one concern from an operational perspective that I want to highlight. We know what the situation in Ukraine is like at the moment. We know there are concerns over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and that Civil Defence has a significant role in radiation monitoring in this country. I suspect it has not really been updated since the 1980s and Chernobyl, or perhaps Sellafield. We could probably do with dusting off some of those plans, doing an audit of the equipment and making sure people are properly training so that they can carry out air, soil and water sampling. This is not to scare anybody. The fact that they would be carrying out their training would allay a lot of people's fears about having a system in place. The last thing we want to do is be caught in a situation for which we are not prepared. It is a low probability event but one with maximum, indeed catastrophic, impact if something like that happens. The Civil Defence probably needs to make sure it is totally on the ball from a radiation monitoring point of view. Turning to the Bill itself, in general it is a good Bill. I welcome the fact that a register is going to be established. I caution against making the Civil Defence organisation overly bureaucratic. One of the reasons why it is successful is that it is not bureaucratic. The code of practice is important and the 70:30 funding model is good as well. I throw out two ideas as I wonder about the departmental structure of involving two Departments controlling one agency. As a general rule, that is probably not a good idea. As a general rule, it could be argued that if two people or two organisations are in charge, nobody or no one is really in charge. We might want to consider whether we should put one Department in charge exclusively, that is either the Department of Defence or the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage. That is just a consideration. Second, across the European Union, the phrase "civil protection" is used rather than "civil defence", so if we were looking to align our Civil Defence organisation with its European peers and counterparts, perhaps a renaming or rebranding should be considered. Again, I am not sure what the Civil Defence volunteers' view on that would be but if we are looking at deploying teams overseas from an earthquake point of view, or from a forest fire or disaster relief point of view, perhaps aligning ourselves with our European colleagues might be a good way to go. In summary, I welcome the Bill. I am a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence so I look forward to further scrutiny on 28 March when the Bill comes before the committee. I make one suggestion that if it is going to be discussed at committee, we might get a Civil Defence officer and a Civil Defence volunteer to turn up as well so we can ask pertinent questions from an operational point of view in order to get the best information possible when it comes to making legislation.

I am after running a few laps of the building. I join others in welcoming this legislation. It is very positive. It is very interesting historically that this combines the old Air-Raid Precautions Acts 1939 to 1946. That was very old legislation when we were in a very different historic period. I had a grand-uncle who served in the LDF at the time. A point of interest is that one of the last surviving air-raid sirens in the country still operates and is tested once a year at Ardnacrusha power station. It was very interesting when we were teaching classes in Parteen National School that once a year this booming air-raid siren would be heard at the power station. It was a real throwback to yesteryear. The children in our local school did not always need to watch YouTube clips to figure out what this sound was like; they were able to experience it in real time. I acknowledge, as others have, the immense role of the Civil Defence. Certainly, in County Clare, we are very familiar with its work. The Minister has been in Clonlara, County Clare himself, and to Springfield which is an area very prone to flooding. Thankfully in the lifetime of this Government it has been dealt with by really robust flood defences. What we saw there time and again in 2009, 2011, 2015 and 2019, was the members of the Civil Defence going down in dinghies, waders, large vehicles, and all-terrain vehicles and bringing people out of their houses to bring them to safety. They were absolutely outstanding frontline emergency personnel and we are hugely grateful. We saw yet again last March when we had a massive influx of Ukrainian refugees to our county, that it was again the Civil Defence in Clare and the mid-west that stepped up to the mark. I note that 18 families were helped directly to find accommodation in that same period. The efforts of the Civil Defence in that regard have been absolutely immense. I will speak on the matter of Defence Force accommodation for families. I am from the southern area of County Clare. Our local army barracks is Sarsfield Barracks in Limerick city. Indeed, Meelick, from where I hail, has a housing estate called Elton Court. This housing estate was built in the 1980s in partnership with Father Harry Bohan. It was an affordable housing scheme and it was really targeted to entice military and Defence Force families from the city of Limerick out to County Clare where they could rear their families. It was such a successful scheme. Beyond County Kildare and the Curragh area, this is the largest housing scheme, if you like, of Defence Forces personnel, be they current or former. That model of affordable housing is something I would like to see replicated again. If the Minister, Deputy Martin, is in County Clare sometime, I can show him first-hand this scheme from the 1980s. It is an estate of high-quality affordable housing, which was really earmarked for those in the Defence Forces, and it still operates really successfully. I know there is a whole review underway and terms and conditions of pay for the Defence Force personnel will rightly improve but we also need to look at those other metrics of providing for them, including accommodation. The solution I have suggested is one that needs to be looked at a bit further. We had a discussion here on all things defence related again about a week ago and the clock was ticking. I have a little bit more time today so I will elaborate on an issue I dealt with and tried to represent that day. I refer to the whole decade of centenaries and the period of commemoration we now find ourselves in. Every single weekend there are commemorations happening the length and breadth of the country. The best of those commemorations are probably not the State-led ones; they are probably the community-led ones where politics is left in the wings and a community historically leads out their own local event remembering their own local people who fought and many of whom died seeking Irish independence and during the tragic years of the Civil War. I think it is unforgivable to see members of the Opposition, in particular Sinn Féin, at weekends marching alongside individuals with black berets and paramilitary uniforms. It is absolutely incongruent to have a spokesperson on defence coming in here to speak for the men and women of the Permanent Defence Force, being their voice, and then at the weekends walking the streets with people who wear paramilitary uniforms. There is only one Óglaigh na hÉireann. There is only one Irish Army and this absolutely does not fit and is an insult to those who don the uniform and the harp brass buttons on their tunics, who represent Ireland overseas, who defended Ireland, who go on many peacekeeping missions overseas, and who have a very proud record. Some of them have paid the ultimate price of their lives. It is an insult to them to see some Deputies in this House, particularly those in Sinn Féin, marching with one army at the weekend and speaking for a different army when they come in to this House. I really think it is time we look at some form of legislation that prohibits the wearing of parliamentary uniforms. We can of course have a carve out in terms of historical re-enactment. That is something we should embrace. It is nice to see members of communities, including my own in County Clare, don old, historic Irish Volunteers and Cumann na mBan uniforms, non-politically - without any connotations to modern day politics - and wear those uniforms with pride to re-enact historically and represent events of yesteryear. It is wrong to don the black beret and a uniform that has no semblance, no reason and no logic whatsoever in the context of current Irish statehood.That needs to be taken out of Irish politics, and it certainly should not be walking in step with any debate we have in these Houses on the Defence Forces. If we want to hear logical and sound debate on the Defence Forces from the other side of the floor, I will turn to the likes of Deputy Berry who has lived this life and is an encyclopaedia on all things related to the Defence Forces. If I want to hear a logical voice on this subject, I will turn to him rather than to somebody who walks at the weekend with people in paramilitary uniforms and at other times of the year speaks for the Permanent Defence Force. It just does not wash.

It is managed by 35 local authority Civil Defence officers and has approximately 3,500 volunteers. From the bottom of my heart, I want to salute the work they have done over the decades. Eddie Cooney, who is not well at the moment, was the officer in charge in south Tipperary for decades. He has now retired and is laid low. I wish him well. Dolores Fahey is now in that office. I was going to bring something on the subject of volunteers to the attention of Deputy Cathal Crowe, but he has left the Chamber. I remember attending a summer camp in Lahinch when I was chair of the council. I was looked after by the late Fine Gael councillor, Jimmy Hogan, and his late wife, who were both wonderful officers. They looked after me and my three children at the Munster final in Limerick on the way. It was a joyous occasion. The Civil Defence does great work. Over the decades, it dealt with floods in Clonmel. Thanks to the former Minister of State, Martin Mansergh, and others who helped to provide funding, we now have a scheme that is 95% successful at keeping out water. The Civil Defence is still on hand to help out when there are floods, someone is missing or there is a water outage. I think the Civil Defence is abused by local authorities and Uisce Éireann in terms of delivering boil water notices or whatever. We need to respect it and not use it for such purposes. There have been a lot of cutbacks in recent years and the Civil Defence is limited in what it can do. It used to provide great assistance, such as traffic management at funerals and so on. A lot of those things have been pulled back from it because of insurance and everything else. Volunteers loved doing such events, but the rules and regulations have denied them the ability to do so. The Bill proposes to consolidate a number of Acts. I hope it does. Legislation can often have unintended consequences.  It is now very difficult to get volunteers, as the Minister knows. The voluntary fire service has tremendous people who were pushed aside and have been told their tenders are not up to standard, but such services were local to the people, were the first to arrive at a scene and dealt with many difficult cases. In the case of the Civil Defence, they have pride in their vehicles, uniform and colleagues. They assist at many festivals and community events which others do not attend. As gardaí are thin on the ground, community events and field days are attended by the Civil Defence. To be fair, the Order of Malta and the Red Cross have done tremendous work over the decades. We must strengthen the Civil Defence. We must have the motto of ní neart go cur le chéile and the idea of the meitheal. That is how the Civil Defence works. Uisce Éireann and others cannot use it for other purposes. The previous speaker mentioned monuments and parades at weekends. I agree with every word he said. People are hijacking the Tricolour and many events. Political parties, some of whom are in this House, have hijacked the Liam Lynch memorial monument. My dad was proud to be the clerk of works when it was constructed. There were 12 members of the committee and my dad was joint treasurer. Most of the men had served in prison, the War of Independence and the Civil War. It is a national commemoration, but some people want to claim ownership of the monument which was built by the sweat and blood of people who handed stone from hand to hand. Some arrive as new kids on the block and think they own the monument. Nobody owns the Tricolour, but the Army is proud to represent it. Nobody owns the reilig of Liam Ó Loingsigh. Many members of his family are coming to commemorate him. There is another event in Fermoy on 11 April. We look forward to a proper weekend of commemoration. The Tánaiste attended the ceremony in the past. We will not allow it to be hijacked by anyone. The monument was built by the people of Newcastle, Ballybacon, Ardfinnan and Grange. The money came from America. I saw the letters my father received when he was treasurer containing a shilling, a half crown or whatever. It was built with sweat, blood, tears and pride, and it will stay that way and remain in the ownership of the committee.

The former Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney, correctly recognised the immense and enormous role played by these volunteers in Ireland's response to the spread of Covid-19 at an event honouring their work in Dublin's Croke Park last November. We understand that over 300 volunteers received a specially designed medal for their efforts in 2020 and 2021, and a total of 1,100 medals were to be distributed following the event. It is to be hoped these medals have been delivered to each of the volunteers since then. The country owes each and every volunteer our heartfelt appreciation for stepping up during many challenging times. These volunteers reached out during the pandemic to the most vulnerable members of society and provided much-needed comfort. In doing so, they helped to reduce feelings of isolation. For those efforts, the Civil Defence's contribution will always be remembered and their efforts will always be appreciated. There are over 3,500 volunteers in the Civil Defence. As Deputy McGrath has said, we cannot forget the Order of Malta, the Red Cross, cliff and rescue groups and all of the other volunteers who put their lives at risk at times to help other people, whether that involves searching for people and doing whatever else needs to be done. The Civil Defence and others have always been there for the people. Its volunteers undertook 9,500 tasks during the pandemic, including medical appointments, testing, delivering food and medication and assisting in the HSE vaccination centres. I would like to pay a personal tribute to each and every volunteer. As I said to Red Cross members, many people do a lot of dedicated work without any proper recognition. I will mention as an example Dr. Jason van der Velde, who runs the Jeep for Jason service in west Cork. Every evening, he turns on his monitor and phone and takes calls on a voluntary basis. The local community in Ballinascarthy has raised funds for him and purchased a jeep so he can carry out this work. He has saved many lives on the roadside when other emergency services may not have been able to attend as quickly as he can. The national fire service needs to be commended. It does a lot of tough and hard work on the roadsides. Work on the Clonakilty fire station has not yet started. Staff there have asked me to keep going with the fight to make sure that happens. Such people need to be commended. Any Bill that will help the Civil Defence and others is something I will support. I would also like to remember the air ambulance service, an organisation which is in existence thanks to people fundraising on a daily basis and its volunteers. I commend those working in Cancer Connect in my constituency, Cork South-West. It looks after people from Castletownbere, the Mizen Peninsula, the Sheep's Head Peninsula and throughout west Cork. It takes people to and from Cork on a daily basis. Funding was promised for the service from the Government, which unfortunately did not come. We have to continue to carry out voluntary work and do more fundraising for the service. Cancer Connect comprises 100% volunteers. Nobody is making any profit out of it. It is an area that needs to be looked at. Today is about the Civil Defence. I will certainly support the Bill.

Of course I want to recognise the work done by our local authority, Kerry County Council, and, under its jurisdiction, the local authority, the Civil Defence officers and all the volunteers in County Kerry and throughout the rest of the country. There are 3,500 volunteers throughout the country. These people have done Trojan work at ordinary and extraordinary events. An example of an ordinary event is a very happy affair such as Puck Fair, the Rose of Tralee festival or the 15 August fair in Kenmare. We have many other great events in our county. We can rely on the Civil Defence being there, as well as the Order of Malta, the Red Cross and all of the others. When there are emergencies or additional help is needed, these people are brought in. They help at the great Kilgarvan weekend event we have every year where Helen O'Sullivan and her hard-working committee hold an event in the village. Those people provide support when they are needed with crowds, which is very important. What also needs to be recognised here today, and I want to do this on behalf of the county I represent, are the inshore rescue people in Caherdaniel, Waterville and along the rest of the coast because given its coastline, County Kerry experiences tragedies and people who get into trouble in the water. We also need our mountain rescue. These are the great people from Coolmagort, Beaufort who go up our mountain ranges when people get into trouble there. They are ably assisted by Civil Defence on the ground if it is needed. I want to recognise the likes of those people.  We are talking about the value of emergency services such as Civil Defence but I also want to recognise Donie Lucey from the Irish Community Air Ambulance for the excellent work it has done. The forthcoming Castleisland Forestry Rally was launched. Castleisland is a place the Minister will know well. A rally will take place there with the funds to go to the air ambulance in County Kerry and the Cork region. We are so fortunate because of our rough terrain. Regarding driving from Valentia Island to Tarbert, you could drive from Kilgarvan to Dublin quicker so is it any wonder we need an air ambulance and people to rescue people from the mountains? We have a big open area where we need help. We should give every acknowledgement to Civil Defence. I also thank the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, for acknowledging its work, particularly during the pandemic. The statistics are frightening. There were 9,500 call outs and operations in which it was involved taking care of people and dealing with the emergency at that time. I know the Minister when in the important position of Taoiseach acknowledged its work and I appreciate that. It is very important that the Government recognises and thanks these people, who are volunteers, giving of their time freely. We appreciate that very much.

The Department provides training for volunteers instructors and supplies equipment, vehicles, uniforms and PPE for Civil Defence volunteers. Civil Defence volunteers undertook 9,500 tasks during the pandemic, including transporting people to medical appointments, testing and vaccination centres and delivering food and medication. Civil Defence was extraordinary during Storm Ophelia and Storm Emma and later during Covid. Civil Defence provides five core services, including emergency response, search and rescue, medical response, community assistance and a radiation monitoring service. It was established in 1951 and is a volunteer organisation that supports emergency services in local communities. It has 3,500 members trained to provide a range of services. Civil Defence volunteers around the country do incredible work. I am delighted that the Minister for Defence is funding it and providing equipment for it but we must acknowledge the volunteers who do the work and go out in all kinds of conditions to help people. It includes the air ambulance service and the Blood Bikes that travel around the country. Civil Defence covers everything in our areas. It goes across the water and carry out peacekeeping missions as well. A lot of work is done by Civil Defence for which we are eternally grateful.  I come back to the fact that they are volunteers. Ireland is known for its volunteers. No matter what happens, people such as those in Civil Defence come out and put their shoulder to the wheel and make sure that no matter what event takes place, be it for the wrong or right reasons, it is there to help. Civil Defence is broad-based with a central command. I commend anything that will help our Civil Defence. I commend any recommendations to help and fund Civil Defence and help and reward our volunteers for their excellent work.

I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation at this time. The memorandum circulated to Members states that the purpose of the Bill is to modernise the existing legislation relating to civil defence matters contained within the Air-Raid Precautions Acts, 1939 and 1946, and the Civil Defence Act 2012. Civil Defence provides five core services, including emergency response, search and rescue, medical response, community assistance and a radiation monitoring service. It is very important that at this time, its role is updated and it is properly recognised. The purpose of the Bill is to consolidate existing disparate legislation in place in this area. Each one of us, particularly elected Members, knows how vital Civil Defence is. There are times when Civil Defence is very visible such as during normal big events with crowds of people such as the day of the Munster final in Killarney when we have a go at Cork, treat it very well and hope it does not win. Civil Defence is very visible on days like that. Its members are at major events like the Rose of Tralee and the horse racing in Killarney but it is equally visible on desperate days when someone is missing and a family is trouble. Civil Defence plays a vital role. Civil Defence members are volunteers but they are trained. I set out the various roles they can play. When somebody has a cardiac arrest, they are probably the nearest at times to help when help is needed. Civil Defence plays a vital role with the diminishing presence of An Garda Síochána or when its members are away on different operations. They provide as good a service as those who are paid to provide them and they must be recognised and properly treated and have the proper equipment. I appeal to the Minister to ensure the Civil Defence has that.  I also thank all the other volunteer services in Kerry such as the Order of Malta, the Red Cross and the air ambulance, which is vital. We know the vital role it has played in saving so many people by taking them directly to the larger hospitals where they get treatment. We know how great that service is. It goes into areas that are so slow to get in and out of and does miraculous work and we really appreciate it.We previously raised in the House the issue regarding the air ambulance service and I am proud to be a member of the Rural Independent Group, which did so. Those people need proper financial assistance to keep that service going. Without that, rural places including in County Kerry, such as Glencar, Scartaglin and Brosna, will be impacted. Kerry is a massive county and that has to be recognised. Perhaps in Dublin, the services are more visible and readily available, but people living in rural Ireland and rural Kerry need the same services as the people everywhere else and in the urban areas. I appreciate the Tánaiste's efforts in this regard and will thank him if he takes stock of what we are asking for such that these people will be properly funded.

I thank all the Deputies who contributed. We have had a good manifestation, from across the House, of the esteem in which the Civil Defence is held by communities, as the Deputies articulated. I thank them for their fulsome tributes to the Civil Defence and look forward to teasing out on Committee Stage the issues they raised, such as funding issues, investment in infrastructure in terms of various headquarters or accommodation issues and the ongoing recognition of the volunteering dimension of the Civil Defence. The various counties were well represented by the Deputies who came forward The consideration of this legislation now and on Committee Stage is an opportunity to work on some of the issues they raised, not least in regard to the funding, status and resourcing of the Civil Defence. Above all, this is about a legislative template for the future. I look forward to dealing with Deputies in committee and thank them again.

To be fair, it is a little confusing because there are three sets of amendments to the initial set of amendments. In any event, we will work through them. On the basis of discussions we have had, I probably will not press my amendment, but the spirit of it was based on ensuring there would be a full understanding of what was required to ensure there would be open disclosure throughout services and screening. My amendment will provide for an obligation for patients to be informed of their right to make a request for a Part 5 review. As part of this, patients will be told they can do so at the point of screening or before that. We wanted to ensure something that was a strong request of the patient advocates, including the 221+ group and everyone else, namely, that this would also be done should somebody be diagnosed with cancer. It would not necessarily have to be done imminently, given it is a difficult period for people, but within a reasonable timeframe, such as three or six months. That is what our amendment seeks to provide for, although subject to how the Minister responds, we will decide whether to press it. This is a critical issue because of cases such as that of Irene Teap, who found out during the birth of her child about her cancer diagnosis. Women have been told previously that they have the option of undergoing a patient review, but four or six years later, will they remember that? The key ask of the advocates was that if somebody has been diagnosed with cancer, within a given timeframe after that they would be reminded of that option. This was the most important issue we felt was not covered by what had been provided for, and it was deemed essential that this be dealt with. Under our amendment, therefore, patients will be told post diagnosis that they have this option for a patient review and that will be done within a reasonable timeframe. For me, that would be three to six months. I understand that the Minister will table an amendment to ensure this is covered and that this will be future-proofed by communication he will give directly to the HSE. This is critical. We would not have been able to move forward today if we had not resolved this issue in communications we had before Christmas, last week and even yesterday.There is one other issue I want to highlight as part of this and I might as well raise it now as it comes under the same bracket. It is an issue that might have got a bit lost in much of this conversation, namely that the audit stopped. Once Vicky Phelan went out to the steps the audit stopped then until now, effectively, and probably will be stopped until this legislation is enacted and operable. What are we going to do to ensure that those women, in particular, have the same access to review as everyone else?  I thank the Minister's officials for the work they have done over the past few weeks, and the past few hours in particular, but I understand that when it comes to legislation that we pass in this House there are often legal issues around retrospection and so on. However, I am sure that as part of this process, the way that the Minister implements this and directs this and directs the HSE to implement it that he can deal with this issue. Anywhere between 1,000 and 1,500 women could have the opportunity to look for that review. Based on the figures that I have calculated with others, that is the number of people who might do that. Although it might only be a fraction who do it, they have to be treated the same way as all the others before that. I have often pointed out, for those women all the issues, around the time lines of what happened to Vicky Phelan, Lorraine Walsh, who is sitting in the Gallery tonight, Irene Teap, Ruth Morrissey and everyone, the variables have not changed in respect of the labs, the process etc. for a considerable period. There have been improvements in the past number of years but for a considerable period after the time that Vicky Phelan's case was settled and dealt with and she came out because the audit stopped those women have not had the same look-back. They have not had the same opportunity. To be frank about it, if they are not a part of it then that is not open disclosure but that is hiding that opportunity from them. As part of this process, I would like the Minister to deal with that.  The amendment tabled by myself and Deputy Duncan Smith was to deal with patients being told post diagnosis that they would have the option of a review. If the Minister's response in the form of his amendments and what he is going to say to this House is acceptable, we will not push the amendment but I want to make it clear here that I expect that to be amendments that will deal with reviews being post diagnosis that will happen after screening that will be a combination of what is in this legislation, a combination of a letter that will be written by the Minister to the HSE directing it on that, that the Minister will stipulate that the patient representatives will be part of the process of putting this in place and, of course, there will subsequently be the two-year review. On that basis I will not press the amendment based on the Minister's reply.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	194	Two months have been lost on this and, hopefully, it was worth that delay. I want to welcome the fact that agreement was reached with the 221+ group last week around clarification on the notifications that would be provided to people to make them aware of the option of the Part 5 review. While that was provided for in the original legislation, it is good that there is additional clarity being brought to that about the points along the way when that information is to be provided to people who availed of the screening programmes. That is a good thing. On the process that is to be followed, it is good that there will be further consultation with the 221+ group and that there will be a review of the legislation in two years. All that is positive and I pay tribute to both the officials in the Department who have been helpful over recent months on all aspects of what is quite a complex Bill and the 221+ group, who has been active on this and who have engaged positively and constructively with the Department. We just received the Minister's amendment this afternoon. I do not know why it was late as I understand that agreement had been reached a while ago on it but it is welcome nonetheless and I am happy to support it when it comes for decision. I will make some other points on this that arise from this group of amendments. I am seriously concerned that the recommendations made by Dr. Scally have not been taken on board fully. He did an excellent job over an extended period. His latest report that was published in October, and many from this House and others were at that briefing, identified a number of issues in particular. The key points he made at the press conference was to urge the need for a duty of candour on healthcare workers and organisations; the Bill is too narrow in the circumstances for mandatory open disclosure; it deals with the more serious end of errors that are made; and nearly all those circumstances in the Schedule relate to death so there is a whole range of other circumstances that could arise for which it is important that there be a duty of candour. In particular, given the issue before us of cancer screening, I am concerned that the points Dr. Scally made were not taken on board. Equally, he recognised that the Government amendments may deal with shortcomings in the Bill but he called for an amendment to establish a clinical complaints system. This would provide patients with answers to their concerns and remove most of the need for patients to take legal action. That is an important recommendation. It is true that, particularly in light of two high-profile cases in the news yesterday, there are significant lessons to be learned about the practice of the HSE and the State generally in not addressing serious errors that are made and putting families and individuals through the ringer over an extended period, leaving people who need financial support because of the need to provide services for a person with a disability as a result of negligence or errors and leaving a person for many years in some cases without that kind of financial support. There is the financial aspect of that and the further traumatisation and deprivation of people who have been affected by serious incidents where they have to do without services and supports that they need because of the long delay in addressing these cases. From the point of view of the individuals and families, there is the additional trauma, worry, concern and time taken up for the families. We saw an example of that yesterday. I am concerned that this issue has not been addressed in the context of this legislation. It is an associated issue to CervicalCheck but something has to be done about the kind of legal advice that is given to the Government to fight people all the way - we had a discussion about this last week, and it is continuing, around historical cases - when what people essentially want to know is why a serious incident happened, what is going to be done to prevent such incidents recurring and amends have to be made with financial compensation. That is one lesson out of this. The other thing I wish to raise is the limited scope of the Bill. That is problematic. The Bill only specifies the mandatory requirements for open disclosure in the case of 13 categories. I tabled an amendment which was ruled out of order. I cannot understand why that is the case. Dr. Scally made it clear that the vast majority of the circumstances listed in the Schedule - 12 out of 13 - relate only to circumstances where a person dies. There is a range of other circumstances where there needs to be open disclosure. I cannot for the life of me understand why my amendments were ruled out of order. It should not have happened. What is the point of commissioning a person of the status of Dr. Scally, who is held in such regard by everybody, when some of his key recommendations are being ignored?
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2023-02-15 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	195	It has got very messy when we have four or five amendment lists, amendments to amendments and so on. The manner in which this Bill was crafted and worked its way through the Oireachtas was a bit chaotic. Notwithstanding that, I thank the Minister for his co-operation in recent weeks. We did the right thing in December in pausing this and taking the time to engage with the 221+ group. I told the Minister in this Chamber and in private briefings that my view was that group was not supportive of the Bill as it stood. That was the case, as we have now seen. We have had intensive engagement and if there is a lesson to be learned, it is that the engagement could have happened much earlier with the 221+ group. However, I welcome that it happened and also the Minister’s contribution, which got these amendments over the line. I understand these are complicated issues and, for all the right reasons, the Minister’s officials will give him sound, clinical advice. We have to take all that advice and try to frame a Bill, which is complicated because we can have an intention to do something but providing for something complex in legislation can be difficult. I accept that and thank and commend the Minister for his co-operation. The amendment we are discussing will be superseded by an amendment to amendment No. 19, which the Minister is bringing forward. I think that is the one we now want to see put in place. The establishment and implementation of procedures on how we give women further information is important. Will the Minister clarify - I am sure we will get to this if we get to the amendment in question - that the 221+ group will be central to that process and its input will be important when its gets to implementing the processes and procedures? It is important that when there is a diagnosis women are informed of the right to initiate a review at the point of entry into the system and in as many ways as possible. We need to make sure it is done at the right time. The right time for one patient might not be the right time for somebody else. The concern was that the point of diagnosis, when a patient is being informed he or she has terminal cancer, may not be the best time to tell somebody that he or she has a right to a review. From my understanding of a conversation I had with the Minister and the 221+ group, the details of that will be done separately. That makes sense and I support it. I imagine, in the context of the Minister’s amendment which we will get to, the amendment we are now discussing will be withdrawn. I will not push any of my amendments to a vote. We have had a good engagement and discussion. It is a good day when a Minister is prepared to listen and work with the Opposition on a sensitive issue. Consensus on this issue was and is important. I said when we first discussed this Bill and again on Second Stage that I wanted to support it. I wanted a Bill the 221+ group could buy into and support and one that was fit for purpose. There will be different arguments down the road on the type of audit that may or may not be put in place. That is not part of this Bill, as such. The Department has not agreed what an audit will look like. We can come back to that later. I ask that when we do that work there will be a role for the Joint Committee on Health. Once the audit is agreed, it could come back to the committee for consideration and there could be further engagement with the 221+ group. I will not rehash all the arguments on that issue because we have made significant progress. I have spoken in recent days to members of the 221+ group and they are pleased we have got to a point where they can give their support to a Bill. It is a good day for them and for patients. There are recommendations, as Deputy Shortall said, in the Scally report which still have not been implemented. One is that people cannot make a complaint about clinical decisions. That was a concern Dr. Scally had. I accept that is a difficult and complex area but we have to have further discussions on it. We cannot pass this Bill and park all those other issues, notwithstanding the fact they are complicated. Dr. Scally also called for a greater duty of candour generally in healthcare. He was critical of that not being dealt with in the Bill. I accept the complexities of that as well. None of this is easy. It is difficult to legislate for these matters. Sound clinical judgments and arguments come back to us. We had discussions with the chief clinical officer, Chief Medical Officer and chief nursing officer. They made sound clinical arguments on why certain things are not possible. We understand the complexities. We all accept that but we had an independent report from Dr. Gabriel Scally that made recommendations, not all of which are dealt with in this Bill. I see this as work in progress. This is an important first step. I thank the Minister for his co-operation. It was worthwhile. It is not often we see it from a Minister. Very often, that is not the way we do business in this House but, given the sensitivities of this issue and the journey we have all been on in supporting the 221+ group and all of the women involved, it was the right thing to do to reach consensus in this Chamber and have their support as well. The fact we are at that point makes this a good day for politics, as well as for the members of the group and their families.

If I go slightly over the seven minutes allotted, I ask the Acting Chair and colleagues to please bear with me. I thank several groups of people for where we have got to, which is the right place for this Bill. First and foremost among these are the patient representatives, including the 221+ group. Members of that group and other patient representatives who are here this evening have been involved for the past two years in detailed design of the patient-requested review, not just in these aspects. We had a very productive meeting recently. My officials were engaged yesterday through the night and the wording was agreed this morning, which is why it came through. I thank the patient representatives for all their work, not just over the last few weeks but the last few years. I hope they will stay involved and I thank them in advance for that. It is a serious time commitment for people who have many other things going on in their lives. I thank everyone involved and note their presence this evening. It is great to see. I also thank my Department officials. A huge amount of work has been done on the Bill. We have focused on one important part of it but this is a comprehensive Bill. Officials in the Department working with colleagues in the HSE have put a vast amount of work into it. They worked through the weekend, having worked right through since we discussed Report Stage previously. I thank Oireachtas colleagues. This can be a messy process.Some of Deputy Cullinane’s colleagues were suggesting that it is no way to make law on Report Stage; maybe it is. This is the legislative process. This is where we listen to each other and make changes. This is probably partly how we should do business. I acknowledge the work of colleagues across the House on this. What is the Bill ultimately going to do? It will lead to better outcomes for patients and better clinical and health outcomes. It will also lead to a better experience for patients and some much needed transparency. It is important from that perspective. While there is, very understandably, a focus on cancer screening services and cervical cancer screening services, the Bill is much wider than that. Obviously, it covers the whole health service. It is absolutely correct that the genesis of the Bill comes from cervical screening, however, and from the women and men who stood up and said we are just not having this anymore; this is no way to run this and treat patients and we have had enough. We all know those involved, some of whom are here this evening and some who are sadly no longer with us. Their work and the stance they took, not just then, but in the work they have done right through since we started debating these issues back in 2018, has led to this Bill and other things that are happening. On cervical screening, for example, this Bill is one part of the change that is happening. We introduced the human papillomavirus, HPV vaccine and the Laura Brennan HPV catch-up programme. We introduced a HPV test as part of the screening services. The new laboratory is now built in the Coombe. I was there a few weeks ago and it is state-of-the-art. It will be ramped up over time to take on the vast majority of cervical screening samples. A whole new workforce is being built up, or dare I say rebuilt, with new professionals being trained up. I spent quite a bit of time with them few weeks ago and they are absolutely committed and dedicated to that work and to this Bill as well. Thanks to the bravery and determination of so many people going back to start of what happened with CervicalCheck, all of these things have happened, including this Bill. Our health service and cancer screening services are in a completely different position now than they would have been without that and, ultimately, a lot of lives will be saved. I thank them for all of that. I will very briefly go through the Bill because it is very important. Initially, the Bill aimed to do three main things, one of which was to bring in mandatory disclosure for patient safety incidences. Deputy Shortall raised the point around the Schedule being a very short list. That Schedule is not meant to be there as a complete list; that is the Schedule no Minister can take out. These are the patient safety incidences that would require the Oireachtas to change. The intention is that a much longer list will be developed through regulation. The reason this is through regulation rather than statute is because the nature of those incidences change. Some procedures may not happen anymore and new procedures will be added. They might be changed or updated in certain ways. That is the intent of this. The only reason that Schedule is there is to say that regardless of what any Minister thinks, he or she cannot actually remove these without amending the legislation and, therefore, the agreement of the Oireachtas. That is the first issue. The second is that the Bill provides a framework for clinical audit. Deputy Cullinane asked whether we can include Oireachtas colleagues or patient representative groups in the future and ongoing design. Yes, absolutely we can. It will be very useful to have the Joint Committee on Health involved in that. The third thing the original Bill aimed to do was expand HIQA's power to the private hospitals, which we are all agreed is essential. That was the original intent. I then sought to add to add three additional amendments at Report Stage, which we all agreed at Committee Stage. The first of those was that we further extend HIQA's powers to nursing homes. With regard to many of the patient safety incidences that happened in nursing homes during Covid-19, HIQA had no statutory ability to go in on individual patient safety matters. That has caused a real problem. We cannot put it that in retrospectively but we can at least put it in for the future. That is a new power HIQA will have, which is really important. The second thing is mandatory disclosure of patient-requested reviews. Deputy Kelly raised the point, which he and I talked about previously, around patients who have a diagnosis pre-audit, which is, essentially, from 2018 until now. The answer is that all of them will have access. The way the patient safety reviews are being set up is that any patient can initiate a review within ten years of the diagnosis. Therefore, anyone who got a diagnosis in 2018, 2019, etc. are all covered. Indeed, someone with a pre-2018 diagnosis from BreastCheck or BowelCheck may within ten years of the diagnosis want to avail of the same thing. That is covered. The third thing I sought to introduce at Report Stage was a review after two years. That will be taken very seriously. It is a statutory review as per the termination of pregnancy review, which we will have very shortly. We then had a very constructive Committee Stage-----

The first is mandatory informing of patients of their rights to a patient-requested review before or during screening. The second is mandatory informing of the right to a patient-requested review after screening and that the process needs to be put in place for that, which is contained within the wording. The third then is mandatory provision of information on the process online. Those are the three additional pieces we are seeking to add. This has been the subject of much discussion. I thank the 221+ group for its engagement and support. Its intent, and that of mine and colleagues, is that the reminder, if you like, would happen at an appropriate time after diagnosis. We could not put it in exactly like that for drafting reasons but I want to be very clear that that is the intent. That is exactly what the Department, patient representative groups and HSE will be designing. I will be writing formally to the HSE stating that is my wish and the wish of the Oireachtas. That is how it will work. Appropriate information that has been designed with patient groups will be provided to inform before or during the screening and then at a reasonable time after diagnosis. We will leave the detail of that to the patient groups, the Department and the HSE to work out. For example, various patient representatives I met who have been through this said they would not have wanted to know during the same meeting in which they got the diagnosis, and that they might have wanted to know one week, one month or six months later. We will leave that to the team in place to decide what is most appropriate and then we can review it. It probably will not be all right the first time around so we will review it. I acknowledge that is what we are going to do. Something that was invoked very reasonably in this Chamber previously was whether this would then pass the Vicky test. Certainly, the letter I received from the 221+ group today suggests that in its view, this combination does pass the test. Deputy Shortall raised points about complaints and I agree. This opt-out or subclause in the 2004 Act, which the Deputy has in as amendment no. 20, is in a different grouping. I agree; we can come to it later but this is not what this Act is for. There is a separate process going on to look at exactly those kinds of issues, however. It is quite an extraordinary clause whereby a person can make a complaint but not one related to a clinical issue. I agree with the intent, but we will solve it in different way. I appreciate I am way over time but I will speak now to the main points of this because we did not quite get to them the last time. The new piece we are bringing in this evening includes three subclauses. The amendment provides that the health service provider shall inform the patient of his or her right to a Part 5 review before or at the time of screening. The new patient-requested review has been developed following guidelines, obviously, from the expert review group, ERG, and designed in consultation with the patient groups, including the 221+ group.It will be mandatory to fully disclose the results of the reviews to patients. It is worth noting that we are doing well on this in Ireland. Very few countries have patient-requested reviews, with only a small subsection of them having mandatory disclosure of those reviews. Very few countries in the world have this combination of patient-requested review and mandatory disclosure thereof. Before patients participate in the screening programme and have their test, they will be fully informed by the health service provider that reviews are available. The new amendment puts the obligation to inform a patient of his or her right to a review on a statutory basis for the health service provider. On Part 5, we never discussed the patient-requested review the last time, so I will briefly go through this before stopping. I thank the Acting Chair, Deputy Funchion, for her indulgence. I have set out details of the amendment to the new section 36. I will return to amendment No. 19. I flagged on Committee Stage that I would introduce the amendment on Report Stage to ensure that open disclosure applies to completed patient-requested reviews. The approach is based on the expert reference group report into interval cancers. It was deemed appropriate to follow the group's recommendations regarding individual patient-requested reviews. The amendment we discussed in the debate on 7 December is quite a lengthy document, comprising 21 sections. It is necessary to provide full provision for mandatory open disclosure for patient-requested reviews for cancer screening similar to the provisions already in the Bill for mandatory open disclosure of notifiable incidences. The amendment ensures that open disclosure applies to completed patient-requested reviews of cancer screening. I am now proposing that a patient-requested review of the patient's cancer screening will be provided for in a new Part 5 of the patient safety Bill. Essentially, this is to differentiate a look-back review from being a patient safety incident in and of itself, which it is not. It is separate from a patient safety incident. The review itself is not an incident and so we have separated it into its own Part in the Bill. This will ensure the current provision for open disclosure of a notifiable incident will be replicated in the new Part. All reviews will have to be disclosed regardless of whether there is a discordance. The amendment proposed provides for the insertion of a new Part 5 in the patient safety Bill 2019 for the purpose of providing for open disclosure of completed patient-requested reviews of HSE cancer screening services. Such a review will be defined in the body of the Bill and will involve similar statutory requirements to those prescribed for a patient safety incident.

I also thank the Acting Chair, Deputy Funchion, for indulging all of us in this debate. It was necessary for the Minister to provide that outline. Perhaps we can pull back and put a structure on this amendment. I will not be pushing the Labour Party amendment but I seek clarification one or two minor matters. Based on the new amendment the Minister has brought forward and to which we were privy, I welcome all of the work done. I, too, thank the Minister for the manner in which he dealt with this legislation before Christmas. The time and engagement have been necessary. The fact is that the 221+ group would not have supported this Bill if we had not taken the time to do what we did over the past few days. I have been raising the issue of the absence of audits for the past couple of years and long before we got back to this patient safety Bill. I am glad the Minister said this will be over ten years. That is good information, which I did not have. I want to check a point with the Minister. Obviously this will cover bowel screening, breast screening and so on. Are there any issues around someone being statute barred given the time period? I know the period is ten years but are there any other consequential statute issues that I would not be aware of legally? I am just checking this. I do not believe it is the case but I am making sure, to be sure. The Minister referred to the process and the wording around post-diagnosis. I take everything the Minister says here on the floor of the Dáil as being 100% correct but I presume he will put that in writing to the HSE as a result of this legislation.

Will he direct, in the form of a letter, that this is the intention of the legislation, even if we cannot put that into primary legislation, and that this is the stipulation? I understood the Minister will put that in writing. Will he confirm to the House that he will do that in order that anyone who wants a patient safety review will be able to have one?

By all accounts, it is a very fine facility. The big issue with it was that there were no staff. Certainly up to recently there were not adequate staff to deal with CervicalCheck smears. I asked a parliamentary question on this in December. The response indicated only private work was being done there. We were told the CervicalCheck programme smears would be processed at this lab very shortly. Will the Minister update the House on where we are at in that regard? When does he expect the new lab in the Coombe Hospital to be fully operational? It is a matter of serious concern that all of the CervicalCheck smears are going to the United States, notwithstanding that Dr. Scally said he did not have concerns about quality in that lab. That is an important point. The aim has to be to bring back all of the analysis of smears as quickly as possible. I also raise with the Minister a question I raised previously regarding the Minister's amendment No. 19 on the Part 5 review. I believe that, in the main, the provision is good but there are two areas where I have proposed amendments. The first concerns the statement in respect of the procedure for open disclosure under Part 5. Again, this is a critical area. Section 41(2) states that, without prejudice to the generality of section 76, the Minister "may make guidelines". I propose that the word "may" be substituted with the word "shall", so we do not leave anything open to a lack of clarification and there is no confusion. If we are seriously committed to open disclosure, in my view the Bill should provide that "the Minister shall" make guidelines. Similarly, section 51(1) concerning the review information states that "A health services provider may, at any time after the holding of the Part 5 review disclosure meeting, provide information" on the guidelines. My amendment would change this wording to provide that a health services provider "shall" make guidelines. It is only fair that if there is a serious commitment to open disclosure, we would be absolutely clear about that, there would be no confusion about it and the onus would be on the Minister and healthcare provider to make those guidelines, rather than having this left as a possibility. We should be very clear that there "shall" be guidelines provided. I ask the Minister to look favourably on my two amendments in that regard.

Obviously we want to see a ratcheting up and expansion of services at the Coombe Hospital. If we can repatriate a large part of the screening services for CervicalCheck in that facility, it would be really welcome. I ask that the Minister keep us informed of the ratcheting up of staffing and capacity as it happens.That is to be welcomed in the first instance. There is a lot to be done there yet. While we still have a long way to go, I understand that the lab itself is a first-class facility and we must make the best use of it. Am I correct in saying the Part 5 review will be in place for all cancer screening services?

This will not just be for CervicalCheck; it will be for all cancer screening services. I welcome the Minister's commitment to work with the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and to keep us informed on what the audit will look like. I also welcome his commitment that the 221+ group will be consulted on that element of it as well. That is very important. We discussed with the Minister some outstanding issues from the Scally report. What is his expectation and plan to deal with those issues, which were not addressed in the Bill? We all attended the briefing Dr. Scally gave. He published his report some months ago, some time before Christmas. He outlined areas where there was movement and progress, which he welcomed, and he also outlined areas where there was no progress. What is the Minister's intention regarding how that will be addressed? That will be a very important issue for us as we go forward. We accept the Bill, and we will pass it, but there is a role for the Oireachtas and the Opposition on those issues that have either been parked or not addressed because they are still under discussion. I would like the Minister to outline, as best he can, his views on the outstanding areas from the Scally report that have not yet been implemented.

My understanding is that the time is from when you know, but let us get a legal view on that. In response to Deputy Kelly's second question, there will be several matters on which I will be writing to the HSE. Yes, it is my intent, and I will be including this in writing to the HSE, to say that what we mean in the second sub-clause by "after screening" is what the 221+ group means, which is at, or a reasonable time after, diagnosis and, critically, that patient representatives including the 221+ group will be included in the design of exactly that. In response to Deputy Shortall, the Coombe lab is a very impressive facility. It is now staffing up with histopathology and various other skill sets, but because screening was shut down in Ireland, it is having to train up a whole new group of healthcare professionals because the skill set has been lost to some extent. That does take a little bit of time. It has started with CervicalCheck samples in recent weeks. The aim is to get up to about 10% of those samples this quarter and then to ramp up as quickly as possible. The kind of timeframe I was discussing with the lab was about five years. What was said is that we will always want some samples going abroad. This is backed up by Dr. Scally's report. We do not want to be reliant on just one lab. In terms of the five years, I did press and ask if we could go faster. The lab will if it can. The point it made was that it is about training up new healthcare professionals. Even quite skilled clinicians who are coming in require several years of training to be able to analyse the individual slides and samples. It is not a funding issue. It is nothing other than that it just takes-----

I am not in a position to accept the specific amendment on "may" versus "shall" for a technical reason. Guidelines will not be required in every circumstance from the Minister and, regarding the second piece, from the healthcare provider. There may not be any additional information in every case. We would be putting an obligation on the Minister of the day and on the health service to provide guidelines where that simply may not be possible. It is not something we can provide for in law. Deputy Cullinane raised the Part 5 review. Yes, that is for all cancer screening services. His final question is a very interesting one, namely, where we go with the rest of Dr. Scally's report. I might suggest a health committee session on that. It is a broader conversation than we can have here this evening. I had a very good meeting with Dr. Scally on the morning he launched his report. Some of his report was based on the non-amended version of the Bill, so some of the issues he raised have been covered by the addition of amendments. There are some other outstanding issues that he has raised. If the health committee is up for it, we might do a session on that, or perhaps we could all meet informally to discuss it and see where we go. Some of it is within the bounds of this Bill and some of it is not.

I flagged this amendment on Committee Stage when I advised the committee that I proposed to give the HIQA chief inspector of social services "a discretionary power to carry out a review of certain serious patient safety incidents that occur during the provision of healthcare where some or all of the care of the patient is carried out in a nursing home". This policy was approved by the Cabinet in October 2021. This proposed amendment will seek to support patients and their families when something goes wrong with the clinical care they received in a nursing home. It will ensure appropriate external processes are in place to review serious patient safety incidents. The amendment follows the report of the Covid-19 nursing home expert panel recommendations that called for suitable structures to be put in place for external oversight of individual care concerns arising in nursing homes. This power will not replace the responsibility of nursing homes to address concerns that are raised by patients and families. It would put in place an appropriate escalation pathway to ensure the concerns are addressed in a way that will provide answers to patients and their families. In effect, the amendment will give HIQA the discretionary power to review an individual serious patient safety event, called a "specified incident" in this provision, in a nursing home that may have occurred when clinical care was being delivered. The amendment will seek to support patients and their families when something goes wrong with the clinical care they received and ensure that the appropriate external processes are in place. Pending completion of broader work on clinical complaints legislation, which we discussed, and policy across the health and social service sector, priority is being given to providing HIQA with this discretionary power.

I met HIQA representatives regarding these amendments a number of weeks ago. They made some interesting points that surprised me. The first was that they believed most of the powers being made available through these amendments are already available to HIQA. I got the sense that they did not see great value in what is being proposed. I was a member of the Covid committee that met in this Chamber for some time. For me, one of the issues that arose during the Covid pandemic is that there are serious incidents - the Minister talked about specific incidents - that HIQA obviously can and should investigate but there are also issues that amount to neglect. That can be subjective but there were many complaints where a family member may have complained that his or her loved one was neglected in a nursing home. There are examples I could go into but I will not because these related to individual issues in nursing homes, some of which were brought to the Minister's attention by some of his Government colleagues, as he knows. The problem was there was no power to initiate investigations by safeguarding teams, social care teams or HIQA into individual issues of neglect. That was a problem. It does not seem this is captured by these amendments. The Minister might clarify that.

It is not exactly clear. It may be in the small print but I cannot see where that power has been given to HIQA. In a general sense, I welcome the Minister's amendments relating to extending the powers of HIQA in certain respects. Of course, those powers will only be useful if the consequent resources are provided. What are the proposals to increase the resources of HIQA to enable it to carry out these additional duties? I will make a point in respect of a matter that arose during this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Health, when the Secretary General of the Department appeared before us. About a year or so into the Covid pandemic, an expert group was established to report on the response to Covid-19 in private nursing homes. One of the recommendations made by that group was to carry out a full review of the use of private nursing homes in the context of the extent they are being used at present, with 80% of all nursing homes now in the private sector. Serious issues undoubtedly arose with Covid-19 in respect of the shortcomings of such a heavy dependency on private nursing homes. I asked the Secretary General where that review was at and whether it had commenced. He and none of the people with him were aware of that recommendation from the expert group. This is an important area. In 2020, I recall that then Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, said on one occasion that we needed to do a comprehensive review of the model of care that we are using for the care of older people, meaning that congregated settings in the private sector are not necessarily the best care arrangements to provide. Of course, the vast majority of older people want to have support to stay in their own homes. I am concerned that this important recommendation from the expert group could be lost. I ask the Minister to respond regarding where the review is at present or, if he cannot answer, to at least come back to me with a note.

From the perspective of nursing homes run by the State and those run privately, and smaller versus bigger nursing homes, the report showed that smaller nursing homes had fewer complaints. They were better run and there were fewer complaints about them. These are the same nursing homes that are fighting at present to keep their doors open due to the economic pressure of the rising cost of energy. These amendments give powers to HIQA to carry out investigations and extra powers to go into nursing homes. HIQA is now going into smaller nursing homes where there are very few or no complaints. It is putting extra pressure on these homes to change to different models, even though they do not have any complaints from any of their residents. HIQA is pressuring them to spend more money at a time when small nursing homes are running at a loss. I am talking about nursing homes that range from 25 to 30 beds that are under fierce financial pressure to keep the doors open. HIQA is now telling them to increase room size by 1.5 sq. m to meet the guidelines. Yet, there are no complaints in the sector regarding the care being given by those particular nursing homes. On the one hand, I welcome HIQA coming in and enforcing from the perspective of healthcare for people who are in nursing homes. However, we also have to look at smaller nursing homes that have been there for many years, need our help to stay open and have had no complaints from families or residents. We should protect them as well.

Under section 9, HIQA has powers to intervene but only in very specific circumstances. I engaged directly with HIQA on one particular patient safety incident, for example, and the point was made to me that, in this case, which was not a good one, it had no power to intervene. It will now. This legislation will give it the additional powers it needs. The Deputy quite rightly raised the question of neglect as opposed to an individual incident where HIQA can go in. That is being dealt with but it is outside the scope of this Bill. It is being dealt with through the complaints work that is going on. It is quite likely that new legislation will be brought forward around complaints, including, I imagine, repealing exactly what Deputy Shortall seeks to repeal through amendment No. 20 around the 2004 Act. That is where issues of neglect can be dealt with. To Deputy Shortall's question on HIQA resources, I will get her the detail. HIQA will be provided with resources. Its remit is expanding in quite a few areas based on this Bill and it will be resourced accordingly. I will get back to the Deputy regarding the private nursing homes review. One thing I found quite alarming is the lack of standards for private nursing homes in matters such as building regulations. It is something the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, has spent a lot of time on. We are bringing in HIQA as regards patient safety but guidelines on the architectural design of nursing homes, communal areas, single room occupancy, etc., are also very important. There is a programme for Government commitment around a commission on ageing. That is one area where some of the issues raised by the Deputy can and should be addressed.  Finally, to Deputy O'Donoghue's point, the changes HIQA is making are important and are aimed at improving patient care. However, they come at a real cost to the nursing homes, particularly, as the Deputy said, the smaller ones. I can confirm that in just the past few weeks the nursing homes renewing with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, under the fair deal programme have seen quite a significant increase in the weekly payment per resident, and that is in recognition of exactly the point the Deputy has raised. Furthermore, payments are going out under the inflation fund or the energy fund in the winter to these nursing homes, again in recognition of the fact that their costs have gone up and that a lot of the smaller nursing homes in particular are really struggling to pay the bills based on the previous fair deal rates that are in place.

Again, one of the issues HIQA raised with me was that this does not cover patient safety incidents in centres for people with disabilities, for example, or in other healthcare facilities. The Minister might confirm if that is the case and, if so, why.

The initial view is on long-term residential care, but I will get back to him with a note on the question raised.

All payments are welcome. Recently, a new alliance for smaller nursing homes was set up. I think it counts 18 or 19 nursing homes and more than 1,000 patients. The alliance feels that the new payments coming out are still not adequate for the smaller nursing homes. If there are new, increased payments, the alliance would like the Government to look at the smaller nursing homes first and to see where the shortfall is. The larger nursing home businesses in the system can run a lot more smoothly per patient because of their size, whereas the smaller nursing homes - and I go back to point that we have heard either no complaints or only minute complaints - are the ones that are really suffering. The Minister might look at the smaller nursing homes. The alliance met with the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, and told her of the smaller nursing homes' plight and the problems they are having keeping open. They told her of a nursing home that would close within a week unless there was an intervention. That nursing home has gone, and two more are looking at closing in the next two weeks because of the costs incurred. I ask the Minister to look at those nursing homes. I can give him personally a list of all the ones affected. If he would look at them, I would appreciate his help. Nursing homes create a home for the people who are there, and the smaller nursing homes are a home away from home. I talk to people who own large nursing homes and smaller nursing homes. They tell me that the homely care in the smaller nursing home setting is better and that people there get better care. They are in an environment where they actually think they are at home. I ask the Minister to look at this.
