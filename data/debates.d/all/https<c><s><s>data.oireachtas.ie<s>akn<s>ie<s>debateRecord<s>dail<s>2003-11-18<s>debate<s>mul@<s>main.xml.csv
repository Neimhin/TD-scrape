#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, and No. 128 together.I can confirm to the Dáil that Deputy Collins communicated to the Government Chief Whip his resignation from the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. There is no agreement or understanding between the Government and the Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Will the Taoiseach give a definition of the status of Fianna Fáil Deputies who have either resigned the whip or have had the whip taken from them? It appears the only real penalty applied to them is that they miss the excitement of Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meetings. Will the Taoiseach indicate the numbers within his ranks who, like Deputy Collins, have resigned the whip or have had the whip withdrawn from them?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Of course, you do not like the scope of the question.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Deputy has gone outside it.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Deputy Collins informed the chairman of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Kirk, that he was resigning the whip. I want to know from the Taoiseach if it is possible to get a definition, without mentioning geographics or demographics, of what status Deputy Collins now has and the status of any other Deputy within the ranks of the Fianna Fáil Party who has resigned or has had the whip withdrawn from him or her. Is special attention being given to these people? While Deputy Collins did not vote with the Government on 5, 6 or 11 November and did not bother to participate, something happened on the way to Damascus because he voted on 12 November with the Government. Is he back or is he not? Demographics, geographics, is he with Fianna Fáil or against it? What is the definition of his status and that of others?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	As I said in my reply, Deputy Collins is not a member of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Taoiseach has had plenty of time to think about the relationships between Deputy Collins and Fianna Fáil given that he knew of Deputy Collins's difficulties in June but did nothing about them. Having given so much time to the matter is the Taoiseach in a position to tell the House how Deputy Collins's situation may affect the way tax clearance certificates are to be dealt with in the future? Are there any lessons to be learned from Deputy Collins's difficulties given that apparently there was no problem in obtaining a tax clearance certificate? If that is the case, is it the Taoiseach's view that there is not much validity in a tax clearance certificate?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The Deputy is going outside the scope of the question.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	We all need a change in the rules and the Taoiseach is the one to herald the change.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	11	Deputy Collins and all Members of the Fianna Fáil Party and the other parties, so far as I know, had a tax clearance certificate. In regard to Deputy Collins, an issue has been raised in a Revenue report. That is the subject of independent handling by the Public Offices Commission which has full responsibility and full powers to deal with that matter and I am not going to do its work for it.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	12	That is typical. It is meaningless.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	What lessons does the Taoiseach think the House and the political system ought to learn from the experience with Deputy Collins? Does the Taoiseach agree that in the minds of the public when he said, as he was able to say from the United States, that as far as he was concerned Deputy Collins had a tax free certificate, that seems to convey to the public that his tax—
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	14	Tax clearance certificate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I am immensely grateful. On reflection it looks as if he did have a tax free certificate for quite a while.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I ask Deputy Rabbitte to continue with his question and not to allow himself to be side-tracked.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	17	That seems to be the problem. He had a tax free certificate. Does the Taoiseach agree that in the view of the man and woman in the street, that means that one's tax affairs are in order? What are the implications of that for the system we operate to underpin Members' elections to the House where the general view was that if one was in possession of a tax clearance certificate, one's tax affairs were in order but now it turns out that is not the case?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	18	As I said previously on this point, I agree with what Deputy Rabbitte says. I understood a tax clearance certificate meant that one's tax affairs were totally in order. Whether it means that or not, we have to wait until the Public Offices Commission investigates this matter. Deputy Collins informed me he had a tax clearance certificate, that he had sorted out a tax issue with the Revenue Commissioners but that it would be published on a list which would be in the public domain shortly. He told me that last June. It did not come into the public domain until September. He stated that he believed it would lead to the Public Offices Commission examining the matter. At this stage Deputy Collins has opted on advice to deal fully with the commission, as he must under law. We must wait to see the circumstances of the tax issue that he resolved with the Revenue Commissioners, what Revenue's view was, how that affected the tax clearance certificates and how the Public Offices Commission, under its statutory powers, interprets that. I honestly do not know the answers to these questions. We must wait for the report.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	19	When the Taoiseach was in New York he described as "spongers" the decent compliant taxpayers who campaigned against the local bin tax regime. Why did he not call Deputy Collins, against whom there is a proven case of tax evasion, a sponger? Is it not the reality that the resignation by Deputy Collins of the Fianna Fáil whip is a nod and a wink to convince the public that Fianna Fáil might take tax evasion seriously? If it did, the party membership of a tax evader would immediately come into question. The reality is that tax evasion is not a serious issue in Fianna Fáil.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Deputy must ask a question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	21	If the Taoiseach legally allows millionaires and billionaires to pose as tax exiles to evade their social responsibility in taxation—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	22	We are dealing with Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, and Question No. 128.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I know that.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	24	The Deputy is well outside the scope of these questions.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	25	We are trying to learn lessons from this situation, as several other Deputies have said. I was about to conclude. If the Taoiseach grants millionaires and billionaires tax exile status and allows them evade or avoid taxes to the tune of hundreds of millions, what does it matter if one of the lads does it unofficially?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Deputy Higgins is ahead of me, as always. If he has evidence that Deputy Collins is guilty of tax evasion, which is a criminal offence, perhaps he would give the House the details. It might be better still were he to say it outside the House and allow Deputy Collins deal with it.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Will the Taoiseach explain to the House the ethical basis for agreements with Deputy Collins or other Independent Members of the House? Will he advise us whether he agrees that agreements with so-called Independent Members should be in the public arena where they would be open and transparent?Should it not be the case that, if there is or has been in the course of this and the previous Governments' terms in office since 1997, a preferential facilitation for Independent Members, as against other elected Members on the Opposition benches, that is something of which the wider public and the relevant constituents should be fully apprised? Does the Taoiseach not agree that we need open and transparent detail of such agreements?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	28	As I stated previously, there is no agreement with Deputy Collins. The previous Government acted in line with the tradition of the House which is that, when a Government does not have a majority, it works with Independent Members by explaining to them and co-operating with them on the legislative programme and dealing with issues of concern to them. That has always been the way.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Taoiseach will recall that, shortly after the Revenue Commissioners published Deputy Collins's name in September, that mighty man from Limerick, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy O'Dea, appeared on "Prime Time" and said that the Taoiseach had insisted that Deputy Collins notify the Public Offices Commission of his tax problems last June.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Deputy's remarks do not arise out of these questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	32	They do arise.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Not out of these questions. I suggest that the Deputy submit a question on the issue.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	34	They do arise. They are relevant—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	35	We are dealing with questions about the agreement or understanding between the Government and Deputy Collins.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	36	They are relevant to the agreement or understanding the Government has with Deputy Collins. Will the Taoiseach admit that this statement was not true and that the Public Offices Commission was not notified of the tax problems of Deputy Collins until after his name was published by the Revenue Commissioners? Will he state whether that is a failure or a weakness in the strategy and conditions set up by him?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	37	That matter does not arise from these five questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Excuse me, it does arise.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The Chair has ruled that it does not arise. The questions are quite specific.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The Chair has ruled on many occasions in the House, in my presence, that it has no control over the response given by the Taoiseach.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	41	That is correct, but I have control over the contents of a question, and the question—
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	42	Is there an understanding between the Government and Deputy Collins in terms of the agreements worked out between them? There is a need for the Taoiseach to answer that. What is the current status of the inquiry into Deputy Collins's behaviour, being conducted by the Taoiseach's party? Will that inquiry be concluded shortly and will the report be published?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	43	On the first issue, I am aware, as I stated previously, that in an interview on RTE television the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, gave in good faith a version of events as he understood them. That was not the version given in the statement issued by the Public Offices Commission. I too clarified the position, which was accepted by the Minister, Deputy O'Dea, and everyone else. There was no problem there.On the other matter, Deputy Collins has opted to deal with the independent statutory body handling this issue and I am not au fait with how that investigation stands.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Deputy Collins, albeit no longer holding the party whip, is still a member of the Taoiseach's party. Is it not therefore the case that there is an understanding of membership? We are trying to elicit further information. Is the Taoiseach concerned that Deputy Collins remains a party member, having had to secure a tax clearance certificate and indeed swear on oath that he was in compliance with tax laws? Is there not a difficulty for the Taoiseach in having members of his party swearing on oath that they are in total compliance—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	45	That does not arise from these questions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	46	It involves the relationship between the Taoiseach and Deputy Collins, which is one of party membership. Will the Taoiseach bring about changes for his party membership or for the way in which tax compliance is assured to the public in advance of an election?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I will not comment on this matter in advance of the Public Offices Commission completing its investigations. Experience has shown me that many issues, when investigated, turn out to be totally different. I will be glad to comment when I see the report on these matters.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	48	Has the Government an understanding with Deputy Collins that, for example, he will support the Hanly report? If so, he would be the only Fianna Fáil Deputy in the mid-west region to support it.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	49	He would be the only person in Fianna Fáil to support it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	As I understand from the Taoiseach's answer to Deputy Sargent, the internal Fianna Fáil inquiry or commission has collapsed. Is that due to the fact that he selected as chairman of that inquiry someone whose company made a settlement with the Revenue Commissioners for over €600,000 some years ago?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	51	That does not arise from these five questions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Will the internal inquiry proceed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Public Offices Commission inquiry is taking precedence. I thought that Deputy Rabbitte would at least be fair to a former colleague of his. That person's company made the settlement, but he was not a director of the company at the time, he was a Minister of State. As Deputy Rabbitte knows, he did not have responsibility for those matters. His company made a settlement, but that is not the issue. The issue is that Deputy Collins has decided on his own legal advice that he will deal comprehensively with the Public Offices Commission because it is a statutory body and he will give precedence to it.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	54	Sorry, Deputy Rabbitte, the House has spent 20 minutes on this question and we have gone well outside the scope of the four questions which are similar to each other.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	55	There are four questions.

The House has gone well outside the scope of the questions—
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	57	No more than when we began. There have been four questions and no answer.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I am anxious to facilitate the Chair but it is an important subject. After the decades of tax evasion, non-compliance, DIRT accounts, bogus non-resident accounts and all the rest—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	That has nothing to do with the questions. We will move on to Question No. 5.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	No, a Cheann Comhairle, it has.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	63	In respect of the Taoiseach's statement that he has no understanding with Deputy Collins in terms of his future voting arrangements in the House, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to condemn non-compliance with the tax laws by a member of the parliamentary party of any party in the House?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	64	As I have stated several times, no current Member of the House has brought in more anti-avoidance and anti-evasion legislation than me. I do not believe any other Member has done so since the foundation of the State and certainly no current Member has. As the person who brought in that legislation and took enormous political criticism from the media, business and, to a lesser extent, Members for doing so, of course I subscribe to the standards outlined by the Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Taoiseach referred previously on Question Time to a certain status attached to those who are not members of Fianna Fáil or another party and are given the assistance of an official to inform them of issues that arise. Is Deputy Collins in receipt of assistance from the same official or is there such a conduit of information given that he cannot attend Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meetings? How is he informed of the message, whether it be about Hanly or demographics, geographics or whatever? How is he to know how he should address the population on these critical issues? Is an official assigned to assist him in this regard?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	68	As I stated earlier, there is no agreement or understanding between the Government and the Deputy and neither is he seeking assistance from the office of the Chief Whip or the official who liaises with people who seek it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.There are no vacancies in my Department at present. Vacancies are generally consistent with day to day variations arising from promotions and departures.Recruitment to fill posts in my Department is in line with the normal procedures that apply to the Civil Service. Staff are assigned by the Civil Service Commission and also recruited through FÁS in the case of services officers, services attendants and cleaners. Internal promotions are effected in accordance with agreed procedures in the Department. My Department is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for all staff. We follow the guidelines set out in the code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities in the Civil Service. Recruitment, promotion, training and all other benefits and opportunities are decided on the grounds of ability, qualifications and other relevant objective criteria.Of the 193.8 core staff employed in my Department, six people have disabilities. My Department therefore exceeds the 3% target for the employment of people with disabilities. The Department's offices are compatible with the needs of persons with disabilities.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I am pleased to hear that the Department of the Taoiseach is in compliance with the set target. Given that the general rate of unemployment is approximately 4% but the rate of unemployment among those with disabilities is approximately 60%, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that the objective of 3% be raised? Would he consider it to be a progressive step and has he discussed it with the Government? Is the Department of the Taoiseach fully accessible to those with disabilities? As a public building, would a person with a disability face problems accessing it?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Every year more work is carried out and the Department is now fully accessible. I have not heard of any difficulties. There is a dedicated parking facility for people with disabilities and this and other improvements have made the Department more accessible to them. That work is ongoing. Many agencies from inside and outside the Department came to discuss disability legislation and the building was accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility is always difficult for those with disabilities but lifts and ramps help to make the Department accessible.I used to deal with the 3% employment target for those with disabilities many years ago in the Department of Labour, but we should look not just at that figure. There is a member of my Department on the steering group but I am not up to date on its plans. We should not just work towards the 3% target, but should always try to improve it. The process in my Department, and in those in which I worked previously, was to ensure full equality. Persons who are eligible for employment under the criteria of the Civil Service should be treated equally. That should be done under any recruitment mechanism regardless of reaching the 3%.Some Departments have reached or surpassed that target and there may be proposals in future to increase the target figure. On the point raised by Deputy Kenny, we should not, on reaching the 3% target, do nothing more. Where suitable opportunities exist we should try to employ those with disabilities because they find it more difficult to secure employment, particularly in the private sector.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The number of public servants will be cut by 2,000 next year. Will the procedure being discussed to implement this cut in numbers – non-replacement of staff – be followed in the Department of the Taoiseach? Has the Taoiseach evaluated the effect of this Government measure on the performance of his Department? Members of staff there are currently overworked so how will those vacancies impact on the work of the Department?I notice from the Estimates a rise of 9% in 2004 for salaries, wages, allowances and administrative costs. Is that due to the benchmarking increases and where does it fit in with the 28% additional costs –€1.25 million – for incidental expenses? What are incidental expenses? Do they have anything to do with the EU Presidency? A figure of €1 million has been earmarked for the EU Presidency. Will that include increased staff numbers, even on a temporary basis? Will the €1 million cover staffing costs?I was interested to hear Deputy Kenny ask about the quota for disability. Will the Taoiseach update the House on the gender balance of staff in the Department?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	73	On the question of the Estimates, if the Deputy puts down a question I will give him the details of the subheads—
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	74	It is the Taoiseach's Department.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Yes, but this is a question on the staffing. I do not have the details on all the subheads with me. There are additional expenditures next year for the European Union under a number of subheads in my Department. The management group in my Department is responsible not alone for reducing numbers by 4% but also for ensuring that we maintain, within the modernisation programme, the same services. That is a question of management, it is part of the pay agreement and Departments have to manage it. That will be done. Staff costs in my Department in terms of increments, overtime and allowances, particularly next year, will be higher than in other years and those are some of the reasons for the increase at the staffing end. Next year the Department effectively will be open on a daily basis right through the Presidency. It has to be under the normal rules of the Presidency.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	76	What about the gender balance issue?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	77	I do not have a breakdown of the actual number but I gave the figures on this previously. In most of the grades, the gender balance in the Department is close enough to 50:50. Even among the top grades in my Department there is a good gender balance, right up to assistant secretary general.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	78	Does the Taoiseach agree that we should not accept under any circumstances the situation whereby more than 50% of households headed by a person with a disability or a long-term illness are living in relative income poverty? Does he accept that the Government, and perhaps his Department in particular, should be taking the lead in addressing this most unacceptable situation? Given that this is the European Year of People with Disabilities, what measures has the Taoiseach introduced in the course of this year, or that he proposes to introduce before the year's end, to properly mark this very special year to ensure there will be a positive legacy for people with disabilities as a result of measures he would take?Am I correct in my understanding of the Taoiseach's earlier response that he accepts that the 3% recommendation on employment of people with disabilities should not be seen as a ceiling but rather a strengthening of that, which is what we want, and that it should be expanded on a continuous basis to tackle the serious situation whereby some 70% of people with disabilities are currently unemployed?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	79	Under the existing code and criteria, when posts are being filled we should try to employ as many people with disabilities as we possibly can and, as mentioned by Deputy Kenny earlier, ensure that the facilities are put in place. The Civil Service code of practice for the employment of people with disabilities sets out clear criteria. All staff are recruited on an equal basis of opportunity. Staff are recruited through the Civil Service Commission on the grounds that they meet the requirements of the positions they are to fill. The issue of disability does not impede recruitment and no exceptions are made in my office in this regard. I do not believe they are made in any other Department either.On the European Year of People with Disabilities, we have had an ongoing interest in that during the year. Additional resources were given to a number of areas and also to the campaign which I launched in January. We allocated resources to the public awareness campaign which covered many issues around making a difference in this area. I also announced some new areas of action some of which cover the public service, agencies and the private sector and including 100 ways of assisting disabled people. In my own Department special leave arrangements were granted to staff who volunteered to work during the Special Olympics. The disability liaison officer of the Department is an active member of the national co-ordination committee of the year. The Cabinet committee on social inclusion is also involved and has raised disability and equality issues in the context of promoting the year and assisting in its development. There has been a campaign based around information posters and newsletters which have been displayed in places throughout my Department and others. There is also a website from which staff can download information. We have offered assistance across a range of areas in the European Year of People with Disabilities.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	81	There are two categories of staff in the Civil Service. The majority of civil servants come through the Civil Service competition, while others are appointed at the behest of the Minister. Can the Taoiseach indicate the number of staff who fall into the second category in his Department? When the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is up and running, which I hope will be at the beginning of the new year, will all categories of staff, irrespective of the posts they hold in the Oireachtas and including those which, up to now, have been in the gift of each Minister, come under the aegis of the new commission?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	82	As regards the breakdown of staff, most of the people are appointed through the Civil Service Commission, other than the grades I mentioned in my Department. However, that is a small number out of the 200 or so in the Department. I do not have the exact figure with me, but it is not a sizeable one. As regards the new commission, I understand the entire operation of the Houses of the Oireachtas will come within the control of the commission.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	83	As regards the 5% reduction, I am not clear about that or about tracing it within the House. I have read a number of times that the Minister for Finance has decreed that there shall be a 5% reduction in staff numbers in the public service. Is that the case and, if so, how is it proposed to implement it? Will it happen through natural wastage or the non-filling of vacancies?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	84	My Department is required to achieve a reduction of 4% in overall staff numbers by 2005. We must do that as part of a process of achieving efficiencies and economies in the way we conduct our business. The process will be managed by the management group in the Department. It will probably not fill vacancies, but restructure each time to ensure we do not reduce the service. As part of the pay agreement, the service and the work must be shared out and managed between others to achieve higher productivity and efficiency and more modernisation within the Department. That is what we must do.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	85	The Department of the Taoiseach must achieve a reduction of 4%.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	89	It will happen irrespective of the Presidency. It will probably be done through the non-filling of posts, but there is also the transfer of posts, sections or units. However, there must be a reduction of 4% within the overall figures. The senior management group in the Department – the MAC – must manage it in such a way that service is not cut and difficulties or inefficiencies are not created. It must be done by 2005.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Will it be 4% across the entire service?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	93	An historic moment indeed. A total of 55% of households headed by a person with a disability live below the poverty line. In 1994 the NESC and the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities recommended that there be instituted a cost-of-disability payment to offset this imbalance. In 2000 a working group was set up under the PPF to examine the feasibility of such a payment and in 2002 An Agreed Programme for Government promised that the work of this group would be completed. It is almost three years since the working group was set up but it has not yet reported. Who chairs this group? What resources does this person have at his or her disposal? What is the problem that has prevented this working group from reporting after three years, given that it was based on a promise by Government to implement a cost-of-disability allowance? Is it not perfectly obvious, particularly to those in public life, that the link between poverty and disability is irrefutable? Would the Taoiseach not—

Without waiting for any report this Government has provided resources towards the education of people with disabilities, whether through classroom assistants or additional special needs teachers. From having a few hundred special needs teachers in the entire country a few years ago, we now have about 6,000. We used to spend only a few million a year on disability grants but the figure in the last budget was about €40 million. In the area of local authority housing there has been a huge increase in funding.

Following an active programme of investment by the Government in sporting facilities nationwide, this remains the one major gap that needs to be addressed. This need is acknowledged by Government and it has been my task as Minister with responsibility for sport to find the most efficient and effective means of delivering additional stadium facilities while at the same time satisfying the needs of the various sporting bodies concerned.In response to my invitation, the IRFU and the FAI commissioned Arup Consultants to draw up prioritised proposals to meet the need of both organisations for modern stadium accommodation. The Arup report evaluated stadium development options at five locations, including Lansdowne Road, Newlands Cross and Abbotstown. This report has been subjected to detailed examination by the Office of Public Works, my technical advisers on the project. I received the Office of Public Works's comprehensive analysis of the Arup report in mid-September. Since then, in addition to firming up my own conclusions on the issues highlighted in the Arup and Office of Public Works studies, I have had further discussions and consultations with interested parties. In this regard I am conscious that the matter is daily becoming more pressing.Earlier this year a representative of FIFA who visited Lansdowne Road indicated that FIFA would not be prepared to waive its rules relating to the requirement that Ireland's qualifying matches for the next world cup, which commence in 2004, must be played in an all-seater stadium. There is an urgent imperative that suitable, safe and secure accommodation is provided for these matches and the Government is focused on meeting this need. There are a number of options by which this commitment can be met. As Minister, it has been my task to consider carefully the negative as well as the positive aspects of each of these potential solutions. Not only does a stadium represent a considerable investment of resources but it is a long-term project and therefore must be suitable for both present needs and future requirements. My Department has obtained a thorough assessment of a range of solutions, ensuring that all aspects of the project have been taken into account and that cost estimates are appropriately robust.With regard to the proposals put forward jointly by the FAI and the IRFU, I am awaiting final input on one or two specific issues which I expect to have by the end of this month. When this material is available, I will embark on the formal process of consultations with my Cabinet colleagues on my proposals for dealing with the acknowledged need of both the FAI and the IRFU for modern stadium accommodation. Until such time as the Government has reached a decision on these proposals, I do not intend to make further policy statements on this matter.

Surely it is now decision time. On 8 October the Minister told the House he would bring a memorandum to Government seeking a decision soon. Will the Minister define what "soon" means? How soon will this be done? Does the Minister agree that in the absence of a decision on this, both the IRFU and the FAI are losing considerable sums of money?

I have indicated that it is intended to bring a memorandum to the Government soon. Recently, I had a meeting with the IRFU at which it was indicated that the organisation required to make a further submission. I am disposed towards listening to what the IRFU and any other sporting organisation has to say. It is my intention to bring the memorandum to Government at the earliest opportunity. There is little point in my doing so until I have all the required information to hand. At that point the memorandum will be brought before the Government and it is a matter for the Government to make a decision.I agree with Deputy Deenihan that the IRFU and the FAI are at a substantial revenue loss as a result of the fact that their facilities are, at present, inadequate. I hope the situation can be rectified. I will put the options to the Government and it is a matter for the Government to make a decision in due course.

In view of the fact that Davis Langdon PKS were also the consultants for the Abbotstown project, does the Minister not see a conflict of interest in employing consultants to evaluate a proposal which is contradictory to the one they were promoting?

The company in question acted as project managers for CSID Limited during the construction of the National Aquatic Centre. That contract ended in July 2003. The company was consulted for its technical expertise by Office of Public Works during its examination of the Arup report, which set out the IRFU-FAI proposals for stadium development. I am confident that the company carried out its work in a professional manner and I have no reason to complain about it.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I wish to make it clear that the responsibility for providing a permanent home for any organisation rests with the organisation itself. As the Deputy may be aware, however, I have met representatives of the national community games on a number of occasions to discuss with them their ideas about securing a permanent location for holding the finals of the national community games in the future. In the course of these discussions a number of possibilities were mentioned and I understand that consideration of these options by the organisation is continuing. I remain available to support these efforts in whatever way I can. I will meet representatives of the organisation tomorrow.As the Deputy will also be aware, the organisation has held its annual games at Mosney holiday camp in County Meath. When I was Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I facilitated arrangements for the continued use of Mosney camp for the national finals in 2002. The finals were held there again this year and I witnessed at first hand the widespread support and enthusiasm which the games engender. I am informed that the Reception and Integration Agency, which has entered into an agreement with the owner of Mosney holiday centre for the accommodation of asylum seekers, is prepared to make every effort to facilitate the continued holding of the community games at Mosney and I welcome this decision.I acknowledge that the ESB national community games promotes and encourages sport and activity among young people in Ireland and is a very important element of sport development in Ireland. Up to 500,000 children participate in events each year. The organisation encourages participation and involvement in different sports and activities. This is its 36th year of existence and it has been responsible for introducing thousands of young Irish people to sport.The Irish Sports Council has been very supportive of the community games and has allocated funding totalling €500,000 over the past two years. However, these funds are for the continued development of their sports.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I am pleased to note that the Minister will meet representatives of the community games tomorrow. Mosney has always been the home for the community games. Does the Minister agree that the fact that the Government has a lease on the facility makes Mosney the ideal place for the further development of the community games, not alone for the three weekends of the finals but as a home for the ongoing process of developing the community games throughout the year?Will the Minister investigate, with the community games organisation, the possibility of developing Mosney as the permanent home of the games? Representatives of the organisation have assured me that if the games are moved from Mosney they would become fragmented and would lose the impetus they have gained over many years. That would be detrimental to an event which is enjoyed by many children and which is working well. We should ensure that every effort is made to continue the lease on Mosney and to develop the camp as a permanent home for the community games and for community involvement.

I acknowledge the role of the agency and its director in ensuring the continuance of the games at Mosney. It is desirable that the games continue at Mosney, an ideal location for them. Difficulties have arisen in relation to leasing arrangements at Mosney. It is difficult at this remove to envisage a better location. It is also difficult to envisage how funding could be put in place to provide an alternative location. It would not be possible to make a large capital sum available from my Department, for example, because funding of that nature is not available in the Estimates and is unlikely to be available in the future.I will meet the community games organisers again tomorrow to discuss how we might progress this matter. I agree with Deputy Wall that the ideal solution would be the continuance of the games at Mosney and I will seek, in tandem with the representatives of the community games, to progress this proposal and encourage it in every way I can.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	Under the national lottery-funded sports capital programme administered by my Department, funding is allocated to projects which provide sports and recreational facilities at local, regional and national level. While the majority of the funding allocated under the programme goes to voluntary and community groups, grant assistance is also approved for projects submitted by local authorities. For example, under the 2003 programme, grants to the value of €6.5 million were allocated to ten municipal projects, either directly to local authorities or to projects where the local authority was working in partnership with a sports club or a community organisation. In this regard, I wish to make it clear that I see it as an important objective of sports policy to support multi-sport centres under the management and control of local authorities. Of course, such projects must, like all others, comply with the terms and conditions of the sports capital programme.Examples of multi-sport centre projects allocated funding under the sports capital programme in recent years include those for Finglas, Ballymun, Monkstown and Ringsend in Dublin and Waterford city, Navan, Trim, Carlow, Letterkenny, Sligo, Ennis, Athlone, Ballina and Portlaoise. Of these, the Athlone sports centre, which includes a swimming pool, has been completed and is open to the public, while those for Ballymun, Finglas, Letterkenny and Portlaoise, apart from receiving grants through the sports capital programme, plan to include swimming pools in the overall sports complex and have applied for funding to that end under the local authority swimming pool programme, which is also administered by my Department.Applications for funding under the 2004 sports capital programme will be invited at the end of the month. All applications received will be evaluated against the programme's assessment criteria, which are outlined in the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme. Following this assessment process it is likely that further municipal projects may be selected for funding.Under the local authority swimming pool programme, there are four stages in a swimming pool project, following the submission of a feasibility study. These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical adviser, the Office of Public Works, evaluates each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval is issued from my Department.The maximum grant available under the programme is €3.8 million, subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and the grant amount is capped at the time of allocation. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.The provision in my Department's 2004 Estimate for the local authority swimming pool programme is €15 million, an increase of 67% on the Estimate provision of €9 million for this year. Expenditure under the programme in 2002 was €3.9 million. It is expected that the allocation of €9 million for this year will be fully utilised.Since becoming Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in June 2002, I have approved grant aid of €13.1 million for five swimming pool projects which include one new pool, one replacement pool and three refurbishments. These projects are located in Grove Island in Limerick, Finglas in Dublin, Clonmel in County Tipperary and Tralee in County Kerry. Two of the projects are located in Tralee, namely, the Aquadome and Tralee Regional Sports and Leisure Centre.The position on the Monaghan swimming pool project is that, in February of this year, given the special circumstances arising from the enforced closure of Monaghan's only local authority pool, I decided to allow the local authority submit a proposal on a swimming pool under the current programme. A feasibility study, representing the initial phase in the process, has been submitted by Monaghan Town Council and is under consideration in my Department.The Government intends, as it committed in An Agreed Programme for Government, to put in place a long-term strategic plan to ensure the development of sports facilities throughout the country. The first step in this process has commenced with a review of the sports capital programme under the Department's expenditure review programme. The purpose of this review is to establish what has been achieved under this programme in recent years with a view to identifying gaps in the existing provision and procedures and setting priorities for the future. The expenditure review will be completed by the end of this year.A similar review of the local authority swimming pool programme has recently commenced and the results of both will feed into the overall strategic plan for the provision of sports facilities.

I appreciate what he has said so far. I did not want to take all the credit for tomorrow's meeting in advance.Given the Government's commitment to invest in sports facilities, particularly at local level, and its recognition that clubs of all codes remain the backbone of Irish sport, how far has the programme advanced and has any national audit been carried out? We are a quarter of the way into the Government's term of office and one would have expected that any action that was to take place would have taken place by now. We had a pool in Monaghan for 29 years and it is now closed and in a state of disrepair. We need grant aid for it. What is the position nationally?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	144	Nationally, there has been a great increase in the money made available for sport. A sum of €17 million was made available in 1997 while this year's budget is in the order of €176 million. Everybody would agree that this is a substantial and welcome step forward.On the provision of sports facilities nationally, a review is being carried out to assess needs, identify gaps that require filling and see where we can enhance the programme. It is anticipated that this audit will be completed in a professional manner and will allow for a correct overview of the situation. It is true that there is a need for such an audit. There are often complaints to the effect that one area was successful in providing a facility and another was not. It is important that we have an idea of where facilities are required and that we then move to put them in place. We expect the results of the audit to be very informative.

When one provides amenities such as sports facilities and swimming pools in small towns, it makes them more desirable places in which to live. Children must be taken off the streets in these towns. There is a great chance that they will use the facilities if they are put in place.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	146	The idea behind the CLÁR programme was to achieve the objective which Deputy Connolly has set out. In addition, the RAPID programme assists in the same way in urban centres. Over the years we have sought to ensure that the money was spread as evenly as possible. To give the Deputy an idea of how successful this has been, in 1998, for example, the allocation nationally under the sports capital grant programme was €7,554,942 and the average grant was €30,711. This year, the funding allocated was €53,136,000 and the average grant was €85,981. To date, 3,522 grants have been made available across the country.Although I admit that, from year to year, one area may say another was successful while it was not, on balance we are achieving the kind of equilibrium that was originally envisaged for the scheme. Small towns are being provided with facilities they could not have envisaged five years ago.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	147	I have already expressed my determination to ensure that the excellent work of the tourism policy review group is capitalised upon and the momentum generated by the in-depth focus on the tourism industry continues apace in the development of the tourism sector over the coming decade.The review group emphasised the need for an agenda for action, highlighting some 70 concrete actions that should be pursued within the first two year rolling plan. Its recommendations are directed not only to my Department, the tourism State agencies and other Departments but also, perhaps more importantly, to representatives of the tourism industry and individual tourism enterprises. Restoring competitiveness is regarded as the major challenge facing the industry in the years ahead.The report recognises that competitiveness is not just about pricing but that it must be a function of the overall Irish tourism experience for customers relative to other locations, beginning with their initial inquiries about visiting Ireland through to their travelling here, where they go when they arrive, where they stay, who they meet, what they do, what they see, and their perceptions about price and quality.One of the key messages of the report is that an increasingly high proportion of visitors have expressed concerns about competitiveness, and the industry should recognise that it has primary responsibility for offering better value to its customers if it is to maximise the opportunities for future growth.There is no immediate, single or easy solution. Having identified competitiveness and value for money as one of the key strategic drivers of success for Irish tourism, the review group listed some ten specific actions to deliver the strategy. These require responses from both the private and public sectors, and they include proposals on taking responsibility for restoring competitiveness, inflation, benchmarking, customer relations, management capability, high standards for competitive advantage and training.None of the ten specific recommendations on competitiveness listed in the report is directed to me or my Department. However, my primary role is to ensure that a coherent action plan is implemented quickly and effectively. To this end, and on receiving the report from the chairman of the review group, I have made a commitment to establish a small high level implementation group to drive forward and monitor the action plan. Earlier this month, I received the considered response of the key industry representative group, the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation, to the report and, more recently, its views on the shape of the implementation group. I am considering these and hope to be in a position shortly to announce the membership of the group.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	The Minister will agree that the competitiveness of the tourism industry has been decimated. We are now the second most expensive of the 15 European Union member states, whereas we were the fifth least expensive country in 1999. The main reason for this change has been increased Government taxation. Our hotel VAT rate, at 13.5%, is the second highest in the eurozone. The equivalent rates in France, Spain and Portugal are 5.5%, 7% and 5%, respectively. We also have the highest wine tax, second highest beer tax and third highest tax on spirits in Europe, while our insurance premiums have increased six times faster than other European countries. All these increases have been influenced by the Government. Will the Minister give the House a commitment that the problem of Government taxes will be addressed in the budget, which offers a real opportunity to restore the competitiveness of the tourism industry? What plans does the Minister for Finance have to restore competitiveness in the budget? I noted that the Minister, in an interview with a national newspaper, recommended that VAT rates be frozen this year.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	149	Given his considerable experience as a Member of the House, Deputy Deenihan will not expect me to read the Minister for Finance's budget speech on a Tuesday afternoon in November. I can, however, address in a provisional manner some of the questions he raised. Since becoming Minister, I have repeatedly addressed the question of competitiveness, which we need to improve. One only had to attend the World Travel Market 2003 in London last week to see the number of new competitors which have entered the marketplace. We are under no illusions in this regard. Tourism is a tough environment and competitiveness is the key to attracting a greater number of visitors.The fall in inflation to 2.3% is welcome. We must avoid talking ourselves into a crisis or depression, particularly in light of the fact that tourism numbers, against a difficult backdrop, look like they will increase by more than 3% this year, which is a great tribute to the resilience of the industry and testament to the value of the 20% increase in marketing funding made available to Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte.As Deputy Deenihan correctly pointed out, insurance is a serious problem for the industry and must be addressed. The issue is targeted by the review group and Fáilte Ireland is working as a priority to find ways to help businesses reduce their cost base and make them more competitive and profitable. As a first step, Fáilte Ireland has commissioned risk and insurance specialists to gather, with the assistance of the representative groups, all data on premiums and claims experienced across the sector, from bed and breakfast providers to restaurants and hotels. Drilling down into this data will give the organisation the information it requires to engage in informed dialogue with insurers to address the massive hikes in premiums since 2000. It has been estimated that this approach could deliver savings of up to one third for tourism enterprises in time for the 2004 season.The industry is also becoming increasingly price conscious in terms of delivering value for money for visitors. Although the industry has listened to me, Opposition spokespersons, other Deputies and others, it is difficult for it to deliver the kind of value of money to which we all aspire when it is faced with rising costs in areas such as insurance. I expect the first phase of Fáilte Ireland's project to be completed by December and I hope it will be successful in its efforts to reduce insurance premiums for the sector.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Our inflation rate is still twice the European Union average. We must also take into account the recent appreciation of the euro by 18.9% against the dollar and 11.7% against sterling, which reduces the competitiveness of holidays here in our two main markets.On the issue of local authority charges, it is obvious that local authorities will have to increase charges twofold or more to pay the cost of benchmarking. This will impose a major burden on the tourism industry which pays most of the rates and charges levied in rural counties. There is a case for the Government to provide funding to cover the costs of benchmarking incurred by local authorities. Failure to do so would force up local authority charges and increase costs for the tourism industry.It has been confirmed that those involved in the tourism sector are making less profit now than five years ago. Significant discounting is taking place across the industry in an effort to maintain cashflow. Despite an increase in visitors, revenue will decrease this year, by a substantial amount in some cases. Various local authorities will soon strike new rates, refuse charges and water charges. Increases are inevitable to cover the cost of the benchmarking payment. On behalf of the tourism industry, I ask the Minister to make a special case to the Cabinet that central funds be used to cover some of this cost, which the Government imposed on local authorities.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	151	As the Estimates have been published, there is no point in revisiting them. Moreover, issues related to local authorities are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The tourism review group's excellent report makes more than 70 recommendations. I will ensure that the group's proposals, in so far as they affect my Department and the agencies within its remit, will be implemented. In addition, we are pursuing the active implementation of the other recommendations through a high level implementation group which will be formed in the coming weeks. It is the intention of the implementation group to report within six months and to hold a forum one year after submitting its report to identify progress in implementing the expert group's report. This is a two year rolling plan and I anticipate that the review group's report will be largely implemented and will make a substantial contribution to the development of tourism.Ancillary matters such as charges are, unfortunately, a matter for other Ministers. I am conscious, however, of the need to keep charges as low as possible. The Deputy should note that in an attitude of visitors survey carried out in 2002, only 4% of those questioned were not satisfied with their holiday experience here, which speaks volumes for the industry and the product.

I have also made no secret of my view that the section 481 scheme is important for the maintenance of a viable film industry. I am in dialogue with the Minister for Finance on all of the issues arising in this context. These discussions will take account of all relevant inputs, including the detailed recommendations of the joint committee and the PricewaterhouseCoopers report jointly commissioned by my Department and the Irish Film Board, which is being considered in the Department of Finance.The joint committee highlighted the problem of abuse and while we must be careful not to tar the legitimate majority with the same brush as the abusing minority, I share its concern. We can no longer afford to have such an important industry threatened by people who refuse to abide by the rules and we will root them out. I do not wish to comment further on the details of the committee's recommendations until my discussions with the Minister for Finance have concluded.

They were the result of all-party agreement in the committee. I went slightly further in the committee by asking that section 481 be extended further than the three years recommended by the committee to ensure continuity and certainty. Is the Minister of the view that we should extend this provision over a longer term so it will not arise again in three years, should the committee's recommendations be accepted?The other suggestion I made in the committee was that instead of examining the cap on investment, consideration should be given to an immediate doubling of the cap in the overall review of section 481 suggested by the committee. An immediate increase in the cap would encourage the making of more films in Ireland. Does the Minister believe it is logical to encourage 3,000 students to undertake film industry courses when there is no certainty that there will be jobs for them when they complete their studies? Many of them will have to emigrate to find work if section 481 is ended.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	Section 481 was one of the most innovative proposals for the film industry to emanate from Europe for many decades. It has served the Irish film industry well. It ensured that the industry prospered and grew to its current level where it employs approximately 4,500 people. The industry has gone from strength to strength. Indigenous Irish film making has been underpinned by the efforts of the Irish Film Board in recent years and I was glad to provide a substantial increase of 9% in the board's funding for next year in the Estimates for my Department.Section 481 has benefited the Irish film industry. The question is where we go from here. The Minister for Finance deemed it necessary to announce, in last year's budget, the termination of the scheme as of end December 2004. It is important to examine the reasons for that decision and to acknowledge that there were reasons for it. There is little doubt that there has been abuse of the scheme and if I were to ignore that, it would signal the certain end of section 481. I and the Irish Film Board commissioned a report from PricewaterhouseCoopers on the effect of section 481 on the film industry and specifically on whether it was of benefit to the general economy. I forwarded this document to the Minister for Finance and he is giving it his consideration at present. It is my intention to meet the Minister again soon to discuss the matter.The Deputy asked about an extension of time for section 481. Film makers plan their films far in advance and it is important that they have a long lead-in period. The longer they have to plan their project, the better. In that context, the longer the period of extension for section 481, the greater prospects there are for attracting high budget feature films. There is a strong argument for increasing the cap of €10,480,000 on the amount that may be invested under section 481. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh in that respect. If the cap were increased, there would be a greater probability of attracting higher budget films to Ireland. That, in turn, would have a positive ripple effect on the economy generally and an unquantifiable benefit in so far as advertising the country on a broader stage is concerned.I am particularly glad that young people have chosen in recent years to get involved in the exciting film industry. I would be saddened if they were discouraged from doing so as a result of the termination of the section 481 relief. The Minister for Finance has made his case about section 481 in a fair way. He has been careful to listen to the industry and to what I have had to say about it. This dialogue, in the context of consideration of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report, will continue. I do not believe it is the intention of the Minister for Finance to destroy the film industry or to see it retrench. However, he has a duty to the taxpayer to ensure that if reliefs are given, they are not abused by unscrupulous people to the detriment of the majority who have dedicated their lives to a thriving Irish film industry.

I wish the Minister well in his continued dialogue with the Minister for Finance. I look forward to publication of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report as soon as possible so we will then be aware of its contents and the information on which the Minister will base his final decision. There is a significant link between the arts and tourism sectors and the film industry. It is a pity the section 481 relief is within the remit of the Department of Finance because I believe this Minister would be more favourable towards its retention over a longer period. Has a study been carried out on the loss of revenue for small areas which have been deserted by tourists and which are now dependent on films being made there? I have in mind areas in Wicklow and around Dingle, which have benefited occasionally from film making when the tourism industry is collapsing.

However, far from retrenching, the film industry and the number of film projects in Ireland have been growing, and I sincerely hope this growth will be allowed to continue.

With regard to the recommendations directed at my Department and the State tourism agencies, a number of the actions are already underway. The tourism unit of the Department has been reconfigured, advertisements seeking expressions of interest in the national conference centre have been placed in the media and bilateral consultations have taken place with the Department of Finance on taxation issues and with the Department of Health and Children on the anti-smoking regulations.I have been advised that Fáilte Ireland is taking account of the relevant recommended actions and suggested timescales, set out in the report of the review group, in its operational planning for the remainder of this year and next year. In addition, Fáilte Ireland has announced a new initiative to address the cost of insurance across the sector in co-operation with industry representative groups, including the Irish Hotels Federation and the Restaurants Association of Ireland. Similarly, Tourism Ireland Limited has completed an examination of the recommendations in the report that impact on areas within its remit, and has incorporated a number of these into its three year marketing strategy and detailed operating plan for 2004.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	The Minister will shortly enter what will probably be the most important period of his term of office when Ireland takes over the Presidency of the EU. What aspect of the Presidency will be helpful in overcoming our difficulties with competitiveness and the perception that Ireland is an expensive country for tourists etc.? As many important meetings will be held in Ireland, it will be an ideal opportunity to portray Ireland as a tourism attraction within the EU. How can the Minister and other members of the Cabinet use their position to portray Ireland in a positive light? Have there been meetings on portraying Ireland in a positive light as we prepare for what will be the most important six months in the lifetime of the Government and during the Minister's term of office as Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I am pleased Deputy Wall has addressed this question because the first six months of next year, during which Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union, represents an ideal opportunity to portray Ireland in the most positive manner possible on the European stage. In that context, we are currently formulating a comprehensive cultural programme which will illustrate the best of Irish traditional culture. This means 1 May will be a very special day when we will celebrate the accession of ten new countries to the European Union. I have written to ten towns throughout Ireland, through their councils, requesting they participate on that day in the celebrations. I have offered to make funding available to the towns in question to the tune of approximately €50,000 each. It will culminate on the evening in question in a major concert in Dublin which I trust will be relayed by RTE television and through the European Broadcasting Union across the European Union.In addition, we have planned various other cultural events and exhibitions. Some of these will take place in Brussels and others will take place in Ireland. I am pleased the Presidency coincides with the Bloomsday Festival which will commence in April and continue to the end of August, climaxing on 16 June 2004, when major celebrations are planned in and around Dublin. This is a comprehensive cultural programme which will portray Ireland in the most positive light possible. There is a relatively generous allocation from the Department of Finance, through the good graces of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy. We will take the opportunity of holding forth all that is good and great about Ireland.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	In response to Deputy Ó Snodaigh, the Minister said he was having discussions with the Minister for Finance regarding section 481. In a similar response to my previous question he said he would not pre-empt the budget. Is this a contradiction? Given that one of the recommendations of this fine report is that the Government should tackle VAT and excise duties, there is an onus on the Minister and the Minister for Finance to do something in the budget about this issue. If there is a clear implementation strategy and timeframe surely it must begin with the budget. This whole exercise will be futile unless there is a response to excise duty and VAT in the budget.A strong recommendation has been made in the report on human resources. Will the Minister outline his policy on the development of human resources in the tourism industry given that many of our personnel are brought into this country because of a lack of chefs, receptionists and other expertise?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The Deputy must be brief.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The Minister said the national conference centre is one of the facilities he has put in place. There was an announcement in one of yesterday's newspapers that a private investor is going ahead with a conference facility which will cater for approximately 16,000 people. Given that the Minister's conference centre will cater for approximately 2,000 people, is it a waste of a resource if this fine facility goes ahead in Dublin? I would like his views on going ahead with a facility that will cater for just 2,000 people when a private investor will cater for 16,000 people, including other ancillary facilities?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	163	On the issue of the conference centre, I cannot prevent anyone in the private sector from bringing forward proposals, obtaining planning permission and constructing a conference centre or any other edifice. However, I want to be clear about one thing, the Government is proceeding with the construction of a national conference centre. It has been advertised and we are awaiting expressions of interest. I anticipate this conference centre will be worth in excess of €50 million to the tourism industry in the greater Dublin area in years to come. The objective is to try to have the conference centre completed by the end of 2007.On indirect taxes, it is important to point out that Ireland is one of the lowest taxed economies in Europe. This is due in the main to the good work of the Minister for Finance since 1997, which should be acknowledged. In addition, corporation tax at 12.5% is extremely low. Tax on business generally is low compared to other countries.On section 481 and the budget, given that I could not give Deputy Deenihan any promises in regard to indirect taxes, neither could I give Deputy Ó Snodaigh any guarantees or promises in regard to section 481, so there is no contradiction.Deputy Deenihan's question on the recruitment of young people into the tourism industry is tremendously important. There are a number of areas where Fáilte Ireland can play a key role in this regard. In so far as training courses are concerned, it is important that Fáilte Ireland should make it an objective that graduates from Fáilte Ireland operate or support courses which are proficient in the use and application of new technologies in the industry. In regard to recruitment itself, it has been recognised that we should establish a tourism career promotions group comprising key stakeholders, including students, to formulate a national recruitment plan designed to strengthen linkages with schools, communities and career guidance services.

He may recall in September 2002 when he looked for similar expressions of interest for the national stadium that what he received was not attractive. Regarding expressions of interest in this instance, what will be the Government's input? Will this facility be solely built by the private sector or will it be a public private partnership? If he does not receive expressions of interest, will he go ahead in some other form with the national conference centre?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	165	To say the least, I expect the expressions of interest to be far more interesting in the sense that the successful bidder will be guaranteed a customer, which will be the State. In other words, the State will lease the conference centre from the successful tenderer. It is intended that the conference centre will be built in its entirety by the private sector. It is true that the State may retain, in the course of negotiations, an option to purchase the entire centre at a given date in the future. For example, during my time as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Midlands Prison was constructed and financed by the private sector. It was leased back to the State and the State had an option to purchase, which worked very well. This scheme, which I admit is relatively complicated in terms of its legal definitions and so on, can work equally well.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 89, 92, 93, 100, 109, 113 and 114 together.Deputies will be aware that the council will receive funding of €52.5 million in 2004, a 19% increase in 2004 on 2003 funding levels. This level of funding clearly demonstrates the extent of the Government's commitment to the arts. This allocation took account of all pertinent factors, including the views expressed by the Arts Council in advance of the publication of the Book of Estimates.The reduction in funding for the Arts Council in 2003 was a direct function of the far more difficult conditions that applied in the economy generally and especially in the public finances. I am well aware of the difficulties that have arisen for those in the arts sector because of the unavoidable decisions that had to be taken by the Arts Council as a consequence of the reduction in funding this year. However, I point out that, although the Arts Council's funding was reduced this year by around 7.5% on the 2002 figure, that 2002 figure was the culmination of steady year on year increases since 1997. Arts Council funding increased by more than 80% between 1997 and 2002.The arts plan is a council, not a Government, strategy, and although the Government endorsed the principles on which the plan was based, this endorsement did not extend to commitment to the annual financial targets set out in the plan. The amount that the Government can provide for the Arts Council is dependent on the Estimates process, which is based on an annual cycle. This system cannot accommodate multi-annual commitments because the availability of funds are known with any certainty for only one year in advance.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	167	Will the Minister accept that 1,000 jobs have been lost due to cuts in the allocation of funding to the Arts Council for 2003? That is a frightening figure for the Arts Council, although it did not give a breakdown of the sectors involved. That is a huge loss to the sector. This reflects also on the tourism industry given that many of the jobs are in entertainment and different sectors of the arts. Does the Minister accept that 1,000 jobs have been lost and, if so, has the Arts Council informed him of the sectors involved? What efforts can the Minister make through his Department in terms of the funding available to rectify the matter in the coming year?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Deputy Wall is correct when he asserts that there were job losses as a result of the reduction in Arts Council funding last year. I have always been clear on the point that there was a great deal of disappointment in the arts sector about the 8% reduction in funding last year. It is a matter of which I am acutely aware. Throughout the year I availed of the opportunity to meet those involved in the arts sector. I have rarely met a group as enthusiastic or as excited in terms of their profession.I am especially pleased that we succeeded in increasing the funding to the Arts Council by 19% which, in all probability, is the largest increase provided to any agency in the State for 2004. It is my sincere wish that this funding will lead to an expansion of the arts. I hope those who were unfortunate to lose their jobs as a result of the cuts last year will regain employment. I look forward to working with the sector for its betterment in the coming year.

In other words, the chairperson and the Arts Council have made it clear to applicants that they will be extremely transparent in the disbursal of funds. This is welcome. If there has been a disparity and if, as Deputy Stanton said, some negative discrimination, I hope it will be corrected in that context.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	172	We now have three major reports on reform of the health system – Prospectus, Brennan and Hanly. On 15 October the Minister for Health and Children announced that the Government had endorsed the Hanly report as Government policy and would implement in full its recommendations. Last week the Minister for Defence openly defied the Government's decision not once, not twice but three times, like Peter in the Garden of Gethsemane.Last week the Taoiseach qualified the Government's support for Hanly with obscure references to geographics and demographics. Last week's Estimates contained an 8% reduction in capital expenditure in the health services. This clearly means that the hospitals in the designated regions cannot expect significant improvements in 2004. Last weekend, following a massive demonstration in Ennis, the Taoiseach committed himself and the Government to consultation with local communities before Hanly is fully implemented, which he suggested would take about ten years.Communities throughout the country and of whatever persuasion are fearful of services in their local hospitals being removed, downgraded or dismantled. They receive confusing and conflicting messages from the Taoiseach, as leader of the Government, and from members of the Cabinet who support the report in Dublin and oppose it in the country.It is time we had clarity from the Head of Government on the status of the Hanly report. Is it now Government policy and is it to be implemented in full? How is it to be implemented if there is no money in the Estimates for 2004? Is the Taoiseach not aware that this is causing outrage throughout the country because of the genuine fears and concerns of thousands of people who fear their local service will be removed, dismantled and gone forever? Is the Hanly report Government policy and, if so, how will it be implemented? What is the Taoiseach doing about the comments from members of the Cabinet on the issue?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	175	The Government is willing to undertake a radical reform programme for the health service. Having spent considerable time on them, we have now produced three expert reports – Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly. These are comprehensive reports which were researched in recent years. In all of these reports we are putting the patients first so they can receive the right treatment in the right place at the right time. Our commitment to health care is quite clear with increases of almost 200% since 1997. The Hanly report about which Deputy Kenny asked this afternoon will mean a better service for patients. It means a consultant-provided service that harnesses the contribution to all our hospitals enabling a wide range of appropriate services and procedures to be provided in local hospitals. It makes specific recommendations for two regions, for reorganising hospitals on the east coast and in the mid-west, and the reports set out the principles for the national organisation of hospital services. They propose measures to reduce doctors' hours and to improve medical education and training as part of the European working time directive. In pilot areas 300 meetings were held and 600 staff were consulted.

That is in phase 1. In phase 2, Mr. Hanly and his group are to look at other areas of the country. That work has not commenced yet. It will take place in the future but I do not have the timescale on that. Local groups will also be able to make an input. All of this forms part of the overall health reform agenda for which everybody has been calling because everyone says that we have put in the staff, the resources and the capital programme but we also have to deal with the reform agenda. The hospital service executive group is being set up at present. A senior person and persons to form that group will be announced within days.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	183	I will be brief. That group will drive the operation of this whether it be the Hanly, Prospectus or Brennan report. As set out in the report there will also be a hospital services office that will link directly to the Hanly report and there will be the steering group for the overall plan. These are the main elements and groups which will drive the agenda. For people who say that the Hanly report said this or that about different parts of the country, I emphasise that Hanly made his report on two areas. A project implementation group will be set up in those areas. Individuals, groups and communities in those areas will be allowed to report. Hanly has not moved on to stage 2, which is the rest of the country, and I hope that is clear.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	The problem with the Taoiseach's reply is that one cannot believe anything from the mouth of this Government. There was the Prospectus report, the Brennan report, whose author complained twice about it not being implemented, and now the Hanly report and no money contained in the Estimates, if it is Government policy. I am glad to see that the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, is here because he said the people of north Tipperary should not be sacrificed on the altar of Hanly yet he is quite prepared to sacrifice Deputy Hoctor on the altar of Hanly. There is a distinct difference between the view of Deputy Hoctor and those of the Taoiseach and Deputy Michael Smith on this.When one looks at the unit in Blanchardstown which is not opened, the community care facility in Birr for 90 beds costing €20 million which is not opened, the scandal of Mullingar hospital which is unfinished for the last seven years, one cannot believe what this Government says. If the Taoiseach qualifies the Hanly report by saying consultation in respect of geographics and demographics will take place, does that mean there will be an accident and emergency unit in Nenagh and Ennis hospitals after his Government has implemented the Hanly report? Does it mean that the qualifications of geographics and demographics are going to save the other hospitals around the country? When the people start to march this time they will be unstoppable. The Taoiseach should not take away from people a service to which they have grown accustomed. Given the state of the roads in many areas he should not put that burden or pressure on them or unfortunately tragedy will result. If the Government wants to put its money where its mouth is, let us see in the Estimates where the money will be for the super-regional facilities. The Taoiseach will have left politics in ten years, as he has often said, and Hanly will not have been implemented. Is it a dead duck or not and will geographics and demographics save Nenagh, Ennis and Portiuncula and all the other hospitals? That is what the people want to know.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	As the reform agenda states, local hospitals will continue to cater for minor injuries and illnesses and for the high percentage of patients who attend accident and emergency departments. Emergencies will be catered for by well-trained ambulance staff who can provide immediate treatment and bring the patient to the hospital best equipped to provide high-quality care.Implementation of these proposals is under way. As I have already stated the membership of the expert group to prepare the plan for the national reorganisation of acute hospital services phase 2 will be announced shortly. It has not started. Submissions will be taken from interest groups. The project groups for the east coast and the mid-west are in preparation and will have a special responsibility to take full account of local geographic and demographic factors as the reports state in dealing with and progressing these proposals.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I want to raise with the Taoiseach the savage 16 cuts in social welfare announced last week. A senior citizen came into my clinic last Saturday, a man who retired on a modest pension three years ago. He is a coeliac and he explained that his cost of living will increase three and a half times its present level when the dietary allowance is phased out. How can the Taoiseach justify the Minister for Finance taking advantage of the well-intentioned Minister for Social and Family Affairs and cutting her budget for the weakest and most vulnerable in society by €58 million at the same time as he increases the allocation for horse racing to €67 million?Among the savage 16 cuts are cuts in the housing rental supplement which will literally put people onto the streets; the phasing out of the dietary allowance for people like the man who called to see me on Saturday; the cutting back of unemployment benefit by 11 weeks, even where people have PRSI stamps; the cutting of the back to education allowance for people trying to get a pathway out of their circumstances into third level education; the cutting of the MABS supplement, where the service for people approaching the Money Advice Bureau Service to broker a settlement with creditors is now cut, which will result in those people being driven into the army of moneylenders.How can the Taoiseach justify cuts of €58 million for the weakest in our society when €67 million will be made available, most of it in prize money, for the diversion of tax exiles in the racing industry? How can the Taoiseach justify the attack on lone parents contained in the cuts of €58 million? How can he justify the situation in community employment in circumstances where we have the most expensive community employment scheme, costing €67 million, for the delectation of those who will not even pay their taxes in this society? I do not include in that €67 million the 100% gift of €15 million arranged by the Punchestown duo, Ministers McCreevy and Walsh, for a facility that we now find is not large enough for the purposes for which it was constructed.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	The Estimates are before the House today and a number of my colleagues, including the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, will be going through them in detail. I will say a few words about the Estimates for the Department of Social and Family affairs. The Estimate that will be before the House is one of €10.65 billion, an increase of €355 million over last year. It is almost double what it was just a few years ago, in spite of unemployment figures falling to 4.4%, half the European Union average. This does not take into account increases that will be announced on budget day.The social welfare spending represents year on year increases under this Government from only a few years ago when the figure was only €7.8 billion. The increases over the period have been largely directed into improving the rates of payment in line with the Government commitments. An estimated 970,000 people on average are expected to claim social welfare payments. The Government has reduced the poverty levels across all areas and categories of social welfare. We have targeted any measures that we have into areas which the Minister will be very glad to deal with. I can go through the back to education allowances, the lone parent allowances and the rent subsidy allowance mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte. There are five measures directed mainly to ensuring that rent supplements are paid in appropriate circumstances in accordance with established policy, taking account of the objectives of the policy—

The Minister in her schedule and her contribution to the House will give the full details.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	217	The diet supplement mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte is being phased out over a number of years. The supplement has become outdated in the context of real increases in social welfare payments in the past number of years.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	220	It reduces the necessity for these narrow top-ups. In some cases the diet allowance top-ups are 42 cents per week. I am not too sure what case Deputy Rabbitte is referring to but these are the figures. If he can dispute these figures he may do so with the Minister. They are very small top-ups to the scheme. If a person has an exceptional need, and there is such a case as Deputy Rabbitte mentioned, the person can still put his or her case to community welfare officers.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	221	The Taoiseach should not shift the issue to the community welfare officers.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	227	Deputy Stagg will not lecture me because I remember the kind of paltry increases that his party approved. The figure of £2.74 will be remembered, and the tiny increases given by the leader of the party of which Deputy Rabbitte was a then member. We are not going to listen to that. The reality now is that substantial increases are being given across the ranges to the less well off, and in the areas where the Minister has tried to deal with the system and rid it of abuses which should not be there, she has allowed for measures to assist people in need.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	234	Deputy Stagg has stated quite clearly that he believes all the people in the racing industry should lost their jobs. That is what he has stated and now we know what his policy is in Kildare.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I hope the Taoiseach is not suggesting that the dietary allowance is a means of abuse. The gentleman I mentioned, who is 67 or 68 years old, explained to me that it is not just bread and the essentials of life he has to order from his chemist, but even cornflakes. He tells me the cost per week will be three and a half times what it was.Taking another example, a person must rent for six months before getting the rent allowance. How does the Taoiseach propose that people who are destitute, who cannot get public housing, can rent from one of his Fianna Fáil-supporting landlords in 2003, and find a deposit? How will they do that? If, when such people go to the community welfare officer, their parents have paid their rent for the first six months, and not many are in those circumstances, the officer will say that if the person had means for the first six months, then under the rules and guidelines that person has means for the next six months.So it goes on, right through the 16 cuts. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs was taken advantage of by a Minister who himself became famous for the dirty dozen cuts, the same Minister who makes an annual grant to the horse racing industry that is now worth €40 for every visit by a punter to a race meeting in Ireland.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	236	Deputy Rabbitte—
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The Ceann Comhairle did not interrupt the Taoiseach and let him run for a long time.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The Chair pointed out to the Taoiseach that his time was up.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Yes, the Chair did so. If the GAA were to get €40 for the four million people who attend its games annually, it would be getting a grant of €160 million per annum. It is the richest tax exiles who play with the prize money that is put through the hypothecated 2% betting tax. That comes to €67 million, and the Taoiseach forced the Minister for Social and Family Affairs to cut €58 million from the most vulnerable in our society, people who have no voice, who in the main do not vote, without whose votes the Taoiseach has decided he can get re-elected. It is a disgrace and a shame and it will long run in this House until he re-thinks it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I said that the diet supplement is being phased out over a number of years. I did not say it was abolished. I said that the small top-ups are as low as 42 cent. I also stated that if a person has a case, it is still at the discretion of the community welfare officer to decide. In relation to the rent supplement measures, I stated that there were five measures to ensure that rent supplements are paid in appropriate circumstances in accordance with established policy and taking account of the objectives of the SWA scheme, which will focus on meeting immediate short-term rather than long-term housing needs. The health boards will retain the discretion they currently have to make exceptions in individual cases if the circumstances warrant it.I also stated that 970,000 people are expected to claim social welfare payments under the headings of child benefit, old age contributory pension, widowed person's pension, disability allowance and supplementary welfare allowance. Significant increases have been made in those areas. The Minister has provided €10.5 billion and has put forward proposals to ensure more focused methods. She has allowed a means where those with a genuine case can appeal a decision in a fair manner—
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The Taoiseach set up the Minister.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Today we now understand what the Taoiseach means when he says that a Minister totally, totally supports Government policy. It seems "totally, totally" is the Government's equivalent of double yellow lines in traffic law, meaning very little until a few offenders are clamped. Will the Taoiseach say who it is he totally, totally supports on the issue of including waste incinerators in the national infrastructure bill?In The Irish Times last Saturday, it was reported that Ministers are at odds over fast-track planning, “McDowell and Cullen on collision course over proposals to include waste incinerators in new legislation”. The Taoiseach unveiled at a Fianna Fáil Ard Fheis the idea of a fast-track planning system to further remove accountability in the planning process. This comes on top of the removal of powers from councillors to decide on matters of infrastructure and the imposition of prohibitive charges for submissions by ordinary people in the course of planning applications and appeals. Will the Taoiseach tell the House, the Minister, Deputy McDowell, the Tánaiste – who I am sure would like to be informed – and the Progressive Democrats if incineration is to be part of the new Bill to be unveiled before Christmas? The Progressive Democrats view on this issue was delivered quite emotionally last Thursday at a meeting in Sandymount by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It would be appreciated if the Taoiseach could give the House the Fianna Fáil view and clear the matter up.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	244	As I stated recently, the legislation on infrastructure which aims to move some major national projects forward is under discussion in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It will be brought to Cabinet in due course. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the office of environmental enforcement within the EPA is working to secure enforcement of environmental legislation and to provide better resources for local authority environmental enforcement. This is working very well. The delivery of necessary waste infrastructure is being speeded up at regional level and is progressing well. The establishment of new structures to provide waste prevention, minimising and recycling and to promote the development of markets for recyclable material is progressing very well. New producer responsibility initiatives are being introduced for end-of-life vehicles, tyres, electrical equipment and construction demolition waste and this is progressing very well. It is hoped to publish a national biodegradable waste strategy in 2003. I thank the Deputy for his support in all those areas.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Taoiseach will forgive us for not taking his reply very seriously, given that the Estimates provide for a 32% cut in EPA funding. It is difficult to foresee how the EPA will undertake those projects.I am aware that the Taoiseach consults widely before taking any decisions, if he takes any action at all. We witnessed the case of the great survivor, the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, who is smiling in his seat beside the Taoiseach.

The Minister, Deputy McDowell, became very upset last Thursday at the public meeting and told my colleague, Deputy Gormley, and many others that the Ringsend incinerator is contrary to Government policy. Will the Taoiseach therefore assure the House that the proposal for incineration as proposed in Ringsend and in other sites around the country is effectively dead in the water, given that forensic analysis by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Will the Taoiseach say whether the proposal for mass incineration or the Minister is dead in the water?

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to debate the following urgent matter: to discuss the report of the Sub-Committee on EU Scrutiny which referred an EU Council proposal for a decision on embryo research and the funding of embryo research by all member states to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which under the scrutiny procedures agreed by the Oireachtas has recommended against the Government supporting the proposed decision of the Council. In view of the fact that the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, has indicated that she will vote in favour of the proposal without any detailed explanation to or approval from the Dáil when this matter is raised again at the Council of Ministers' meeting on 27 November 2003, it is urgent that the Dáil call the Tánaiste to account and that the matter be considered.

I am grateful to the Taoiseach and the Chief Whip for the reports that are coming back from committees. The report dealing with Nos. 14 and 15 from the committee chaired by Deputy Ardagh, however, recommends that there should be no further debate on the motions by Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann. A committee reporting back to the Houses should not recommend that the Dáil or Seanad should not have further discussion if Members think otherwise.

Will the Taoiseach indicate when legislation will be amended or introduced to deal with fines imposed in other EU member states to give compliance to the framework decision? The background note stresses that changes in legislation will be necessary.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I thank the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Ardagh, for his report but I support the point Deputy Kenny made about the Government-inspired closure of the report. The House should tell the committees that we do not want a recommendation on the discussion of reports – that is a matter for the House to decide. This is a Government-inspired element in all reports, not just that of Deputy Ardagh, who has taken the Whip as a Government committee chairman. I object to that conclusion in the report. Otherwise the report is practically useless, it contains no information. It does not state that the committee divided on the idea that the matter should not be debated. I would like to see a real report so the House has some idea of what the committee did except to say the issue was discussed. This is an important issue and time should be provided to debate it in the Oireachtas. We object to the Order of Business on the basis that this should be debated.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Green Party has no problem with No. 16, but Nos. 14, 15, 17 and 18 involve issues that must be debated, particularly Nos. 14 and 15. Although we hear about the report, for those in smaller parties who do not have representatives on all committees, it is important that the "blacks" are available to read the debate leading to the report's formulation. In such cases we do not have the "blacks" and, as a result, it is difficult to make an informed decision on these issues.Judging by the briefing note, No. 14 is objectionable because it allows for the use of legitimate force in expelling people. There are questions about how legitimate such force is and how it might be applied, and they should be debated. No. 17 should also be debated given that Jackson Way is being discussed in the news as a result of proceeds that may arise from crime.With the Defence Forces' involvement in Liberia, it is also important that we debate defence matters if we are to do our job properly. It is totally objectionable that these matters be passed without debate.

It is simply untenable that this House is being denied the opportunity to peruse the only real report of committee deliberations – a transcript of what took place at committee. As of this afternoon, and for reasons of pressure of work, the transcripts are not available and we do not have the opportunity to peruse in detail the contributions, concerns expressed and conclusions reached by members of the committee on this debate. This will facilitate shared, forced expulsions. Deputy Ardagh, or the Taoiseach on his behalf, might clarify whether this runs absolutely contrary to Article 4 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits collective expulsions. Has this matter been addressed and will it not now be addressed in the Dáil? The issue cannot be allowed to pass without full and careful scrutiny.There are two elements to No. 17, a proposition for greater EU harmonisation of judicial measures. These measures apply to every citizen of this State, as they do to other member states, so why will we allow this proposition to proceed without debate? It is like asking us to allow domestic legislation to proceed without a debate on Second Stage, and we would not accept that. Despite the assurances on EU scrutiny, we have a flawed process that must be addressed.This continuing objection on the part of Opposition spokespeople is not intended for entertainment value or to pass the time, we have repeatedly made these points but the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues refuse to take on board the valid and justifiable concerns of spokespersons. I appeal to the Taoiseach to ensure we have a more appropriate and streamlined method of addressing proposals as important as these that will have legislative effect on the daily lives of citizens.

I emphasise again that Members who are not members of committees are entitled to attend the meetings. They can put forward their views and debate them in the committees. Looking at the time slots I see that one of these issues was debated for over an hour, although I do not know the cumulative time involved. The view is put forward, particularly by Deputy Ó Caoláin, that there was no discussion. A committee is a committee of the House.

This is a new procedure and we can work out how we do it, but I think that is useful.

I dissented at the committee from the decision that the matter would come back to this House without debate in either House of the Oireachtas. That is not reflected in the minutes and it should be. I regarded the matter as a fundamental issue of policy that needed to be dealt with by the full House rather than simply being referred to a committee which would then decide whether the House should consider the matter at all.

On budget day I will set out the complete picture of the Government's economic and fiscal strategy for 2004.Before setting out the strategic focus and the aggregate content of the Estimates, I will deal with the economic context within which they were framed. Ireland has faced a much more challenging economic and business environment over the last 18 months. The economic growth projections which underpinned my last budget assumed that the generally anticipated global recovery would begin from the second half of 2003. Clearly, this did not happen at the pace we expected. As a result, in August the official economic projections for GDP growth in 2003 were revised downwards from 3.5% to 1.5%.In assessing our economic prospects and framing our spending policies we must, therefore, deal with the world as it is, not as we would wish it to be. In this regard, there are a number of key facts that are relevant to us all and that must inform our thinking. First, Ireland is part of a monetary union where monetary policy is focused on ensuring a low inflation environment, with the ECB aiming to maintain the rate of inflation at close to 2% over the medium term; second, international competition is exerting downward pressure on goods prices and is likely to continue to do so for some time to come; third, we are one of the most open economies in the world; fourth, international competition for jobs and investment is becoming much more intense all the time.Ireland's position as a small and open economy means that economic developments here are, to a large degree, determined by our ability to supply goods and services to the global economy. To ensure we can continue to compete successfully, we must strive to get our cost levels in line with the European Union as quickly as we can. The decisions made by the Government in framing the 2004 Estimates were taken in this context. They are designed to ensure we create the conditions necessary for the economy to be strongly positioned to benefit from the expected international upturn; maintain and create employment; and increase the share of wealth in the country.We did not adopt this strategy simply for the purpose of economy in spending or compliance with financial rules. The plain facts are that by creating a low inflation environment, keeping public spending increases in line with resources, keeping debt levels low and planning a coherent investment strategy we will reap strong rewards, not just in the longer term but also in a matter of a couple of years. A key element in this is ensuring a balance between the resources which the Government has at its disposal and what it spends. The exceptional economic growth in the years 1997 to 2000 enabled annual gross spending to be increased very substantially to a high point of 21% in 2001. As economic growth has moderated, we have in the interests of sound management followed a course of bringing spending increases more into line with increases in revenue.The expectations created by the experience of exceptional high growth are no longer realistic. Lower economic growth means lower revenue growth. Lower revenue acts as a constraint on what the Government can spend. As such, we must limit public spending growth to revenue growth. If we fail to do this, we risk either an early return to higher levels of taxation or excessive levels of borrowing. The Government has kept a tight rein on spending over the last 18 months to ensure this would not happen. As a result, this year we have reduced the gap between revenue and public spending growth. We need to ensure we consolidate this situation. This message of consolidation is the key message I wish to impart to the House today. We must not endanger all we have achieved since 1997 by imprudent management of the economy and the public finances. All sides of the House must recognise that spending growth must be kept at a sustainable level over the medium term. This means future annual public spending increases will have to be very close to this year's level.Based on the latest estimates as supplied by Departments the summary tables of the Estimates include 2003 forecast outturn figures. The outturn on gross spending is estimated to be higher than provided in the Revised Estimates by some €340 million. However, the additional gross spending is offset by additional receipts from the health levy, moneys recouped from the United Kingdom for health services and higher PRSI income into the social insurance fund, giving a net excess of some €115 million. Accordingly, I now expect gross spending in 2003 will increase by 7.6% over 2002 compared to annual increases of 14.4% and 20.7% in the previous two years. I acknowledge the financial discipline and control shown by my ministerial colleagues and their Departments, particularly this year, in bringing about this outcome.The measures in relation to financial management and control which I announced in last year's Estimates debate also played a key role in this regard. Particularly important was the monthly reporting to Government on expenditure trends and the requirements placed on Departments in relation to risk assessment and contingency planning to cater for unforeseen pressures.The strategy underpinning the global and sectoral allocation of resources is twofold: first, as I have indicated, to ensure the global allocation was appropriate to the total level of resources and the promotion of stable economic conditions and sound public finances, and, second, to give priority to the areas of social welfare, health, education, and infrastructure, while meeting our pay obligations under Sustaining Progress.Health, education and social welfare spending will account for 67% of total Voted spending next year. The gross allocation for the Department of Health and Children will amount to over €10 billion in 2004. Over the period 1997 to 2004 gross expenditure on health will have increased by €6.4 billion or 178%. Cumulative spending on health from 1997 to 2004 is €53,000 million while the share of total national public expenditure on health has increased from 19.2% in 1997 to 24.9% in 2004. There are now about 96,000 staff providing health services compared with 66,000 in 1997. Between 1997 and 2003, an additional 6,000 nurses have been recruited, which amounts to 22% of the total increase. A further 8,500 people, amounting to over 30% of the increase, have been recruited to the medical, dental and health and social care professional grades. This investment has, therefore, seen real improvements in the delivery of frontline health services over this period. However, we must strive ever harder to optimise value for money for the huge level of resources invested each year.The gross allocation for the Department of Education and Science will be €6.5 billion in 2004. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on education over the period 1997 to 2004 will amount to €3.3 billion, a doubling of expenditure over the period. The 2004 Estimate provides for nearly 79,000 employees, which effectively means that the pupil-teacher ratio at both primary and second levels has improved significantly in recent years. At primary level the ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 18:1 in the 2002-03 school year, while at second level the ratio has fallen from 16:1 to 13.6:1 in the same period.The lower pupil-teacher ratio means that there are now approximately 2,500 resource teachers and 1,530 learning support teachers in the primary system to enable children with special educational needs receive a proper level of educational services. There are also over 5,500 special needs assistants employed in first and second level schools to ensure that children with special educational needs in mainstream classes receive the necessary educational supports. These figures show that the increased investment in education has been translated into a higher level of frontline educational services.The gross provision for social welfare expenditure is €10.6 billion on a pre-budget basis. On this basis, spending in 2004 on social welfare will have increased by almost €5 billion since 1997. Over the same period, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10.3% to 4.4%. This represents a very significant improvement in real terms in the level of social welfare provision. For example, in 1997 the old age contributory pension was €99 per week. It is now, before any increases in budget 2004, over €157 per week. This is an increase of 59%, or 27% in real terms, on the 1997 level. The corresponding increase in the old age non-contributory pension is even greater, at 68%, or 34% in real terms. Child benefit rates have also increased substantially. In 1997 the rate for the first and second child was €38 per month. In 2003 it is €125.60, representing an increase of 231%, or 165% in real terms.The gross allocation for Exchequer capital expenditure will be €5.5 billion in 2004. When account is taken of public private partnership investment in public projects and the contribution of CIE resources to public transport investment, total capital spending on this basis will be about €5.9 billion or an increase of over €350 million, or 6%, on the figure pertaining to 2003.Since 1997 the Exchequer has invested over €33 billion in capital expenditure. Its provision is now close to 5% of GNP, as compared with 3.4% in 1997. This is twice the EU average.Turning to individual sectors, the 2004 provision for capital investment in the transport area will be €1.6 billion, an increase of €1.3 billion or 413% over 1997. Within this total, road investment has increased by €963 million or nearly 320% since 1997, and public transport investment has increased by €322 million, which is 46 times the 1997 level.The 2004 Exchequer provision for capital investment in housing will be over €1 billion, an increase of €766 million or 275% over that of 1997. This provision will be supplemented by over €650 million of non-voted capital investment by the local authorities.Health capital investment in 2004 will be €509 million, an increase of €342 million, or 205%, over 1997. Capital investment in education will be €491 million, an increase of €327 million, or 199%, since 1997.This unprecedented level of investment is funding the implementation of the infrastructural programme of the national development plan. Despite the delays and cost inflation that have affected the NDP infrastructure programme, the reality is that by the end of 2006 the plan will have brought about a very significant improvement in our economic and social infrastructure.The Estimates continue to give priority to national development plan investment, especially in the key area of infrastructure. This accords with the view articulated by the ESRI in its mid-term review of the national development plan. More generally, while the Government has differed from the ESRI's financial recommendations in some areas, the national development plan Estimates provisions are broadly in line with the ESRI's recommendations.I accept that the evaluation does contain criticisms on cost overruns and deficient management of infrastructure projects and programmes. It also points to the need to properly evaluate projects. We must strive to ensure the best value for money in the planning and evaluation of infrastructure projects.My Department is currently revising the capital appraisal guidelines for public sector capital projects and revised guidelines will be issued to Departments and public agencies. The existing guidelines remain in place and relate to the evaluation, planning and execution of capital projects.I must stress that the onus for proper appraisal and management of capital projects rests with Departments and the implementing agencies. My Department will, however, strive both in the context of the revised guidelines and otherwise to impress on Departments and implementing agencies the need for best practice in regard to evaluation and execution of capital projects.I am also in favour in principle of a multiannual system of financial envelopes for capital investment. This is recommended by the ESRI and would facilitate more efficient project and programme management by providing greater certainty as to availability of resources over a number of years. I will have more to say on these issues in my Budget Statement.The provision for Exchequer-funded public service pay and pensions is €14.2 billion, an increase of €1.1 billion, or 8%, on the figure for 2003. The increase comprises the following: the general round increases under Sustaining Progress –€540 million; the 2004 increases arising from benchmarking –€305 million; and other pay provision, including the part-time directive –€265 million. This rate of increase in the pay bill is lower than the rate of increase in any of the past four years.The largest increase is accounted for by the increases due to the general rounds under Sustaining Progress, which are 3% from 1 January 2004, 2% from 1 July 2004 and 2% from 1 December 2004. In 2003 a six-month pay pause for the public service was secured, which meant that all the increases due under Sustaining Progress are to be paid in 2004. The pay pause in 2003 saved the Exchequer about €180 million this year.The additional €305 million for benchmarking in 2004 includes about €50 million for the parallel process. This provision and the provision for the general rounds are being made on the basis that there will be verified progress on the conditions outlined in the agreement. The performance verification groups and the relevant Secretaries General have yet to finalise their work. It may be that in some cases the increases will not be paid if some grades or organisations or sectors are in breach of the conditions. However, it is prudent to make provision for the payment given its size.I am determined that, over the period to which Sustaining Progress refers, the quality of public services will improve. There has been a period of stable industrial relations and I expect this to continue. In addition, there will be benefits to taxpayers through the achievement of the modernisation objectives over the life of the agreement. The longer term benefit of the benchmarking system will be that it will force public service pay determination away from the old, illogical relativities based system towards a better system more closely tied to that which operates in the private sector.A total of €265 million of the additional pay cost is due to other factors, such as the payment of the increase due to the application of the part-time work legislation in education, an increased provision for the EU Presidency, increments, an extra pay day in 2004 for some staff and an increase in the numbers of pensioners.Between 1997 and 2002 staff numbers in the public service increased by 59,000, or 27%. I have already alluded to the improved services in health and education that these additional staff have achieved. Nonetheless, in the light of the vastly changed economic and budgetary position, I announced in last year's budget that public service numbers would be capped and would decrease by a modest 5,000 over a three year period.The Government subsequently agreed the timing and details of the reductions. In agreeing proposals in this area, the Government has endeavoured to provide that frontline service staff would not be targeted for reduction. The cap has now taken effect and a reduction of 2,000 is expected next year. The full effect of the reduction in numbers will materialise in 2005 and 2006.To summarise, the key features underpinning these Estimates are as follows: we need to consolidate in order that we can be well positioned to reap the rewards of the expected upturn in future economic growth; we must match public spending growth to revenue growth; future increases in public expenditure will have to be kept close to this year's level; the 2004 Estimates provide for an extra €1.9 billion, bringing total planned expenditure to more than €40 billion; and we continue to provide substantial resources for health, education, social welfare and infrastructure.The 2004 Estimates will enable us to sustain a healthy economy and public finance position in order that we can capitalise on an improved international economic climate. They build on the significantly expanded expenditure base of recent years and, in so doing, provide for considerable investment in the areas of health, education and social welfare. The Estimates also provide for a continued high level of investment in infrastructure to help us become more competitive over the medium term. They are the correct prescription for the economic and investment requirements of the country at this time. I commend the motion to the House.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18510	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"–notes that the 2004 Estimates for Public Services (Abridged) published by the Minister for Finance on 13th November, 2003 will provide that:–60% of the increase in current expenditure will be absorbed by increases in the Exchequer pay and pensions bill;–the payment of a further round of benchmarking will be made without a commensurate reform programme to ensure value for money is delivered;–in many Departments expenditure on non-pay subheads will decline in real terms, resulting in a reduction in the level of services provided;–inadequate provision has been made to fund the capital infrastructural requirements, especially in the transport and health areas, which are needed to build a strong economy;–further stealth taxes will be imposed on a range of State provided services, especially those under the remit of the local authorities;–the cutbacks in the social welfare area represent a further attack on families and on lone parents;–the Government's promise to recruit an additional 2,000 gardaí will not be met; and–condemns the Government's stop/start approach to the management of the public finances which has totally failed to deliver quality services to the public despite incurring record levels of expenditure in recent years."In 1997, after almost two decades of scrimping and saving to mend the problems in the public finances, this Government was handed a unique opportunity. Not only had the public finances been placed on a sound footing, but the economy was growing at 10% and employment was increasing at the rate of 1,000 jobs per week. Here was an opportunity for the Government to step up to the mark and carve out a new Ireland using the wealth we had created wisely to bring benefits to all of our people. That opportunity was spurned and, instead, the hard lessons learned during the difficult years, particularly the 1980s, were quickly forgotten. The worst excesses of rapidly developing economies were repeated due to a lack of Government wisdom. Huge sums of money were poured into unreformed systems which did not deliver value for money. Poor choices were made, as we have seen in the ESRI report, poor value was obtained and, as we have seen in the Punchestown case, proper procedures were ignored.The Government had no vision for a new Ireland and squandered the opportunity. The problem was inept leadership from a Government which worked a washed out model and was unequal to the challenges the country faced as we moved into a new millennium. The Estimates volume for this year bears the indelible marks of the legacy of soft option policy, for which people are now picking up the pieces.One will search in vain in the Estimates for radical reform or anything which would deliver better value for money. No programmes have been restructured, no bureaucracy has been dismantled and no new systems of evaluation or cost management have been introduced. No renegotiation of the benchmarking agreement has taken place in order that genuine value for money could be obtained and no organisation has been asked to compete for its budget or demonstrate what it is achieving. Instead, we have more of the same, with the Estimates presented in the same manner as every year. Despite indications given by the Minister many years ago, the House did not have a new debate.The Minister has presented the same recipe as last year, namely, more stealth taxes and cuts in infrastructural spending and a squeeze on services which will hit the most vulnerable sections of our community. The only difference is that many items of this nature are more cleverly concealed than they were a year ago. It is clear, for example, that the Minister has concealed the true extent of expenditure growth. Until today, no reference was made to the €430 million overrun in current expenditure, nor was reference made, even today, to the double payment under the benchmarking agreement last year. The two years of benchmarking payments paid last year again conceal the extent of the increase which must be found to meet this year's payment. When one adds these two items, one finds that the underlying growth in current expenditure –€2.5 billion or 8% – is much higher than the equivalent figure in last year's Estimates.The Minister has given the House an indication, based on reasonable assumptions about growth, of the capacity of the economy to raise taxation next year. His estimate of €1.9 billion means he is already committed in his Estimates to spending €600 million more than is likely to be generated in additional tax revenue, which will, I presume, be yielded through unchanged taxation rates. If one adds to this figure a minimal social welfare package, one arrives at a figure of €1.2 billion in excess of what the tax base will generate next year. It appears that the Messiah of low taxation has switched to the other side. There is no doubt, however, that he will save his blushes by doing the type of things with which we are now familiar, namely, increasing indirect and stealth taxes, raiding special funds and bringing forward payment dates. Such measures will do nothing more than conceal the reality that the additional taxes required will have to be paid, if not today, in the future. This is the approach that underlies the Estimates.The fundamental problem with the Estimates is that the money available to the Minister is not being spent properly. The high water mark of this Government's refusal to address reform in any realistic way was the benchmarking agreement. I do not propose to revisit the benchmarking agreement in detail, as we have already debated it in the House. It was, however, supposed to cast aside the idea that one would be paid extra simply for co-operating with modernisation and change. Instead, we were told it would be based on objective evidence and real delivery of value of money would emerge in exchange for 75% of the additional payment. The key to unlocking this extra value for money was that the Government would enter negotiations with a hard reform agenda and negotiate serious reform in the delivery of public services. What happened? It did nothing about negotiating the reform agenda and one heard not a squeak from trade unions being pushed to go beyond their established position in the crucial negotiations which followed publication of the benchmarking report. The opportunity to reform was lost and with it the possibility of bringing before the House a different type of Estimate. This will go down as one of the greatest failings of a Minister for Finance who has expressed pride in holding office.The consequence of this failure is now obvious. We must come up with €515 million in additional funding to pay for benchmarking increases due on 1 January, which will bring the benchmarking bill in 2004 to €805 million when one includes the double payment awarded this year. In addition, the Government is committed to a further €800 million for pay rounds in 2004. Not surprisingly, public pay increases have pre-empted all other resources.If one strips the Estimates bare, one finds that the amount of discretionary money which could trickle down to ordinary people to deliver improved services, is close to nil. While the amount allocated for non-pay items is €720 million on paper, when one looks more closely one finds that €620 million, more than 85% of the total figure, is already contractually committed under increases in various social welfare schemes, demand-led health schemes, third level grant commitments and commitments under the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse and the Residential Institutions Redress Board. These are hard commitments which must be paid and will not be available to those who deliver public services. In short, non-pay budgets will be delivered a sharp blow. While the bureaucracies and permanent staff remain intact, the materials they need to deliver a quality service will not be available.The axe has fallen on discretionary spending. When one examines the provisions, one finds the Estimates are peppered with cuts which will undermine the quality of services to ordinary families in real terms. Child care and primary and secondary school capitation grants have been cut. The Exchequer contribution to the local government fund has been cut for the second year in a row, while community employment has been cut and the treatment purchase fund has been cut in real terms. FÁS training and integration budgets and social welfare employment support have been cut and, despite Government boasts that housing is its priority, investment in water and sewerage has also been cut along with urban regeneration funding. The Environmental Protection Agency's funding has been cut, as has health capital spending. This is despite the Government's claim that the Hanly report will be implemented in 12 months in two selected regions. This is a direct consequence of the way the Government put together these Estimates. It has been forced to exact these cuts from various Ministers to square the books because it failed to carry out the type of reform that was needed over an extended period, particularly last year with regard to benchmarking.Aside from the visible cuts in the Estimates, there are many more concealed from view. They will be implemented but their implementation will be shoved down the line. It will not be Ministers who announce them or who will have to contend with the impact. The people dealing with local services will feel the squeeze. They will have to tell people depending on public services that the services are not available. The list is already familiar. Hospital beds will be closed next year, as they have been this year. This is madness. These beds have been put in place by the taxpayer at enormous expense. There are huge needs in the health area. Why are we not using those beds more efficiently, turning them over more quickly and getting greater patient throughput? Instead, the Minister for Health and Children and his colleagues come up with the idea that we must close these beds and deny service to people who need it. That is the consequence of this mindless, accountancy approach to public spending.We will see the same in the schools. Teaching materials will not be bought, broken equipment will not be replaced and the quality of education will deteriorate again. Travel will be cut and social workers and outreach workers will not be able to travel to the most vulnerable to provide the services they need. Budgets for contracting in nursing homes will be cut. More of those available will be blocked while there will be more blocked beds in our acute hospitals. The consequences of this will be felt in the accident and emergency departments which will experience even more persistent chaos than they have experienced this year. They will also be felt by the families who are caring for relatives 24 hours a day, seven days a week. They will be denied respite care, as they already have been this year. We will see more of this approach.It is not clear from the Estimates but there will be no money to make inroads into the backlog of unmet needs for people with disabilities. It is one of the blots on the records of successive Governments that they have not been able to get to grips with those needs. Once again, they will be left behind in the scramble for money. It is always the weakest who are left to suffer the pain and to pick up the pieces. It will be schools in deprived areas which will suffer most. Public patients, not private patients, will be left to wait endlessly on trolleys or to suffer in silence, imprisoned in their homes. Carers will be worn out and young families will be left cooped up in bedsits or shared accommodation. The opportunity to break out of social welfare dependence will be closed to many.It is often said that a state should be judged by how it treats the weakest people in its community. There is no evidence that concern for the weakest people in our community had any bearing on the way these Estimates were compiled. The Estimates tell people on the minimum wage that they must pay all their medical expenses, not only for themselves but also for their spouse and children. The 60,000 people who depend on social welfare rent supplement must survive on €112 for a single person or €195 for a couple. The low paid worker cannot ever get any help with the cost of his or her rent.The contrasting experiences of those who are well placed and those who are vulnerable and who visit the clinics of Fianna Fáil Ministers tell a story. Well placed members of the equine industry and of the private hospital sector have called to the Minister's clinics and have been greeted with open arms. There has been a rapid scramble to deliver them extra money or generous tax concessions. Contrast that with the experience of those who appear to have called to the clinics held by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. The result was, as she said on the radio this week, that she got ideas for how she could exact €58 million from the meagre incomes of those on social welfare.The other hidden aspect of the Estimates is the way the screw will be tightened through stealth taxes. The Government has admitted to some of them. People on long-term medication will pay more. The amount they pay has increased by 46% since the general election. The cost of attending a hospital has increased by 40%. Those who depend on rent supplement have to pay 70% more since the general election while people trying to send their children to college must pay 90% more since the election. These are only the tip of the iceberg, the increases the Government has acknowledged.The new policy, however, will shunt down the line the extra taxes and stealth taxes that will have to be paid. They will arise from the freezing of the local loans fund and the ridiculous three-card trick whereby the Minister tried to pretend that increases in motor taxes were not stealth taxes. The freezing of the local loans fund has three consequences – increased motor tax for motorists, increased bin charges for householders and increased commercial rates for businesses. These will follow as sure as night follows day. Furthermore, later this year there will be a quadrupling of the development charge paid by the buyers of new houses. Fianna Fáil, instead of nurturing the seeds of the future, has the new philosophy of making those who are forming new families or who are undertaking new business initiatives shoulder the burden for neglected infrastructure. It is an extraordinary philosophy and flies in the face of much of Fianna Fáil's rhetoric. However, that is the reality.The parents of school-going children will experience more demands for voluntary contributions. The big State monopolies will also look for more. The ESB has already secured a 6% increase. The VHI will also look for more, following the 15% increase in bed charges. We will probably see the other big companies vying with each other for the accolade of securing the highest charge. Thus far, the highest charge granted since the general election is approximately 40%.The business sector, which would have looked to these Estimates for evidence that the Government had got the message that our competitiveness is crucial and is being eroded, will be bitterly disappointed with what it has learned. Over the last 12 months the prices our exporters have been receiving for their products have fallen by 8%. Government increases in charges that affect business have increased by between 10% and 15% across the board, as was shown by surveys during the week. The hope of business was that the Government would finally realise that most of the elements that are eroding our competitiveness are originating with the Government. However, that message has not got through. Instead, a stop-go approach, which wastes money, is being introduced in infrastructural spending. The evaluation process that had been so careful when the European Union was funding such projects has rusted over, as the ESRI has pointed out.The Estimates offer the business community more cuts in infrastructural investment, new stealth taxes, extra spending without securing value for money and more sclerosis in decision making on insurance, deregulation and competition. It always seems as if the Government is waiting for just one more report before it will get to grips with the anti-competitive practices that affect so many professional services and the delivery of banking and financial services.The Estimates are a disappointment. They show all the evidence that they were put together with the slide rule approach of getting the numbers right and forgetting about the need to deliver quality services, to secure good value and to reform systems. These elements, which should have been a feature in the Estimates, have been overlooked. We will see the consequences of that in the poorer performance of the economy and poorer delivery of public services while those at the bottom of the heap will bear the brunt of it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	331	The Labour Party has tabled the following amendment to the motion:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"–condemns the 2004 Book of Estimates for its lack of social and economic vision, and its harsh treatment of the most vulnerable in our society, in particular:–the imposition of a series of taxes by stealth on the Irish people, which have no regard for ability to pay on the part of those on whom they are imposed;–the harsh series of cuts in social welfare provision which will impact on the least well off;–the failure of the Government to live up to its electoral promises in a range of areas, particularly in its failure to provide for additional medical cards and the hardship which this will impose, especially on children; and–the failure of the Government to make adequate provision for capital investment which will inevitably result in lower economic growth and fewer jobs in the future."It is certainly a milestone when the public budget passes the €40 billion mark. It prompts the remark that rarely in a country's history has so much money been spent with so threadbare a list of achievements to show for it. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, enters the pre-budget season with a significant cloud of doubt over his judgment, shown up by the Punchestown affair. He might be forgiven if his judgment had been vindicated by the subsequent history of the centre. It has not been, and is most unlikely to be in coming years. No amount of bluster by him can hide the fact that he played fast and loose with public funds and, in so doing, compromised his office and judgment. It is a dark blot on his record, which is beginning to show an unconscionable number of such blots.The Book of Estimates is littered with them. It is unfair, short-sighted and economically foolish. This is the third round of spending cuts since the last election. It is a betrayal of Fianna Fáil's election promises and a further assault on the least well-off in our society. It provides for further unfair taxation by stealth of the people. It is also a recipe for economic stagnation and failure. This is a Book of Estimates for the "nags and jags" brigade. No expense will be spared by the Minister for pet projects. No cut is too harsh for those who rely on social welfare and no breach of faith with the electorate is too brazen to contemplate.Economic policy is not driven by economic logic but by party political considerations and an unvarnished ideology of the right. In the last Dáil spending was first curtailed. Then the Government went on a pre-election spending splurge, as the Minister has acknowledged. In this Dáil it is doing precisely the same. The Estimates are not about economic prudence but about building an electoral war chest. Fianna Fáil will try to buy the next election with the electorate's own money, just as it did at the last election. We will then hear sanctimonious speeches about how Fianna Fáil took difficult decisions in difficult times. Money will once again be no object but serious damage will be done to the economy in both the short and long-term.Two issues stand out in the Estimates and both demonstrate dramatic switches of policy by the Government which need to be highlighted. The first concerns social policy. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan, who is usually upbeat and optimistic, appeared unusually forlorn at her press briefing last Thursday, and no wonder. I heard her hapless admission on "Morning Ireland" that she was under orders to find more than €55 million in savings from the social affairs budget. These cuts in social welfare bring to an end a political consensus which has lasted for more than ten years. The Taoiseach was involved in a policy decision by the then new Fianna Fáil-Labour Party coalition that social welfare reform's primary aim was to encourage people back to work, training or education to create a path for opportunities.The then Government set an agenda which was endorsed and amplified by the rainbow Government and which all of its successors implemented. In this agenda welfare reform was to avoid right-wing punitive measures on claimants in favour of positive encouragement back to work, training and education. These reforms allowed lone parents to earn between €146 and €293 while retaining some or all of their lone parent's allowance. The back-to-work scheme allowed individuals to hold on to a portion of their social welfare payments for up to three years after commencing work. A series of schemes promoted back-toeducation, training and work experience measures, which included help with child care and the retention for a period of vital benefits such as medical cards.Last Thursday's announcement by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs indicated a sea change in policy, a return to a harsher, often right-wing approach to welfare which will cause immense hardship to the poorest in society at a time of historic riches. The harshest measures will be the changes to supplementary rent allowance. This will mean that persons will not be able to get help with their rent for six months. It will affect lone parents, particularly younger lone parents, who after the birth of their child may live for three or four years with their parents but by their mid-twenties may want a place of their own. Such parents have almost no chance of getting local authority accommodation and usually resort to renting, with the help of a rent supplement, while waiting for anything from five to eight or nine years on the housing list.The Government decided four years ago to transfer responsibility for the rent supplement scheme to local authorities but has chosen not to implement the policy. Rent supplement claimants are to be the victims of this failure. It is proposed that those claiming rent supplement will be referred to the local authority for an assessment of housing need. This is a seemingly sensible measure but there is no possibility of local authorities meeting the need they have assessed, given the numbers on housing waiting lists and the paltry amount of social housing under construction. According to the Minister, ways of improving the services provided for those with long-term housing needs are under discussion with the local authorities. Why were these discussions not completed before making these changes? The Minister obviously lost out in the battle to a much more robust Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen. From now on anyone claiming rent supplement will either have to be already homeless or in rented accommodation for at least six months. This is a classic catch 22 – if one can afford to pay rent for six months, why would one need a rent supplement? My colleague, Deputy Penrose, will deal with the other cutbacks in social welfare.The second policy U-turn outlined in the Book of Estimates concerns the capital investment programme. For all of the Minister's honeyed words about multi-annual budgets, the true situation is that there is a shortfall of resources under each heading contained in the spending plans. The Minister once had a target Exchequer capital spend of 5% of GDP. His 2004 Estimates fall €150 million below this figure. In 2003 the under-spend on the capital side so far is €763 million. In an overall spend of €40 billion for 2004, there is no disguising the blunt fact that the share devoted to investment has been seriously reduced. This is a dramatic switch in policy and observers are unanimous in recognising the plain truth contained in the figures that the relative importance of capital investment in the Minister's overall spending plans has declined. He cannot pretend there is lesser demand for investment. The opposite is obviously the case from even a cursory analysis of our infrastructural gaps and the rising costs of congestion. The inevitable result will be a further loss of competitiveness and fewer jobs.I am sure the Minister has read the World Economic Forum review that downgrades Ireland's rating for growth competitiveness by no less than seven places in the past year from 23rd to 30th. This assault on the capital programme is short-sighted in the extreme. It undermines the future capacity of the economy to reach the goal of steady, even growth rates. It destroys confidence by resuming on the wretched path of stop and go, boom and bust. International investors looking at Ireland will now get two negative signals from the Minister. They see a country that has prospered but whose Government has chosen to abandon plans to use that wealth to lay down conditions for future prosperity. They will see a national pension reserve fund get another billion euro or more but still no re-investment of these funds at home. Another year has passed and still the Minister is unable to offer the trustees of the pension fund a route to have some of this money invested here in roads and communications networks that can secure a return and a cashflow as good as anything Philip Morris or any other international share can offer.Everyone will pay the price of this Book of Estimates. Once again, the Minister has chosen taxation by stealth. He has added further to the long list of charges and fees which he has increased since the last election. Our old friends Duncan and Mary have been hit once more. Doubtless, the Minister will remember Duncan and Mary. They featured in last year's budget as the typical couple with two children who would benefit from modest tax changes. I hope in this year's budget, the Minister will find the time to catalogue the other changes he has made to their family budget and which many commentators have estimated will come in at approximately €800.The cost of in-patient accommodation in hospital is up 25% in 18 months. The cost of an accident and emergency visit is up 42% in 18 months. The drugs payment threshold is up 46% in 18 months. VHI bills are up 27% since the election. So-called college registration fees are up 89% since the election. Motor taxation is up 17% since the election. The list goes on. Gas bills, ESB bills, TV licences, VAT, telephone bills, stamp duties on ATM and credit cards have all been increased. If one does not like it and wants to leave the country, one will be charged more for a passport to get out.These indirect taxes and charges are regressive. They take no account of a person's income in how much is required to be paid. Some are targeted at the worst off. As pointed out in The Irish Times on Monday, Flixotide, a preventive medicine for childhood asthma costs €46.70. The drugs refund scheme will not cover this cost. Once again, the poor, and particularly the children of the poor, who are affected by asthma, must, literally, suffer.The Book of Estimates contains no substantial additional resources to fight crime. Where crime is concerned, the Government has no money, no strategy and no clue. It promised 2,000 extra gardaí. When that idea was dropped, it had no plan B and continues to have no plan B.There is a need for reform of Garda structures and management. Equally, the fight against crime requires more resources. As a Deputy who represents Dublin West, I know only too well the impact crime has on communities. It is not the rich and the well-to-do who suffer most from crime. It is the middle and lower income families who suffer, who are intimidated and sit up at night worrying when their teenage children go out, who suffer the costs of damaged property and damaged lives, who deal with the consequences of a Government which talks tough on crime, but only that, because for this Government talk is cheap.On health, the headline is that the health budget will pass the €10 billion threshold. This is deceptive as a large slice is to be clawed back from health consumers by extra charges and the third rise in the drug refund payment limit in the 18 months since the election. Nothing becomes the Minister for Finance so much as the cavalier way he behaved during Report Stage of the Finance Bill this year when he suddenly introduced a clause to offer yet another McCreevy tax shelter, this time for investors in a private hospital.Some Sundays ago it was reported that a prominent Dublin tax consultant was assembling a consortium of so-called high net worth individuals to invest in a private hospital in Galway. Some €14 million worth of tax breaks was to be the sweetener, thanks to the McCreevy scheme. The result will be less taxes for the Minister to collect, more tax breaks for wealthy people, more access to private health care for those who could pay and, accordingly, less resources for those who use the public hospitals. As always on the McCreevy-Martin watch it is a lose lose situation for the public health service.What are we to get from this year's health budget? Precious little to judge from the Minister's background statement. He cannot promise a single additional medical card nor can he set out any timetable to meet his promise of 200,000 additional medical cards. The percentage of the population covered by medical cards continues to fall inexorably and is now below 30% dragging more and more families into additional personal costs to cover visits to the doctor and associated prescription costs.In my constituency, James Connolly Memorial Hospital has a fantastic new wing fully built, furnished and equipped for more than six months at a cost of approximately €104 million. I believe other hospitals are in the same position. Funding restrictions make it impossible for these new facilities to be commissioned fully. This is economic madness pure and simple. The Irish Times medical correspondent summarised the grim reality of Irish health care under the Martin-McCreevy stewardship as follows: “The prospect of paying more for the privilege of waiting longer continues to be the reality of Ireland's health service.”The decisions on education are mystifying. Primary schools appear to get an extra funding boost to their building programme but it will only enable a partial catch-up after years of repeated indifference to the substandard condition of many schools and the urgent unfilled gaps in primary school provision in many development areas.What is it about the Government that makes grandiose spatial plans of hubs, gateways and strategic development zones but will not guarantee the provision of new schools in the locations they choose. These plans are all dead letters if they do not offer the most basic of amenities any community must have, a comfortable well-equipped place for the children to go to school.I heard the Taoiseach speak eloquently here on Wednesday last in defence of development levies by citing the mistakes of the past where people were sent to live in areas where no facilities were provided. His Government is responsible for the most basic facility of all – a primary school. Last year the primary schools were held back, this it is the turn of the secondary schools, universities and institutes of technology. Parents are made to pay more for registration fees but their student children will enter colleges whose funding is so restricted that inevitably they must reduce services to students. This will mean less tutorials, fewer practicals, less funds devoted to reducing the chronic drop out rate, and less investment in new learning methods. Therefore, students pay more to get less.Both the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, and the Tánaiste were obliged to do a policy U-turn by restoring the science research budgets they had previously dumped. I am glad they were persuaded, however belatedly, of the error of judgment they had made. Knowledge industries are the key to future industrial growth. Foreign investors do not come here solely because of low company taxes. Access to a well educated source of modern skills is the main ingredient such companies will seek in the future.Before leaving the education topic I note that €120 million has been set aside for payment to victims of abuse in residential institutions. It is a very large sum and a heading we are likely to see at this magnitude for many years to come. The transfer of liability to the State education budget must mean services for the current generation of school goers will suffer. This sum would go a long way to get a head start initiative back on the road to offer pre-school opportunities and to fund a meals in school service, particularly a hot breakfast, for children in disadvantaged areas. In meeting that deal the Government should not have taken the money out of the education fund. Again in these Estimates we see the poorest and most marginalised people in our society being made to suffer the brunt of the McCreevy cutbacks.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I wish to share time with Deputies Ó Caoláin, Harkin and Higgins. I speak to the Green Party amendment to the Government motion. The Green Party condemns the Book of Estimates, 2004, as lacking in a social, economic and sustainable vision in the manner in which it already deals with marginalised groups in our society. If this Book of Estimates is informed by any vision, it is a narrow selfish vision. It is born out of a Government that knows where its votes come from, in the case of the Progressive Democrats, and where its money comes from in the case of Fianna Fáil. The Green Party further condemns the failure to properly resource necessary infrastructural development and to prioritise infrastructural needs effectively.In this Book of Estimates the Government is proposing to spend €10 million less than it proposed to spend last year in capital spending, and it seeks to tweak that figure by artificial means. The national development plan cannot and will not be met in its present form and the Government continues to misrepresent how infrastructure is being provided. The Minister has quoted a figure for how public transport has increased at 15 times the rate of capital expenditure on roads, yet we spend three times as much on road expenditure as we spend on public transport, and this Book of Estimates further cuts the amount of capital expenditure available to public transport projects. Rather than have direct Exchequer funding for CIE to help it fund such capital expenditure, it is moving that burden in a very suspect way into an additional debt for the CIE group of companies. That is how this Government operates.The Green Party condemns the misleading attempt to acquire additional funding through surreptitious means that disproportionately transfer the burden of financing public service onto those with least means. There are additional charges of €90 million, flat rate charges, direct charges and charges that are not linked to the ability to pay. Maybe if the Government had courage enough it would say that the people who are not within the tax net and earn even less than the minimum wage, will be paying these taxes and levies, in the same way as those who are among the 400 top earners, many of whom pay no tax, will be paying these same levies.We further condemn the cutting adrift of local government funding that will undermine the provision of services at local level. Apart from increasing motor taxation this Government is not providing one cent extra for local government. It is imposing the full burden of providing additional local services and the cost of benchmarking on local authorities by way of increased service charges which will no longer be linked to any attempt to be a refuse or environmental charge, and increased commercial rates. We condemn the merciless attack on those dependent on social services through the removal of key funding projects. We will hear in the course of this debate over the next day and a half how many of these petty and vindictive cuts will affect the most marginalised in our society. I have heard Government backbenchers defend the cut in the back-to-education allowance. This money will be aimed at secondary education. On that logic future cuts in this area will focus on the money spent in primary education. I suspect that by the time of the next election the back-to-education allowance will apply only to pre-school education because that is the logic on which this Government operates.We condemn the insulting manner in which environmental protection programmes have been cut, with a 32% cut in funding for the Environmental Protection Agency indicating the Government's true priorities in this area. This is just a selection of the cuts in the most contentious Book of Estimates that this Government has produced.The Minister for Finance is fond of using 1997 as a benchmark, his year zero, the Government's Pol Pot. Everyone knows the resources that were available between 1997 and 2002. Will he use 2002 and the date of election as a benchmark?

This is a Book of Estimates that will help inform a budget for those who occupy what the Minister describes as the new plateau of wealth, those who are pulling up the ladder of universal access to social security, health and educational opportunity all in the name of fiscal discipline.During the boom years the economy was on autopilot. Ministers were preoccupied with little more than spending their largesse in enhancing their electoral prospects, and in indulging their whims. There are clear indications that the problems in the economy will be turned into opportunities for some type of ideological experimentation. We will see more privatisation, more stealth taxes, licensed profiteering, local levies and poorer core public services along with continued generous tax breaks. The burden of fiscal discipline will be carried by those who have been disenfranchised, denied their full rights to citizenship and excluded economically by a Government which has given up on them and feels it does not need their support to govern.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	337	There is clearly deep anger throughout the country at the series of cuts and stealth taxes arising from the Book of Estimates published last Thursday. In a two-pronged attack on the citizens of this State the Government is charging more for less services and is cutting back on vital provisions for some of the most vulnerable people in our society. This is typified by the mean and dangerous restrictions on rent supplement which will penalise the poorly housed and those on the economic margins. The restriction of qualification for those who have been in private rented accommodation for six months is an absolute disgrace. It will increase homelessness and further inhibit people in dangerous domestic situations from moving out and finding their own accommodation. What a pitiful reality for those newborns and young children who will grow up in such circumstances. It is a reality far removed from the national pledge to treat all the children of the nation equally.Before the general election, Fianna Fáil promised to extend the medical card to 200,000 people. Since the general election the people who were promised that they would benefit by this extension have been hit by increased charges for health services. The new rise in fees for visiting accident and emergency units follows a rise of 26% last year. It comes at a time when people are on trolleys in accident and emergency units and when the Government is proposing to close such units in local hospitals under the aegis of the Hanly report, where it has not already done so. It comes also at a time when the primary care units promised by this Government have not been delivered. Such units would help reduce the numbers of people going to accident and emergency units. These health charges are a further blow to those whose income is just above the limit for medical card qualification. They will now face higher costs for medicines after another significant increase last year. The drugs payment scheme threshold has risen from €70 to €78, following a €5 increase last year. This will cause further hardship. The allocation in the Estimates for health does not provide for the reforms to which the Government claims it is committed. It will simply keep the system limping from crisis to crisis.I have already received representations about the cuts in back-to-education allowance where the qualifying period is rising from six to 15 months. A constituent has pointed out that he will now have to claim unemployment benefit for an additional nine months. This cut is illogical and can serve only to dissuade people from returning to education.In his Estimates statement last week the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, spoke of "a tighter approach and greater prioritisation of spending". Where was this approach when he was bankrolling his pet project in Punchestown in his constituency? This, like nothing else, symbolises the overall economic mismanagement by the Government. Who is paying the price? The answer is, of course, the ordinary taxpayer.The Estimates and budget of last year, with this year's Estimates, have again spawned a whole series of stealth taxes, taxes which take no account of ability to pay and, therefore, hit the lowest paid citizen hardest. The Government has increased health charges, local authority charges, value added tax, fees for State examinations and many other charges. These stealth taxes have effectively wiped out the previous PAYE tax reductions for the lower paid, and the value of the minimum wage.The Minister should look at what is happening at the other end of the scale. We are only now seeing the full extent of how the wealthiest in our society have successfully shirked paying their fair share of tax. Earlier this year it was disclosed that 254 Bank of Ireland customers with offshore accounts had settled unpaid tax bills with the Revenue Commissioners. The tax recovered amounted to €100 million. One individual paid €7.3 million in back taxes. A recent study by KPMG found that over €4 billion had been lodged in the Isle of Man bank accounts of six Irish subsidiaries between 1998 and 1999. Of the top 400 earners in the State surveyed in 2002 by the Revenue Commissioners, 117 had an effective tax rate of less than 30% in a system where over 500,000 PAYE workers are paying income tax at the top 42% rate. Some 18% of the top earners were paying less than 15% in tax. As the Minister well knows, a significant number were paying no tax at all.Instead of restructuring our tax system to create greater equity and ensure greater revenue from the wealthy, the Government punishes the ordinary citizen with stealth taxes and social welfare cuts. Instead of providing both the reforms and the resources necessary to deliver better health, education and social welfare services and infrastructure, it mismanages on a massive scale and squanders the resources of the people.On behalf of Sinn Féin, I reject the Estimates. We will be campaigning against these cuts and stealth taxes, and for their reversal in the upcoming budget.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	338	What is that message beamed at us from our television screens every night? It is: know the price or pay the price. If only it were that simple, because the public now knows that it is paying the price of electing a Government which taxes us by stealth while constantly telling us that we have one of the lowest tax rates in the European Union, yet it claws back with stealth taxes in each successive budget and Book of Estimates.Stealth taxes are well named. They are like the thief who comes in the night, uninvited, unwelcomed and, most of all, unwanted. What did the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, say before the last general election? He said there would be no cutbacks, planned or otherwise. He was planning, not only cutbacks but also clawbacks. The Book of Estimates is the book of evidence that indicts him for taxing by stealth and attempting to create the illusion that we have a low tax regime when indirect taxation is rocketing.In the short time I have available I can mention only one or two of the most insidious clawbacks in the Estimates. One of the worse aspects is that while everyone is hit, those on low incomes are at the receiving end of knockout punches. Junior certificate fees have increased by 14% since last year. Third level registration fees have increased by 90% since 2002. Primary and secondary school capitation grants were cut. The threshold for the drugs refund scheme has increased by 20% since 2002, a scandalous attempt to squeeze money from those who suffer from long-term illnesses. Hospital accident and emergency charges have increased by 30% since 2002 but if the Hanly report is implemented as planned, those who live in Ennis and Nenagh will be so pleased to have an accident and emergency department that they will gladly pay any price.I could hardly believe the new rules on eligibility for rent supplement which mean that a person must live in rented accommodation for six months before claiming. This is absolutely crazy. We have approximately 800 people on the Sligo Borough Council housing list and 700 on the Sligo County Council housing list. Where can the people concerned live, if not in rented accommodation? How can a person pay a deposit on a home, pay rent for six months and then claim a need for rent supplement? This will lead to an unprecedented increase in the incidence of homelessness all over the country and is the most cruel and heartless announcement in the Estimates.While it might seem that an increase in credit card stamp duty is not in the same league as the last issue I mentioned, it will nonetheless have a negative impact in my constituency on the business of MBNA in Carrick-on-Shannon which employs over 900 people. If a person changes his or her type of credit card with the same provider, or changes provider, he or she will pay stamp duty twice, though using only one credit card at any one time. This is a direct threat to the business of MBNA but more importantly will stop consumers shopping around for better value and make a mockery of the slogan "know the price or pay the price". The Estimates will ensure we pay the price and that we will keep paying it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The Estimates speak volumes about the priorities of the Government. This is a Government which rules for the rich, the speculator, the millionaire tax exile, the millionaire stud farmer and big business generally. For ordinary working people and those suffering from poverty, it does everything wrong on the double. It double-crossed the people in lying its way back to power, and double-taxes working people over and over again while giving €600 million in tax breaks to big business every year from now on. It is a Government of disgusting double standards by which ordinary working people, compliant taxpayers, are dumped into prison for taking a stand for taxation justice, while the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform does not lift a finger to bring before a court, let alone put behind the walls of a jail, the Ansbacher men, corrupt councillors and defrauding bankers who have stolen hundreds of millions from the State.The cuts in social welfare speak of a Government whose arrogance now sees its members light years removed from the economic difficulties of ordinary people. For six and a half years the Government allowed the speculator and the landlord to profiteer most monstrously, pushing up the price of homes and rents to crushing levels. Because of its failure to build homes for low income families, they were thrown at the mercy of the landlords into whose maws the State was shovelling rent supplements. When it comes to take the situation in hand, who does it hit? It does not hit the rack-renting landlords but their victims. It is absolutely incredible that poor people are supposed to find €6,000 before they can arrive at a point where they can organise accommodation for themselves.The rotten system over which the Government presides is stunningly transparent in the outrage announced yesterday whereby a gang of speculator and bribe givers organised in a company called Jackson Way was awarded €13 million of public funds by virtue of a vote by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael councillors to rezone land on which the company had speculated, yet we are supposed to respect the institution of the State, the rules of which are rigged to make this possible. That is the problem. We have a State which is rigged, over which the Government presides and which it continues to allow to be rigged, to benefit the minority of the very wealthy, the privileged, the big banker and the speculator, while ordinary people who want to take the situation in hand are shown no such tolerance by the institutions of the State, rather they are persecuted and thrown in prison for standing up for justice. The local and European elections cannot come soon enough to give the ordinary people of the State an opportunity to pass judgment on the Government of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. I have no doubt that they will pass judgment and pass it harshly.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	340	Before the debate commences, I wish to make a brief comment. I remind Members that part of the subject matter of the debate relates to matters before the courts. I draw the attention of Members to long-standing rulings of the House, namely that the House is not a court of law and therefore there is an onus on Members to avoid if at all possible referring to persons outside the House in a manner which could be construed as being prejudicial to any subsequent investigations which may be deemed necessary by appropriate authorities. In addition, I remind Members that under Standing Order 56 a matter should not be raised in such an overt manner that it appears to be an attempt by the Oireachtas to encroach on the functions of the courts or a judicial tribunal. When permission to raise the matter has been granted there will continue to be an onus on Members to avoid, if at all possible, comment which might in effect prejudice the outcome of proceedings. I ask Members to bear these points in mind when making their contributions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	341	I move:That Dáil Éireann:– deploring the failure of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deliver on the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí as promised before the election and the failure of the Government to make provision in the Book of Estimates for the recruitment of extra gardaí in 2004;– noting the decision of the Central Criminal Court sitting in Limerick to relocate a murder trial to Dublin due to the difficulties which it experienced in swearing in and retaining a full jury;– regretting the subsequent collapse of the murder trial in the Central Criminal Court in Dublin, and the extent to which it has undermined and subverted the administration of justice in this country;– noting the comments of Mr. Justice Carney on the collapse of the trial that he had never before encountered ‘the likes of what happened in this case';– deploring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reforms failure to maintain confidence and stability in the criminal justice system;– noting that so far this year, on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reforms watch, there have been 19 gangland killings and that 40 criminal gangs are operating in Dublin;– believing that the failure of the Government to properly support the RAPID programme in order to tackle the roots of social disadvantage has exacerbated the crime problem;– noting the implicit admission of failure in the fight against crime on the part of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in his decision to allocate a mere €2 million extra to the Garda Síochána to fight crime;– condemns the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Government for failing to recognise the inter-generational shift which has taken place in gangland activity and further condemns the Government for its consistent failure to take definitive action steps to quell their activities; and– calls on the Government immediately:– to admit that it has failed to prevent the escalation in gangland activity to such an extent that such gangs have become a threat to the administration of justice,– to restore public confidence and judicial confidence in the criminal justice system,– adopt a co-ordinated approach to tackling gangs which exercise an unacceptable level of control in communities throughout the country,– to commit itself to the enforcement of the existing criminal laws which are already on the Statute Book,– to publish proposals forthwith setting out how it proposes to afford proper and adequate protection for witnesses and jurors in criminal trials,– to honour its pre-election promise to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí,– to fully and adequately resource the Garda in the fight against gangland activity,– to establish forthwith an organised crime unit that has the capability and specialisation to tackle and extinguish criminal gangs,– to expand and enhance the emergency response unit,– to enable such further similar trials to be conducted in the Special Criminal Court.I fully respect the Chair's statement and I have no intention of straying outside that ruling. I wish to share my time with Deputies Deasy and Stanton.The administration of justice is integral to any democracy and the rule of law and order is sacrosanct. When the administration of justice fails, it ruins public trust, shatters public confidence. When it fails to defend the citizen, to protect society, the Government loses control of the State. It forfeits its legitimacy to govern. This is what has happened in Ireland today.This Government was elected on a false premise, a false promise: way less crime, more gardaí – 2,000 to be precise. Its programme for Government stated, "We stand for a society where all people can feel safe in their communities, businesses and homes."  It made 28 specific commitments in legislation, the Judiciary, policing, narcotics and enforcement. Now 28 specific commitments later there is not a single additional garda on our streets; organised crime is of a new and worse order; there is wholesale trafficking of women for the sex trade; cocaine is freely available in every town and city; 100,000 E tablets are dropped in this country every week; new-generation hallucinogens such as DOB inducing horrific self-mutilation are available; 40 gangs are carving up the capital between them; 19 gangland executions occurred this year alone, one of them for no reason other than to send a message. There were 19 gangland executions but only four State charges.The reality is that today, €5,000 will buy a plasma-screen television; a five-year-old Fiat Brava or a professional hit on a citizen of your choice. Gangsters, having asserted their legal rights, can literally give the finger to the rule of law, to democracy, to every decent thing that makes up our society. This is war and look who is winning. Now who feels safe in their in their communities, their businesses, their homes?Two weeks ago, reality TV took a new twist. On primetime viewing we were treated to a drug dealer outlining his fail-safe, get-rich-quick plan to his should-be captive audience. What was his advice? For every thousand euro they "invest", they should make back two thousand, with the rider that any "investment" deal should include, "a bit of coke for yourself, ‘cos man, you too need to party". Thanks to this Government, we have a two-bit hood sounding like someone from the IDA, outlining a capital investment scheme, only in the underworld the profit is 100%What do the Ministers of this Government, who stand collectively in name as a Cabinet for a safe society, propose to do? How do they plan to fix it? Specifically, how do they intend to take out these gangs? What is the status of the Government's intelligence on the former paramilitary organisations who are now supplying the weaponry and firepower to these gangs? Can the Minister tell the House that these persons are more or equally dangerous than they were in their previous incarnation with the provisional IRA or other? What and how many personnel will be dedicated to rooting out these organised criminals? The only way of ridding society of these criminal gangs is by knowing their haunts and runs, knowing who are their associates, by constant surveillance and contact and by fingering and hindering their associates. That requires manpower and resources. One need only talk to any member of the Garda and its special units to learn that at least five persons are required to mount surveillance on a suspect.I listened to the Garda Commissioner when he appeared before the Oireachtas all-party committee. It is very difficult for the senior police officer in the State to come before any committee because if he is asked questions he is quite likely to stray into what might be perceived to be the political arena. When he states that he does not have sufficient resources—

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I say to the Minister that in the Estimates for this year, overtime was cut by 40% and travel and subsistence by 60%. What superintendent in any district could effectively police his district with that kind of savage cutback in force? It is not possible. The citizens demand to see the gardaí on the streets. They want to know they are available and they like to see them. They want that comfort. There are people who will go to bed tonight terrorised, not just in city communities but throughout the length and breadth of the land. The previous Garda Commissioner set up a number of specialist units which recruited the best and the brightest from the force but they were never replaced. The Minister says that there are difficulties and that he will extend the age of retirement. The problem exists in the 51 to 52 year old age bracket because those gardaí are retiring, taking their pensions, doing other jobs and not being replaced. While Templemore is full – it is stretched to the limit – the Minister will never see anything like the 2,000 extra gardaí he promised unless spectacular arrangements for training are put in place.I do not have the level of information available to the Minister, but the evidence I have is that the people supplying the fire power to these gangs were previously members of paramilitary organisations. If the Minister lives up to the reputation he had when he entered this House as a Member of the Government, if he takes the gangs off the streets, Fine Gael will support him. We will support measures the Government takes to eliminate these gangs and provide people and businesses with the sense of security and comfort that only the Garda Síochána can offer. Unfortunately, in a variety of ways, the Minister has run against the Garda Síochána in the past year, although I do not doubt his integrity in wanting to make root and branch change to the structure of the Garda Síochána to ensure the most effective results for taxpayers' money.This is the most dangerous period for our democracy since the murder of Veronica Guerin. At that time, the rainbow Government responded with a clear, concise strategy and put resources in place for it, and that paid off. The CAB was set up and gangs like that of Gilligan were put out of business. They have now been replaced, however, with younger and more vicious gangs and the Minister must take political responsibility for the administration of justice. He is not entirely responsible because investing in ghettos leads to criminality and investing in urban sprawl leads to deviancy and vandalism. It is only by investing in people that there will be real results. The Minister's colleagues who are absent this evening do not appear to understand that the society we are breeding now will require constant injections of resources and manpower to tame these elements.This party will support the Government in making changes and providing resources to remove these gangs from the streets. We do not want knee-jerk reactions, such as the law that deals with non-alcoholic discos for teenagers that take place in licensed premises. Gardaí must implement this law and are putting teenagers on to the street because they have no choice. The Minister must spell out his solution to this problem. Yesterday I was told by two garda superintendents that they have no option but to enter licensed premises where a teenage disco is taking place, even though there is no alcohol on sale, and to put those teenagers on to the street. That is not good and the Minister must deal with this situation.Studies show that at 22 months, a bright child from a poor background does vastly better than a slow child from a better off background. By three years of age they are level and by six years a slow baby from a rich home will score far more than a bright baby from a poor home. The society in which we live is not all down to the Minister, there are other areas where politics can impact on the creation of opportunity, advantage and equality for all, but this is happening on the Minister's watch. I do not understand how the Government can say the Minister will live up to his responsibilities while it cut back resources by 40% to 60% last year.Deputy Deasy has raised the issue of cases being heard before the Special Criminal Court. Obviously no change in the law will act as a substitute for maintaining an effective system of justice and law and order but the Special Criminal Court is capable of trying crimes which are not subversive on the production of a certificate from the DPP. The Minister mentioned the Canadian system where evidence can be given beforehand that a witness might not want to corroborate subsequently. There is a difference between the intimidation of juries and of witnesses but this is an area the Minister should examine and if these cases cannot be tried for any reason, the option exists to use the Special Criminal Court.I was interested in the Minister's definition of gangs, for which he made a plausible case. I feel, however, that he will get the support of the House if he puts extra resources into cleaning up our streets, going after the drug barons who cause these problems and puts forward proposals to regenerate our society and give everyone a chance.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I will bring the House back to the AGSI conference in April, which the Minister attended, particularly to the prophetic comments of Mr. Joe Dirwan, then president of the association. Mr. Dirwan said that organised criminal gangs have grown as arrogant as they were in the years before the murder of Veronica Guerin. He stated that almost weekly incidents of gangland murder were particularly worrying and that such is the climate of fear, it is impossible to get witnesses to come forward to give evidence that would secure the convictions of perpetrators. He called for a targeted and properly resourced response within the force to go after the organised gangs before the danger became so great that they are once again a major threat to society.I went through the statements made by gardaí in the past year and a similar theme runs through them. This is a typical plea on the part of gardaí and their representatives who were fearful of what would happen if these criminal gangs were not leashed. The Garda Commissioner talks about the growing drugs culture of the country and Opposition spokespeople such as Deputy Costello have been talking about gangland killings for a year. I have lost count of the number of times I have raised the issue of an organised crime unit but the Minister will not take it on board . While he was making speeches about winning the war on crime, the people who were fighting that war were trying to tell him what was going wrong and what was needed, but the Minister ignored them. They continued to fight without success as a result.The Minister's attitude to this can be best summed up by the comments he made at the photo opportunity with former Garda Commissioner Byrne and a horse at the Garda sports centre in Westmanstown. In a "their day will come" speech, the Minister vowed that everyone involved in gangland murders would be tracked down and brought to justice. So far this year there have been 19 murders but in only three cases are charges pending. There are ongoing investigations but no one believes the promise the Minister made that day.The Minister said he was happy with the Garda performance in tackling organised crime and that he did not believe a lack of resources was an issue in the apparent increase in gang crime. This was after gardaí had been telling him the exact opposite for a number of months. The Minister was wrong and it was a serious error of judgment on his part. When the situation got worse, what was the Minister's reaction? He threw €2 million that was found down the back of the couch at the gardaí after saying for so long that money was not the issue. The Minister had not listened to the people who mattered.The Government's response to the doubling of the number of gangland killings, the doubling of gun homicides and the quadrupling of drugs seizures is interesting. The gangs involved stepped up a gear while the Minister was not looking. It was only when those accused of the murder of Kieran Keane went on trial and the trial collapsed that it started to take notice. I knew some people who were in that courtroom, who had been to hundreds of jury trials, who said they had never seen fear or terror like it when a person found out he or she might be a juror in the case. The Liam Keane trial then collapsed because the witnesses would not corroborate their written statements. The reaction of the Government was to say that this is a serious situation but that the Opposition spokespersons were overreacting, that theirs was exaggerated outrage and a knee-jerk reaction. However, the Minister became much quieter when it was found that someone had placed a device under Paul Williams's car. He then had an open mind about the situation.What the Minister has been trying to do throughout this is maintain a facade of authority and control when in fact he does not know what to do. He has never known what to do because he has not listened to the people dealing with the situation. That is the issue. This is all about the Minister maintaining control within his Department and maintaining that facade at all costs. He is trying to maintain the notion that he knows what is going on but he does not. When the pressure has come on, he has prevaricated and dithered. His defence mechanism has been to insult anyone who has a different point of view to his.When drug dealers kill other drug dealers, which they have been doing with great regularity for the past three or four years, there is no public outcry and, as a result, there is not much of a political reaction. Who cares that another 20 year old drug dealer in Finglas killed another one? This has gone on for a long time without the appropriate response from the Government.The difficulty for the Minister is that the mask came down on a few occasions. For example, when the Garda Representative Association suggested making it an offence to be a member of a gang, something my party leader mentioned earlier, the Minister dismissed it out of hand, even though it has worked effectively in other jurisdictions. The GRA knew that but the Minister did not.In July, at the event in Westmanstown, the Minister said that the greatest problem in dealing with these gangs was the wall of silence but he dismissed the GRA's idea out of hand. The GRA gave the Minister the solution but he was not interested. He was in control and that was that. As far as this issue is concerned, the Minister has used every opportunity to dismiss suggestions that legislation could be introduced to make it an offence to be a member of a gang. I do not believe he has bothered to objectively consider this proposal any further.I sometimes get the impression that ideas that emanate from the Minister are automatically brilliant but those which come from other sources are suspect. On the one hand he talks about all-party support on this issue, which we are willing to give, but on the other he rubbishes proposals from this side of the House without giving a credible explanation. The Minister has lost credibility in the House as a result.As far as the gang membership issue is concerned, the Minister is very fond of Canada because it is a place in which he has found precedence to his satisfaction. Legislation making it an offence to be a member of a gang appears to function quite well in Canada. Section 467 of the Canadian criminal code makes it an offence to be a member of a gang and provides a plausible definition and offence provision. The Minister should also examine what is being done in Austria and Spain before he dismisses what the GRA had to say.P. J. Stone supported my call for these trials to be held in the Special Criminal Court. The Minister called his comments ignorant and silly. P. J. Stone represents the front line of the Garda Síochána. He is the person who represents the gardaí who put their lives on the line, yet the Minister called his comments ignorant and silly. That is where the Minister made his greatest mistake, and I will explain that.The Minister went to Templemore last month realising that the comments he made about gardaí taking money from journalists hurt and that he had made a huge mistake as far as the Garda Síochána was concerned. Incidentally, I read reports over the weekend from retired gardaí which stated that morale in the force has never been lower. I believe that, if they were asked who has made that happen, they would say it is the Minister.In Templemore the Minister made a fine speech about standards in the Garda Síochána. He said that there may be people who denigrate the Garda Síochána from outside but that the greatest critics of the force should always be from within. He said we should ignore those cynical and tired voices who claimed high standards of professionalism could not be upheld in the real world. The problem is that the Minister had already dug his hole. The damage had been done.The Minister has done more to question the professionalism of the Garda Síochána in the past 18 months than anyone else. His legacy so far this year is approximately 700 retirements from the Garda Síochána. About 1,000 gardaí have qualified this year to do the pre-retirement course. So many gardaí have qualified this year for the course that there is a waiting list. That is the Minister's legacy. The problem is that he, not his policies, have become the issue. He has made the gravest error, politically speaking by allowing himself to become the issue. He cannot do that in his position. It is the most destructive thing he could have done, and he did it.This debate has degenerated into rants against anyone who challenges or questions the Minister's authority or his ego. What does that mean? It means that the chances of meaningful Garda reform are not good while the Minister is in office. That is the initiative he has always said is the most important to him while he is Minister. That is his goal, but it will not happen because gardaí are sick listening to him. There are serious problems within the Garda Síochána. The members of the force know that, but what they did not need was the Minister shoving it down their throats over the past 18 months. They will not forget it.The Minister's reaction to these events epitomises his tenure in office. He has presided over the most under-resourced and overstretched criminal justice system the country has ever had. His sole response appears to be that Garda numbers will soon be at their highest, but to say that is to ignore the fact that the courts system is creaking, with delays of 12 months being commonplace. Jurors cannot be empanelled because they are in fear of their lives. Juvenile criminals go on crime sprees because no places of detention are available for them. The Garda Síochána has been denied real additional resources in this year's Estimates. Serious crime has dramatically increased and the non-reporting of crime is endemic. The Minister may shake his head but he should look at the rape figures issued today in Dublin.I inquired two weeks ago about section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999. This was the much publicised ten year mandatory sentence for the possession of drugs with a value of more than £10,000 or €12,000. I was interested to read in the response that the number convicted under the Act so far is 276 but that the number who received the ten year sentence was 12. Around the same time as this was reported in the newspapers, the North-Western Health Board issued the statistic that ten year old children were pooling their money to buy drugs instead of food.This is how bad the situation has become. There is little deterrent for people dealing in drugs. If a person deals in drugs, it is difficult to jail him or her under this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. I know that because I see it happening in my home town. I have said on a number of occasions in the House that we should begin with what the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors called for in April, namely, a three months minimum sentence for someone dealing in drugs. The Minister referred to this some weeks ago. He should send a signal to the people who are willing to do this that there are deterrents.I asked another question last week about the number of convictions under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act, which has been in force for four months and is supposed to be the panacea for street crime. The official response I got was that the Minister does not have any official responsibility to Dáil Éireann for these matters. That is amazing. The Minister did not want me to get that answer. I would not be surprised if there were not any convictions under some of the sections. Why can the Minister not answer the question?

#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I could ask a question about the Criminal Justice Act 1999, but I will not get an answer. The same picture emerges for the sections of the recently introduced Intoxicating Liquor Act.The Minister cannot legislate his way out of the problems of crime. Some 40 pieces of criminal law have been passed in recent years. More energy has been expended on the construction of new Acts than on the reform of policing methods. However, people are fast losing their faith in the criminal justice system and criminals are taking advantage of that. Legislation is not the only answer to smashing these gangs. We need more gardaí and a better resourced force. We also need a root and branch reform of the Garda Síochána, starting with an effective complaints inspectorate. For too long the Minister has denied the gardaí the proper resources to do their job. More importantly, he has jeopardised proper Garda reform by needlessly alienating the people who fight crime in our streets. The Minister came to the job with some great ideas, but that is all they are. It is fine to draft Bills and to announce plans, but the people feel less safe today than they did when the Minister took office.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I am pleased to support the motion, but I am concerned that we had to table it in the first place. We are dealing with serious matters of life and death. It is common to hear on the radio in the mornings about a person being shot or someone being murdered. People are becoming immune to it. We need action and we need the Minister to instil confidence. Unfortunately, however, the Minister is not doing that.The Minister said he will jail gardaí if they talk to journalists. That is a stupid thing for him to say. How will that encourage gardaí or boost their morale? Last week the Minister said he will close prisons. We have a crime epidemic, but he wants to close prisons. He chose for closure Fort Mitchell on Spike Island in Cork, a prison which is the least expensive to run, is drug-free and deals with young people. He wants to close prisons at a time when we need more prison places. He said he will privatise the Irish Prison Service, although a report commissioned by his Department states that it would be wrong to do that.The Government has a philosophical problem. We passed the Youth Work Act a number of years ago. However, money has not been provided for it. This is not the Minister's sole responsibility, but as a member of Cabinet he should be aware of the problems. If we do not have a proper youth service, young people will get involved in street crime.Deputy Deasy is correct that the country is awash with drugs. There is no mechanism to steer young people who are at risk away from drugs. Crime is becoming a big problem as a result. If the Minister can give a positive response tonight by outlining what he intends to do to address this problem, we in Fine Gael, as Deputy Kenny said, will support him.Many Garda stations are closed at night throughout the country, which sends the wrong signal to people involved in criminal activity. Garda presence on our streets is non-existent. There were gardaí on the streets in the past. The police are visible at night on the streets in other countries. Their presence acts as a deterrent, but that is not the case in this country because we do not have enough gardaí. The Minister and the Government reneged on their promise to provide extra gardaí, yet they knew the need existed. Perhaps the Minister will tell us why we still do not have extra gardaí on the streets almost 18 months later. It seems there will be fewer gardaí on the streets as a result of resignations and early retirements due to low morale. The Minister must take serious action to boost morale in the Irish Prison Service and among gardaí.The Minister must work with everyone in the House. When the first motion on crime was tabled in this House, the Minister derided Deputy Deasy. I was in the Chair that night and I could not believe the horrible and arrogant way in which he did it. It is time for the Minister to get off his high horse and to look at what is happening. It is also worth noting that there is not one Government Deputy here to support the Minister. Even the members of his party are not here tonight.We are beginning to see a situation where people who are asked to act as jurors are being intimidated. That is extraordinarily serious. These people fear for their lives. The Minister is laughing. However, I do not see anything to laugh about. These are life and death issues. It is an attack on the State. Unless the Minister acts, the gangs will increase and they will get more violent and vicious. The Minister must put more gardaí on the streets and give them the resources and the authority to act. We should not send out a wrong signal by closing prisons and causing rows, which could lead to gardaí being taken off the streets to man the prisons. That is not the way to operate. The Minister should meet the people and listen to what they are saying, as Deputy Deasy requested. The Minister may think he has all the answers, but he does not.A number of years ago a school principal told me he could identify young people at four or five years of age who would end up in jail. Other people say they can identify them earlier. We must start intervening earlier in the communities. We are building sprawling housing estates, but we are not providing resources or a youth service. Social workers and probation people are stretched to the limit. A total Government response is needed to deal with this issue.I said earlier that the country is awash with drugs. We all know about the large quantity of drugs seized by the gardaí, but that is only the tip of the iceberg. I know from talking to people that the supply of drugs is almost endless and they are getting cheaper. We must put measures in places to divert young people away from crime and drugs. We must tackle the gangs to stop them from increasing in number, getting stronger and taking on the State. The Minister must start to build up the morale of the gardaí, the prison officers and the Irish Prison Service. I hope the Minister will come forward with a positive response, unlike the last time he addressed us on an issue such as this.

We are talking tonight about serious and weighty matters that go to the heart of our democratic system. Nothing is more serious for any society than the way in which the criminal justice system functions. On a subject such as this we should put aside propaganda and wishful thinking and face the facts in a spirit of truthfulness.The front line force in our fight against crime is our national police force, the Garda Síochána. We have a duty to give the Garda the members, the resources and the support, both moral and political, which it requires to carry out that task. Members have spoken about the morale of the Garda. It is a matter of record that the Garda has for the last 18 months been under a constant bombardment of morale-sapping criticism from the Opposition parties in this House. All too many of its achievements have been doubted, sneered at and denigrated by a constant stream of Opposition criticism. Day in, day out we are fed with statements which attack its record in crime prevention, which in the last year has shown positive results.

The credibility of the figures is questioned when they are good. The crime figures compiled by the Garda are only to be believed, apparently, when they are bad. Opposition spokesmen pretend concern and admiration for the force while they and their colleagues daily kick away at public support for it. The record of their parties in Government is truly pitiful when examined. The gulf between what they did and what they said they would do is immense.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Week in, week out Opposition Members accuse members of the Garda of impropriety and misbehaviour. There is never a week without some new accusation made against the force. Parliamentary questions are regularly tabled about the level of compensation claims against and by gardaí, public order incidents and every possible circumstance that could embarrass or reflect badly on the Garda. Nearly every incident is exaggerated or distorted in an unrelenting campaign to create the impression that the Garda Síochána is failing in its task and is losing the battle against crime. That constant barrage of negativity comes from the Opposition in this House, not from the Government. All of this is done in the hope that by damaging and discounting the Garda, there will be damage and embarrassment for the Government.The message has been conveyed that the Garda Síochána is losing the fight against organised crime and that criminal gangs are gaining in strength and influence. I roundly reject that assertion and I deeply regret the inevitable effect of such assertions on Garda morale. On the contrary, I believe that the Garda Síochána is gaining the upper hand in that fight, which it is fighting on behalf of all of us. I am not being complacent. Recent events, especially the outcome of a recent trial in the Central Criminal Court, have quite rightly generated much public debate and concern. In participating in that debate as public representatives, we should all be aware that we are constrained in what we can say in light of the fact that proceedings are ongoing. Those events have presented us with a challenge, but it is no greater challenge than many that the Garda and the State have met and faced down in the past. This House has met and dealt with far graver challenges to public order, the rule of law and the authority of the State.Nobody should doubt the determination of the Government and me as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Garda Commissioner and the entire force to tackle and to put down what is on the face of it a crude subculture of criminality among a small number of young men who are foolish enough to believe that they can take life with impunity and evade the consequences. Let nobody in Limerick, Dublin or elsewhere doubt our resolution that they will be brought to justice and made to pay the price for the cruelty and ferocity of their crimes against the community. There is no question of the State or the Garda Síochána lying down in the face of such crude and cruel criminality, nor should anyone in this House imagine for one moment that the outcome of this struggle in the battle against criminality is in doubt.Our response must be resolute, proportionate and focused. We have a State and a Constitution adopted by the people. We have a system of criminal justice which strives to strike a balance between convicting and punishing wrongdoers and protecting personal liberties and fundamental rights. The basic structure of our criminal justice system is fundamentally sound. However, we cannot be complacent. Just as the price of liberty is eternal vigilance, the cost of containing crime in any civilised constitutional democracy is constant adaptation of our policing, laws and systems to match the ever-changing face of crime. We must continually keep that system under review and adapt it in the light of changing circumstances and emerging challenges. That is what I am doing. I have already told the House that I intend to review the adequacy of legislative provisions, resource allocations and administrative practice to see whether changes are required and to consult with all the appropriate persons and organisations involved in the criminal justice system.I welcome the decision of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, chaired by Deputy Ardagh, to conduct a legislative and administrative review of the system, especially the issue of witness protection, and to invite submissions from interested organisations and individuals with constructive proposals to make. I will participate in that committee and I hope Deputy Kenny will finally appoint Deputy Deasy as a full member so that he can participate fully in the proceedings. It is about time they settled their little tiff.

The Commissioner has projected, based on the expected rate of retirement, that the maximum authorised force strength of 12,200 will be achieved during 2004. These extra gardaí will be assigned to the areas of greatest need.As I have already informed this House, I will not be content with raising the strength of the Garda Síochána to an historic high of 12,200 by the end of 2004. As soon as budgetary circumstances permit, I am confident this Government can make progress towards the target of 14,000 provided in the programme for Government.

I have brought the text of these programmes to the House this evening because the last time this matter arose I was contradicted when I said that neither party had made any commitment in the matter of Garda numbers. I have carefully checked both programmes and neither of them makes any commitment to any increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána whatsoever, although the Fine Gael Party said it would establish a special commission to look at the strength of the Garda without any commitment on its outcome.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Hand in hand with that fundamental reform of the structures, accountability and strategic management of the Garda Síochána, in the new year I will publish a new criminal justice Bill that will modernise and strengthen the investigative and evidential powers of our police force. This is being done in accordance with Garda management, whose views on law reform I take seriously and always try to give effect to.While I am disappointed, I am not surprised to see described as a "mere €2 million" the extra resourcing which will provide up to 55,000 additional hours of overtime between now and the year's end for those elements in the Garda Síochána that are targeting criminal gangs. The bulk of these additional resources will be targeted at the southern and Dublin metropolitan regions and for support units, including the emergency response unit. That such additional funds are being made available to the Garda to meet such obvious needs is the opposite of failure. The availability of funds arises from prudent management of expenditure across the Votes for which I have responsibility. I am fulfilling my commitment to make available to the commissioner sufficient resources to meet the operational needs of the Garda.I am particularly pleased to have secured a €91 million increase in the Garda Vote for 2004 over the 2003 Estimate of €954 million. This represents a 9.5% increase in the Garda Vote for 2004. Having reached the target €1.054 billion, the Garda budget is now at a historic high. The resources secured by me for the Garda Síochána are an increase of 75% over the figure allocated by Fine Gael and Labour for the force in 1997.

The rate of increase for next year demonstrates that I have focused strongly on bringing substantial additional resources into the fight against crime.The budget for Garda salaries, wages and allowances includes an increase in overtime provision of almost €7 million, an increase of 13.3%, from €51.516 million to €58.359 million.

I have ensured through this allocation that normal policing resources would not be diverted during the six month Presidency period. I have also agreed with the commissioner that overtime resources would continue to be deployed in targeted operations against criminal activity that give rise to most concern in our communities.It has been suggested that the Garda Síochána needs an organised crime unit. I have carefully considered such a proposal and have discussed it on a number of occasions with the Commissioner. Recent years have seen the establishment of a wide range of specialist Garda units, such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda national drug unit. The co-ordinated deployment of these units has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime, as well as other crime, more effectively. Other smaller units, including the money laundering investigation unit and a unit dealing with theft of computer components, have also had success in combating the activities of organised criminals.If there were a case for one organised crime unit to be established, I would support it wholeheartedly. I spoke to the commissioner on this matter today and he is absolutely satisfied that the existing arrangement of specialised units is more appropriate and more effective. I agree with the commissioner's professional judgment which is based on experience and detailed knowledge of the organisational requirements of the force. I attach more weight to his view on this matter than I do to that of others.There have never been more resources available to the commissioner in the fight against crime. The number of gardaí has increased to an all-time high. Funding for the Garda Síochána in 2004 has passed the €1 billion mark. The commissioner has tremendous resources at his disposal in terms of a well trained and highly motivated force, specialised units, infrastructural assets and technical assistance etc. to assist in responding to the challenges of this fight. What the gardaí need now is public support in their battle against crime.

He may only do so when he comes to the view that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the administration of criminal justice. He may not exercise this choice on improper grounds, such as the willingness of witnesses to renege on their evidence or some notion that the prospects of conviction would be enhanced by such a move. Everyone in Ireland has the right to jury trial as long as a jury can be reasonably expected to come to a fair verdict on his or her case free from outside interference.There is no need for me to strengthen the director's power of referral of cases to the Special Criminal Court. The rules of evidence in the Special Criminal Court are exactly the same as in other courts and judges' decisions as to admissibility of evidence are made on exactly the same criteria.It has been suggested that the evidence of a chief superintendent that a person is a member of a gang, however that could be defined – I know some countries have made an attempt to do so – should be admissible to prove its contents and that persons should be liable to be convicted of gang membership. This has never been tried in any of the countries referred to by Deputy Deasy. As I understand it, this suggestion seems to be based on some loose analogy with the provisions of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act of 1972 that deal with proscribed organisations.If membership of a gang were to be made an offence, it would be still necessary to show that the ordinary courts were inadequate before any such case could be tried in the Special Criminal Court. Any other law would be unconstitutional. If an individual were to be indicted for membership of a gang of say six or eight persons, it seems it would be necessary to arrest, charge and put on trial all the other alleged members of the gang. I do not believe that a law that provided for the mass prosecution of a gang on the word of a chief superintendent would survive constitutional scrutiny or would be acceptable to public opinion. The analogy with proscribed organisations is a false one.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I believe that reliance on a jury trial and on the proof of cases beyond reasonable doubt by evidence capable of being challenged is one of the chief guarantors against oppressive misuse of State authority and one of the chief foundations of public confidence in our criminal justice system.There are many areas in our criminal justice system that can be improved, not least delay between the arrest and charging of a person with a serious offence and his or her subsequent trial. Such delay inevitably prejudices the due process of law and public confidence in the criminal justice system. Delays can occur equally in jury and non-jury courts and I intend to confer with the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Courts Service and the Garda Síochána so that delays that are prejudicial to the public interest can be minimised. I will bring these and other issues and proposals to the all-party justice committee hearing in the coming weeks.I state emphatically and categorically that recent events are no basis for hasty and ill-considered measures that would, if implemented, erode the integrity of and public confidence in our criminal justice system. Nothing would be easier than for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Taoiseach or Government to announce such ill-judged proposals as Government policy in the wake of some event or controversy that excited public interest and concern in relation to the criminal justice system. I note from investigating the aftermath of the shocking murder of Veronica Guerin in 1996 that the then Government almost immediately announced a package of measures which included a proposal to transfer all major drug crime to the Special Criminal Court. That may have assuaged public opinion in part at the time but the record shows that nothing was done on foot of that commitment and the proposal was quietly abandoned in the cold light of day when its unconstitutional implications were evaluated. It is little surprise to me, therefore, that some of my critics whose parties used that suggestion as a stage prop in 1996 should cynically return to it in 2003 without remembering exactly why they rejected it back then.

I heard, with a leaden heart, the remarks of Deputy Stanton that morale in the prison system was lowered on my account and that I was closing prisons instead of opening them.

This is an ambitious programme which requires determination and a steady hand on the tiller and I intend to see it through.I have also levelled with the Irish people. I have published crime figures as soon as they have become available to me and on a quarterly basis. I have done so in order that the public can see the true picture and that fact can displace myth.Ireland has a relatively low crime rate. International comparisons contained in the National Crime Council's report, Crime in Ireland, note that the State is situated at the lower end of the scale. Of the countries studied by the council, only Switzerland, Greece, Russia and Japan had lower rates of violent crime. Similarly, comparative crime statistics compiled by the UK Home Office show that, in the years 1999 to 2001, the most recent available, an average of 1.42 murders were committed for every 100,000 persons in Ireland, which is below the EU average of 1.6.These statistics also show that the increase in violent crime is an international phenomenon. For the period from 1997 to 2001, the average rise was 22% in the EU. With regard to crime in general, indictable crime in Ireland increased during the 1980s and early 1990s. In 1995, just over 102,000 crimes were recorded. From 1995 to 2000, serious crime fell by 29%. For two years afterwards, the crime figures deteriorated in the aftermath of the introduction of the PULSE recording system but now show signs of stabilising and, indeed, declining. Provisional crime statistics for the first nine months of this year show a cumulative decrease of 3% compared with the figures for the corresponding period in 2002.With regard to the number of murders, following a relatively stable period in the late 1990s when between 32 and 38 murders were committed each year, in 2001and 2002 just over 50 murders were committed each year. Happily, there is no evidence to date this year of a further increase on this level. In fact, figures reveal that violent crimes against the person fell consistently during the first nine months of this year. In 2002, assaults increased by just under a half. However, figures for the first nine months of this year show a decline of a quarter.The record of the Garda Síochána continues to be excellent with impressive detection rates by international standards of 81% in homicide cases, 72% in assault cases and 68% in sexual offences in 2002.Murder rates in Ireland are still comparatively low by comparison with international levels. Statistics for 2001 show that 52 people were murdered in that year and the figure for 2002 was 51. So far this year, a total of 44 people have lost their lives through unlawful killing in the State. In 15 of these cases only are the Garda of the view that they are related to gang activity.I have heard the Garda criticised in this House because, in the would-be expert view of some Deputies opposite, prosecutions are not coming fast enough in these cases. I acknowledge that killings within the criminal fraternity present the Garda with particular difficulties. There are huge profits involved in organised crime, particularly in the drugs trade with all its devastating consequences for the community. To these criminals money is everything and killing is a tool of their business. They are prepared to take whatever action is necessary to protect their positions against anyone who gets in their way, including violence and murder. However, it is important to emphasise that of the total number of murders this year, detections have already been recorded in 25 cases.All unlawful killings are the subject of exhaustive investigation by the Garda. There is no question of gang related deaths not being followed up with the same vigour as other killings. I will not countenance any suggestion by those opposite that the men and women of the Garda Síochána do otherwise. Regardless of how they are classified by the opposition and the media, the Garda subject all murders and violent crimes to detailed and thorough investigation. All the necessary technical services are deployed in the investigation of any killing. National units such as the national bureau of criminal investigation and the national drugs unit are available to assist where it is considered necessary. I am satisfied that everything possible is being done by the Garda Síochána in investigating such killings, in spite of all the difficulties involved.In that context I have heard Members of this House speak in dramatic terms of 50 or 60 organised gangs operating. Let us be clear about the extent of the problem. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a situation report on Irish organised crime groups for 2002, which has been submitted to EUROPOL, indicates there are 17 major organised crime groups in this jurisdiction. A small number of the major groups now have, or have had in the past, links to paramilitary organisations.In relation to public order, which became the subject of immediate public concern last year, I have also demonstrated that the matter could be tackled by immediate and effective legislative responses in the form of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act. The Garda Síochána has had considerable success in confronting street violence and public disorder. The Garda Commissioner informed me today that in the 12 month period from November 2002 to the end of October 2003 public order offences have sharply declined by 9% and violent assaults are down by more than 14%. This very considerable achievement reflects how good policing, adequately resourced and properly provided for in terms of legal reform, can turn the tide in a short time on what 12 months ago was described in this House as a crisis.We have a shifting focus in this House. Last year the concern was that people were being kicked to death as a result of drunken disorder in our streets.

Those disorderly scenes and drunkenness have been curbed. They were curbed by action taken by me in the face of considerable opposition from certain quarters in this House, although not all.Quietly and without fuss the Garda Síochána improved its public order policing methods. I heard Deputy Stanton say the Garda presence on the streets is non-existent. That is the kind of exaggerated hyped-up disparagement of the police that cuts no ice with me. If you go around the streets of Dublin and talk to people who are on the streets they will tell you that the gardaí have got their act together in the city centre areas and have produced a tremendous improvement in the sense of security and in tackling public order offences in the last year. I congratulate the Assistant Commissioner, Kevin Carty, on what he has done.One can talk about Garda morale. There they have an achievement and the Opposition knows that. Instead of acknowledging it Deputy Stanton says the presence of gardaí on the street is non-existent.

They need to know that while there may be disagreements between different parties and individuals as to what are the best solutions and approaches – and these will no doubt be reflected in political debate in this House – the Government, the people and the people's representatives are at one in saying to them that their acts of intimidation and their bully boy tactics will not succeed.They need to be in no doubt that their activities will be met head-on by the forces of law and order who have full Government support and the confidence to take them on. If they rely on misguided rumour and innuendo to the effect that Garda morale is such that thuggery will go unchallenged, they are making a big mistake. They are facing one of the best and most professional police forces, which has shown on many occasions since the foundation of the State that challenges by the forces of evil, some more grave than any we face now, will be met with strength and determination and that no lawless minority will be allowed to undermine public order or hold its neighbours in fear.There are more Garda resources in place now than ever before. This is a fact and not an empty claim. I have been able, as a result of prudent budgetary management and through the Garda authorities, to release further resources this year, and I will continue to do so next year. If the Garda Commissioner makes the best professional judgment that a further redirection of resources is required, he knows he has my support for any measures he takes. The criminal gangs can and will be taken out of circulation and their ill-gotten gains vigorously pursued within the rule of law and not outside its remit.I am grateful to Members for their vigorous participation in this debate. I stand for what Kevin O'Higgins stood: the forces of law and order, support of the Garda, an insistence on high standards and not compromising with low standards. This is the professionalism I require, obtain and will continue to obtain from the Garda Síochána with the help and support of all sides of the House. I appeal to the House to stop carping and sniping and support the Garda to help it win the battle.

It was certainly a casualty in his address which was interesting but contained more fiction than fact. He might submit it for the Booker prize. It gave the impression that everything was hunky-dory in the criminal justice system he represents and that everyone else is out of step except him.This Private Members' motion by Fine Gael is timely and welcome. Vicious family feuding in Limerick and gangland-type executions in Dublin have dominated the media in recent months. There have been 19 gangland killings already in 2003, compared with a total of eight in 2002, and only three prosecutions are pending. These are the harsh statistics.The country witnessed the recent debacle of moving the Central Criminal Court to Limerick, its being compelled to transfer back to Dublin when a jury could not be empanelled and the collapse of the trial because witnesses refused to testify—
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	434	Those were two different cases.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	435	That is what I am saying. The Minister is not listening to me. There was no worthwhile corroborative evidence other than that of those witnesses and therefore a nolle prosequi was entered, as was necessary. This was followed by the triumphant accused giving the two fingers to all and sundry outside the court. It constituted a potent symbol of the abject failure of the agents of the State at every level of the criminal justice system to protect citizens from organised crime and to prosecute a murder trial effectively.The subsequent hoax bomb threat to the outspoken journalist Paul Williams raised the spectre of the gangland execution in 1996 of Veronica Guerin, the most outspoken crime journalist of her era. How come we hear today that the Garda has removed protection from Paul Williams some days after the planting of the hoax bomb given that the amendment to the motion refers to the Minister's condemnation of the despicable actions of the criminals who placed the hoax bomb under the journalist's car and congratulates the Garda on prompt action in discovering the crime? This is the story in the newspapers today. Will the Minister clarify this matter?A palpable shudder of fear, disbelief and outrage shook the country after the collapse of the murder trial in the Central Criminal Court. The trial judge declared that the events in his court were unprecedented and the media declared a crisis in the thousands of column inches they produced since then. A newspaper poll showed that 83% of the public surveyed thought there was a crisis of crime. The Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights has now decided to hold hearings on the criminal justice issues relating to the collapse of the murder trial in the Central Criminal Court.Former detective inspector Gerry O'Carroll declared in the Sunday Independent last week that there were 980 applications from gardaí for the force's pre-retirement course. Will the Minister comment on this? The retired detective inspector also stated that Garda morale was at an all-time low. The Minister, as usual, lashed out at everyone, rejecting knee-jerk reactions and sound-bite proposals in general. On one day he stated that he would not allow the Constitution to be torn up and a few days later he approached the Sunday Independent to say that he was open to every proposal that might be made. He had little to offer other than that he was thinking about a Canadian judicial practice of allowing statements to be considered by the jury if a witness subsequently refused to testify or retracted his or her statement.The stewardship of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has been a shambles to date. It is no wonder that the poll in the Sunday Independent last Sunday showed 83% of the people interviewed were dissatisfied with his handling of organised crime. This is what people are thinking in the real world, not in the world reflected in the nice statement the Minister read to the House.The single greatest failure of the Minster was reneging on the pre-election promise of his party, the Progressive Democrats, and that of Fianna Fáil, and the coalition's collective post-election promise in its joint manifesto to "expand the Garda Síochána by a further 2,000" in excess of the planned strength of 12,000, which was to be reached by the end of 2002. At the end of 2003, we still have not even reached the 2002 target. The commitment to have 2,000 extra gardaí has been shelved.No amount of bluster will conceal that colossal deceit of the electorate. No action other than the provision of the extra gardaí will restore the confidence of the citizens who live in increasing fear of anti-social behaviour in their communities and who read in the newspapers, hear on the radio and view on their television sets daily accounts of the growing incidence of organised crime and brutal slayings.The unarmed garda in uniform on the beat who responds quickly to the call of the distressed citizen or who deters crime through his or her visibility on the street in the community epitomises perfectly the role of the Garda Síochána as the servant of the people and guardian of the peace, as envisaged by those who founded the organisation towards the beginning of the previous century. The Garda needs new structures to enable it to reconnect with people at community level and there is a great need for community police fora to be established urgently on a statutory basis. This will shift the role of the uniformed gardaí to one of community policing.If the election promises were kept, Garda numbers would be increased to 14,000. This is not a huge number considering that approximately double that number are employed in the private security services sector and that the British Government is deploying 14,000 policemen in London alone on the visit of President Bush to England today. Moreover, the recruitment of the extra gardaí would restore morale, give a breather to the existing overstretched Garda force and would allow for round the clock surveillance of targeted criminals.There is no substitute for a strong, well-motivated, well-trained, professional police force with adequate resources and the skills to adapt to the threat presented by the new generation of organised criminals. Drugs, prostitution, human trafficking, smuggling and fraud are at the heart of organised crime in Ireland in this century. Today, organised criminals have a ready supply of high-performance weapons and hired assassins to enforce their will on their patch. Wealth beyond their wildest dreams is the prize for those who work in this murky underworld. Rootless young men from the most deprived housing estates of Limerick, Dublin and Belfast have little to lose and much to gain. The fact that they are preying on their own people is of little consequence to them. Indeed, because they are preying on their own, they have often been left untouched by the police to wreak havoc and tear the heart out of defenceless communities.The establishment of an organised crime unit to combat organised crime is urgently needed. A month ago, the Garda Commissioner told the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights that the Garda Síochána is aware of the identities of the criminals but needed to get "lucky"– the Minister used the same term in the House – to catch and put them behind bars. Luck is not a factor in organised crime and should not be a factor in the Garda's pursuit of organised criminals. An organised crime unit would be a highly professional body with the detective tools, skills, resources and personnel to carry out investigatory work and would have the technology to mount sophisticated electronic surveillance. It would also have access to a new DNA databank which would provide the cutting edge for forensic evidence, something apparently badly lacking at present. It would recruit accounting and financial expertise and have access to Revenue and social welfare files. It would link up with Europol where international crime was involved and, as in the case of the Criminal Assets Bureau, officials from the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Forensic Science Laboratory would fast-track cases and evidence in order that organised crime offences would be dealt with and seen to be dealt with most expeditiously. An overall strategy combining swift action and sustained pressure emanating from a variety of directions would remove the element of luck from policing and replace it with one of professional efficiency.The reason for the collapse of a case in the Central Criminal Court today was faulty police procedures. Despite the recommendations made in 1978 by Mr. Justice Barra Ó Briain, no video recording equipment was in operation in Finglas and Blanchardstown Garda stations 20 years later. This is the fault of the Minister and his predecessors. Will the Minister give the House a commitment that another year will not elapse before such equipment is installed in every Garda station which has an interview room?
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I am pleased to have the opportunity to participate in this debate. I invite the Minister to visit my constituency, which is one of those areas in which there are, unfortunately, pockets of serious disadvantage and crime. Despite this, the few resources available to it are spread thinly. Deputies have frequently tabled parliamentary questions seeking resources for projects in the area, for example, the Rialto policing forum. We have failed to elicit a commitment that any money will be forthcoming for the forum which has been operating on a wing and a prayer. It is a well supported group to which the community is committed and local gardaí are responsive, but we cannot continue to operate without some form of funding to make it effective and viable. It is no longer possible to operate on a volunteer basis. The forum is located in an area with serious crime problems and social disadvantage which will not go away.I will not snipe at or criticise the Garda Síochána. I strongly support it in my area and recognise the hard work being done by gardaí with limited resources. They tell me that if we move resources into an area about which I have highlighted a problem, they will have to take them from another area, which will have a fall-out and lead to further problems down the line. The reality is that resources sufficient to inspire confidence in the community are not available on a consistent and continuous basis. The fall-out of this is that the community lives in fear and its members live in fortresses.There is a gangland element in parts of my constituency. I do not want to create the impression that the entire area is affected, but it has pockets where gangs operate. People know who these gangs are and live in fear and terror of their members who are completely out of control. We have had regular shootings and a number of murders in the area and it is not uncommon to have drug related crime. The crime we like to describe as joyriding is a continuous problem.The Minister made no mention of factors which would influence the prevention of crime. A commitment to joined-up thinking on crime prevention is badly needed. In areas where education is poorly subscribed, crime follows and this is the case in the pockets of my constituency to which I have referred. There are many socially disadvantaged people in my constituency who depend on back-up and supports. While some limited supports are available for children and, on occasion, for parents, I have not yet encountered any form of holistic approach which encompasses family. Without this, there is little point in introducing good support and services.Deputy Kenny referred to the differences between rich and poor at the ages of three months, three years, six years and so forth and the obvious effect of lack of education and social disadvantage as well as the consequent fall-out in terms of crime levels in areas of social disadvantage. I appeal to the Minister to give a much stronger commitment to crime prevention and to ensure such measures are given a much greater input. Tackling the outcome of crime is not the correct approach.As I stated, I recognise the commitment of the Garda Síochána. We all know good community gardaí who work diligently and show commitment. There is, however, a limit to what they can do. Local authorities also have an important role to play in ensuring the facilities they provide are well managed and maintained. Co-operation and integrated thinking is what is required in the area of crime prevention and control.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I thank my colleague, Deputy Costello, for sharing time. I wish to address the drug culture we are allowing to develop. I fully support the Garda Síochána's recent efforts and congratulate it on the major finds it has made in recent months. These are, however, the tip of the iceberg. We must introduce further support mechanisms to maximise the potential of Garda efforts and ensure that we prevent a drug culture from developing.If a recent drugs find in a nightclub in the north of the State is typical of nightclubs elsewhere, it provides evidence to sustain my theory that we are allowing a drug culture to develop. My theory derives from approaches made to me, including by children, and encounters I have had on the streets. The number of gardaí with appropriate expertise is not sufficient to deal with the drug pushers, who are moving to greenfield sites. When the Garda Síochána is successful in Dublin, drug dealers are pushed out into large towns and even smaller towns in rural areas. We must ensure that appropriate expertise and additional gardaí are provided and that the development of community policing is permitted. If we do not try to reduce the market for drugs, we will allow the drug culture to take on frightening proportions.The Garda Síochána has been successful in my local area. One reads in all the local newspapers of cases where the Garda has brought people before the courts on drugs charges. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing problem. Young people attending secondary schools and third level institutions will tell one that any drug one wants is available on the market. Will the Minister explain to the House how we will defeat the drugs culture? How will we ensure that our young people, the next generation, will not have the threat of drugs hanging over them?The Minister referred to the RAPID programme. This programme is operating in my home town but, unfortunately, no funding has been provided to sustain it. There is a wonderful co-ordinator in the town but she will confirm that the funding has not been made available.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue. There was a great deal of political controversy in the early 1980s about the British Government's view that it was making an excessive net contribution to the European Union. The basis of the British case was that its VAT base was too high compared with that of other member states, it was a below average beneficiary of the Common Agricultural Policy and was, therefore, making an overpayment.To meet the British concern the Fontainebleau European Council of June 1984 agreed the UK rebate. It is a complicated formula which consists of paying back to the UK about two thirds of the difference between what it contributes and what it receives from EU expenditure. In effect, Margaret Thatcher handbagged the other member states with the threat of blocking expansion of the EU.For many years the UK argued that the rebate could not be renegotiated while CAP reform was not seriously addressed. Pressure is now mounting among EU member states to end the rebate. The German EU Commissioner for Enlargement, Mr. Günter Verheugen, speaking at the German SPD party congress last weekend, said that continuation of the rebate is not feasible. He based his arguments, among other things, on the pressure that is being unfairly applied to the poorer states to pay these moneys. It is clearly unfair that they should have to pay the wealthier country.Officials from the Department of Finance told the European affairs committee last week that the sum has not been significantly changed since 1984 and that the basis for its calculation has not significantly changed. More surprisingly, they agreed that there is no scientific definition of an overpayment and that it is based on a political calculation. Next year the UK rebate will cost the Irish taxpayer €98 million.The current arrangements run out in 2006 but there is an opportunity for Ireland to take a lead on this issue ahead of enlargement. It is a patently unfair system. I reject the view that Ireland should be silent out of gratitude for the manner in which the EU has funded Irish development in the past few years. Ireland has sacrificed a great deal during its membership, particularly fishery rights. We approached the issue of CAP reform maturely and, in that context, the days of the rebate are numbered. In light of the new financial perspective in the EU, the Growth and Stability Pact, the renegotiation of CAP and the enlargement of the EU, it is time the British EU rebate was reconsidered. It is a legacy of history and has little relevance today. It is a drain on the resources of member states for the benefit of one country.The officials from the Department of Finance who spoke to the European affairs committee could not fully explain the basis of the calculation of Ireland's contribution. It is supposed to be based on our gross national income but it is not made clear whether this refers to GNP, GDP or something different. If it is GDP, it is clear that Ireland's contribution has increased out of proportion in recent years on the basis of repatriated profits. This is a factor that uniquely affects Ireland. Nearly €100 million could be saved by the Irish Exchequer if the rebate system to the UK is abolished. This money could be used to finance vital services and projects. I call on the Minister to acknowledge that this payment is out of date and out of kilter with EU reforms.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	439	It might be useful to give the historical background to this issue. The origins of the UK rebate essentially lie in two factors that prevailed at the time of the UK's accession to the European Community. The first was the relatively small size of the UK's agricultural sector which, given the predominance of agricultural spending in the Community budget at that time, meant that the UK received a relatively small share of total Community spending. The second factor was that because of the high level of farm imports from outside the Community to the UK, the associated transfer of agricultural levies to the Community budget and the UK's relatively large VAT base, the UK was making a relatively large contribution to the financing of the Community budget. These factors combined to produce a situation where the UK, despite the fact that its national income per head was below the Community average, was a major net contributor to the Community budget.This was a matter of serious political controversy almost from the moment of the UK's accession to what was then the EEC. From 1975, a series of correcting mechanisms were introduced in an attempt to resolve the controversy. The first mechanism was agreed by the European Council in Dublin in March 1975. However, it was never triggered and nothing was paid to the UK under it. A second correction mechanism was agreed at the Dublin European Council of November 1979. This provided for compensation for the UK in the form of specific expenditure measures favourable to the UK. However, this, too, failed to resolve the concerns of the UK.The third of these correcting mechanisms was agreed at the Fontainebleau European Council in 1984 and the basic principles of the mechanism agreed at Fontainebleau have operated since then. Subsequent agreements about EU financing have incorporated and reflected the Fontainebleau agreement. The mechanism for calculating the rebate is extremely complex. The formula takes account of the UK's share of the EU's uncapped VAT base, the UK's share of total EU allocated expenditure, the total amount of EU allocated expenditure, the agreed rebate rate of 66% and certain changes since 1984 in the EU own resources system which have benefited the UK.This correction mechanism, which underlies the current arrangements for the UK rebate, was arrived at after much vigorous political debate and negotiation over several years. The issue could be said to have almost dominated the EU agenda in the early 1980s. It certainly dominated relations between the UK and the EU. The UK rebate arrangements represented a political agreement between the member states as to what was the most acceptable solution to what had become a most contentious issue.Decisions on the method of financing the EU, known as the EU's own resources system, including the UK rebate, are taken by unanimity. The UK rebate will be one of many important issues that will arise for discussion during the upcoming negotiations on the post-2006 financing and expenditure of the EU. It looks likely that the substantive debate on post-2006 EU finances might well start during our Presidency from January to June 2004. The negotiations are likely to take some time and will certainly not conclude during the Irish Presidency. It can take the best part of two years to reach agreement in negotiations of this type. The substantive debate will begin when the Commission, which has the right of initiative, sends to the European Council a communication on post-2006 EU financing. We expect to see the communication in the next few months.A Presidency is expected to progress issues with a view to advancing the interests of the EU as a whole and with a view to securing political agreement among member states and EU institutions. Ireland will fulfil its responsibilities in this regard. In the negotiations over the next couple of years, Ireland will, like every member state, defend its national interests in the common endeavour to agree policies that best serve the objectives and ambitions of the EU. The final agreement will encompass all issues, including the UK rebate, and will reflect what is politically acceptable to all member states of the EU.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	440	The purpose of this debate is to invite the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to explain to taxpayers the circumstances in which he approved allocations of State funds to Punchestown Agricultural and Equestrian Event Centre. He should explain what financial and management controls were utilised by him to evaluate the project and indicate whether the €17 million of State funding spent on this project is recoverable or secured by a security on the centre or on the lands and assets of Punchestown Racecourse.The primary responsibility of a Minister for Finance in hard times – this Minister is particularly fond of lecturing us about this – is to make hard decisions on spending priorities. If the Minister of the day is seen to take a soft option in the interests of local pet projects or personal cronies while vital areas of public capital expenditure, such as health and education, are postponed or cut back, this brings the profession of politics into disrepute. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report and the Committee of Public Accounts hearings have disclosed that this project received 100% funding in several tranches and seems to have been fast-tracked by means of private agreements reached directly between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Agriculture and Food.Anyone who has sought money for a new school, a falling down school, a hospital ward to be opened or an extension to a community hall must wonder how the "tally-ho brigade" in Kildare were able to winkle such enormous amounts of money out of the Minister almost like magic. My first question is was the project agreed by the Minister and the Minister for Agriculture and Food at the races, because there is a letter on record indicating to the Minister for Agriculture and Food that he was grateful for the interest and commendation already shown to the project? The project was approved and on two occasions funding was increased from the original €6.9 million to €14.8 million, even though under an agreement of 9 August 2000, the second tranche of money was to be the last.In October 2001, Punchestown sought a further €1.5 million, mainly for works to satisfy the planning requirements of Kildare County Council. This was sanctioned in record time by the Minister for Finance four months later on 31 January, bringing total State funding for the project to €14.8 million. We do not want too much guff from the Minister about how this is a wonderful project, the like of which has never been seen throughout Europe. While we wish the project much success, and we wish horse-racing in Ireland and the Minister's enjoyment of the races equal success, that is not the point. The "horsey set" are very well off and very few projects get 100% funding. Therefore, why were the terms of the 9 August agreement breached by the Minister in October 2001 and at the end of January 2002? Why did the Department of Finance not act to require a proper analysis of the proposal submitted by the Department of Agriculture and Food? What is the current status of the guidelines issued by the Department of Finance for the evaluation of major capital projects? The Minister should not tell us the Department of Finance is now taking a hands-off approach to evaluating projects because he told us recently that he is tightening the screw on evaluations. What is the status of the Government's financial control procedures and the requirement on Departments to obtain the approval of the Department of Finance for the funding of projects? What does the phenomenal speed with which the project was approved represent? It has the appearance of two Ministers personally approving a proposal and pushing it through without any proper scrutiny – something for their friends, and nothing less.Areas throughout the country have been left short of €1 million, €2 million or €5 million for primary schools. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cut funding this year for the probation and welfare service. Yet the Minister's friends in the "tally-ho brigade" received €17 million while scarcely submitting more than an invitation to lunch at the racecourse or visiting the Minister in his clinic, a very important way to get either tax breaks or to get the Minister to give other schemes the go ahead. We need an explanation because people throughout the country are hurting from the kind of cutbacks the Minister has deemed appropriate to impose. There will be a huge increase in the numbers of homeless because of what the Minister has done in regard to rent allowances, yet he could find €17 million for his friends. This is 100% funding with almost no conditionality. We do not even know if the State holds some kind of security for these assets in the event of the whole project failing. All we know is that Santa's kingdom will base itself in the centre for the next few months. Not only was the Minister playing Santa Claus to the Kildare hunt, but he appears determined to keep on doing so.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I am particularly pleased at the opportunity offered by the Deputy to explain my involvement in the provision of funding for the Punchestown Event Centre and to reiterate my support for the project.Punchestown has a long and rich history and is associated world-wide with national hunt racing and eventing. The new facilities provided at Punchestown over the past five years or so have made a major contribution to making Punchestown the attraction it is. I have long been a supporter of the various developments at Punchestown, both in terms of the racecourse facilities and the Agriculture Event and Exhibition Centre, which have transformed it into the world class facility it is today.It is ironic that the Opposition have just now woken up to the issue of the funding of the event centre, given that its funding has been before Deputies for consideration on no less than eight separate occasions, between June 2000 and June 2003. No one can argue that the provision of funding for the centre was not open and transparent. I refer the Deputy to the Vote of the Department of Agriculture and Food for the years concerned where funding for the centre appeared in bold print in its own dedicated subhead.It appears that the biggest problem some critics of the project have is not its existence but its location. The fact is that no other promoter made an approach to provide such a facility and, in the context of the scale of the facilities required, the large land bank available at Punchestown made that location particularly suitable. No doubt, however, there are those opposite who would have preferred if we located the centre in Mount Merrion. I might also add that the public funding of such centres is not unusual throughout Europe. At least the then Fine Gael spokesman on agriculture welcomed the location of the centre when, on 13 June 2001, he said "I am delighted to see that in subhead E5, funding is provided for the establishment of a new agriculture and eventing exhibition and international show and competition centre at Punchestown. I am not being parochial when I say that because as it happens, Punchestown is across the road from my constituency."Perhaps it would assist the Deputy to understand the role of the Minister and the Department of Finance in regard to the allocation of public funds. Next year, for example, Departments and offices will spend more than €40 billion. As the Deputy knows, there are a range of Departments which deal with different areas of Government activity. Over the years these Departments have developed the expertise and experience needed to make decisions as to the merits of particular projects that come before them. Surely the Deputy is not suggesting that the Department of Finance should sit in its ivory tower and second-guess the activities and decisions of every other Department.For too long, my Department has been criticised for imposing its dead hand on other Departments and preventing them from using their experience and judgment.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Thankfully, we are moving away from those days and I have yet to hear anyone suggesting a return to them.This project and its funding were subject to careful appraisal within the Department of Agriculture and Food. I have full confidence in that Department in this regard. An application for my approval of funding came only after the Department had fully satisfied itself as to the merits of the project. I was aware of, and indeed shared, the view of the Department of Agriculture and Food of the need for a facility of international standard suitable for the holding of agricultural shows and exhibitions. I fully share that Department's view that the central and accessible location of Punchestown, the space available and its place as the centre of eventing and national hunt horseracing in Ireland for many years made it the ideal location for the centre.The facts are that the Punchestown authorities wrote to the Department of Agriculture and Food in November 1999 with a proposal for an event and exhibition centre at an estimated cost of €7 million. The Minister for Agriculture and Food sought approval for the funding on 20 January 2000 and I conveyed sanction for the spending. In June 2002, the Minister for Agriculture and Food sought approval for additional funding of €6 million, which I approved the following month. Arising from planning conditions imposed by Kildare County Council, the Minister for Agriculture and Food sought sanction for a further €1.5 million, which I approved, subject to the money being found from within the resources of the Department of Agriculture and Food.The event centre is now operational and has hosted a number of significant events, not least the highly prestigious European Eventing Championship and the Open Endurance Championships in September last. Its location, size and adaptability will ensure it continues to play host to a variety of events in the years to come and it will contribute significantly to the financial recovery of Punchestown. This centre is fundamentally a good thing and enjoys my full support. It is already proving its worth. I have no apologies to make about my involvement and I am certain the State's contribution has now resulted in a world class event centre in which we can all take pride.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I am glad the Ministers for Finance and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are present because this is a matter of injustice and lack of finance. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. The issue most frequently raised at my clinic concerns the elderly who find it very difficult to get care in their old age. Families come in desperation. In some cases there are no families, in which case friends and neighbours come to see how on earth this problem can be dealt with. The issue is one of nursing home subventions. The ways in which people can be looked after include respite care, the winter bed initiative, subvention and in beds run by the North-Eastern Health Board. This issue is a nightmare for some of these families.I recall a case last week which concerned a 91 year old lady who lives at home with her 87 year old brother in an old farmhouse. Her neighbour came to me in desperation because she had to sign herself out of Drogheda hospital. When she arrived at Esker Lodge nursing home, County Cavan, she had to sign a form stating that she would not stay more than ten days, although she had broken her hip. That is inhuman. The lady was not getting physiotherapy. However, the personnel with whom I dealt were sympathetic and I believe she is being looked after. The pressure to which she was subjected is uncalled for.Another case is that of a 90 year old man who has been blind for some years and is no longer able to look after himself. As a result of a stroke his wife is in a wheelchair. He was in and out of hospital and sent here and yonder. He was informed that, because there was no winter bed initiative in Monaghan General Hospital and since he would have to be cared for on a long-term basis, his only hope was, possibly, Northern Ireland. How could his wife, who is in a wheelchair, travel there to see him? What arrangements would be made from a financial point of view?It is important to remember that there are 64 people on a waiting list for subvention, one of whom is 99 years of age. This is ridiculous at a time when, as the last speaker admitted, €15 million could be found for Punchestown. It appears money can be found for everything else while the aged, the handicapped and the elderly suffer.For those over 80 years of age, 128 per 1,000 are looked after nationally – in the mid-west the number is 140 and in the north-east the number is 91. I merely want to prove we are not abusing the system. Of those in nursing homes, 46% in the north-east are in the high dependency mode – the national average is 35%. The number of subvention beds nationally is 14 per 1,000 – in the mid-west the number is 23 per 1,000 while in the north-east it is 11. The number of non-acute beds nationally is 55 per 1,000 – in the mid-west it is 66 per 1,000 and in the north-east it is 45. So much for the Good Friday Agreement and all the help we are supposed to get in the Border area.When the service commenced subvention was demand led. Before the last election 250 places could be subvented and now we are being asked to reduce the number to 156. If we were allowed to maintain the level at that of two years ago, none of those people would be on the waiting list. The health budget has increased by 130% to 140% during the past five years. Why have people in the north-east, especially in the Cavan-Monaghan region, to suffer such savage cuts on behalf of the most vulnerable in society? Those who have worked a lifetime and given their life to this nation are under extreme stress. Irrespective of where the money is found, I ask the Minister to ensure the subvented beds are restructured.It is not that there is a scarcity of beds in nursing homes. There is a nursing home outside Monaghan, at Mullinahinch, which has only a few people in it. It is a brand new state-of-the-art nursing home. Its proprietors were encouraged to build it and told to get subvention. There is another in south Monaghan, along the Broomfield stretch, which is half full. The position is similar in Cavan. It is not that the beds are not available but rather the people cannot afford them. There is a need for restructuring, and for God's sake, I beg that this be done.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	445	As the Deputy will appreciate, I am standing in on behalf of the Minister for Health and Children.The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 permit health boards to enter into arrangements with private nursing home owners and to pay more than the maximum rate of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for each health board in the context of meeting increasing demands for subvention within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letter of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) ( No. 3) Act 1996.Significant additional funding has been provided for the nursing home subvention scheme since its introduction in 1993. In 1994, the first full year of the operation of the scheme, €15million was made available to the health boards to administer the scheme and approximately 3,200 clients received subvention. However, due to a range of factors, including demographics, increasing demand, increasing dependency levels among clients and increased availability of private nursing home beds, the cost of the scheme has risen substantially every year. Funding for the scheme in 2003 will amount to approximately €115 million, with approximately 8,860 clients in receipt of subvention, approximately 53% of whom are in receipt of an enhanced subvention payment.Deputy Crawford will be aware that the authority and the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, are receiving increasing numbers of applications from clients for enhanced subvention under articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993. It is a matter for each board and the authority to determine the extent to which such applications can be met having regard to the requirement to stay within their overall financial allocations.The Department of Health and Children has had regular discussions with the authority and the health boards, including the North-Eastern Health Board, concerning increasing demands on the nursing home subvention scheme. However, it should be noted that the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations do not specify a maximum amount to be paid in respect of enhanced subvention. A decision relating to the amount to be paid is a matter for each health board, following assessment on a case by case basis and bearing in mind their obligation to comply with article 20 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations 1993 as well as the Health (Amendment) ( No. 3) Act 1996. Article 20 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations provides that, if under section 31 of the Health Act 1970 the Minister specifies a limit on the expenditure to be incurred in providing services under the Act, a board may pay such amounts as would enable it to contain its expenditure within the specified limit.As the Deputy will be aware, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been carried out by Professor Eamon O'Shea, National University of Ireland Galway. The review was commissioned jointly by the Departments of Health and Children and Finance following from a Government decision in 1999. The O'Shea report was formally launched on 25 June 2003 at a joint press conference with my colleague, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, launched the Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland at the joint press conference. Following from the publication of the O'Shea and Mercer reports it was agreed that a working group should be established by my Department to review the operation of the nursing home subvention scheme.The objective of the review is to develop a scheme which will be transparent, offer a high standard of care for clients, provide equity within the system to include standardised dependency and means testing, be less discretionary; provide both a home and nursing home subvention depending on need, be consistent in implementation throughout the country and draw on experience of the operation of the old scheme. The Department will also consult all stakeholders as part of the review process.A number of health boards are running pilot personal care package schemes which include home based subvention payments.The introduction of a home-based subvention was recommended by Professor O'Shea in his report on the scheme. Applications for home-based subventions are considered from or on behalf of those requiring long-stay residential care, particularly in private nursing homes. The Department advice to health boards is to apply the criteria for eligibility for a nursing home subvention scheme to any application for a home-based subvention.

#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I thank the Minister for staying to answer this Adjournment Debate. As the Curragh Prison is in my constituency and I see it almost every day I pass through the Curragh, it was natural for people to come to me regarding their concerns at the closure which the Minister recently proposed.The representations come from three different sources. Prison officers are deeply concerned about what will happen their position, where they will be transferred, the criteria to be used, the timescale and so on. Almost all of them have families and they see problems arising because they have mortgages and have made a commitment to the Curragh and to the prison, all of which could change within a few weeks.The educational staff attached to Kildare VEC are also concerned. There are five full-time staff members, two temporary full-time and eight part-time. They have made a great effort to ensure their work has therapeutic and educational benefits for the prison inmates. This has been successful in that 91% of the inmates are involved in educational and therapeutic classes.Last but not least are those who have relatives in the prison. It is always sad to see someone at a hospital or a prison but there is perhaps nothing more sad than to see people waiting to visit prison. One can fully understand their concerns as to what will happen. They derive comfort from the enclosed nature of the Curragh Prison because their family members are receiving educational and therapeutic benefits, but they wonder what will happen when their relatives are moved to a different prison, including the level or privacy and protection they can expect. That is my major concern.Last Thursday, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment told the House that the prison may not close. I understood her to say the Minister's stance is a negotiating position in the context of the ongoing union-management problem of excessive overtime. If that is the case I ask the Minister to give a clear undertaking tonight that the problem encountered by the prison staff, the educational staff, the inmates and their families is not being used as a ploy or a pawn in the game of trying to resolve this problem. If it is to be used in that way it will be a sad state of affairs. I doubt that was the Minister's intention in his proposal to close the prison. I hope in his reply he will address my concerns about what will happen if the present prison inmates are integrated in the midlands or Portlaoise, or wherever, and what will happen to the educational staff whose contract is with the Kildare VEC.The prison officers are deeply concerned because they have made a commitment to the Curragh Prison and their families are attached to the neighbourhood or the catchment area of the prison. They have developed social and family links there as well as commitments to building houses and paying mortgages and so on. I hope that in giving his response the Minister will offer some way of alleviating those concerns.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-11-18 00:00:00	Prelude	448	As I said in the course of an Adjournment Debate on Fort Mitchel last week, I have no desire to close or mothball any prison and that includes the Curragh Prison. My preference is for an agreed way forward which is beneficial to both management and staff. The proposal put forward by management not only included a fully operational prison service at Fort Mitchel, the Curragh, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, but also a prison service-run centralised escort corps.The management proposal presented an opportunity for staff to move from a culture of working as many hours as possible to a system whereby the emphasis would be on working less and working smart for guaranteed and consistent levels of income which, by any standard in the public sector, would still be extremely attractive. Under the management proposal, a typical basic grade prison officer with ten years service would earn approximately €54,000 per annum from 2004 onwards, and an officer in this rank with 13 years service would be on the maximum of the scale, earning in excess of €61,000 per annum from 2004 onwards. That is the management's proposal. Many officers in the Curragh Prison are in the latter position. I exclude from this the lump sum offered to officers of €12,250 spread over the next three years because this is a non-returning item. This is what is on the table in the context of keeping the Curragh Prison open. That message should be clearly understood.There is still a window of opportunity for the Prison Officers' Association to come back to the negotiating table and adopt a more realistic approach to the discussions with a view to reaching a mutually acceptable solution. However, time is fast running out and if the Prison Officers' Association is unwilling to agree reasonable terms for the operation of prisons on an economically sustainable basis before 1 January 2004, I have no option, in view of the Estimates published yesterday, but to proceed with the decisions approved by the Government. The responsibility for the choice which must be made rests entirely with the Prison Officers' Association. It is now in the association's hands.Deputies are aware of the context within which the Government decision was made. Negotiations have been ongoing for seven years. The present impasse with the association was reached despite my giving it 90 days in which to come to an agreement, subsequently establishing another process for negotiation involving Bill Attley and Joe McGovern. The intractable nature of the ensuing impasse led me to seek Government approval for the measures I had to take because present arrangements cannot continue.I understand the Deputy's point about the concerns expressed by the prison staff, the prisoners and their relatives. If the proposals I have put on the table, which I have outlined to the Deputy, were accepted, the Curragh Prison would remain open. However, I have been forced to make this decision following not only the failure of the Prison Officers' Association to engage in reasonable negotiation so far, but its tabling of a demand for a basic pay increase or, as an alliterative, that an extra 1,200 officers be recruited. This year, between €60 million and €64 million will be spent on overtime, depending on what happens in the few remaining weeks to year's end. That is substantially more than the entire Garda overtime budget.Earlier this evening, Deputy Wall heard the coruscating criticism of me from his side of the House for the resources that are available to the Garda. That €64 million is divided among 3,300 prison officers whereas the approximate figure of €56 million which the Garda is getting is divided among 11,900 gardaí. Between three and four times as much overtime per capita goes to prison officers as to the Garda. In that context I have done everything I can possibly do. I have put on the table a package which, instead of requiring prison officers to work all the hours God gave them to earn absolutely unconscionable amounts of money, reflects a totally different philosophy whereby they earn the salaries I have mentioned to Deputy Wall, very good salaries by international comparison, for as few hours as the Prison Service can possibly be run on. There will be no incentive for prison officers to maximise overtime and every incentive for them to get home to their families and out on to the golf courses or do whatever else they want to do with their spare time.I fully appreciate the Deputy's concerns and I know why he has raised them in the House today, but there is an air of unreality to all of this. I hope to meet representatives of the POA later this week to get the negotiation process back on the rails again. I ask the association to look at this offer and consider the interests of its members. It is a choice between a struggle with me, which they cannot win because the money is not there, or alternatively a compromise which has been offered to them and grants them very good basic salaries and every incentive to restore to them their own time, allow them back to their families and hobbies, and enjoy a decent lifestyle. The choice is theirs, and if one of those choices is made, the Curragh and Fort Mitchell prisons will be operated as Prison Service institutions into the future. If I am forced by the POA to opt for the other choice, I have no alternative but to implement the Government decision from 1 January.The Dáil adjourned at 9.10 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 19 November 2003.
