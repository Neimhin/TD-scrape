I have selected the matters raised by Senators McCarthy, Leyden and Quinn and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senator Kitt may give notice of the matter he wishes to raise on another day.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business shall be No. 1, Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 – Order for Second Stage and Second Stage, with the contributions of spokespersons for each group not to exceed 30 minutes – this follows requests from two or three of the parties that speaking time be increased from 20 minutes to 30 minutes, to which I am glad to accede – and those of all other Senators not to exceed 15 minutes and on which Senators may share time, the debate to commence at the conclusion of the Order of Business, to continue until 5 p.m. and resume at 7 p.m. and continue until everyone who wishes to speak has spoken; No. 2, statements on the Convention on the Future of Europe, during which we will have the presence of the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, to be taken from 5 p.m. until 7 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I propose an amendment to the Order of Business: that No. 1 be deleted, that the matter not be debated until such time as the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service organises a meaningful review and consultation with all interested parties on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 and that any proposal or proposals to amend the principal legislation prior to the conclusion of such a review be regarded by Seanad Éireann as premature.My party will oppose today's Order of Business as the Leader is, in effect, proposing a guillotine of our proceedings in the House tonight and, in a most unseemly way, attempting to rush through what is poorly thought out and ill-considered legislation. The Government is wrong to rush it through the House. The Bill was published only on Friday. Most colleagues received it in their post either yesterday or today. We have not been given enough time for any kind of review of the matter to take place. None of the players involved in the freedom of information regime has been properly consulted by any committee of the Oireachtas. For us to advance the Government's proposal at this stage would be wrong and completely against the all-party spirit in which the Freedom of Information Act was put in place in 1997.I understood the objective of the alleged watchdog, the Progressive Democrats, was to keep an eye on Fianna Fáil.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I am sure we all send our best wishes to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the talks on Northern Ireland and wish the talks well. Will the Leader assure the House that when a conclusion is reached, which we hope will be positive, we will be able to discuss the matter in the House this week?Will colleagues join the Committees on Procedure and Privileges in supporting the legal challenge to the absurd ruling of the Morris tribunal in respect of the case being taken by Senator Jim Higgins and Deputy Howlin? Will colleagues on all sides support them in ensuring the principle of parliamentary privilege, enshrined in the Constitution, is maintained?
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	6	Everyone must agree that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 is being rushed through. It is the revenge of Sir Humphrey to get the Bill spun through as quickly as possible and all the pain over with in one day by pulling all the teeth together. It reflects badly on the Government. Senator Hayes's proposal has much merit. While we all agree that certain amendments should be made to the legislation, we object to the replacement of open government with a Stalinist iron curtain around information on the workings of government.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The progressive wing of the Government is upset by this but, unfortunately, that is where matters stand. We have not had an assessment of how well or badly the Act is working. In the main it is working very well. However, issues need and can be addressed. The contents of the Bill have taken everyone by surprise. There has been no consultation with those who use the legislation, including the NUJ, Senator Ross's union. I know my right wing colleague is upset by the idea of access to the workings of the Establishment but this must take place. Consultation is an essential part of any review which has not taken place. I will save my comments on the Bill until we debate it. I am simply giving the reasons I am supporting Senator Brian Hayes's proposal which the Government should consider.Last week I raised the question of having a debate on public private partnerships. I said unidentifiable forces were at work to upscuttle their proper workings. Such partnerships allow the State to get support from the private sector to give better public service in a way that is attractive to all. One of the reasons given for objecting to PPPs is that EUROSTAT maintains public private partnerships impact on the Government's bottom line. In a recent statement Mr. Pat Cox made it clear that this was not the case.We have been led to believe – I have not had time to check it – that, for example, the Cork School of Music project was scuttled on the basis that it was having an impact on the Government's bottom line, which is untrue. Clarification is required. I will not point the finger at anybody until we discover who has been making these statements. The Minister for Finance could do much to help us. Perhaps, this afternoon, as a gesture on FOI, he might decide to deal with some of these issues.We have had many debates in the House on corruption in planning. There have been all sorts of inquiries into who received money, who obtained receipts and what was built. If what happened in Loughrea this week happened in north Dublin, we would oblige people to climb trees in order to find out what happened.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I compliment Senator Ulick Burke on taking a brave stand on this issue. It is something that should concern every Member. There should be an inquiry into what is happening in planning in Galway. This is not a political or a party issue; everyone in the House should seek to discover why these questions are being asked. Those on Galway County Council should recognise that they are not separate from the rest of the world and if they take decisions like this, they will have to answer questions in another place at another time. There is something not right here. We should intervene on this issue and seek a full inquiry or, at least, an explanation. This is a matter for the Department of the Environment and Local Government and the area to which it relates needs to be opened up. I hope Senator Ulick Burke will seek a debate in the House where it can be discussed. I would be happy to support him in making such a request.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	13	On a normal Tuesday there are so many issues I would like to raise. The decision by the police authorities in London to reintroduce officers on the beat, having discovered, as everyone knew, that this works or the heroic display of democracy by the Parliament of Turkey last weekend in the face of the most extraordinary bribery are issues we should debate.I wish to be associated with the remarks of Senator Brian Hayes and I wish the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister success at Stormont. I am sure the Taoiseach is lecturing the parties in Northern Ireland about dialogue, consultation, the need for openness and transparency and the need to keep all channels of communications open and not to take decisions in a way which alienates large sections of the population.This brings me to the extraordinary situation in which we find ourselves. The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, as published by the Government, arrived at my home in Cork yesterday at around midday. If the Government had its way, that would have been the first I would have seen of it. It would have been an utterly unintelligible Bill because it consists of a series of amendments to an Act. I do not have the entire Acts of the Oireachtas in my personal library. Fortunately, however, the Internet – not the Government – came to my assistance.I have been presented with a Bill which an increasing section of public opinion – the voluntary organisations, the media, the organisations which represent journalists, the Opposition parties – agrees is not merely a minor change. To quote something I said in the House on 5 February, it is a subversion of the freedom of information legislation. When I asked the Leader on 5 February whether the Government proposed to subvert the Freedom of Information Act she gave a rare and categorical "No", from which I can only conclude that she either has no influence or no shame. One way or another, this House was conned about the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003.I formally support and second the Fine Gael amendment to the Order of Business. This Bill does not deserve consideration. Labour Party Members always want to be constructive and, as soon as time permits, we will introduce a Bill which will respond to the Government's apparent concern about the five-year limit by proposing that it be extended by another year. We will also propose a structure of proper consultation which will lead to a consensus. This is an issue that ought to be dealt with by consensus. If it is not dealt with in that way, the public is entitled to believe there is a hidden agenda.I believe this is part of the secret deal for Government under which the Progressive Democrats will remain quiet and Fianna Fáil will get its wish and return to the way it likes to do business best, namely, to deal with issues in secret. As Senator O'Toole said, Fianna Fáil and the Civil Service will withdraw into their Stalinist cocoon of secrecy.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	18	In terms of the way the House does its business, to produce a Bill of such gargantuan impact on a Friday morning and demand that we dispose of it by Tuesday night is an example of the Fianna Fáil of old, which I thought had been consigned to history. Some things emerge after a period: first, a leopard does not change its spots; and, second, a poodle is no match for a leopard.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	24	It is totally wrong to suggest that the Bill, which will be considered today and which should be debated on Second Stage and not on the Order of Business, is a subversion. I reject that assertion. The Bill was published last week and was discussed a great deal in the press at the weekend. I am sure most people have a particular attitude to the Bill, but I do not believe there is anything a committee could achieve which this House cannot achieve in an open debate. The Leader has allocated a generous 30 minutes per speaker.It is utterly wrong to suggest that a guillotine is being imposed. The Leader explicitly said that the debate would continue this evening for as long as people wanted to contribute. Furthermore, this is a Seanad Bill and there will be an interval between its passage through this House and its introduction in the Lower House. There will be adequate time for consultation during that period and between today's debate and the taking of Committee Stage here next week. There is nothing unusual in the way the Bill has been published or is being considered. The House will have adequate time to debate its merits and consider amendments to it.I agree with Senator Brian Hayes in regard to something which is of far more importance, that is, the events taking place in Hillsborough today. I wish the Government and all the parties participating well in their endeavours and I hope there will be a successful outcome which will ensure the peace we have enjoyed in recent years will continue and be enhanced. It is wrong to suggest that the Taoiseach would lecture the parties in Northern Ireland. Even if he were so disposed to do so, I doubt if the parties in Northern Ireland would be prepared to listen to such a lecture.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	26	In regard to the Morris tribunal, another matter to which Senator Brian Hayes referred, it is perhaps somewhat excessive to say the that ruling is absurd. Nevertheless, I take the point that the House has an obligation to protect the privilege of its Members in regard to papers and to communications made to them in confidence. As the Cathaoirleach will be aware from his chairmanship of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, we have already affirmed that on not one but two occasions. I am confident that affirmation will be successful if, indeed, contested in the courts.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	27	Will the Leader of the House request her successor, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to come into the House and assure us that Eircom will guarantee equal access for all to affordable line provision? That Eircom has broken the conditions of its licence means that many in certain parts of the country will not have affordable access to line provision. Given that it currently holds the majority market share, there is no alternative in some cases but to seek line provision from Eircom. It is, therefore, of the utmost importance that the Minister clearly shows he has teeth with regard to making Eircom comply with the conditions under which it got its licence.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I support Senator Brian Hayes's amendment to the Order of Business. This is important legislation which needs to be treated with due care and consideration. The Government has not done this. The fact that it simply appointed five departmental Secretaries General to produce it and significantly failed to consult its own Information Commissioner weakens the approach to the Bill.One must be very careful with animal analogies, particularly those referring to poodles. The effeminacy of poodles has been greatly exaggerated. They can be extremely vicious animals. I am quite sure—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Is this on the Order of Business?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	33	It is very much on the Order of Business. I wish to raise a couple of other matters, of which one is the question of the abuse of taxi plates. This surfaced in the Sunday newspapers and has been the subject of a good deal of comment—
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	34	The Leader might give her view.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	36	I am asking a question which is a little long-winded. It was indicated on the airwaves that an amendment to the legislation might be required. It is appropriate that this be done in this House because, whereas nothing criminal has been done and one cannot do other than admire his entrepreneurial ingenuity, it seems Mr. O'Leary puts his own transport requirements way above those of other citizens, which is not appropriate in a republic.I agree with Senator Ryan that it would be useful for us to continue to monitor the situation regarding Iraq, in particular because it would provide us with an opportunity for a bit of a gloat at the action of the Turkish Parliament in which the members were described as standing up jubilantly, all except the Finance Minister, Mr. Ali Baba, who sat with his head in his hands as he watched the bribes disappearing down the tube.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I support my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes, in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. As has been stated, we got the amending Bill only yesterday. It is disgraceful that the Government is trying to ram it through tonight. Irrespective of what is being said on the other side of the House, the Government is trying to ram it through.On another issue, I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Education and Science to come to the House to outline the Government's policy or lack of in relation to third level education fees. We have had so many leaks that the roof is almost falling in on this issue. I ask the Government to come clean on its policy in relation to these fees.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	38	We, on this side of the House, have always found the Leader very reasonable and co-operative in her approach to business and very responsive to requests from this side of the House. I ask her, therefore, to look again at what we are proposing. In particular, although it is at very short notice – we are getting used to short notice – I ask her to look at the Bill the Labour Party published only today in relation to freedom of information. The Labour Party, in its co-operative and reasonable way, will give an extra year to the Government to retain the Cabinet secrecy it desires so much. However, my party's Bill also allows for a reasonable period of consultation on this important matter.I was not a Member when the original Bill came before the House. The legislation was introduced here first because the Minister of the day knew the Seanad would engage in an extensive debate on it. The Second Stage debate on the original Bill lasted for a number of weeks. The Leader should adopt the same spirit, if the Government allows it, and recognise that what is before us today is a travesty of freedom of information. It is freedom from information and tears apart the principle of openness, accountability and transparency.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	39	The matter can be debated later.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I ask the Leader to take a reasonable approach, as she always has, and to be independent on this. I call for a debate on this matter.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	43	The point has been adequately made. I call Senator Coghlan.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	44	I support the reasonable request made by Senator Brian Hayes. The Government has always been well able to corral a committee or group when it wished to procrastinate. On this occasion, instead of three wise men, there are five Sir Humphreys.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Four. There was one Lady Humphrey.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	47	This matter is not appropriate to the Order of Business.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	48	I appreciate that. I have two other items to deal with but I will conclude my remarks on this matter first. There has been no consultation. I agree with Senator O'Meara that the Leader has been reasonable to date on the Order of Business. However, there is an attempt to get this matter through without consideration. That is not good enough and the Leader should accept that.There was an announcement some time ago regarding an audit of State assets. I asked the Leader when the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, might come before the House. She responded reasonably at that time and I ask again that this be done. We have not heard the result of this audit, when the assets will be advertised or when the first phase of the sell-off – to which today's newspapers refer – will begin. That is not good enough. It is not known whether the family silver or the kitchen sink is involved. Members are entitled to information on this matter and the Minister of State should be brought before the House.It has come to my attention that different local authorities operate different criteria in regard to the allocation of public housing. Such a lack of uniformity is not good enough and the Leader should arrange for the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, to come before the House to discuss this important matter. It is most unfair to applicants.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	49	On an point of order of some importance to me, Senator Brian Hayes was guilty of a serious breach of protocol when he referred to the Deputy Michael McDowell as Citizen McDowell. Such references, together with the concomitant bestial references from other Members, run the risk of seriously damaging my good name. I ask the Cathaoirleach to see to it that Senator Brian Hayes and others desist from such breaches of protocol.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Is there a question on the Order of Business?
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	51	There is a more serious matter to which I wish to refer. Is the Government still committed to introducing the whistleblowers Bill? The Leader will recall that some three years ago the Taoiseach, in the Lower House, committed the Government – I assume his commitment follows through to this Administration – to supporting a Private Member's Bill in the name of my current party leader which would, among other things, give protection to civil servants who blow the whistle on wrongdoing in Government. If, as I assume is the case, the Government is still committed to that Bill, does the Leader agree that it is somewhat hypocritical for the Government to shut off one of the mechanisms by which such information comes to public notice, while claiming that it is still committed to introducing a Bill of that kind?
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	52	In accordance with Standing Orders, the Order of Business must be completed within the next four minutes. Four Senators are offering. I ask them to be brief. I call Senator Bannon.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I propose a vote of sympathy on the death of the late—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	54	There are procedures under Standing Orders for expressions of sympathy.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I support the proposed amendment to the Order of Business. I did not get the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill in the mail because of the deteriorating postal service.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	56	A question for the Leader, please.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	57	The Leader's proposal for the taking of Second Stage on the Bill is an insult to democracy and decent politicians. More time should be allowed for this debate.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I join my colleagues in expressing regret at the manner in which the Government is trying to ram the legislation on freedom of information through the House tonight. I agree with the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes.Senator Cummins referred to the possible reintroduction of higher education fees. Over the weekend, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment have expressed different views on this issue. I urge the Leader to ask the Minister for Education and Science to attend the House to debate it. With examinations pending, this is an important time of the year for students, especially those who are filling CAO application forms.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I support the amendment proposed by my colleague, Senator Brian Hayes. Second Stage debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill is to be rammed through the House when Senators have not been appropriately informed about the legislation.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	60	A question for the Leader, please.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Agriculture and Food the crisis in agriculture that has been exacerbated today by the charges to be imposed on farmers for rendering, which will result in a reduction of €40 per head. I also ask the Leader to request the attendance in the House of the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment with responsibility for consumer affairs to explain the views of the Consumers' Association of Ireland that big stores are making huge profits as the price of agricultural produce falls. This has serious implications because, according to a European study, agricultural prices in Ireland have fallen by 9%, yet this benefit is not being passed to consumers. At the same time farmers are being ripped off and are not being paid for their products. It is a double rip-off on both farmers and consumers.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The matter can be raised during Private Members' business.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I know, Sir, you are very concerned about this issue. The Leader must act on it.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I support my colleagues on this side of the House in their total opposition to the manner in which the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill has been handled. This is a dark day for democracy because the Bill is sinister, subversive and dangerous. The  modus operandi in introducing the Bill three days after publication is wrong. It is an insult to the House.If the Members on the other side of the House are serious about protecting their rights they should immediately take a stand with the Government. They should not act as puppets and poodles and they should resist any attempt to bulldoze the Bill through.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	65	This is not relevant to the Order of Business.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I thank the Leader for her concession in proposing that spokespersons should have 30 minutes on Second Stage. Senators on all sides have much to contribute and the proposed 15 minute time allocation is inadequate, especially in the context of the way the debate is to be taken. I, therefore, propose amendment No. 2: that, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, the Order of Business be amended to allow for unrestricted time for debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. There should be no guillotine and no attempt to restrict the right of Senators to express their views on this horrendous and repulsive legislation.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I second the amendment. I support the reservations expressed on this side of the House at the manner in which the Government has attempted to control and envelop in secrecy the workings of what is an arch-conservative, right-wing Administration.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	68	It is great that the House and Visitors Gallery are so full. I welcome everybody.The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Brian Hayes, proposed an amendment to the Order of Business which I expect to be dealt with at the end of my response.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	69	She accepted it.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Order, please. The Leader, without interruption.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Senator Brian Hayes said I was acting in an unseemly fashion. I may be many things but unseemly I am not.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The Leader should ask the Members sitting behind her.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	73	She is a distinguished former Minister.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	74	The debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 will not be guillotined. We will sit until midnight. The time slots can now be extended and Senators will be allowed to speak for 20 minutes or more. The proceedings might become a little unseemly as time progresses if everybody says the same thing but if Senators wish to be allowed 15 to 20 minutes, that will be acceptable. I will confirm this with the Cathaoirleach afterwards.I agree with Senator Brian Hayes on the North. Before we degenerate into unseemly behaviour, the House should unite in wishing well the Taoiseach, Mr. Tony Blair and everybody involved in the talks in the North in the hope they will be fruitful, that there will be a commingling of ideas and, in particular, that they will lead to more certainty in a week or two.Senator O'Toole agreed with Senator Brian Hayes and also called for a debate on public private partnerships, which I agree is necessary. When the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, comes to the House shortly, perhaps we will question him on this, either privately or publicly. There is some spancelling of people with regard to the pushing through of public private partnerships.Senator Ryan also spoke about the Cork School of Music, particularly the corruption in the planning process, a matter raised by another Senator in the House, whom I congratulate for doing so publicly.Senator Ryan also raised the issue of freedom of information and tackled me with regard to how I answered him in the House but he changed his own words. On a Thursday he used the phrase "subversion" and on the Tuesday he said he wished to withdraw it and use another, which he did, to dilute—
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I was obviously wrong. "Subversion" understated it.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Senator Dardis spoke about the North, a subject on which we all agree, and the Morris tribunal. I remind the House that the Committee on Procedure and Privileges for the Seanad took the initiative on the Morris tribunal issue. We were determined that we would take the lead in the matter and the Dáil followed us. While I hope it will follow us to whatever end is necessary, I also hope common sense will prevail.Senator Ulick Burke referred to the need for equal access for all Eircom subscribers to affordable line provision. I will communicate with the Director of Telecommunications Regulation, Etain Doyle, because it would be wrong if there were breaches of licensing agreements.Senator Hanafin said, quite rightly I hope, that we had no need for a watchdog and that we were well able to watch ourselves. I do not know who raised the watchdog issue. Perhaps it was Senator Brian Hayes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Citizen McDowell raised it first.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I thank Senator Hanafin for raising the matter and telling us how many votes Deputy Bertie Ahern got in becoming Taoiseach.Senator Norris supported Senator Brian Hayes and reminded us all that poodles were vicious when provoked which I hope is not the only occasion. I very much agreed with him in respect of taxi plates and the fact that the rich were purchasing them to speed up journey times to their destinations. The Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, is proposing an amendment to legislation that may reduce the person in question to a bicycle. I do not know—
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	79	That is the way to sock it to him.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Order, please.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I did not mention any names.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	82	That would be unseemly.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	83	As we do not name people in the House, I did not do so purposely. I congratulate the Senator for making the point con brio.To Senator Cummins I say that I am not attempting to ram anything through.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	84	The Leader could have fooled me.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Consideration of this Bill will go on until midnight and I look forward to hearing contributions from everyone.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	86	What about the staff? They do not know when they can go home because the Leader will not tell them.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I am not proposing a guillotine. If Senators wish to sit past midnight, they may do so.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	88	There is a long-standing precedent in the House that the Government side sets out the parameters of business. In fairness to the staff of the House, I ask the Leader to be serious. Does she suggest that we sit until 1 a.m., 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. to debate this matter fully?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I consulted the Seanad record and discovered that, in the past, the House sat quite late into the night in order to consider important matters.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	90	That is an effective guillotine.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Senator Hayes has made his point.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I did not interrupt, except to observe that Senator Ryan was funny.We are not guillotining the Bill and everybody who wishes to speak will have an opportunity to do so. Senators cannot have it every way; they cannot say they do not have enough work to do and then leave the House at 7 p.m. stating that they do not wish to debate any further into the evening. Senators are welcome to remain in the House to debate this important legislation at length.I remind Members that Committee Stage, on which they may debate matters in great detail, will not be taken until next week. Senators will have an entire week to reflect and decide upon the amendments they wish to table in respect of the Bill. Second Stage is very interesting from many points of view, but the meat will be in the detail of the amendments that will come forward. I will not permit people to tell lies to the effect that I am ramming this Bill through and guillotining the debate. Senators may play the March Hare from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland and state otherwise, but I tell them that they are wrong.Regarding Government policy on third level fees, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, is seeking consultation and feedback. However, Opposition Members do not seem to support that course of action. I thank Senator O'Meara who said that I have been reasonable to date.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	93	The Leader is not being reasonable now.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	96	For the information of Senator Coghlan, there were five Sir Humphreys and one Lady Henrietta.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	102	The debate on State assets which the Senator requested has been agreed to in principle by the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon. It is a matter of finding the time to come to the House. I thank Senator Coghlan for raising the matter, and that of public housing, again.Senator Derek McDowell wishes to be referred to as "Senator McDowell" and does not want to be confused with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	103	There is only one Citizen McDowell.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	106	The Whistleblowers Protection Bill is still on the agenda for publication by Government. A false analogy was drawn between whistleblowers and the other matter referred to.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	107	May I raise a point of order?

Senator Coonan said that the crisis in agriculture was exacerbated today by the imposition on farmers of higher charges for rendering and he wishes the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, who represents consumers, to come before the House to debate the matter.Senator Higgins proposed an amendment to the Order of Business to allow unrestricted debate on Second Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Senator Brian Hayes also referred to that matter and I will allow extra time to be provided, if necessary, to allow people to speak. Senator McCarthy seconded the amendment.There is a matter of sadness which I wish to introduce—

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I am pleased to introduce the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 to the House. I am conscious that the Freedom of Information Act began its life as a Seanad Bill and that this House played an important role in shaping that legislation. It is essential that citizens have confidence and trust in Government and public administration. The Government is firmly committed to this principle, as was its predecessor. That is the reason we significantly extended the Freedom of Information Act from just 67 bodies when it came into force in April 1998 to include 370 or so today.At regular intervals, beginning in October 1998, the Government has made significant extensions to the remit of the original Act, first, by extending it to local authorities and health boards, then to voluntary hospitals and subsequently to numerous other State agencies, bodies and institutions, including those in the enterprise, broadcasting and third level education sectors. By extending FOI throughout the public service, the Government has ensured it has become a permanent and valuable feature of public administration.The Government has committed itself to a continuing programme of extensions with the aim that by the end of 2005 all bodies, organisations and groups appropriate for inclusion will be covered. It has also expanded the scope of the Act through secondary legislation. For example, regulations have been made to allow for the release of records to the parents and guardians of minors and persons with a disability and to the relatives and representatives of the deceased.Usage of the FOI Act bears out its important role in public life today. Since April 1998 tens of thousands of requests have been made to public bodies, of which the large majority have been granted in full or in part. However, the success of FOI cannot be judged solely by such statistics. It was anticipated before FOI was introduced that it would serve to encourage the release, on an informal administrative basis, of information which would previously not have been readily available. A recent example of this can be seen in the move by universities and other third level education institutions to release students' examination scripts without requiring students to invoke the Act formally. A further example is available from the health boards, where, I understand, some three quarters of requests for personal records are dealt with informally, with requesters not being required to go through the formal FOI process.In these and other ways FOI has served to improve public administration and heighten public confidence in the institutions of State. By significantly extending FOI and introducing a range of other measures such as the Standards in Public Office Act, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Bill and the Local Government Act, which established a comprehensive ethics framework for local authority members and officials, the Government has shown it is firmly committed to the maintenance of standards and improved accountability in public life.The Government is also committed to effective government. While freedom of information is important, it cannot be the major determinant of how the Government conducts its business. All organisations have the right to decide how to organise their business and the Government is no different. Our work is complex. In reaching decisions on important economic and social issues the Government has to look at different alternatives and approaches, debate these freely and then reach a joint decision on behalf of the community. The framers of the original Act recognised this when they enshrined in the Act key protections for Government records which would last five years. It was also recognised that these records had to be protected.It is becoming increasingly clear, however, that five years is not an adequate period for this purpose. As the high level group established by the Government to review the operation of the Act stated: ". as experience is gained in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, it is evident that a five year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short. It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short space of time". I have no hesitation, therefore, in recommending to the House that the restriction of five years for Government records should be raised to ten. A ten year limit still leaves Ireland with a liberal regime. In other jurisdictions, such limits range from ten to 30 years. Canada, for example, operates a blanket restriction for 20 years on a wide range of records under the general heading of "Cabinet confidences".Another change contained in the Bill to the exemption for records of the Government relates to inter-ministerial communications where such communications deal with a matter already on the Government agenda, on which a submission to Government is proposed or relate to an issue delegated by the Government for resolution between Ministers. Specific protection for such records was recognised as being necessary by the high level group as they are an extension and in direct support of the exercise of collective responsibility.There is also a measure to provide for exemption of records of a committee of officials set up specifically to assist Cabinet deliberations on matters before it, where that committee is mandated to report directly to the Cabinet. In order to ensure that such protection is only afforded to records which genuinely fall within the categorisations mentioned, the Bill provides that the Secretary General to the Government must certify that the committee concerned meets the relevant requirements. The focus of the new Bill is, therefore, on the business of Government. This was also the focus of the work of the high level group which looked very carefully at the working of the existing Act and made a number of recommendations.While there has been a particular focus on Cabinet records – including the extension of the period of protection for such records from five to ten years – the high level group also recommended a number of other important measures, including the introduction of up-front fees. Such fees are long overdue. The cost of administering FOI is not reflected in any meaningful way in the existing fee provisions. While mandatory, these provisions have not operated as was originally intended. The original Act clearly states that a fee must be charged for an FOI request unless the request is for personal information or in cases where exceptional circumstances apply. In practice, the opposite has been happening with charges being the exception rather than the rule.One requester asked a couple of years ago for access to the diaries of a number of civil servants and Ministers. There were hundreds of records. Every diary and thousands of pages of documentation had to be read through, assessed and considered for release and personal or sensitive material deleted. The cost of processing that request was probably well over €10,000, but the cost to the requester, including photocopying, amounted to around €600. I understand those charges were appealed.The cost of servicing democracy through FOI, therefore, does not come cheap. A single FOI request can take many hours to process. This involves the basics of acknowledging the request, discussing the matter with the requester to ensure the request is adequately focused and understood, estimating the search and retrieval time required, locating relevant records, examining each record line by line for any exempt matter and considering public interest arguments for and against release. Where third party information is involved, the process can be even more onerous, particularly in light of the requirements to locate and contact third parties, issue formal consultation letters, consider submissions and notify appeal rights. The Oireachtas recognised that a fee should be imposed for FOI requests as a reflection of this burden.The difficulty is that the fees have not always been charged. The true cost of FOI is not recognised. The Bill, therefore, contains a provision that will permit the Minister for Finance to prescribe fees for requests for access to records and for applications for reviews of decisions, which must be paid before anything else happens. Contrary to some reports in the media, the level of such fees has not been decided. I will be giving careful consideration to the setting of these fees and, in doing so, will be careful to strike a balance between the burden and cost of administering the legislation – which is unquestionably significant – and the need to allow people to continue to have access to information. I should stress that the Government does not favour the charging of an up-front fee for personal information and the Bill explicitly precludes this possibility.A number of other measures in the Bill provide an enhanced degree of protection in key areas of Government and parliamentary activity. These include enhanced protection for records relating to ongoing deliberations, particularly the deliberations of Departments of State.The extent of a deliberative process can be difficult to define. Accordingly, a measure is proposed whereby a Secretary General will be able to certify when a deliberative process has concluded. This should provide greater certainty in relation to the level of protection available for records related to the ongoing deliberations of Departments of State. At the end of the deliberative process, the Secretary General must revoke the certificate and the records will then be considered for release.There is also a proposal to enhance the protection available for certain sensitive records related to international relations, security and defence. While the existing Act appears to provide, in subsection 24(2), a high level of protection for diplomatic communications and other records, the high level group identified difficulties in the interpretation of this section which have given rise to concern. The Government has, in turn, decided that certainty is needed to protect certain sensitive material so that Ireland's ability to function effectively at international level is not restricted by a lack of confidence about, for example, our ability to protect sensitive exchanges with other countries or international organisations.Other notable measures in the Bill will provide greater clarity and enhanced protection in relation to the work of tribunals and public inquiries and protection for parliamentary briefing papers. I look forward to elaborating on each of these areas as the Bill progresses through the Houses and to the contributions of Senators.The Bill contains a series of technical measures to improve the operation of the Act. These include a strengthening of the administrative protections available to public bodies against manifestly unreasonable or vexatious requests. Senators may recall a case that came to light within the first year of FOI where a single individual made 466 requests, and was responsible for 101 internal review applications and 35 appeals to the Information Commissioner. Of these requests, 194 were made to a single public body. As the authors of a technical report on the Act noted in relation to this case "neither those who campaigned for FOI nor the majority of requesters who make reasonable use of the Act would have expected that a single individual would, through extreme usage of the Act, cost the taxpayer well in excess of £100,000 or €127,000 in an eight month period following its introduction." While it must be emphasised that the vast majority of requesters act responsibly and make good use of the Act, I am satisfied that measures must be taken to provide an enhanced degree of protection against those few individuals who choose to use FOI in a vexatious way.Other technical measures in the Bill include a new provision clarifying that protection is available for records whose release could endanger the life or health of persons, the removal of the restriction on an appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of the High Court and an extension of the basis on which a public body is empowered to refuse to confirm or deny the existence of records. The Bill also provides for an extension of the period that the Information Commissioner has to complete a review under section 34 of the Principal Act from three to four months. Experience to date indicates that the three month deadline envisaged by the Act is not achieved in many cases.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	143	As Senators will be aware, we have an elaborate system for supporting the implementation of FOI and for involving the various stakeholders and users of the legislation in dialogue on its operation. Within my Department, the FOI central policy unit chairs an interdepartmental working group and a public service users network with representatives from all sectors of the civil and public service covered by the legislation. Below these two umbrella groups, networks such as those in Government Departments and offices, local authorities, health boards and universities meet regularly to consider issues of common concern and to share learning and experience. All of these networks and groups and the other arrangements underpinning FOI have ensured that the Act has been kept under continuous review since it came into force in 1998 and that a considerable amount of experience has been built up within public bodies.The Freedom of Information Amendment Bill is based on this experience. It has been prepared on foot of the Government's consideration of the high level group report, which looked at various sources, including the annual reports of the Information Commissioner and his report in July 2001 on compliance by public bodies, the Civil Service users' network report in 1999 and the views of the FOI central policy unit of the Department of Finance, which, as I have said, monitors the implementation of the Act on an ongoing basis.The views of practitioners in the wider FOI community, such as academics, journalists and frequent users of the legislation, have also been available to the unit on an ongoing basis, through the print and other media and through various conferences hosted and attended by the unit. Included in the latter is the recent FOI annual conference, which was attended by representatives from across public bodies, the media and academia.The Bill has been informed by a wide range of experience and views over the past five years. It contains sensible, practical measures designed to allow the Government and public administration to work effectively. I commend it to the House.

It had been signalled in advance that the Government intended to tamper with the Freedom of Information Act because it penetrated too deeply into what was happening behind closed doors at Government and official level.Nobody in their wildest dreams could have foreseen the extent of the amendments proposed by the Government in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. This Bill effectively is not amending legislation; it is a repeal of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. It turns on its head the main and pivotal functions and thrust of that Act. It literally castrates the Act from the point of view of making available information to which individuals, the general public and the media have an absolute right. It will rank as one of the most arrogant, negative, sinister, subversive and heavy-handed pieces of legislation ever brought before the Oireachtas.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I am surprised that ordinary elected Members of either of the Government parties would countenance supporting the measure before the House. Not alone are the rights of ordinary citizens, organisations and the media being trampled on and interfered with, but the rights of ordinary Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas are also being trammelled and trampled upon. If ever there was an opportunity for ordinary Senators and backbench Deputies to take a stand – they have recently done so forcefully on issues such as the dual mandate and achieved concessions – and to indicate that they are not prepared to act as puppets or pawns and not to be dictated to by their colleagues in Cabinet, then surely this is the opportunity. Judging by the manner in which the issue has been dealt with thus far in the House, people are not prepared to take a stand. They should do so because the Bill is wrong and it is a bad day's work.The utter contempt being shown for people's intelligence by attempting to portray the measure as being "in the public interest" is matched only by the manner in which the Bill has been brought before the Seanad today. As has been said repeatedly on the Order of Business, the Cabinet took a decision to go ahead and publish the Bill at last Tuesday's meeting, yet it was not published immediately or put into the possession of Members or the public. It was not published until Friday when neither the Dáil nor Seanad was sitting. Those of us who reside outside Dublin did not receive our copy of the Bill until yesterday and some on this side have still not received a copy. Yet the Second Stage debate is listed for this afternoon, a mere 24 hours after most people received the Bill in the post.Irrespective of how the Leader is trying to defend what is happening, this ramrodding of legislation is wrong. It shows complete contempt for Parliament. Legislation should be rushed through Parliament only if there is an imminent threat to the security of the State and then only where there is clear and overwhelming support from all sides of the House.When I was Government Chief Whip we had an agreement in relation to legislation coming before the Dáil that a minimum of two weeks should expire before the Bill would be taken at Second Stage. A further gap of two weeks would expire after the passing of Second Stage before the matter went to Committee Stage. The same agreement pertained when I was Opposition Chief Whip. That was a protocol that was breached only in the rarest of circumstances. In my time in the Dáil I can only remember two or three occasions when we agreed among ourselves – and there was agreement – to rush legislation through. One was the Bill to regularise, regulate and save Larry Goodman's empire, the beef industry and our beef exports.The Leader of the House has indicated that the Bill is not being guillotined. Effectively, it is being guillotined because the House is prepared to sit until any hour, into tomorrow morning if necessary, to see this legislation through. There is a de facto guillotine operating here. It means that by 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. every Member who wishes to do so will have contributed because of the time restriction of 20 minutes. Effectively it is a guillotine by stealth.

I ask that no attempt whatsoever be made to introduce the guillotine on Committee Stage deliberations, which must be open-ended. I assure the House we will table many substantial amendments, not vexatious or frivolous amendments as stated in regard to some of the requests under the FOI legislation, to protect what is a fundamental right and freedom.

#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	157	One has to ask what the Government is up to. What is the reason for all the urgency and panic? What is the Government afraid of that it publishes draconian legislation at such short notice and proposes to bulldoze it through in such an unseemly fashion?As I said when tabling an amendment to the Order of Business, this legislation is sinister, subversive and dangerous and should never have been published. It reeks of suspicion and is shrouded in secrecy. It is the work of a select group of civil servants working behind closed doors who consulted with nobody. Why was the Ombudsman and information commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, not consulted about this legislation? This person is a former civil servant and in his present capacity has statutory responsibility for ensuring that the terms of reference of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 are implemented. He has hands-on knowledge and experience of the workings of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, yet he was not consulted or asked for his views by his former Civil Service colleagues. Realising that he would not be afforded an opportunity to put forward his views, he contacted the Government and the committee with a view to having his views heard, only to be ignored and to get the thumbs down. Why is it that an expert in such a pivotal position and obviously with helpful and constructive insights in relation to this legislation was disregarded? Surely the proper and responsible approach to drafting this legislation should have been to have as widespread a dialogue and consultation process with as broad a spectrum of interested parties as possible.Any far-reaching changes to the 1997 Act, which is acknowledged as the key instrument in achieving long overdue and long sought after openness and transparency, should not even have been contemplated without a process involving all the political parties, the media and the National Union of Journalists. If one considers the statistics, journalists have not abused their right of access to information under the 1997 Act and have done the State a considerable service by establishing certain information, which has led to fairly wide-ranging changes. They have also put high profile issues that needed to be exposed into the public domain.Why was the Irish Council for Civil Liberties not consulted about the legislation? A raft of interested, legitimate organisations, which have a right to have their views heard, were not consulted. Nobody was consulted. It is hard to expect these interested parties, including ourselves, to be consulted when the Information Commissioner – a former high-ranking civil servant – who is the final arbiter in deciding whether a claim for access to information is legitimate, was not even consulted. There should have been a process of dialogue and consultation. This should have happened within the precincts of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, but there was no consultation. What we have instead is a dangerous measure which is sinister, anti-information and anti-people in nature. It is a measure designed blatantly and exclusively to protect the internal secret machinations of the Civil Service and its temporary political masters.In its promotion of the legislation, the Government is trampling on people's right to information. It is attempting to row back rights already established under the 1997 Act, which could give rise to constitutional issues. It is a blunt denial of people's entitlement to get at the truth. The Bill is littered with the fingerprints of collective Civil Service paranoia and reflects the Civil Service mentality which never liked its actions or modus operandi being publicly questioned.At a time when the thrust of Government and Parliament should be towards far greater openness, transparency, access, accountability and inclusiveness in order to give people a greater sense of trust and insight, this legislation goes in the oppose direction. If passed, it will further heighten the sense of exclusion among the public. It will fuel cynicism and increase people's suspicion in relation to the nature of the process of Government. People are already sufficiently alienated from politics and politicians. For politicians to introduce this legislation and dress it up as being in the public interest is one sop the public will not, under any circumstances, swallow.It is this public suspicion, mistrust and cynicism of politics and politicians which has led to such a dramatic fall in the number of people who vote in elections. If this repeal of the right of the public to know how Government decisions are arrived at is passed – there is a determination on the part of the Government that, irrespective of any public disdain or revulsion or the legitimate expressions of the Opposition, the measure will go through – we will damage an already badly fractured democratic process.The restrictive nature of these new proposals is serious. They represent a crude assault on the spirit of openness and transparency that underpinned the original legislation. The Bill will create particular classes of information which will be automatically withheld from the Opposition parties, the media, legitimate interested or concerned organisations and members of the public. For example, briefing notes from civil servants to Ministers, including those relating to replies to parliamentary questions, will be restricted. I am at a loss to know why a briefing note in relation to a parliamentary question to a Minister should be restricted.The Leader of the House spent most of her parliamentary life in Cabinet whereas I sat at the Cabinet table for a mere two and half years. From 1995 to 1997, I answered questions when I was for a brief period Minister of State at the Department of Finance with responsibility for the Office of Public Works. I also answered parliamentary questions in my capacity as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Government Chief Whip and Minister of State at the Department of Defence. On occasion I substituted for other Ministers of State who were unable to be present during Question Time. I can genuinely say that I do not remember any occasion on which I answered a parliamentary question when there was reason for the briefing notes accompanying the question to be withheld from public access. I imagine the Leader of the House could probably testify that the same applied to her. The briefing notes with which one is presented essentially provide information on how the content of the question should be relayed. There is nothing sinister about such notes and why these should be included as part of the new restrictions is beyond me.As somebody who sat at Cabinet and dealt with Government memoranda, etc., I see no valid reason that the period of release in respect of Government memoranda should be extended from five to ten years. The making available of such advice is good. It gives people the opportunity to see how the process of forming legislation comes about. It lets people into the process, etc., and is an enlightening exercise from the point of view of establishing how the dialogue at Cabinet meetings develops and how consensus is eventually achieved.What the Government and the Civil Service, in particular, propose to do is to vest themselves with new restrictive powers. If this Bill passes into law, the Secretary General of a Department could decide to withhold requested information if he or she decides that – this is a jewel or a peach of an expression – the "deliberative process" surrounding the issue is ongoing. The use of the term "deliberative process" is intriguing. It is so wide in its possible interpretation that one must arrive at the conclusion that the only reason it is included is as a deliberate barrier to block access to information. In other words, those in authority will be able to claim that information cannot be released because the deliberative process – I presume this means that people will still be raking over the issue in their minds or talking to others about it – is ongoing. This is deliberately being included as an excuse or a blocking instrument to stop information which the Civil Service or the Government do not want to get into the public domain. On one hand, the Bill will curtail the role of the statutorily independent information officer while, on the other, it will grant quite extraordinary additional powers to senior civil servants.The main reason for the rush to get this legislation through – and what has triggered the urgency and panic on the part of the Government and the public service – is the date of 21 April 2003. Under the 1997 legislation, Cabinet memoranda and documents dating from 21 April 1998 are due for release. The attempt to extend the period raises the question of whether information contained in these Government memoranda and papers is so damaging or explosive that it must be locked up and kept away from public scrutiny for another five years.Section 12 of the Bill, which seeks to revoke the five year provision and replace it with a ten year restriction, will be opposed tooth and nail by this side of the House. On Committee Stage we will bring forward a series of amendment to ensure this component of the Bill is retained in the legislation. We will argue the case for doing so comprehensively, cogently and convincingly. There is no excuse for extending the period from five to ten years.I listened over the weekend to people trying to justify this on various political programmes. What the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, said on "Saturday View" has already been quoted in the House. He did not bring forward a single valid argument for this extension. I listened to the Tánaiste on Today FM on Sunday morning and, again, no valid argument was forthcoming to justify this. They advanced not a single syllable of sense in relation to this measure.The argument is that if documents can be released after five years, the Government to which they relate might still be in office. That is no defence. The maximum constitutional term of office for a Government is five years from the date of the formation of that Government and no Government in the history of the State, not even the last Government which ran to within six weeks of its full term of office, has lasted the full 1,825 days. There is, therefore, no basis for saying documents could be revealed while a Government was still in office. Even if Cabinet papers were released within the term of office of a Government, what great fissures, ruptures or earthquakes would be caused by making Cabinet memoranda public while a Government was still in office? There are differences of opinion between Cabinet members, just as there are between people in other organisations.

Is it not the most natural thing in the world that in any organisation, Government or otherwise, individuals will hold opinions that differ, often widely? Is it not in the public interest to enable people to see the different perspectives from which individual members of Cabinet come and to have such differences ultimately resolved in a process known as collective Cabinet responsibility?I listened to the argument made in the Dáil by the Taoiseach last week and his assertion that the five year rule was impractical and dangerous since it would lead to the release of the Belfast Agreement negotiating papers. Nothing could be further from the truth. Has the Taoiseach been wrongly briefed by civil servants or does he not realise the extent of the current legislation, which makes it clear that the 1997 Act contains a specific exclusion in relation to the Good Friday Agreement and the negotiations leading up to it? This is simply a spin and nothing more.This is a bad day's work for Parliament. It is a cynical and hypocritical move by the Government, a smash and grab raid on a key pillar of accountability and transparency of Government. The Government is saying the potential embarrassment to it is more important than people's right to information, that papers held by public bodies belong to the bodies and Ministers, not to the people, and that the people will have to pay to see them. This will be yet another stealth tax. The Government is saying Ministers do not have the courage to tell their Cabinet colleagues in writing what they believe. The refusal of the Government to engage in any meaningful consultation with interested parties before the Bill was drafted was cynical, wrong and hypocritical.The ultimate insult in the Bill is the Government's proposal that it be ten years before Cabinet papers are released. That is being very conveniently used as a key argument when it is no argument. By ramming this measure through the Oireachtas, the Government is being totally and grossly irresponsible. It is showing contempt for Parliament but particularly for the public which has an established right to have access to information. It is recognised that the legislation introduced in 1997 was far reaching. It was an example to other jurisdictions and has been held up by other jurisdictions as an example of what could be achieved in allowing people responsible access to information. By rowing back on this, the Government is doing irreparable damage. I again implore the Leader of the House not to go ahead next week until we have had an adequate opportunity to fill in the gaps and voids in terms of the deliberative dialogue that should have taken place with interested parties outside the House. I ask her to postpone Committee Stage until such time as we have had an opportunity to debate the matter with interested parties and hear the views of the general public and then, in no circumstances whatsoever, to attempt a restrictive debate or a guillotine on Committee Stage. That would be the ultimate injustice and insult.

His speech went out with a bang. I welcomed the Minister, and now the Minister of State, to the House. This is an important Bill and it is a compliment to the House, not an insult, that it is being taken soon after publication. I do not know how often the case is made here that we should debate matters immediately, if not the day before yesterday. We are debating something at a time when it is highly topical and being discussed in the newspapers. That is a compliment to the Seanad, not an insult.I do not accept the merit of the arguments about alleged lack of consultation. Political parties are consulted in Parliament. They are being consulted here today and will be consulted in committee and the Dáil. Sometimes on social partnership, parties opposite complain that Government spends too much energy consulting other parties, the social partners and so on outside the House rather than coming to Parliament. This is a case where we are coming to Parliament and Parliament is giving its view. Interested parties will convey their views to us, as is perfectly appropriate in a parliamentary process. I am sure many of us have had calls from representatives of the media, for example. It is very clear from the Minister's speech that there has been constant consultation and discussion with interested parties at conferences and with the Information Commissioner. It is open to the Information Commissioner to write a letter or speak to the Minister for Finance at any time that he chooses during the course of this Bill and make any points he wishes to make. I am very much in favour of freedom of information.If we cast our minds back about 30 years, no records were available. History stopped in December 1921. At that time there was a 50 year rule in place, which, following the introduction of the archives legislation, was replaced with a 30 year rule.

I recall that, on the day he was elected leader of Fianna Fáil, Mr. Albert Reynolds used a phrase about letting in the light. As an adviser to Mr. Reynolds, I recall encouraging him to make a commitment to freedom of information legislation. He did so and it was subsequently incorporated in the programme for Government of the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Administration. The original legislation was quite long and complex and, as a result, was in gestation for some years. However, we got there and a progressive Bill was the result. As the Minister pointed out, its range of applications has been considerably extended since it came into operation in April 1998.The process was experimental in the sense that we were entering new territory. Freedom of information had not been part of our administrative system, which tended to be somewhat secretive and authoritarian. I am glad there has been a move to a more open culture, but it is inevitable that legislation of this kind, particularly in terms of its operation, needs to be reviewed.I am unconvinced by the argument that the Bill is being introduced for essentially political reasons. I do not see any political advantage for the Government in introducing the legislation because, to put it mildly, it is not particularly popular. In the past five years of the operation of legislation, it does not appear that freedom of information did any harm to the Government. There was, of course, occasional embarrassment and a nuisance factor involved. However, the political argument is not valid as a motive for this legislation or as a justification for it.The sole justification for the Bill's introduction is whether it contributes to better Government, which is different from political interests. Better Government includes the keeping of better records. It is unfortunate that the advent of the freedom of information legislation substantially altered the habits of civil servants. I might have taken – as perhaps the Minister did in the past – the Duke of Wellington's attitude, "Publish and be damned". However, not many people adopt this attitude. Written advice to Government and to Ministers was inhibited, as was the way meetings were recorded, because there was consciousness of the operation of freedom of information. This may be regrettable, but it has happened.Oral advice is not generally as systematic as written advice and it cannot be reviewed afterwards. One cannot take oral advice home and people's memories are fallible. Written advice needs to be set out in a logical, reasoned form and it can be reviewed. Some of that has fallen by the wayside under the operation of freedom of information legislation.I agree with Senator Higgins that debate before decision-making is absolutely essential. There is nothing scandalous about the Minister for Finance writing about or challenging proposals from the Ministers for Health and Children or Transport. Healthy debate before decision-making is exactly how Government should operate.I have been a historian in my spare time. I am concerned, as are some members of Government, that the historical record will be impaired by people not writing as frankly as they once did. I know of one committee which, after the arrival of freedom of information, kept its minutes only as decisions taken instead of, as it had done previously, recording debates.Northern Ireland is excluded from the operation of the Bill. As a result, in 30 years there will be a full, comprehensive record for historians of what happened and why which will perhaps not be available in respect of other areas of Government. I see that Senator O'Meara does not agree.

I know what I am talking about. The history of a country is as important to it as the contemporary record. I accept that it is the fashion to say that only newspapers and television matter, but I do not agree; considered history also matters.I do not like the aspersions cast in the House on civil servants. In that context, we may yet hear more about secret machinations, paranoia, etc. Civil servants are also patriots and Members would do well to remember that. The Bill has been drawn up by distinguished civil servants.The only person I have met resembling a character from "Yes, Minister" is somebody who either is or was the head of a university. I will not be more specific than that. I recall a Cabinet Secretary whom I affectionately sometimes thought of as Polonius, but not as Sir Humphrey. I also remember a civil servant telling me when our esteemed leader – I am not referring to Senator O'Rourke – was absent, that politics was too important for politicians. However, the difference between Sir Humphrey and the senior civil servants behind this Bill is that the former wanted to stop things being done. In my experience, most civil servants want to see things done and get enormous satisfaction from this. The vast majority of senior civil servants should not be portrayed as Sir Humphreys, or the female equivalent, because they are no such thing.The operation of freedom of information has imposed a considerable administrative burden and there may be a justification for some charge. In the case of the unemployed, pensioners, the unwaged and students – particularly students of journalism – a reduced rate should be considered. It is a pity that the legislation has been used for relatively trivial purposes and I refer to a number of ongoing debates in this regard. If one wants to travel by air in luxury and comfort, one flies first class on a commercial plane and not by Government jet. Some ministerial offices, and a number in Leinster House, are as spartan and austere as could be imagined. Most of them do not even have sofas.I have great sympathy with the legal case Senator Higgins and Deputy Howlin are taking. That goes to show that they need some secrecy and confidentiality to get their job done, which is true of all organisations. It is easy to say there should be total freedom of information with regard to the Government, but not to let it apply to anyone else. I would love to see some of the internal minutes of newspapers when, for example, a proprietor rings an editor about a particular matter. However, despite the fact that newspapers are in the public sphere, nobody gets to see these.We must be realistic and accept that a certain degree of confidentiality is needed to conduct business efficiently. The main change in the Bill is the move from five years to ten years with regard to Government communications. I hope that if Fianna Fáil is part of the next Government, it will not introduce a Bill in the next Dáil to extend it to 15 years. The ten year provision should be adhered to and no further extension should be contemplated.There is a case to be made for the Bill in terms of efficient and good Government. It should not be dismissed.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	167	The designation of the term "high level group" to those charged with responsibility for reviewing the Freedom of Information Act is unfortunate. Those involved are eminent people and I agree with Senator Mansergh's description of them as patriots. They work all hours for the good of the country – pro patria. The term “high level group” immediately raises hackles and suggests elitism. Those involved would not consider themselves to be part of such a group and it would be more readily understood if they were referred to as a group of Secretaries General. I know the five of them. They are eminent, proper people and full of probity. They are headed by the Secretary General in the Department of the Taoiseach.In friendship, I must remind Senator Higgins that while he was a very good Minister of State at the Department of Defence and Chief Whip in the rainbow coalition Government, he was not in Government when the Freedom of Information Act was implemented, commencing in April 1998. The Senator spoke blithely about some aspects of the Bill. He may think differently when he returns to Government. I hope that is his aspiration.The number of groupings or bodies covered by the Act have increased from 67 to 370, which is proper. The range and extent of those included indicates that nothing has been stifled. As Minister for Public Enterprise, I introduced a number of Bills which, when enacted, were to brought under the terms of the Act. Doubtless other Ministers introduced legislation subject to similar provisions.The requirement that Secretaries General must certify the release of information is the proper way to proceed. The former Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Eithne Fitzgerald, worked long and hard on the original Bill, as did those advising her. The Act provides for a range of fees for the recovery of information, but these have not been implemented. Any fee paying system, such as water charges, should have an appeals and waiver system and in this regard I strongly advocate that the Bill provide considerable scope for waivers in respect of those seeking information who may not be able to afford the fees, such as students engaged in research or those seeking personal records.The Bill also proposes to remove the restriction on appeals to the Supreme Court of decisions by the High Court. The Act allows that appeals may only be made as far as the High Court. It is easy to elaborate on what is wrong in the Bill, but this approach sometimes overlooks the positive aspects. Allowing for appeals from the High Court to the Supreme Court will be a very useful provision.There is no panic about the introduction of the Bill. Every week I am subjected to pressure by Senators to introduce legislation. In proper pursuit of his duties, Senator Ryan must have asked me on at least 20 occasions when this Bill would be published and if it would be initiated in this House.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I welcome the opportunity to discuss the Convention on the Future of Europe. As it moves into a crucial phase of its work, it is important that the public and public representatives be as informed as possible. Our experience of the two referenda on the Nice treaty has taught us not to take the public for granted and to try to ensure it is aware of developments in the Convention and prepared for the final outcomes of both it and the Intergovernmental Conference to follow. The process will lead to a new treaty which I expect will have to be put before the people in a referendum.I will outline the most recent developments and the approach and main priorities of the Government in respect of the Convention. Senators who have been following its work will know that it is now moving into its most decisive phase. The first months of its work were devoted to a general debate on a wide range of issues, such as the values, aims and competences of the European Union, and engaging with civil society through, for example, the convening of a special plenary session involving the young people of Europe. This was known as the listening period which has now passed, as has the second phase.In recent months we have been involved in the second phase which was known as the analysis period. Eleven working groups were established to examine important issues in greater detail and make recommendations to the Convention. These working groups discussed issues such as subsidiarity, the European charter of fundamental rights, legal personality, national parliaments, complementary competences, economic governance, external affairs, defence, simplification of the Union's instruments, freedom, security and justice and social Europe. The working groups came forward with some very positive ideas and suggestions and their work will be reflected strongly in the final document produced by the Convention.The Convention has now entered its drafting phase. The plenary session at the beginning of February saw the release of drafts of the first 16 articles of the new treaty. These deal with the values, objectives, legal personality and competences of the European Union. Convention members were requested to forward amendments to these articles, and the articles were discussed at last week's plenary session. Therefore, today's discussion in the Seanad is particularly timely.I brought forward a number of amendments that, if accepted, will help to clarify the texts. These have been discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, the work of which I am grateful for. I will be happy to furnish Senators with copies of my amendments, if they so wish. My approach is not to call into question the basic structure of the Praesidium's proposals but to try to make the text more legally precise and, above all, clearer for the average citizen.Last week, members of the Convention were also issued with the drafts of articles dealing with the legal instruments of the Union. I am considering these and will be consulting Departments to see if amendments are required. They have already been discussed by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs during a full session yesterday. Further articles will be presented over the coming two months and the aim is to have a full draft of the new treaty ready in May. The Convention is still due to submit a final report to the European Council to be held in Thessaloníki in Greece in June.Institutional issues are central to the Convention's work. Debate in the Convention thus far has been limited to one general discussion because it was deemed, correctly in my view, better to concentrate initially on an examination of the Union's objectives and policies. The raison d'être of the institutions is to deliver those policies and serve the citizens of the Union.Although the Convention has not yet dealt with the issue of institutions, there has been no shortage of discussion and speculation, and many ideas have been circulated, including papers from the Benelux countries and the European Commission, as well as the Franco-German paper which attracted much attention at the beginning of the year and to which there have been varying reactions. The Franco-German proposals were discussed in some depth in a plenary session at the Convention and not well received.I will set out the underlying principles guiding Ireland's approach to the institutional issues because this approach will be central in the final part of the Convention's work. I hope these principles, which I have set out elsewhere, are widely shared across the Union and, in particular, the acceding states. We wish to see a European Union that meets the needs and expectations of its peoples in an effective and responsive way and in which the institutions are made more open and accessible. The European Union is a union of states and peoples, and any new arrangements must continue to reflect this dual nature.The Community method, essential to the success of the Union to date, must be maintained. The equality of all member states, large and small, old and new, must be recognised, respected and preserved. All elements of the institutional triangle, the Commission, Council and European Parliament, must be strengthened, while the balances between them must be preserved. The Government does not regard this as a zero sum game where an improvement in one area is achieved by a disimprovement in another. Rather, it takes a contrary view.We believe a strong and effective Commission is essential to the functioning and development of the Union. It should continue to have the sole right of initiative in the so-called first pillar areas. We support the approach to size and composition recently outlined in the Benelux paper which involves adherence to what was agreed at Nice and guaranteeing "equality of all member states in both its operations and its composition, based on the principle of equal rotation".Equality is a fundamental issue for Ireland and we have given considerable thought to ways in which the democratic legitimacy and authority of the President of the Commission – and, thus, of the Commission itself – could be enhanced. Some members of the Convention favour the current system of selection, a process in which member states, through the European Council, play the dominant role. However, there is also strong support for election by the European Parliament. While this view is most enthusiastically put forward by MEPs, it is also strongly supported by a number of member states. Many Senators will be aware that Deputy John Bruton has put forward a paper on the direct election of the President. His contribution is creative and innovative, but it seems to be ahead of its time.Senators who have been following the Convention closely will be aware that since its inception, the Government has supported the concept of an enhanced role for national parliaments in EU affairs. Against this background, I have submitted a paper to the Convention proposing that the President be elected by an electoral college composed of national parliaments and the European Parliament. The paper is intended to contribute positively and constructively to the debate.It is logical to propose that the European Parliament and member states, as the two other sides of the triangle, should play equal roles in the appointment of the President of the Commission. Accordingly, my paper explored the concept of an electoral college in which the European Parliament and national parliaments would play a 50-50 role. This idea represents a middle way between the imperfect current system and election by the European Parliament alone, which is also imperfect. It would ensure that the President of the Commission derived democratic legitimacy at European and national level in a reflection of the dual nature of the Union. Election via this model would fully reflect the diversity of political opinions and preferences across the Union and within Member States. The selection of the President could not, therefore, be dominated by any one political grouping. The range of details which will have to be examined if this concept is deemed worthy of consideration is elaborated in the paper.The European Parliament should have half the votes and each national parliament should be treated equally. Each parliament may be allowed to split its vote to reflect its internal diversity and voting could take place through delegates or electronically and simultaneously across Europe. The intention is not to create a separate institution. I would prefer the European and national parliaments to meet simultaneously in their own Chambers to elect the President of the Commission. It is an exciting prospect and it would be of huge symbolic importance.It is also proposed that election take place through our proportional representation system with its single transferable vote. In discussions of our system, other Europeans have acknowledged its significant merits, particularly in the context of an election of this sort. I have suggested that nominations come from a minimum of five national governments, from a specific number MEPs or from a combination of these. At present, the selection of the President is decided by a number of late-night phone calls, which is less open and transparent than the process I suggest.During the election campaign, candidates should appear in the media and speak to Parliaments and their committees across the Union. Since the EU is a union of states and peoples, successful candidates should demonstrate an understanding of the differing conditions in each country. In putting forward this idea, I was conscious of the reasons the Convention was established. Its primary purpose is to make the Union closer to its citizens. While adoption of my proposal would strengthen both the President and the Commission, its most important result would be the sense of excitement engendered by a transparent, EU-wide election held on a single day. That would certainly have the effect of making the Union's activities more relevant to citizens of new and old member states alike. My aim in putting forward my ideas is to stimulate debate and I am not dogmatic or fixed in my views. My intention is to strengthen the role of the Commission and its President, but if that can be achieved more effectively than in the way I suggest I would be happy to consider other proposals.Similar principles of equality must be respected in the Council of Ministers. We all accept that it must be organised in a manner that ensures its coherence and effectiveness. While we all recognise that improvements could be made, many of the Council's perceived problems are administrative or managerial in nature and, consequently, require administrative or managerial solutions. There is much merit in seeking further practical enhancement of the continuity and effectiveness of the Presidency along the lines of reforms agreed at the Seville Council in June 2002. The reforms agreed include annual and multi-annual programming and closer co-operation between presidencies.It is important to maintain the principle of equality of member states in the operation of the Council, which is why the Government has not been convinced by the case for an elected President of the Council – a core proposal of the Franco-German paper. The Government is concerned that institutional balance, in general, and the role of the Commission, in particular, would be weakened if this proposal was adopted.The Franco-German proposal prompts major practical questions in terms of the way the office would relate to that of a new foreign policy chief. The perceived weakness the proposal is ostensibly designed to address could be remedied by less radical and risky means than an elected Council President. The Government would support a single High Representative and Commissioner for External Relations, subject to the establishment of appropriate lines of accountability and a clear definition of the officeholder's relationships with the Council and the Commission. Financial and staff resources could be enhanced through the creation of a range of deputy high representative posts.In terms of internal affairs, we support further reform of the rotating Presidency and the creation of a full-time Secretary General of the Council. Members will be aware that when the High Representative position filled by Javier Solana was created, it was married to the post of Secretary General. It is not possible to fulfil both these offices since the High Representative must visit the four corners of the earth. Creation of a full-time Secretary General post would address the administrative ills which result from a lack of continuity.The key advantages of the rotating Presidency should be preserved and the Government is open to discussion as to the means of achieving this objective. We are particularly interested in seeing further detailed work on the concept of a team Presidency, which envisages a number of states undertaking Presidency tasks which still rotate over time. If three member states held the Presidency over 18 months, or five over two and a half years, each would hold the office for six months while taking advantage of far greater supports, particularly in the case of smaller or newer members.There are also proposals in the Commission and Benelux papers to combine the rotation of some Presidency functions with election or appointment to some Council chairs. These ideas could form a basis for progress. There is no reason the Irish Presidency should have to fill the chairs of every one of the more than 200 committees which will sit during its lifetime. Many of the committees are technical in nature and a different approach would make the Presidency less burdensome.With respect to the European Parliament, we have already indicated our support for their role in electing the Commission President as part of an electoral college. We are also happy to consider co-decision to be the norm as part of the decision-making process and that it can be extended on a case-by-case basis.I attach particular importance to the principle of good governance. Together with the Swedish and Finnish Government representatives, I have submitted a joint paper on the issue of good administration by the European institutions which calls for the development of existing provisions on openness and public access—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	186	The paper calls for the development of existing provisions on openness and public access, the inclusion of the Ombudsman in the new treaty – an important role left out of the treaty – and a specific treaty base allowing for the development of detailed rules of good practice in the administration of the Union's institutions. These are concrete suggestions which, if implemented, would help make the institutions of the Union more transparent and responsive from the citizen's perspective. Certainly, if they go half as far as we have gone, it will be a big improvement on where they are.In recent months there has been quite an amount of ill-informed and rather unwarranted criticism of Ireland's approach to the Convention. While we have addressed this issue on a number of occasions, I was disappointed to see it re-emerge at last week's meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs with the Institute for European Affairs. I was particularly concerned at some extraordinary headlines that attached to one report of the meeting.I take this opportunity to set out, once again, the steps being taken to ensure our efforts are wide-ranging at both political and official level. At Government level we have put in place arrangements to ensure Ireland's response to the Convention is as active, energetic and co-ordinated as possible. In this regard, Ireland was one of the first member states to submit its full responses on the original 16 articles. One or two of the larger member states have still not completed that work, two weeks after the deadline.At the administrative level, my alternate to the Convention, Mr. Bobby McDonagh of the Department of Foreign Affairs, chairs an interdepartmental group involving all Departments which was established to ensure all Departments were kept informed of developments in the Convention. It is to meet later this week to discuss a wide range of issues.Separately, I chair a Convention overview group comprising senior officials from the Departments most directly involved which meets weekly and examines developments in the Convention during the week that has passed and previews the coming week's developments. The report of the group is circulated on the Friday of each week with the Cabinet papers and each Minister is briefed. I also chair the interdepartmental co-ordinating committee on broader EU affairs where the impact of the Convention is further considered. The discussions at these groups are fed into the work of the Cabinet committee on Europe, which I attend, and, as appropriate, the Cabinet.Outside the Administration, developments in the Convention are considered in two public fora, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and the National Forum on Europe. I pay particular tribute to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and Deputy Gay Mitchell, its chairman, who has done extraordinary work in keeping abreast of developments in the Convention. Tribute is also due to the work of the National Forum on Europe which is unique both in the existing 15 member states and among the ten incoming states. It has a more proactive view as to how the issue of the Convention should be dealt with than any counterpart in any country in the European Union. It is time to recognise that when we do something in this country, we do it well.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	187	That was another Labour Party idea.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I am not aware of any more comprehensive arrangements in any other member or accession state. If the Senator is interested or if he has any ideas on ways to improve it, I would be delighted to hear from him. We have been very open in this area, have put in place an institutional structure which is unusually comprehensive and are more advanced in this regard than any other member state.The Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs has been following the work of the Convention closely. The Oireachtas Members at the Convention and I have been pleased to appear before it to answer questions on the progress of the Convention's work. In addition to the Joint Committee on European Affairs, other Oireachtas committees will undoubtedly be considering the work of the Convention. The joint committee which deals with justice and home affairs matters examined the issue and will be considering the work of the Convention. It will receive my full co-operation and that of the other Convention members.The National Forum on Europe under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes has also been following the Convention very closely. The Oireachtas Members at the Convention and I regularly attend its sessions both to participate in discussions on specific issues and to update it on the Convention's work and, in my case, the Government's approach. I was due to address its session yesterday on the final report of the social Europe working group; however, due to the unfortunate motor accident involving the chairman of the group, Giorgios Katiforis, the plenary was postponed. I send my good wishes to Mr. Katiforis and my hopes for his speedy recovery. The patience, good humour and intelligence that he has brought to the Convention and meetings of national representatives have been greatly appreciated by all. He is a very good friend of the small countries and a particularly staunch friend of ours. I hope he will have the opportunity to visit the forum which yesterday took the unique and quite extraordinary initiative of issuing a video specifically aimed at schools to inform young people on the work of the Convention. I recommend it to Members of the House.Building alliances with like-minded states is another part of the Government's response to the Convention. This work is carried out at a number of levels. I represent the Government at the regular meetings of national representatives from both the current and accession states which take place in advance of Convention plenary sessions. I chaired the last meeting of the group in the absence of the chairman, Mr. Katiforis. The smaller member states meet at dinners that take place the night before plenary sessions. I hosted the first of the dinners which I invited some of the accession states to attend. In a response to a suggestion which I made, the group has held a number of informal working sessions aimed at establishing common ground on key issues.I also participate in regular meetings of both small and large member states. This group is loosely referred to as the "like-minded group" and meets on the morning prior to every plenary session to discuss a wide range of Convention issues.Beyond Convention sessions, members of the Government have also been involved in regular discussions with their counterparts in the European Union and other Convention members. In January I held talks in Lisbon with the Portuguese Minister for European Affairs and Ernani Lopes, Portugal's Convention representative. I travelled to Warsaw in January for a conference that was also attended by Convention president, Giscard d'Estaing, and had discussions with the Polish national representative and Minister for Europe, Danuta Hubner. I had further discussions in Slovenia on the Convention. Last month I travelled to Prague where I met the representatives of the Government and Parliament of the Czech Republic. I also travelled to Vienna last month where I met with Foreign Minister, Ferrero-Waldner, and Convention representative, Hannes Farnleitner. I went to Vilnius where I met Foreign Minister Valionis, the Lithuanian Convention representatives, the Lithuanian European affairs committee and the speaker of the Lithuanian Parliament. In Prague and Lithuania, both parliamentary committees with which I met asked that I pass on their particular regards and grateful thanks to the Irish people for being so supportive in the matter of European Community enlargement. They regard Ireland as a very good friend of their cause. These contacts will continue as the Convention and Intergovernmental Conference processes continue.Bilateral meetings are also a feature of almost every Convention session. There have been very valuable discussions on the Convention among Ministers for European Affairs on the margins of all the recent European Council meetings. The Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs will be involved in full programmes of visits during the coming months. These will include visits to Germany, Italy, Poland and the Czech Republic. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also met with his Dutch counterpart on the margins of the most recent General Affairs and External Relations Council. These meetings are particularly valuable in helping us to build alliances and establish matters on which there is common ground.It should be placed on record that Ireland is at the very heart of the process of trying to find common ground and developing institutions that will serve the European Union well and which will recognise that which was most valuable in the establishment of a peaceful and prosperous Europe. We have also made a number of written contributions to the Convention. We are probably ahead of most other states in this regard.As I noted earlier, I forwarded a paper on the election of the President of the European Commission. That paper has been well received and support for the proposal is growing. I note, for example, that in the past seven days the Prime Minister of Sweden indicated that while his personal preference was still for the existing procedure, if an alternative was introduced, it would be that outlined in the Irish paper.As I already stated, in conjunction with my Swedish and Finnish Government counterparts, I have also submitted a paper on the issue of good administration by the European institutions. My alternate to the Convention submitted a paper to the external action working group on the role of the High Representative. This was favourably received and substantially influenced the final report of the working group on external action.In addition to the Government's input, Deputy John Bruton and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and their alternates, Deputy Pat Carey and Deputy Gormley, have brought forward many positive ideas. They have played active roles both in the Convention plenaries and in the working groups of which they are members. The active role played by these three Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and one Member of the European Parliament has not been properly recognised. I am particularly conscious of the strain that has been placed on Deputies Carey and Gormley because, as backbench Deputies, they have duties at home which must inevitably suffer if they are serving the nation in another way. Their activity, energy and the amount of time they have devoted should be handsomely recognised.Deputy John Bruton also plays an important and valuable role as a member of the Praesidium, a role that has become even more important now that the Convention has moved into a more decisive drafting phase. I want to put on record that I have the best of relationships with Deputy John Bruton. We have established one of the best working relationships across the Convention. People have commented that the members of the Irish team sing from the same hymn sheet, whenever possible.There are, of course, differences of emphasis in a number of areas between the Government and some of the Oireachtas representatives. Deputy John Bruton and I have submitted different papers on how the President of the Commission should be elected. Notwithstanding any differences, as Irish representatives we meet formally before each Convention session to discuss the agenda and Convention issues more generally. I can state clearly that, collectively and from this country's point of view, we are absolutely committed to seeing the most successful outcome for Ireland in the Convention, the Intergovernmental Conference and in the new treaty. I repeat what I have said already, I am not aware of more comprehensive arrangements in a member or accession state. I hope I have provided some evidence of the seriousness with which the Government and the team at the Convention take the process.More than 1,000 amendments were tabled to the first 16 articles. The task for the Convention over the coming months will no doubt be difficult if it is to conclude its work according to the agreed timetable and present its conclusions to the European Council in June. I hope, nonetheless, that this will be possible, that substantial consensus will be reached and that the task of the intergovernmental conference will be made easier. We will have some interest in the date of the Intergovernmental Conference. It is beginning to look increasingly likely that the Intergovernmental Conference will not begin until the middle or end of October. That said, it is unlikely it will conclude its work before Christmas 2003. If that is the case, the Intergovernmental Conference will be concluded during Ireland's Presidency. The prospect of a treaty of Bray, a treaty of Templemore or even a treaty of Dublin looms.

All the Convention documents and Government submissions are available on the Internet. It is an entirely different, more revolutionary and, in my view, positive process.

The energy and commitment we are bringing to bear on the Convention is absolute. When the Minister for Foreign Affairs addressed the Institute for European Affairs last January, he stated, "We have nothing to fear and everything to gain from a renewed Europe." I agree with this sentiment and I look forward to the closing phase of the Convention and the Intergovernmental Conference. Above all, I look forward to Ireland confidently shaping the treaty, which will be the treaty for a united Europe over the next 50 years.

#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The process which will conclude with the contribution from Deputy John Bruton next week is helpful. We must accept that when the Minister of State and his colleagues speak here on this issue, they are speaking to the converted. The political challenge for Members, and for all politicians, is to transmit this message to the people in a language which is free of Euro-speak or jargon. Senator Ormonde addressed that topic last week.This is an exciting period in the growth of the European Union, particularly in light of the accession treaties and the fact that we are moving towards a possible treaty of Dublin. These are exciting times indeed for people in the political classes. However, we must what this means for the people of this country. It will mean a huge amount economically, socially and politically, but, unfortunately, the public has not yet tuned in. During the two debates on the Nice treaty, we saw how long it took to engage the public and how difficult it was to break down fears and doubts. We will have to repeat the political engagement we successfully achieved during the second debate on Nice. We will be putting the fruits of the Minister's and Government's work, including the deliberations of European politicians, before the people in the future.We have a long way to go to ensure that the public will buy into the new treaty. I agree with the Minister of State's closing remarks, which were a repeat of the Minister, Deputy Cowen's, statement that we have nothing to fear and everything to gain from a renewed Europe. When people think it through, they will come to that conclusion. In today's Ireland, we have moved significantly away from the views held on Europe in the 1970s and 1980s. In the 1970s and 1980s the Irish people saw the word "Europe" as meaning opportunity, an opening and a new way forward. During the 1990s, instead of seeing opportunities, people saw certain doubts and fears. As we witnessed during the debates on the Nice treaty, it was not a question of what we would get from Europe but what we would lose to Europe. We almost feared the cost of success. This debate is before us and we must be ready to address it.This country is now politically at the centre of Europe. We are main players in the politics of Europe and in shaping the new Europe. The challenge for Members and the political establishment is to ensure that we bring the public with us, which will be a difficult task.I was interested in what the Minister of State had to say about the video produced for the younger citizens of Europe. We should try to spread that message, not only to the younger citizens of the European Union but also to every citizen if we want to succeed in selling a new and bigger European Union. The public is engaged in the debate on the Commission Presidency and how it will be finalised and selected. It is healthy that alternatives are on offer and that it is not seen as a fait accompli. I am sure Deputy John Bruton will present his analysis next week. I fully respect the Minister of State's analysis. It is a wise course he is trying to pursue. The public is interested in giving due recognition to the European Parliament and national parliaments. These are just some of the issues we will pursue further with the Minister of State.We must try to get the message across to the people in a way which is straightforward and jargon free. The debate is only starting. The Minister of State's work is perhaps nearing a conclusion. However, the work of national parliamentarians is only starting. We have a lot of work to do.
#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	199	I am delighted to welcome the Minister of State and thank the Leader for allowing time for this debate. We must continue to speak about this issue in the hope people will take note of the fact that the Convention is happening now. It is discussing issues which will have an influence on Irish people in the future. There is no better Chamber in which to discuss this important issue. I hope the media will give coverage tomorrow to the Convention on the Future of Europe, although I am sure the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill will get the headlines. I am delighted to listen to the Minister of State and compliment him on the Trojan work he has done and the many hours he has spent on this issue in recent months. He has reported back to Departments and every Cabinet Minister about what happened at every plenary session and in the working groups which debated the issues.I cannot understand the recent statement by the media that the Government has not adopted a hands-on approach, particularly given that the Forum on Europe, under the stewardship of Senator Maurice Hayes, has travelled the highways and byways discussing this issue. I saw the magnificent video yesterday which will be sent to every secondary school. Every transition year student will have an opportunity to give his or her views on the Convention on the Future of Europe. It is nonsense for the media to suggest the Government has not adopted a hands-on approach.I have attended many meetings in the past month of the Joint Committee on European Affairs which has discussed this issue. I spent hours at home studying it in order that I would be able to speak at ease without reverting to gobbledygook. I attended a public meeting last night and was pleased to be able to speak about subsidiarity in simple language. I welcome the opportunity to tell this to the Minister of State, although he is already aware of it as evidenced by his speech.I want to speak about the institutions of the European Union and how they will be revamped and strengthened in the next session of the Convention on the Future of Europe. I thought there were only two schools of thought in relation to the election of the president but there now seems to be three on how this process should move forward. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify this. We can often say too much and become confused. Perhaps the Minister of State will outline the Government's approach to the selection process and how it should be transparent and open. We should all feel involved rather than allowing the process to take place behind closed doors.We spoke about this issue during the debate on the Nice treaty referendum. We want to include the public. The Forum on Europe and the Joint Committee on European Affairs have made it clear that there will another treaty in the future. We are moving forward with this in mind. The Convention has until June to present its conclusions. The Minister of State said the third phase of the Convention would be brought forward at the Intergovernmental Conference which will take place in the autumn. I hope the treaty will be signed in Ireland and that it will be called the Treaty of Dublin, the Treaty of Athlone or the Treaty of Waterford. I would like to be able to put our stamp on it. We would be proud to campaign for a Treaty of Dublin. We are ahead of member and applicant states in terms of moving forward. We have gone about it the right way and will be successful. I congratulate the Minister of State and the team for the Trojan work they have done in making the Convention accessible and reflecting the views and expectations of all citizens.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I am delighted the Minister of State is representing us at the Convention. It is good to see someone doing something for which he has such enthusiasm. He has always expressed great enthusiasm for any projects related to Europe.Senator Bradford is right that our attitudes have changed and expanded during the years we have been members of the EEC and then the European Union. However, we got a nasty shock last year when we, as politicians, did not put enough work into explaining what the first Nice treaty referendum meant. Much work had to be put into the second referendum. As other Senators, particularly Senator Ormonde, said, we want to be ready to explain everything about the Convention. I compliment Senator Maurice Hayes on the way he runs the Forum on Europe which both Senator Quinn and I attend. It is making a huge difference in ensuring the public is involved in the issue. Mr. Proinsias De Rossa said last week that the Seanad was the first House of any Parliament in Europe to address the issue.The Minister of State said that it looked like there would be a longer lead-in time than was previously envisaged before the Convention became de facto legislation. Does he think the current problems and divisions within the European Union regarding Iraq will make the situation more difficult? It looks like President Bush is determined to go to war, regardless of what we do. That could prolong matters further because we do not know what it will lead to. That is sad. I hope the Minister of State and those working with him will do their utmost to keep the progress being made on track.I am taken by the Minister of State's idea about the election of the president of the Council. No matter what way it is managed, it is important that each country acts simultaneously. There is tremendous cohesion and strength when something like that happens. The marches all over the world, but particularly throughout Europe, against the war in Iraq gave a great sense of belonging and the importance of being part of the European movement. When I remarked to someone that I thought the march in Paris would have been larger than 500,000, I was told that it was the first time the French had ever marched for anything in their Government's favour. It is quite incredible that they always march against but never in favour of the Government.The Minister of State is rightly keeping a close eye on the situation regarding the smaller states, the power of which people underestimate. They have the notion that the bigger states call all the shots but that is not so. The smaller states have a great deal of power. I am delighted to see the Minister of State discussing issues regarding good governance with the Swedish and Finnish Governments. There is a Bill now before the House, the title of which, I am sorry to say, we barely dare speak, that has nothing to do with transparency and openness. It must be a little awkward for the Minister of State to go back and discuss with these open people what is happening here.

I have been getting fan mail asking me to suggest he change the attitude in his amendment regarding removal of the phrase "the rights of children". Apparently, this will now be amended to read "the rights of human beings". The rights of women were enhanced by our entry into the European Union while we are signatories to the European Convention on the Rights of the Child. Why would we want to remove any phrase to do with the rights of the child? I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's explanation.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I, too, welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Roche. It is useful that we have had Proinsias De Rossa and the Minister of State here and that Deputy John Bruton will address us next week. Perhaps they will take a message from this in regard to the role of national parliaments. Previously I would have said the Finns were well ahead of us in regard to how they handled European affairs. That was probably true several years ago but not any longer. We have caught up.Much of the criticism in the press in regard to Ireland taking its eye off the ball is misdirected, glib and superficial and lacks understanding of the work done by the Minister of State, our delegates and the alternates. It is not readily appreciated that all of those involved have come back and informed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, the Forum on Europe and the House of what is happening. We are probably better informed than any other parliamentary assembly in the Union.Will the Minister of State make reference to the issue of federalism? I attended the meeting of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation in Loughrea where this word appeared to frighten people. The Minister of State has proposed amendments to the various articles, in particular, Article 1 which talks about the competences of the Union being exercised on a federal basis. If I am correct in my interpretation of what was in the newspaper today, he is right about this. Many things are done on a federal basis within the European Union and many of its characteristics are federal in nature. However, the Union is not a federation in the classic sense of the word as we understand it in terms of the United States or Germany. I am not frightened by things being done on a federal basis within the competences of the Union but understand that it does cause fright to some and could be used as a vehicle for the mounting of a negative campaign in regard to the adoption of the final treaty that emerges from the Intergovernmental Conference. Will the Minister of State comment on this?The matters raised by the Minister of State in regard to the institutional arrangements are important and we have dealt well with them. What is the European Union? What does it do and what are its characteristics? These are now the fundamental questions which challenge the Convention. It is critical that it is properly presented in terms of the final adoption of the treaty.The attachment of the charter to the constitutional treaty is another issue to be dealt with. I use the words "constitutional treaty" rather than the word "constitution" because there is confusion on this issue. We accept that the charter of human rights would be attached but the nature of the attachment concerns me. Will it have legal standing or is it just a political statement?The question of the interaction between the Constitution and the constitutional treaty that emerges from the Convention is another issue to be dealt with. I accept the fact that the Constitution is supreme in terms of our domestic law. It will only be matters within the competences of the European Union that will be covered by the constitutional treaty.The Minister of State made an important statement about strengthening the Parliament, Commission and Council. It is critical that balance be maintained within that mutual strengthening. When I was in Brussels, I detected a power struggle between the Council and the Commission. While that is understandable, I would not like the election of a president to become politicised to the extent that the institutions could be undermined. The term of the presidency of the Council is another question to be dealt with. The Minister dealt with the matter of the triumvirate but how will the term be defined?There is a proposal that the Commission should legislate in public. What is our view on this? Points were made about transparency. The Commission and the Council are transparent in terms of decision making but many meetings take place in private. They are not paragons of virtue relative to our situation. The Praesidium and the Commission meet in private, rightly so. Will the Minister of State give us his observations on the proposal that the legislative aspects of the Commission be open to the public?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I welcome the Minister of State and agree with Senator Henry that if ever a man was made for a job, it was he. Just like the Dalai Lama it seems he was being formed for it since he was born. The country is well served by the political representatives we have attached to the Convention. It is good that, for the first time, we have a broad range of political representation. The two main parties are involved with the Labour Party. I am genuinely sorry that there is no Progressive Democrats participant. It is important that we create a bedrock of agreement about the future of the European Union. It is important also that we broaden it as far as possible and try to engage everybody not instinctively hostile to the concept. This was not done for previous treaties.I am an enthusiast for the European project, though people may not believe this. I have been so from the beginning but did not like what I was offered in terms of implementation of the project. The first time I voted "Yes" in a referendum was in the second Nice treaty referendum because I believed it was the first treaty on which we were voting which would do harm to others. Whatever way we voted on the previous treaties, we would be the beneficiaries or losers depending on the decision made. I believe the people were wiser than I in regard to most of those decisions. The Nice treaty was singularly different because we were in a position to do enormous harm to other countries and this was the biggest factor which changed my mind.I am also an enthusiastic believer in the European social market model. If I was asked to define that concept, I would reply that I am better able to describe rather than define it. Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, made this point last week. I am not reiterating it in a party political sense, but because it is important that this side of the European project does not get lost in the institution-building and the huge concern about a common foreign and security policy and all the other issues.Europe has been unique, at its best, in its capacity to link economic efficiency with a strong sense of the need to provide a sophisticated and humane system of social protection and guarantees. It is an example to the world, particularly to another huge economic power, in regard to the fact that it is possible to combine the two. We should not lose sight of this. Europe, in its capacity to be both economically innovative and socially just, is a shining example to the world about how one can do both.I support Senator Henry's question on the rights of children. I was about to ask the Minister of State about this area, but I will not spend time on it now.I cannot resist drawing an ironic distinction between our enthusiasm for openness and transparency abroad and what we are currently involved in here. It does not relate, incidentally, to the protection of Government, but to the instruments which are used to protect Government and which are capable of being used to protect an awful lot more.I do not have a problem with protecting Government. I do not have any difficulty with matters that are secret, of necessity, being kept secret. However, I have a difficulty with the fact that where secrecy is offered without being accountable it will be used for far more than is needed. This raises the issue of why many of the State papers that are disclosed every New Year's Day needed to be kept secret for 30 years. Apart from the privacy of certain individuals, very little of what is eventually disclosed really needed to be kept secret for so long.I wish to ask the Minister of State to pursue one issue in regard to secrecy. During the term of the previous Government, I was a member of the Joint Committee on European Affairs. It was a very enjoyable and interesting committee and I hope I was an active member. One of the lowest points for the committee came about due to a proposed meeting with Javier Solana, who had been recently appointed to the position of High Representative for common foreign and security policy. He would only meet us on condition that the meeting was in private. We refused and no meeting took place. I do not have a problem if there is a reason for that sort of thing. In principle, a European High Representative should come to meet the committee of a national parliament to discuss European business. We do not have huge secrets at European level and I believe that it is fundamentally wrong that he insisted that the meeting be held in private.

What we are seeing in each of these debates is that people have much to say about the European Union and the European project. Perhaps we should look again at it. I compliment the Minister of State and all our representatives for the work they are doing in Europe and also for their willingness to participate in a wider debate.I cannot resist concluding by saying that the amendment to the regulations about Europe in these Houses was initiated by the Labour Party. The Forum on Europe was also initiated by the Labour Party and the debate we are now having was suggested by me.

As a child of the EU – I was born in 1973 – I wish to hear from him how he would make the EU relevant to my generation, members of which have grown up in the EU and do not know any life outside it. It remains a challenge for all of us, when we speak to people under 30 years of age, to explain what life was like before the EU and how Ireland's being a member of it has changed our lives for the better. This is an area at which the convention could look.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I also welcome the Minister of State and commend him on the energy and application he has displayed in terms of the work he is doing on the Convention on the Future of Europe. I also commend our other representatives Deputy John Bruton, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, Deputy Gormley and the alternates, Deputy Carey and Mr. Bobby McDonagh, on the work they have done. They have been extremely willing at all times to come to the forum and share their knowledge and ideas and to ensure that its members are kept abreast with developments in Europe.The point raised by Senator Browne is the nub of what we and the Convention should be doing. The Convention's main purpose is to reconnect the people of Europe to the governance of the Union and also to make provision for that governance in an enlarged Union. There is a real danger that there is a generation growing up that does not remember what it was like not to be in Europe and, in many ways, its members have to be convinced. The Irish people have to be reconvinced on the issue of Europe.We are now at the happy watershed of moving from being a receiving country to being a contributor. That is something we should welcome and we should also recognise the extent to which Europe enabled us to get into that position. We must recognise the importance of Europe for us all, particularly in terms of the international situation it addressed. The fact that the EU has kept peace in its part of the continent for 50 years is an idea that has to be sold.We need to recognise the fact that there will be another referendum on a treaty here after all the valuable work has been done. This will probably take place in about 18 months. It is difficult to engage people in abstract subjects while they remain abstract and the media and others only tend to be interested when there is blood on the floor. The question is how to maintain an intelligent interest in the subject so that on the next occasion people are not faced with a treaty that has been parachuted in on top of them without a context being provided and without them feeling part of it.In regard to the work of the Minister of State and the suggestions we made, it seems that the important thing is to try to strengthen and maintain the architecture of the Union while making it more transparent and efficient. Without question, the interests of a smaller country such as Ireland will be better protected by having a strong Commission.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	220	Yes.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	221	This is something to which we should be bending our minds. We might have to make a trade-off between a strong Commission and a fully representative one. If that was the case, I think our interests are to be found in a strong Commission rather than otherwise. I am also interested in the Minister of State's pursuit of rules for good governance and administrative good behaviour. He will be aware that the Council of Europe has, in the past, produced such rules, which could be a good development.I will be glad to hear what the Minister of State has to say about whether the Intergovernmental Conference should spill over into the Irish Presidency. I believe that it should do so. The Convention has carried out its work with a great deal of transparency, whereas the pattern in the past was for Intergovernmental Conferences to work in the opposite way. It would be an enormous pity if, having stirred up public interest to the extent that we have done, the Intergovernmental Conference should move the process behind some form of purdah. I hope the Intergovernmental Conference will not take the form of a series of meetings in smoke-filled rooms at late hours of the night, but that it will also present its discussions in a way in which the community can relate to them. That will be part of the crucial task of selling the outcome to the peoples of Europe.I commend the Minister of State on his work. I have been hugely impressed by what a small Irish team, which has to cover the entire waterfront, has been doing with limited resources. The Minister of State deserves all the help and support that we can give him. We welcome this opportunity of hearing about his work and I hope we will hear more about it in the future.

As Senator Henry and Senator Ryan stated, it is great to see somebody who actually fits into a job. However, I am somewhat concerned about that. I am reminded of the saying that when the Normans came to Ireland they became more Irish than the Irish themselves. I caution the Minister of State against becoming so enthusiastic about Europe that on some future occasion he might take his eye off Ireland's interests. I know he will not do so.

I am somewhat concerned about head office taking too much power unto itself and head office always believes it is there to help you.I like name-dropping and a couple of years ago I met Vaclav Klaus and got to know him quite well. He is now President Vaclav Klaus, having been elected President of the Czech Republic last week. During the period between the two referenda on the Nice treaty, when I spoke to him about where we were going, I discovered that he was not at all in favour of the treaty. He is a conservative and was unenthusiastic about it.

Vaclav Klaus was not enthusiastic because he said he did not want to substitute a new big brother for that which his country had in Moscow for many years.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	242	I have three questions about Articles 9, 11 and 12 of the Convention. Article 9 deals with the primacy of European law over the laws of member states. Is the Minister of State sure that he is protecting our interests in this area? Article 11 deals with exclusive competency over the common policy. The French are worried about their film industry in this area. Are there concerns for Ireland in this regard? Article 12 deals with tax harmonisation, which, according to an article in The Economist last week, could damage our tax system. I do not believe everything I read in The Economist, but will the Minister of State put my mind at rest in that regard? 
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I echo all of the comments and compliments that have been paid to our former colleague in this House. He has done extremely well since his time here and he has our good wishes.Within the context of the debate about Ireland's role and continuing involvement in the European experiment, would the Minister of State agree that we are at a crossroads? If one looks back to our entry into the then Common Market, we were on the periphery of Europe and we were economically backward. The main issue of the day was agriculture. I recall the late Brian Lenihan, the Leader's brother, addressing a meeting in my constituency of Carrick-on-Shannon, where he said that if Ireland did not join the Common Market, the country would be bankrupt at one minute past midnight. He used graphic images to concentrate people's minds. It was not necessarily true that the country would be bankrupt, but it showed where Ireland's interests lay because of our ties with Britain.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	244	He was not far wrong.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	245	We have moved on and what I am trying to suggest is that we are at a crossroads. We have assumed new responsibilities and will be a net contributor to the EU within a few years. We have assumed a leadership role. I am pleased the Minister of State has taken the initiative to set up alliances with the smaller states. This is an area on which he might expand because these are the countries with which we have the greatest common interests. As the Leader will know, having been present at meetings of Councils of Ministers, alliances are very much the order of the day in the relationship between member states.As legislators, we are privileged to have the opportunity to absorb – I am not so sure we are able to absorb them all – the complexities of the EU through the Minister of State's active involvement in this Chamber, in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs, in the National Forum on Europe and several other fora. I ask him to respond again to the fears people had during the first Nice referendum and to a lesser extent in the second referendum? It is a somewhat like that other cliché "It won't go away, they are still out there". I refer here to the issue of neutrality. At yesterday's meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I raised a question about the competency and the apparent overlap of various articles which seems to suggest a need for clarification. The Minister of State agreed – I am glad that The Irish Times covered his response – about the need for clarity where common foreign and security policy issues are concerned and the fact that there is not an ultimate primacy over Irish constitutional law in that regard.Like my colleagues, I am amazed at the Minister of State's energy and I have been aware of his commitment since we served together on the Western European Union Parliamentary Assembly. I am overwhelmed by his dedication and I wish him continued success not only in what he is attempting to achieve, but also in the manner in which he is batting for Ireland at a very serious time in our nation's history.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I am grateful for the expressions of support from Members. Senator Bradford asked interesting questions regarding Ireland's relationship with Europe. So too did Senator Browne and I will tell him exactly how he can inspire every young person to think about Europe. These matters were also touched on by Senators Maurice Hayes and Quinn.This afternoon Eurobarometer survey No. 58 was published. Its first conclusion is that with regard to EU enlargement, Ireland is the best-informed member state and very supportive of enlargement. I have always said that the Irish vote on enlargement was an act of generosity by the Irish people. We could have been the dog in the manger, but we were not. When I travelled around the country I was inspired by the fact that people had questions, and rightly so, because the Nice treaty was far from being a perfect document. I had the job of selling it to virtually 4 million Irish people and I knew all about its imperfections by the time the campaign was over. Senator Ryan grasped the essence of the Irish vote, and I compliment him, because this was the first treaty where we could have done damage to other people but we did not.It is perceived as an act of generosity. Last Monday, at a European Affairs committee meeting, I was asked about comments made by Mr. Chirac, a man for whom I have high regard, over the previous weekend. He is a sophisticated politician representing a sophisticated and civilised country. I commented on the suggestion that new member states were not equal, whereas the very essence of the EU is equality, and if we lose sight of that, the EU will not last or prosper.I made this comment off the cuff, and I was astonished when I arrived in Prague on Thursday in the Parliament building and met a national representative who thanked me and the Irish Parliament for the comment. The Foreign Minister, the Leader of the Senate and the Opposition leader subsequently said they regarded Ireland as the true friend of small nations. I said we had so much in common in their recent history, with a large neighbour taking occupancy of their homeland. They had that for 50 years, Ireland had it for 700 years, so we understood their difficulties. We have an affinity with those people. We should build on that, and be the champion of the small and medium states. This could be one of those lovely occasions involving a synergy between self-interest and the right thing to do.The Eurobarometer shows that confidence in European institutions has increased dramatically in Ireland in the past year. Ireland's confidence rating for the European Parliament is now at 61%, the highest in the EU. In the Commission the rating has risen to 57%, having previously dropped to 48%. Even the Council of Ministers, with all its imperfections, now has a confidence rating by Ireland of over 50%. This whole process of referenda and debate has been very positive in Ireland because it has a better understanding of the EU. We are to the fore in this regard, a factor which we do not recognise.Senator Ormonde spoke about principles. I have argued that it is important that the small and medium states should evolve a set of principles, rather than become involved in the negative argument against proposals. Our Department of Foreign Affairs has drafted such a set of principles, which was circulated to all the smaller states. Last week, for the first time, representatives of all the small and medium states of the EU met. We did not all agree, but we met. Our intention was not to create a dichotomy between small and big states, but to establish principles regarding equality and rotation.As Senator Hayes said, equality is more important than numbers. People are being seduced by the old argument that there should be one Commission member per member state. I would love to see that and would be anxious to achieve it, but only if there is equality. There is no point if one Commissioner is in charge of paper-clips and another in charge of a major portfolio.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, made this point eloquently in his contribution to the IEA. His philosophy in this regard informs my own thinking and the policies we are pursuing. It is seductive, particularly for newer states, to argue the one-for-one basis, but the most important basis is equality. If there is to be rotation, it must be on an equality basis. We are on the strong moral ground in fighting for this, and we will win. If we can improve matters by going a step further, we will do that too.Senator Ormonde also made a point about the name, the Treaty of Dublin. I am not concerned about the title on the treaty. Regarding Senator Dardis's point, it was the Government which fought for the term "constitutional treaty" rather than "constitution", which is used rather sloppily throughout the treaty text. I would love it to be the Treaty of Dublin. Who would not? The most important part of the process is to get a treaty which will serve the people for many years to come, a treaty which the ordinary European citizen can read and understand, rather than the gobbledygook which has passed for treaties before now. We must avoid convoluted language.Senator Henry asked if the Government is inimical to the rights of children. Of course it is not. It is a ludicrous suggestion. Those who know me know how conscious I am of the rights of children.There are two broad approaches within the Convention discussion regarding issues of competencies. In the Social Europe Group, of which I was a member and all of whose meetings I attended, one argument was for a long list of competencies, but in such a list some things are inevitably omitted. In the original draft, we were faced with just such a situation. The rights of children were mentioned, but the rights of the disabled were not. Inter-generational rights were not represented – the requirement for younger people to show concern for older people was not there. There was also a right at which people like myself and Senator Ryan would cavil regarding the defence of the community. I did not know what that meant.In my submission, I have suggested a rewording of the Article. I have proposed using the United Nations formulation regarding human rights. This avoids the danger of omitting something from a list. When drafting such a treaty, an important point is to avoid suggesting a community has more competencies than it actually has. If we look at the relevant section of the treaty, it clearly failed in this regard.We recommend the universality of rights rather than offend against an individual right. I am grateful to Senator Henry for asking that question. If the Convention falls back to the idea of a long list, we will look at it to make sure it is comprehensive and absolutely inclusive and that the rights of disabled people and inter-generational rights are included. There are two dangers if one decides on enumeration. There is a danger of leaving something out and that one may create an artificial view of what the rights are. Nevertheless, I am grateful for the question.I agree with Senator Henry that we got a nasty shock when the first Nice treaty referendum was defeated. When the Taoiseach telephoned me on 6 June and said he was making me Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, I was delighted. When he said, "By the way, the first thing you are going to have to do is get Nice 2 through," I had a certain little—

Most of us appreciate the fact that the Union has always responded best in circumstances of crisis. For example, the defeat of the European political and defence proposals, the Pleven plan, in the French Parliament in 1954 gave rise to the Messina conference which gave rise, in turn, to the Treaty of Rome. When the European Union hit the doldrums, it was intervention by Jacques Delors that reactivated it. There is a necessity for some further thinking on this issue.Senator Henry also mentioned the underestimation of smaller states. It has suddenly dawned on some of the bigger states that the smaller states will be in the majority in the new European Union. That is not to suggest that we should disregard the views of the larger states. I listen with respect to anything said by France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy or Spain and will listen to anything said by Poland when it becomes a member. However, I am not prepared to accept that a policy brought forward by a large state is always superior to a policy brought forward by a small state or Ireland. We have grown to the point where we can be sufficiently self-confident to argue our case and are doing this.While I do not like to knock the media, I agree with Senator Dardis. There is a certain laziness in suggesting that we are not up to speed. This can be shown to be wrong by any objective appraisal of the facts and it is so wrong that it is offensive. Senator Dardis is correct in saying Article 1.1 makes reference to a federal basis. That is all it does. When the first 16 articles were published, I said people should not be over-excited by this article because it was not describing a federal constitution. Members will be aware of an interesting parallel debate in Dáil Éireann when Bunreacht na hÉireann was introduced. When Mr. de Valera was asked the reason the Constitution did not state that Ireland was a republic, he took out the dictionary and defined the word "republic". He said that if one brought an elephant or a horse into the House, one would not need to hang a label around its neck.In the plenary and working sessions I have said that the use of the word "federal" describes a process, not the nature of the Union. That is exactly what it does. The word "federal" is written with a lower case ‘f' in the second part of the sentence. I have suggested that if the second part of the sentence was struck out, Article 1.1 would become much more impressive and clear. A number of states have argued that we should be talking about an ever-closer Union. This is language from the older treaties on which there will have to be a compromise. It is a tactical error to get too hung up on the issue of federalism because it has brought the federalists back out. If I was a federalist, I would be very unhappy with the first 16 articles.Senator Dardis also mentioned the attachment of the charter to the treaty. The appropriate place to put the charter is in a protocol. There are 54 articles, four of which have horizontal provisions. It would become very cumbersome if it was incorporated in the first part of the treaty. The majority view is that it should be in part 2. I think it appropriate that it be included in a protocol. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the clearest view of any of his counterparts in Europe. He has pointed out that if one is going to bring forward the charter, the horizontal provisions and the commentary as to how judges should interpret it, it cannot be included in the treaty. The charter will only apply in a restricted position, that is, to European institutions and the member states fulfilling their responsibilities. That is the clearest exposition of where it should be placed. I am arguing for this, not that we are hostile in any way to the charter but on the basis that we want to make sure that when it comes in, there will not be a clash between the competence of the Union on issues relating to fundamental rights and the Constitution, which is superior. The title, constitutional treaty, is used to retain the institutional balance. That is exactly the argument we are making. We want to retain the institutional balance.Senator Ryan made reference to other issues. He was the first person to introduce a FOI Bill. I was rather more successful in that I got the agreement of this House to such a Bill. It would be interesting to compare the current debates with some of the issues I raised, but I will not go into that.

I will go into it to this extent. When I introduced the Bill in this House, I said there would be difficulties relating to Cabinet papers. I said this, having studied the Norwegian Act, as Senator Ryan did, and having worked for the OECD in Norway. I forecast the difficulties.My concern about good administration is sincere. There should be principles of good administration. By the way, the European Union does not have a FOI Act, although many member states do.Senator Browne asked how I could make the European Union relevant. When I was a young boy, I was taken to the Warsaw ghetto exhibition in London by an uncle of mine where I saw the famous photograph of the little boy with his hands up coming out of the ghetto. That is how one makes the European Union relevant. For all its ills the Union has given more than 50 years of peace, serenity and progress to the peoples of western Europe. The peoples of eastern and central Europe long for this and are entitled to it. That photograph hangs in my room in Government Buildings. People to whom I spoke in connection with the holocaust day were impressed by the fact that it was there. That is the reason it is on the cover of the first Irish holocaust day booklet.I recently had the privilege of representing this country at a Convention in Warsaw. When I was there, I took a half day off and went with a man who had gone into the ghetto as a 16-year old boy. The only thing that remains is a sewer. I went into it with the other Irish people there with me and, on behalf of every Irish person, put a wreath at the transportation point from where 350,000 men, women and children went to Treblinka. That is the reason we should be inspired about the European Union. That is its essence. We should try to create an area of greater peace and harmony in Europe. That is what inspires me.Senator Maurice Hayes spoke of making the European Union relevant. I mentioned the barometer. The forum has done extraordinary work on which I compliment Senator Hayes. I agree with him that a strong Commission is the formula.I remind Senator Quinn that Roche is a Norman name. The Roches built the first castles in County Wexford and set up the first rudimentary administration. I recommend to the Senator that he look at who convened the very first Irish Parliament. It was a man called Richard Roche.

Like us, he is concerned about Articles 9, 11 and 12. Most of the contributions were made on the amendments to these articles and I will ask that they be sent to the Senator because they reflect some of his views.The specific issue the Senator raised was that of tax harmonisation. This is an important matter. We have said we are not hostile to the process of tax harmonisation, but it is of such significance that it should continue to be dealt with on the basis of unanimity within the Council of Ministers. Senators will appreciate that, given that we have surrendered the monetary instruments, the fiscal instrument is important and close to sovereignty. I feel a sense of annoyance about this in the Convention because most of the arguments put forward for tax harmonisation by QMV are ill-considered and do not stand up to any critical test. I understand why some countries are making those arguments, but I cannot understand why others are doing so.In my visits to the new states I have pointed out the significance of retaining the fiscal instrument and of the need for tax harmonisation on the basis of unanimity. When the Convention touched on this – there was a fatuous suggestion that a consensus might be reached – I drafted a letter, which was signed by me, Peter Hain from the United Kingdom, the representative from Sweden and representatives of two of the incoming states, to say we that represent different views on the tax issue in general and different approaches to tax, but that we want this issue to continue to be dealt with on the basis of unanimity. That is a view which is growing within the Convention. The Department of Finance recently produced a good draft for me on that topic and I have used it effectively elsewhere to win support for the idea.Senator Mooney asked if we are at a crossroads. We are always at a crossroads and it is a good place to be. It means one is going forward and is not stuck in the mud. The Senator also referred to neutrality. The first point to be made here is that the articles on CFSP have not come forward, but the working group that dealt with defence recognised the fact that there are different views. The issue of small, non-aligned or neutral states will be well represented by me and others on the Convention. I would be glad to answer any other questions.

Treaties, charters, etc., are fine and no doubt our membership of the European Union has brought about stability and peace. However, Ireland has been a member state for 30 years and the majority of citizens still see it as a "them and us" situation. That was evident in the run-up to the recent campaigns on the Nice treaty referenda. There is a need to push for a genuine union of people within the EU. It is important to facilitate twinning arrangements not only between local authorities and town councils, but also between communities. One will feel comfortable if one knows people better.Being an island nation, we are isolated from mainland Europe and are faced with a "them and us" situation. Local democracy is an issue that has not been mentioned in the treaty. Democracy should come from the bottom up, but here it come from the top down. We have the most centralised system of local government in Europe, particularly when one compares it with those in Denmark, Germany, etc., and it must be considered. We are being treated with arrogance. Since Christmas we have had three or four Bills before the House which dilute the powers of elected local representatives. I refer here to the Protection of the Environment Bill, the Local Government Bill and the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill, which will have an impact on us in terms of discovering what is happening at local government level.

I must confess that I do not know much about the Norman individual, Richard Roche, who came from Wexford all those years ago.I was fascinated by what the Minister of State said. He told us the number of amendments he has tabled to various provisions within the Convention. When is it envisaged they will be debated and what form will that debate take?The Minister of State indicated that the Convention is moving forward. It is clear that he, Deputy John Bruton, and Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, who was here last week, have interesting views. It is no harm that their views are divergent. That is understandable because they are different people. In what fashion is that to be resolved? In what forum will the Minister of State's amendments be debated and will there be a report issued? I would be glad to get a reply on the timetable and contents issue.

I have an interest in some of the ideological elements to which the Minister of State referred. I am glad it seems to have been referred to as a constitutional treaty, rather than a constitution. I am also happy with the union of states and peoples which seems to be a very apt description of the European Union as it stands.We should not engage in a Pavlovian response to any reference to the word "federal", particularly in terms of they way it is used in Thatcherite propaganda. The latter has, unfortunately, been adopted by some of the sceptics in this country about the rise of a federal European superstate. The concept of a superstate is nonsense because it would not be possible to develop such an entity on a revenue of 1% of GNP. I am not a federalist, but one has to take account of people who are. We must also take account of difficulties with our public opinion in our own country, particularly in terms of winning referenda, etc. We should try to adopt a more nuanced approach than some of our friends across the water.Other speakers referred to the issue of defence and neutrality. Would it not be inconsistent with neutrality to have a collective response to terrorism? I would like to hear the Minister's thoughts on that matter.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I also welcome the Minister of State and endorse the sentiments and commendations extended to him. Equally, I commend Senator Maurice Hayes for chairing the forum, which has been widely praised.Some of the questions I had wished to put to the Minister of State have already been asked. I am heartened by his reply in respect of tax harmonisation. I am delighted that he has again affirmed that, in so far as the Government is concerned, unanimity must be retained in regard to tax harmonisation. There are, however, a number of concerns, one of which was raised by Senator Dardis in respect of small states and where our interests might best lie in the future.When we joined the then EEC, for every £1 we paid in we received £10 in return. Out of every £10 we received, £9 went to farmers and, out of that, approximately £8 went on price supports. Things have changed a great deal in the interim. There is a new scheme of things now and, as others Members stated, the situation is constantly evolving. How does the Minister of State see Ireland fitting into the new scheme of things, given that in two or three years we will be net contributors as opposed to being major beneficiaries?Senator Dardis said that the charter of rights will be incorporated in the Constitution. Will it pose a threat to our sovereignty? Some scribes have been busy recently in pointing out a legal basis for our concern. Does the Minister of State agree with that?To come back to the choice between the Commission and Council, the view is, as stated today, that Ireland's interests and those of the smaller states would be best served by a stronger Commission rather than a stronger Council in a constantly evolving European Union.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I join in the welcome to the Minister of State. Like Senator Mooney, I was glad to be an observer at the Western European Union when the Minister of State was our leader. He was referred to as a man of energy which he certainly proved during the last Nice treaty referendum.I raise the question of alternative energy and the European Union's support or otherwise for it. We are conscious of the Kyoto Protocol and green taxes. I also know the Minister of State dealt with tax harmonisation. There is talk of a review of the EURATOM Treaty which was passed in the late 1950s. Will the Minister of State comment on this? There is a feeling that preferential treatment is being given to the nuclear industry, a debate we have had in Ireland in which there has been much concern about Sellafield. This might be an opportune time to look at other forms of energy, particularly in the light of the Kyoto Protocol. Is there continuing support for alternative sources of energy?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	270	In response to Senator Bannon's point about "us" and "them", he is right. We are not conscious of how people elsewhere in Europe view us. We are viewed as a positive, progressive and high achieving small state. Somehow or other we do not accept this. We always tend to defer to someone foreign. If one is looking for a consultant, one thinks that if he or she is from abroad, he or she must be better. That is not necessarily true, although it does not necessarily mean he or she is worse. When lecturing in university, I was always very conscious of the fact that there had been an attitudinal change over the last 30 years and that we were becoming more self-confident. We should try to get rid of the mantle we have carried for far too many years that somehow or other we are children of a lesser god. We are equal. While we are not necessarily superior, we should never accept that we are in any way inferior. I know that was not Senator Bannon's point but it is one on which he touched.In regard to local democracy, the issue of subsidiarity is dealt with in the Convention in a very appropriate way. In fact, it is dealt with in a more interesting way than we have dealt with it in this country. Subsidiarity goes to the heart of the argument of local versus national government or centralisation versus decentralisation. The Belgian Foreign Minister, Louis Michel, said to me some time ago when I was making a contribution on federalism, that in parts of Europe, including Belgium, subsidiarity and federalism were regarded as two sides of the same coin. We just take a different view. It is interesting that people in Europe take different views. Members will be aware that the Committee of the Regions has made a submission. I do not know how it will pan out because the Convention's focus is not inward as regards member states. Its primary job is to take existing treaties, bring them together and produce a coherent document. It does not have a remit to extend the competences of the Community in any way or enter into new areas.Senator O'Rourke asked a good question about the number of amendments. There are over 1,100 to the first 16 articles.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	271	In the Minister of State's name?

One of the interesting statistics is that 436 of the amendments are to the first three articles alone. This suggests there is a huge amount of work to be done. The Senator also asked an interesting question about how they will be dealt with. Oddly enough, that is one of the issues I have raised. I chaired a meeting of national representatives the week before we received the amendments and that question was raised. One of the matters being worked on is a structure to handle the amendments but with that volume it is difficult. I am not being critical of MEPs but when one has a good idea, everybody signs it.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	274	There is grandstanding going on. While many of the amendments are not relevant to the treaty, there will be a problem weeding them out. I recently compared them to a black box – a lot of stuff going in but a lesser amount coming out. One wonders what will happen to the rest.I agree with Senator Mansergh in regard to a union of states and peoples. In fact, he picked up a very interesting phrase. On three occasions when the first 16 articles were introduced, Valéry Giscard d'Estaing made the point that this was the nature of the Union. The Union is not a federation or an intergovernmental body but something different which operates on communitaire principles. That is the point that needs to be made. We need to establish a definition which more accurately describes the European Union. I said yesterday at the Oireachtas Joint Committee that we had been bedevilled with an arid debate on the basis of titles which had no relevance to this body. The Senator's question touched on the protocol relating to our position, particularly the issue of neutrality which will be continued in that the protocols will be carried over.Senator Fitzgerald talked about marking change. He mentioned the fact that we are moving from being a net recipient to a net contributor. That is a great position in which to be because it means we have more than caught up with the European average. It is Ireland's great achievement over the last 30 years. We will continue to be huge beneficiaries. First, we are finding our feet nationally and our confidence in the European Union; second, our young people will have the benefit of a Union which is at peace and harmony with itself and which, I hope, can see eye to eye on major issues; and, third, we have the most important thing of all, a big economic market.I am very positive about the European Union and the Convention. The team and I are putting a huge amount of energy into the Convention because it presents an opportunity for us all in this small peripheral state to put our mark on the future. It is the best opportunity we will ever have and we should grasp it with both hands.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I may not use the seven minutes because I expressed all the points I wish to raise earlier.The debate is important for the reasons I outlined earlier. It is amazing that in detailing their opposition, which they are entitled to do, Members on the other side of the House never mentioned the favourable elements that will be brought about by these amendments. I outlined these earlier and there is no point in rehearsing them.A strong clause makes provision for moving from the High Court to the Supreme Court on appeal. I do not know who spancelled the former Minister of State, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald, on the previous occasion, but such a provision is not included in the existing Act. In regard to charging for information, I urge the Minister to examine the possibility of introducing a substantial waiver system because every payment to a State body can be the subject of a strong appeal. That must be done and I hope it will be because the system will otherwise too arbitrary.There is a clear need for a tighter journalistic approach to freedom of information. I do not mind detailing with whom I had lunch or how many rows I had with the Minister for Finance in correspondence. The Department of Finance has a job to do which is, namely, to say "No" to everybody. The Department of Finance could not function if it did not adopt rigorous scrutiny of some of the expansive ideas which the heads of various Government Departments, as is their right, put forward. However, I thought it hilarious that, just before I left Government, there was a request under the Freedom of Information Act in connection with a luncheon I gave for the press. The person who requested the information was at the lunch and had a very good time.One does not get to do anything that does not come under the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act and rightly so, particularly in light of the things that are happening. I felt like saying exactly what that person had to eat and imbibe and what a good time was had by all. However, I thought it absurd that this was the kind of information being requested. That is not to make a case against the Freedom of Information Act, rather it is to make the case for a stricter journalistic approach to the Act. I am sure journalists would see fit and would wish to adopt such an approach. I am not making a case for draconian measures in regard to what are only minor irritants, but the reporting of them is sometimes quite funny.I recall some correspondence between the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and me in which he wrote something and I replied in equally strong terms because I never take such letters as a put-down, but as part of an invigorating debate. However, what was reported was what he said to me and what I said to him. It was reported in a kind of breathless way that suggested we were about to stab one another, which was nonsense. Senator Higgins made that case this morning. We are not all clones of Dolly the sheep, bobbing our heads together and having the same thoughts and adopting the same points of view on everything. That would be patent nonsense.I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak. I hope the debate will continue, not in a sustained, but certainly in a vigorous, way.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	280	I am instinctively opposed to the Bill, as are all people who are in Opposition or independent of the Government. There are good reasons for that. I do not oppose it with any great hysterical fervour because I understand perfectly well from my experience in this House how politicians behave when they are in Government. I understand even better how civil servants, who are permanently in Government, behave.The Freedom of Information Act has worked in a fairly strange way. There are those who would say it has not worked. The moment it was introduced, ways were found to circumvent it. Ministers, civil servants and other people who felt they would be subject to this Act immediately decided not to put sensitive information in print. That is a sensible and realistic response, if one does not like being open. The experience of Governments here, despite what the Opposition said today, is that nobody really likes people knowing any more than they must. That is a cultural problem which is not restricted to Ireland. It is an international problem that governments, the moment they enter office, do not want to release any more information than they are obliged to by law and those in opposition always want to press for it to happen. That is the situation with which we are faced.We should examine this so-called high level committee – I know what the Leader said and I agree with her in that regard – with a certain amount of scepticism. A Government that does not like the way the Freedom of Information Act is being operated because too much awkward or embarrassing information is being released could choose no more suitable a group to help it suppress such information than one comprised of civil servants. That is not to reflect on the work of civil servants in their jobs, as a rule.The Civil Service, like its counterparts abroad, is an extremely secretive organisation. It has standards which it believes it should uphold. One of those standards is that information is power, that it is valuable and that it should not be released to anybody unless it has to be. That is the culture of the Irish Civil Service. It is the culture of nearly all civil services. If a Government wants to get a group of people to come to a predestined conclusion on this issue, what it does is pick a group of civil servants and ask them what they think. It is inevitable that the people selected, great as they are at their jobs, will come to the conclusion that the information on which they were entrusted to write a report should, as far as possible, be protected.I wish to consider this matter in a slightly different way. I want to challenge the culture of secrecy in the Civil Service and the protective attitude politicians have toward information and ask another question. This Bill essentially defends Cabinet secrecy and the retention thereof. I would like a camera to be permanently placed in the Cabinet room and a tape recorder permanently placed on the Cabinet table. With very few subjects excluded, I cannot see why it should not happen. One reason it should happen is that, in any event, everybody will know tomorrow what happened at Cabinet today. The problem is that the spin tends to distort what really happened. Journalists and politicians know which side most Ministers are on with regard to almost all arguments because Cabinets leak information about every issue. Ministers constantly leak information detrimental to each other and others tell stories, which may or may not be true, under the veil of Cabinet secrecy.

They have nothing of which to be ashamed. No realistic citizen expects that 15 people will agree on something and come up with a unanimous verdict. Every intelligent person would understand if they saw a Cabinet openly disagree – as it does on every issue – and then come together, put through a measure and support it. That is the basis of Cabinet solidarity and it is the nature of Government.There is a charade at present that the Cabinet agrees something with nobody else knowing what has happened, but it all appears in the newspapers the next day in any event. Under the Freedom of Information Act, one is not allowed to obtain information on the measures going through. To do so, it is necessary to get someone to leak the information from his or her point of view, which provides a distorted view of the matter. That is unsatisfactory and I cannot understand why all information on controversial public issues should not be in the public domain. I suppose we should exclude war, security, violence, pornography—

There should no longer be any mystique about what happens at Cabinet and politicians should not be ashamed of their views.An example of the culture of secrecy in our society is the extraordinary aura that still attaches to judges. Oireachtas Members must openly declare their interests, which is a bit awkward, inconvenient and something we would rather not do. However, judges, for some reason, are shrouded in secrecy and do not have to declare their interests – despite having vast interests – because they are civil servants. Top civil servants do not come under the same open rules as do Members.

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	292	It is different. For example, if a person is high up in a semi-State body, he or she does not have to declare his or her interests to the public. The interests are declared to another group and that information is never made public. Why are such people not subject to the same rules on openness as Members of the Oireachtas? There should be consistency on that matter. The Civil Service is not subject to the same accountability and does not want to be because it is not used to it and does not like it. Neither do Oireachtas Members, but it would be far easier for us if we, and the Cabinet, had to account for everything openly and without any suppression of information.I find sinister and subjective the idea of establishing a committee to decide what is relevant. The committee referred to in the Bill will decide what information is designated as being there to support Government deliberations. That is utterly subjective. It will give power to this group to decide what comes under this legislation and what does not. This is not defined in the Bill and it may be found that it becomes a wide umbrella in the years to come. This suppression of information could easily drift into areas which were not intended by those who framed the Bill. It is not a tight Bill, it is extremely subjective.The issue of costs reflects the thought processes of those who framed the Bill and those who wanted to see it appear in this fashion. It is full of the attitude that people should be prevented from accessing information and that obstacles should be put in their way. Costs are an enormous obstruction. Those who framed the Bill have taken an extreme example as evidence to support their case, namely, that of one person who ridiculously cost the State €127,000 by pursuing a large number of matters, some of them frivolous. An exception of that sort makes bad law, and to use it to support the argument in favour of the Bill is not honest.There is a much more serious general principle at issue. I can see it spreading further and further into public life and it is a particularly dangerous one. The House should not be frightened to let people know where Members stand on various issues. The Cabinet or anyone else should not be afraid to do so either.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I am grateful to Senator Ross for sharing time. Unlike him, I do not have an instinctively negative reaction to the Bill. I understand that, for Cabinet and Government to work efficiently, certain measures must be taken. One must be practical about this and it is unrealistic, particularly in the context of Governments which remain in office for four or five years, to have confidential Cabinet material released after five years. It was previously released after 30 years and I think ten years is reasonable.There has been an amount of huffing, puffing and posturing about this. I was curious to hear Deputy Burton on radio dealing with this matter as Labour Party spokesperson. I would have imagined that, as it is a Seanad Bill—
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It was shared.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I see. I did not mean any personal denigration of Senator O'Meara, for whom I have great admiration. I had expected that more prominence would have been given to the Seanad. I hope that the Labour Party will table its Bill as an amendment to this because we will then have the opportunity to consider the two alternatives and vote on them.There is an argument that five years is not adequate and that ten years is more practical. As a tutor in Trinity College, I would tell students to let it all out and to make fools of themselves because university is the place to do so. If there are not rules for Cabinet to allow open, honest and abrasive discussion without it being leaked – where the emphasis would be put on the disagreement rather than the real subject – it makes Government more difficult. I understand the Minister's position on this. We now have access to the record of telephone calls between Mr. Lynch and Mr. Heath at the time of Bloody Sunday. If the content of those phone calls had been made available within five years, it would have had an inflammatory effect on the situation in Northern Ireland. We must be conscious of this aspect of the matter.The language the Minister used was, at times, vague. He said that specific protection for such records was recognised as being necessary by the high level group, but he does not mention any argument on the matter. Why was this recognised? He just makes a statement on it, which is dangerous. The Minister went on to say that "the Secretary General to the Government must certify that the committee concerned meets the relevant requirements". It is not independent, it is too close to the Government. Independence is required in this instance.Another case involved a request for access to the diaries of Ministers and civil servants. Thousands of pages of documentation were produced at a cost of over €10,000, yet the person who inquired objected to being asked to contribute to €600. There is a lack of proportion here.I am a member of the National Union of Journalists and am proud to have been accepted as such. However, there is a strong obligation on members of this honourable profession to treat the information they get seriously, to examine it properly and to ensure that it does not lead to a further series of misunderstandings. For example, reporters are intrigued with Members' allowances. They are apparently blithely unaware that those who are on the ball claim their allowances at a date when they cannot be used for electoral purposes. This means that when any given request for information is made, one Member may have claimed allowances totalling €20,000 because of travel undertaken on behalf of the country, while another may not have made a claim because he or she was too cute to draw an allowance immediately before the FOI request. No account is taken of this. In certain instances, journalists do not care about the context of the information they obtain as long as they secure a sensational headline. That is regrettable.I have a number of reservations about the Bill. The proposal to charge additional fees for applications and appeals is a stumbling block. The House debated similar charges in respect of planning appeals and applications and we on this side argued against them. I take the same view on this proposal.I also question the proposal to increase restrictions on individuals accessing their personal records and the granting of greater flexibility to public bodies in deciding to refuse applications if they consider them to be ridiculous or vexatious, even when there is no definition of these terms. I was contacted by a woman who, on two occasions, had resort to this kind of legislation. Her child became ill and did not get better. She made an application under the Act and obtained the material she sought. She discovered the child had a serious kidney ailment which was being inappropriately treated. She got the treatment changed. That is an important and significant use of the Act.In the second instance, a neighbour made malicious allegations that the woman in question had interfered with her son. This was a devastating accusation and she applied for all the information relating to it. She received some but not all of it and asked the health board to properly investigate the accusation. However, only two categories of finding were possible: first, that it could be confirmed; and, second, that it could not be confirmed. However, the woman wanted to be vindicated and to be told it was not true. She had the support of doctors and others in the case, but the health board would not respond in the manner requested. Eventually it stopped answering her communications. People have an absolute moral entitlement to this kind of information because it concerns them. Every citizen should have the opportunity to access it.The period for deciding on cases continues to lengthen, which is a cause of concern. Where third parties must be consulted before information is released, the consultation period is being extended from nine to 11 weeks. The length of time in which the Information Commissioner has to determine appeals is to increase from three to four months. It could thus take nine months to get a record or a decision on a record processed if it is subject to appeal.It is extraordinary that the review group, which consisted of the five Sir Humphreys, did not bother to consult the Information Commissioner. A briefing I have received from the NUJ indicates the same attitude. When the Cabinet decided to publish the Bill, the NUJ immediately requested a meeting with the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment or the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, but no reply was given. That is astonishing when one considers that 25% of requests for information under the Act are made by those involved in the profession of journalism. Openness, transparency, accountability and consultation do not appear to have existed in the run-up to the production of the Bill, which is worrying.The widening of the reasons for refusal to grant information is also a cause of concern. The provision that information would be refused if a request causes difficulties within a Department is to be narrowed to within a unit. The definitions also become increasingly vague.The composite manual is not to be published in printed form. This was a useful tool for journalists. Technophobes like me will not be able to avail of electronic publication. It might as well be in Chinese hieroglyphs.There will be increasing restrictions of access to Government records where heads of public bodies must now automatically refuse release of information prepared for Government. The Act provides some discretion in this area and a refusal was usually made for publicly stated reasons.Section 2 contains a number of good provisions. There is a clarification of the position of copies of records where it is taken that, for legal purposes, a photocopy has the same date of origin as the original. That is sensible. The position of factual information is also clarified, as are a number of other aspects.Section 3 stipulates that the heads of public bodies will be exempted from the provisions of section 4 of the principal Act, whereby they must cause notice of a delegation of authority on the making of decisions on freedom of information to be published in Iris Oifigiúil. As a result, the public will have no way of knowing who makes such decisions. That is a matter of concern because we should know who has responsibility in this area.Section 4 amends section 6 of the Act, which deals with the right of access to records. It proposes to substitute the word "contain" for the words "relate to". This further weakens the position of the individual or the professional journalist because they will be much more restricted in terms of their ability to access their personal files. They will only be allowed access files subject to 11 exemptions, as opposed to the nine provided for under the Act. Excluded from this will be records about them but which do not contain personal information as defined in the Act. This further weakens the position of the person requesting information. The new categories cover personal records, commercially sensitive information and confidential information. The difficulty is that it is not clear what is meant by these categories. It leads to a further possibility for obfuscation.The most serious cause of concern for a working journalist is section 7. Under the Act, a request can refused if the fee for the current request had not been paid. The Bill provides that if there is a backlog of non-payment of fees the, request may be refused. Concern has been expressed to me about this matter, which the Minister of State would be well advised to note. If, for example, a journalist from the Independent group, who writes for the Sunday Independent, applies for information under the Act, but finds that a colleague from another newspaper in the group, from the Evening Herald– to which I contribute the occasional morsel – had not paid a previous bill, he would not be able to obtain the information. That is wrong. Accounts should be individualised. Responsible, professional journalists should not be excluded from getting information because a colleague defaulted on the payment of a fee.My concerns are specific, but my approach is balanced. The current five year provision on Cabinet papers is impractical and I understand why it is being extended to ten years. I also understand the need for confidentiality because, ultimately, the Government must continue to work and must be permitted to do so. It must not be trammelled by mischievous interventions, which could happen. It is important that journalists behave responsibly in this.The Minister has made a good case for suggesting that some people have made vexatious use of the Act. The example he gave was of an individual who made 466 requests and was then responsible for 101 internal review applications and 35 appeals to the Office of the Information Commission. This is making a professional, full-time career out of requesting information, which seems to be a little bit unbalanced. Another person cost the taxpayer over £100,000.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	297	There is a lack of balance and the Government needs to convince legislators that there is a sense of proportion in the Bill. I deliberately emphasise that I have not shown myself to be totally antagonistic, but I understand the practical working reasons. From this position of sympathy with that of the Government, I ask that it examine closely and address the practical issues I have raised in terms of the Bill's impact.The Government has not done a particularly good job in respect of the method of introduction of the Bill. Its arrival in the House was precipitant. I am not impugning the personnel at all, but questions must be asked about the fact that five wise persons were charged with the responsibility of making recommendations and that there was no public consultation and that the very people represented by the National Union of Journalists, which is the largest block of requesters, were actually refused the opportunity to discuss this matter with the responsible Ministers. Most significantly, the Information Commissioner was not involved. These facts demonstrate an astonishing run-up to the production of the Bill. However, having said that, I understand the necessity, in terms of good governance, to control access to information.As a long-suffering Member of this House, I note that there is much nonsense in respect of ethics in public office, etc. I am blistered from filling out forms exposing my financial inadequacies to the people. I see no reason why they should be entitled to such information and I assure the House that anybody like me who lists a few ould shares on a form is the last person who will defraud anybody. Who is that little man with the glasses who used to be Government press secretary?

Nobody is so idiotic to write down, "I got £150,000 from Mr. Dunlop". It is a complete waste of time and a cosmetic exercise intended to fool people into the notion that there is absolute accountability and transparency. It is irritating nonsense. The sooner we get rid of the pretentiousness associated with standards and address real standards in public life, instead of tricking away at the borders and creating a cosmetic impression that we are all whiter than the driven snow, the better.I give a guarded welcome to the Bill. I appeal to the Minister, even at this stage, to have some discussion with professional bodies such as the National Union of Journalists. I am a member of that body and I also have some recommendations for it. In full knowledge of the presence in the House of its very distinguished secretary, I say that it is also incumbent upon journalists to make serious and responsible use of the information to which they have been entitled by an Act of the Oireachtas. Access to information is not just a right, but a privilege, particularly when it is access to the personal financial records, for example, of individuals, be they in public life or not. There is an absolute responsibility on the part of journalists to treat this matter with seriousness and decorum.

Unlike some debates on legislation in the House, the tone of this debate is often driven in advance by media articles. As Members, we have a primary responsibility to debate issues that come before us and to weigh them up, seek opinions and give our own, rather than echo the opinions of others.It is appropriate that the Bill is before the Seanad given that the Freedom of Information Act began its life here. I fully endorse the principle of freedom of information as an integral part of transparency in public and political life and in the administration of the affairs of the country. In saying that, one must balance effective governance with inability to provide effective government. The Minister has outlined in his speech how the Freedom of Information Act has been used to date. He listed the number of requests, the type of requests and how the Act has been extended continually to other public bodies.The proposed amendments are balanced and necessary in the interest of good and effective government. Listening to the Opposition parties, it is quite clear that they have forgotten what government is and how it works. That is understandable given their long absence from office.

In this era, planning, researching and implementing most Government projects takes longer than five years and it is vital for policy success that deliberations are confidential and effective. We must not allow circumstances to develop in which decision making is not recorded on paper to pre-empt the release of information. We should not advocate a course of action which would result in policy being made through whispered briefings in corridors. I want records.

Ten years of Cabinet confidentiality is acceptable and will permit Government to evaluate policy effectively for the good of citizens.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I agree with the Taoiseach who says 30 years is too long and five too short. The ten year period set out in the legislation is an acceptable one to wait for the release of papers referring to decisions made at Cabinet.The Bill sets out to ensure communication between Ministers on matters relating to Government business is protected. Ministers must be allowed to exchange information and the Government must operate under the principle of permitting free expression of views, even if those views are opposed to each other. To do otherwise would frustrate collective decision making among Departments which would not be in the public interest. The early disclosure of sensitive information cannot be allowed to hinder or impede decision making by an effective Government.Individuals and organisations have abused the law in this area with vexatious requests.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Only one organisation has done so.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I am glad there are no proposed changes on a request for personal records. The legislation does not in any way impede the rights of the individual who continues to have free access to information on him or her. Its spirit is to tighten up areas that need improvement in order to create better legislation and better government. This is what legislators are elected to do. There is no public service aspect to media trawling of government in an effort to look for a story which serves no purpose other than to deflect from the real issues of the day.I am satisfied that the Bill contains a number of amendments aimed at improving the operation of the Act. Questions are being asked about the deliberative process. The question of whether the process has ended is a difficult one. It serves no purpose for information on such deliberations to be released in advance of their conclusion. The introduction of a mechanism by which a Secretary General will have to certify the completion of the process is welcome. It will bring the process to a full and complete conclusion at which time all records will be released.The Freedom of Information Act has been effective in allowing ordinary citizens access to documents pertaining to them held by public bodies. None of the amendments that the Bill proposes will change this fact. As proposed, they are no more than practical and sensible in allowing Government to carry out its work effectively while allowing liberal but reasonable access to records on its deliberations.I hope the Opposition parties will bring forward some credible and original arguments in the debate.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	370	It is nothing short of an abuse of power by the Government. It is an abuse of power because it attempts to roll back on a right given to the people by an elected Government and does so without a mandate. Where in An Agreed Programme for Government was there a proposal to roll back on the Freedom of Information Act? The answer is nowhere. Out it comes at a few short days' notice supposedly on a recommendation from senior civil servants in order to roll back on a very important right and a basic modernisation of our democracy achieved in 1997.Thanks to the poodles, the Progressive Democrats, the Government is using a majority in this and in the other House to roll back radical legislation which made a fundamental change in the relationship between public service, Government and the public which the Government does not like one little bit. Why does it not like it? The answer is that the public gets a look-in. What else does the Government not like? It does not like accountability one little bit. It wants to be able to make decisions in secret, behind closed doors. It does not want anybody to know what led to various decisions or how much is being spent on Government decisions. It does not want political embarrassment, just spin. It wants to be able to control its message because it thinks we are stupid. It thinks the people are stupid but in its arrogance it will learn a lesson.

It was my great privilege to work with the then Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, in formulating the principal legislation. I saw the work involved and saw at close quarters its objective and aim. This objective is now being rolled back fundamentally and blatantly in such an abusive fashion by this effectively dictatorial Government.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	376	The aim was to give a right, not a "maybe" or "we will decide", to the individual to access information on him or her held by public bodies. It gave a right of access within very clearly defined and unproblematic limits to information relevant to decisions made by public bodies. The Minister made a big deal about how it had been rolled out to so many bodies. I note he is not present to hear this speech. He has very little interest in this Bill. The application to hundreds of public bodies was established in the original Act. The Government should not now pretend that it was a favour rolled out by a liberal Government; it only did it because it had to.The 1997 Act created a public interest over-ride in order to guard against wrongdoing by public bodies and Government. That is the reason the Government does not like the legislation and Fianna Fáil, in particular, does not like it. It now seems that the Progressive Democrats do not like it either. They do not want anybody, be it the media, the public or the Opposition, to question their decisions.The Act introduced the important principle of openness into the operation of the decision-making process in both Government and public bodies. It created an independent Office of the Information Commissioner to ensure individuals and members of the public who needed right of access to information would be guaranteed it. Unfortunately, as the system on its own could not be trusted to implement the spirit of the legislation, an important independent office was created. It created a fundamental change in the balance of power in our political framework which the Government now wants to roll back. It wants to roll back the public's right to know and on a right of access to information on how decisions are made. It wants to roll back on the possibility of political embarrassment. It wants to create a level of control and spin which is arrogant in the extreme.The Government and the Minister have made great play out of the so-called "need" for this legislation. The Information Commissioner made a speech to which the Minister for Finance referred in his short contribution to the House. It was made at the freedom of information annual conference in Dublin Castle, held on 10 October 2002, when the Information Commissioner spoke about the radical nature of the legislation and how the public service was forced to adapt to a whole new environment. He stressed that freedom of information has fundamentally and radically altered the nature of the relationship between the public service and the public. In a broader sense, by making Government more transparent and accountable, FOI has significantly affected the environment in which the Government operates. That is what this dictatorial Government wants to roll back.The commissioner spoke about the public interest in accountability and radical legislation. He stated: "It recognises that the rights and legitimate interests of individuals, of corporate bodies and of the public sector itself are separate from, and subservient to, the public interest." In that context I want to refer to Senator Norris's annoyance at ethics legislation and our requirements to declare this, that and the other. I remind Senator Norris, and others who find this legislation such an encumbrance, that we are public servants and are here at the behest of the public. We are not here to serve ourselves but to serve the public. In that context, it is crucial that we account for every action we take even if it is an encumbrance to do so.I want to refer to a specific remark made by the Information Commissioner towards the end of his speech. His concluding comment is extremely relevant to the debate tonight and the so-called argument that the legislation needs to be changed. He states:I am aware of some tensions in relation to some provisions of the FOI Act which may be seen as unduly interfering in the process of government. However, open government and greater accountability by definition involve greater scrutiny of decision making; while this may from time to time result in embarrassment for public servants or politicians, the common good of safeguarding against wrongdoing, at whatever level, must take precedence.In any event, I am fully satisfied that the provisions of the FOI Act as they stand are more than sufficient to protect all of the essential interests of government. Nothing in the operation of FOI over the past four years – bar the odd accident – suggests otherwise.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	377	There you have it.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	378	This has come from a public servant charged with the responsibility of ensuring the Freedom of Information Act is implemented. It has not come from senior civil servants, the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance or a dictatorial Government abusing its power. It has come from the Information Commissioner. While we on this side of the House might listen, the Government is not prepared to listen.I would like to refer to the issue of senior civil servants who got a lot of abuse in recent days. It was my great privilege to work with senior civil servants when the Act was being drafted. In my opinion 99% of civil servants act in the public interest, and when they are asked to do something, they do so to the best of their ability and do it honestly. I consider that the review of the Act was an honest and excellent document. However, civil servants were not asked to frame the legislation, politicians and the Government framed it. This report went from the high level group to the Cabinet. Who decided to change the freedom of information legislation? Senior civil servants did not, the Government did. Following the Minister for Finance's performance in the House this evening, I would like to know who is driving this change. He did not seem to be in the least bit interested in the legislation. His speech was just floating across the horizon of this legislation. He did not go into its detail. He did not set out any great principles or philosophy behind it. He just gave us an example of one mad requester who has cost the Exchequer €100,000, which seems nothing compared to what will be spent on the Government jet. Just one frivolous requester was referred to the Information Commissioner, even though the legislation allows for frivolity and vexatious requesters to be referred to the Information Commissioner. Why was there just one? The example is so daft that one can clearly see it is vexatious. Where are all the other vexatious requests? If they were so vexatious, why were they not referred to the Information Commissioner? I would like to hear the Minister's response.I regard the high level report as cover for the Taoiseach. The Government will say that the experts said it would have to change the legislation and its members are just little poodles who will do what they are told. I do not accept that argument. I want to know who is driving this fundamental change in very important legislation passed in 1997, which has become one of the foundation stones of a modern democracy, and which the Government is trying to undermine and remove. We are entitled to know who that is but we will never know under this framework. The changes contained in the Bill are a complete rolling back on the framework set up in the original legislation.For instance, the widening of the definition of "Cabinet papers" is to include sub-committees with officials, inter-ministerial correspondence and material compiled principally and not just solely for Cabinet. Let us look at that. In the 1997 legislation, those who drafted the legislation went to a lot of trouble to ensure that the definition of "Cabinet papers" would be so framed as to ensure it would not be abused for the purposes of creating exemptions, and it succeeded. I want an example of any Cabinet decision which was allegedly interfered with, undermined or harmed by the Freedom of Information Act. I know of none.The reason is that the framework in the 1997 legislation creates a seal around decision-making. At the time Members of both Houses, including members of the Government and the Minister, accepted there was a need to protect Cabinet confidentiality and the framework is in the 1997 legislation. What is also included, however, is the right of the public to know what information was used in making a decision. That is essential underpinning of freedom of information. Otherwise, Cabinets just make decisions because they feel like it, as in this legislation. That is not democratic. It is dictatorial and an abuse of power, which is exactly what we are witnessing this evening. Cabinet papers will now include sub-committees with officials. Who are officials? It could be anyone the Government decides, including an expert, or someone in off the street, who would be covered by the exemption.In regard to inter-ministerial correspondence, let us think about the correspondence between the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance. Let us think about correspondence in relation to Government decisions or the recent deal with the churches on institutional abuse. Such correspondence would be an embarrassment, which is why the Government does not want people to see it. What harm is it for the public to know what is going on behind the scenes? It does no harm but the Government just does not like it.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	387	The Bill appears to be going further than the Minister of State would like it to go. I suggest that the Minister of State should accept the amendment on that particular section when we put it down.The Bill refers to material compiled principally and not solely for Cabinet. This was specifically put into the original Bill to ensure that material going to Cabinet was covered by a narrow rather than a broad exemption. The narrow exemption has now become a broad exemption. All material compiled principally for Cabinet now becomes exempt from the operation of the legislation.I want to touch on the matter of the appeals process and costs. This is one of the most insidious elements of this legislation. A broad blanket of €20 is being applied. The Minister for Finance seemed to suggest earlier that it could even be higher because he has not decided what will be the cost of an application or an appeal. I understand that, under the current operation of the legislation, there is a certain discretion being used within Departments. I agree with this because some people can afford to make information requests while others cannot.I would have no difficulty with large media outlets such as the Sunday Independent paying the full whack for information but I have difficulty when a small group such as a group in north Tipperary which is currently trying to get information from a health board is asked to pay €20 for every application. It has ten applications in train currently so it would be asked for €200. It does not have that money and would have to ask whether it should make requests on behalf of the community. This blanket charge is wrong and is contrary to the spirit of the legislation. I appeal to the Minister to reconsider it. I hope this charge is not indicative of the intention of the Minister or the Government to prevent applications for information or appeals against decisions.An appeal against a decision is a fundamental part of the fairness of the operation of this legislation. Under the legislation the public servant makes an initial decision. An appeal structure and mechanism is essential to fairness. It is in-built in much of our legislation and is a fairly well established principle of natural law. It is a principle of any fair society that people have a right of appeal. I urge the Minister to remove the charge for an appeal. It is wrong.It is interesting that the briefing behind parliamentary questions is to be exempt.

This proposal clearly came from the political side. Who was behind it? What is the problem in giving access to information that goes into parliamentary questions? Let us remind the House of the remarks made by Mr. Justice Hamilton in regard to the beef tribunal. He said if parliamentary questions had been properly answered in the first instance, we would not have to spend €35 million on the tribunal.

#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I thank Senator Brian Hayes for his supportive remarks. Who was behind this proposal? Of course, we will never know because the proposal will close off the area. It was clearly designed to keep us in the dark and to throw a blanket of secrecy around the way decisions are made.I am familiar with the 1997 legislation having worked closely with the Minister of the time. The matter of certificates is a critical one which relates to the Cabinet making a decision and the so-called deliberative process that goes with that. Much discussion and soul searching went into the matter of the issue of certificates at the time. This is critical also in regard to the legislation's application to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The issue of a certificate, in the original 1997 legislation, was considered to be a rare but important event. The legislation recognised that there were times when things needed to be kept secret but it limited certificates to sensitive and security issues. It also had built-in safeguards, for example, in regard to the publication of certificates so that the public could see how many certificates were issued, by what Department, who okayed them and their general subject matter. We could see therefore that there was no abuse of their use.This legislation basically means that certificates can be thrown around like confetti at a wedding. The certificate will become the blanket of secrecy which this Bill intends to wrap around the deliberations of Government. Routine policy information can now be put beyond the appeals process by the use of these certificates in the framework contained in the new Bill. This is probably the most far-reaching restriction on information in the Bill. We intend to put down many amendments on Committee Stage. The legislation will allow a Government that is hostile to the release of information, as this Government clearly is, to use certificates to label information as relating to unresolved policy issues. The only route of appeal will be the High Court. Who has funds for that?I would like clarification in regard to the use by individuals of the Freedom of Information Act. The impression has been created that the amendments contained in this Bill will have no effect on the right of the individual to access records from public bodies. My information is that there is a critical change of wording in the relevant section of the original Bill which would mean that individuals "will only be allowed access to personal records which contain personal information on them" and will no longer be able to access records "relating" to them. This sounds like an exercise in semantics but words are important.People will now be only able to get records containing personal information about them rather than records relating to them. This is an important new provision. I am being nice about it in asking the Minister to clarify the situation and tell me if I am reading it correctly. Is it the case that this can be used to tell individuals that they no longer have access to certain records? This could be a dangerous provision and we will seek to amend it.I referred already to vexatious requests. The example used by the Minister earlier was frivolous. It was certainly vexatious in terms of my response to it. The Minister referred to one individual and an appeal which went to the Information Commissioner. I would like the opposite side of the House to stop talking about that. If there were so many vexatious requests why were they not referred to the commissioner?I take issue with the Minister's point in regard to users' groups. He referred to the Civil Service users' network in 1999, and the FOI central policy unit within his Department which chairs an interdepartmental working group and a public service users' network with representatives from all sectors of the civil and public service which is covered by the legislation. He spoke of a consultative group and stated how it has kept the area under continual review and has fed into the process which led to the production of the Bill as it appears before us, as if to suggest that users are asking that the Bill be amended in this way. That users' group has not sat for years. It has not been consulted for years so its work at this stage is effectively irrelevant. Its establishment was made irrelevant by lack of use. There has been a lack of consultation on this Bill.We listened to the Leader of the House stating how we all wish to rush legislation through the House, which is not true. The original Act took many months to make its way through both Houses of the Oireachtas. The Minister of the day wanted to hear the views of the Members of both Houses. The Government took its time to ensure that everybody knew what was in the Bill, because it was so significant; that everybody understood its operation; and that everybody's views were heard and, to some extent, taken on board when possible. That is not happening here. That is clearly not the intention of the Government. This is a railroading of disgraceful proportions.There has been a fair bit of swiping at the media. I should have declared earlier that I am a proud member of the NUJ and a former journalist to boot. It is fine by me if the media chooses to splash our expenses all over the papers. I might be the only Oireachtas Member to say so.

Having spent so much time here this evening I was struck by the comprehensive nature and the fundamentally sound arguments of a number of the speakers.Senator Ross stated that it is natural for Governments to devise ways around things. In his capacity as a working journalist, he believes that the Government did not like the way in which the Freedom of Information Act has operated. He feels that it embarrassed the Government and that its response was typical in such a situation – it called in the mandarins. He views the mandarins as a secret organisation and sees it as the culture of all civil servants to bring the lid down on things.He also made an interesting point in regard to Cabinet leaks. History is littered with numerous examples of Cabinet leaks. Senator Mooney is sitting in the seat usually occupied by the Leader of the House on the Order of Business.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Is the Senator saying that the seat is contaminated?

The Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, has often spoken of leaks from Cabinet and she was in a position to know.Senator Ross made the suggestion that there be a permanent microphone and camera in Cabinet meetings but I do not think many Senators on this side of the House would go that far. I am reminded of what a former leader of my party, Deputy John Bruton, said on one occasion, that Government should operate as though it were behind a pane of glass.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	420	We well remember it. God be with the days.

#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Although some of the Senators present may have been around then, I was not. I am not saying we should go down that road either.I agree with Senator Ross's assertion that Governments should not be ashamed of their views. He also made a statement that would be very disturbing if it is true. He suggested that top civil servants and judges do not have to declare their interests in the same way as Members of the Oireachtas. I cannot understand the differing levels of accountability, if that is the case. It is strange, if not incongruous, that people in the public service are to be treated so differently.I very much enjoyed the contribution of Senator Norris, another part-time journalist who writes for the Evening Herald. He made the point that most journalists treat information seriously and responsibly, although he agreed that a few did get carried away on the question of expenses. He suggested that it might take up to nine months to get at some records. He also referred to the widening of the reasons for refusal which he viewed as becoming more vague. If that is true, it is most disturbing and I share the concerns he expressed. He also spoke of the precipitant arrival of the Bill before us. As was outlined earlier on the Order of Business, it was only published on Friday and most of us did not see it until yesterday. We hardly had an opportunity to read it. However, it is here now and we have to deal with it.I enjoyed the contribution of Senator Minihan, who was inclined to assert that no one had abused the legislation. Senator O'Meara rightly pointed out one person had. We all accept there was one. That indicates the excellent record to date regarding the legislation and the way it has been treated by requesters.Senator O'Meara's contribution was excellent. I did not realise that she had been a working journalist which explains the reason she was able to deal with the matter so excellently. She made many fine arguments and dealt particularly well with the questions of the charge for appeals and parliamentary questions. She reminded us of the views expressed by the late Chief Justice Hamilton whose work was not finely regarded in his conclusions on the beef tribunal. He remarked that if only parliamentary questions had been answered fully, the tribunal might not have been necessary. We all know what is said about those who advise Ministers. As I speak I am reminded to welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey. The poor man is having to spend a great deal of time here.

Those who advise him and his colleagues tend to be economical with the truth. This seems to be a natural trait of civil servants.Earlier today in passing between offices I heard some of what Senator Mansergh said. I was struck by his reference to the time when he was advising the former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds. According to the Senator the Taoiseach declared that he wanted to let in the light. Was the Senator acting as St. John the Baptist for this Bill?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	425	It is not fair to refer to the Senator when he is not present.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Senator Mansergh is a fine Senator and I am sure he made a fine contribution. He also pointed out – he would know because he comes from the other side of the tracks, although he is now here as a parliamentarian – how secretive and authoritarian the Civil Service has been.There has been a fundamental lack of consultation with regard to the Bill. There was no communication with the Information Commissioner who required information. That was a denial of basic courtesy, if not absolute contempt. Neither was there consultation with journalists who, by and large, have used the Act responsibly and in the public interest. Commercial organisations were not consulted despite their daily dealings with, for example, the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.Does the Government not realise that this repeal measure will only fuel cynicism about politics and politicians? This is a sad day for democracy. The Government may not like the effects of the Freedom of Information Act but this measure is wholly inappropriate. It was preceded by a review group of five top civil servants. The three wise men did a good job for the Minister for Finance but the five Sir Humphreys did not. I was corrected earlier and told there were four Sir Humphreys.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	427	And one baroness.

Such a group would not be known for its commitment to openess. They only met in secret. The commissioner and everyone who used the legislation were ignored. The Government is rolling back on progress. It was a Government of Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party which initiated the measure and it is hard to understand the present rolling back. The proposed curbs on the materials of working groups and discovery notes to Ministers will mean that, in future, the public will have no means of knowing when the Cabinet acted against official advice – more is the pity. The right of access to official information should not be regarded as a privilege afforded by Government but a fundamental right in our modern democracy which is funded by the taxpayer.The charge will be that the Government is doing everything to avoid, at any cost, embarrassing revelations of the truth about its activities. Every objective commentator regards this measure as heralding a bad day for democracy. The Taoiseach introduced the Freedom of Information Act as a catalyst for lasting change in the history of the public service. At the time openness, transparency and accountability had become the new gods but this measure is a total about turn. It is a stumble, if not a large step back, in the other direction. We are limiting sight and vision. The blinds and shutters are coming back into vogue.A secretive review of the Act must be something of a joke, if not a downright mockery. The Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy, in reviewing the Act last year, feared that some elements of officialdom were showing signs of fatigue towards the legislation. We now know that fatigue permeates the higher echelons of the State service and that the Cabinit has become affected. The publication of Cabinet papers is to be delayed for ten years. The restriction on papers dealing with security on Northern Ireland was already in place and did not need to be included in the Bill.The Minister for Finance is an interesting case in point. He has frequently disregarded official advice which is refreshing. The former Taoiseach, Mr. Albert Reynolds, did the same in his day. It might not have been as refreshing in his case. They were both perfectly entitled to do so, although I find myself more in accord with the Minister for Finance than with others. In future we will not be able to know if a Minister disagreed with advice. Whatever about Cabinet papers, letters between Ministers about Cabinet issues should not be covered by the Act. They are not Cabinet decisions and should not be brought within the scope of the Bill, as is happening. Reports from Cabinet sub-committees and officials will also remain private. I do not see the reason that should be so.One of the Government's problems appears to be that the Information Commissioner's recommendations are binding, while in his role as Ombudsman his recommendations are not binding. I wish to quote from interview with Mr. Kevin Murphy on his role as Information Commissioner – some Members may have already read it, but others may not – in an eminent journal, Public Affairs Ireland.

I am always subject to the Chair's guidance.The following is a series of questions from the interviewer to the Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy:Q. Do you think that the Freedom of Information Act 1997 has achieved its purpose in ensuring greater transparency and accountability in policy formation and decision-making?A. I think the Act has made a significant contribution to achieving greater transparency and accountability in policy formation and decision-making but that it is too early yet to make a final judgment.One interesting development concerns the fact that papers relating to Government meetings may become open to an FOI request after five years. Since the Act is not yet five years old, that provision has been of no effect yet. [We now know it will not be allowed to have an effect.]This position will change from April next year when the Act will have been in operation for five years. In other words, from then on, on a rolling basis, papers relating to Government meetings will be open to an FOI request on the fifth anniversary of the meetings concerned.Q. How many appeals do you handle in a year, and what proportion would result in material previously withheld being released?A. We handle of the order of 400 valid cases per year. Given that many public bodies have internal reviews and appeal mechanisms, I tend to get cases only after a public body feels it has good grounds for refusal. On average, I overturn the public body's decision in about 25% of cases appealed to me.Q. Do you think that the FOI Act has led to a reduction in the amount of material that is committed to paper by public servants?A. In my special report on compliance in 2001, I found no evidence that less detailed information was being recorded or that certain information was being deliberately omitted. However, there was some anecdotal evidence to this effect.The National Archives Advisory Council recently expressed concern that the Minister for Finance has not made regulations for the management and maintenance of records held by public bodies.I share this concern and on a number of occasions I have publicly referred to the need for proper records to be kept if a proper audit trail is to exist in relation to the actions of public bodies.

Are there any abuses of the Act?A. I am aware of some cases of frivolous or vexatious requests for information, but these may be dealt with at the public body level.I am not aware of any case of non-compliance by public bodies although there have been appeals against some of my decisions on a point of law to the High Court. If a public body simply refused to release records after I have decided that release was justified they would be failing in their duty to respect the statutory rights of access, provided for in the FOI Act.As such they would be open to a complaint to the Ombudsman for misadministration. There is also provision in the FOI Act for the Commissioner to carry out investigations into complaints and submit a special report.I am coming to the final question in the interview.

What is the outlook for the Office of Information Commissioner?A. By and large the Office is working well. It has already become a familiar part of the administrative landscape in Ireland and has earned the respect of public bodies and requesters alike. With over 350 public bodies now subject to the Act, the need for an effective office is likely to grow for some time to come.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I have some declarations of interest to make before I begin. I am a member of the board of Independent Newspapers and I write for one of its organs. Some of my friends in the field of journalism might not like all of what I am about to say. I am also a former civil servant and some of my former colleagues in that profession may not like what I have to say either.It is a pity that this subject has become so dramatised. It is an important issue but it is not helped by hyperbole on either side. The world will not fall apart if this Bill is passed. On the other hand, it might be a better one if it was not passed. There are two important safeguards to democracy, one of which is freedom of information and the other is strong Government. It is a question of finding a balance between the two. People have a right to information, but it is not an absolute and unqualified right. Equally, a Government is entitled to a degree of reticence when it is reaching conclusions but, in a sense, that cannot be absolute either. It is a pity that this legislation was not developed at a slower pace. It is a subject which, to coin a phrase, would benefit from mature reflection.I have no doubt that the high level group is excellent, but it took a rather narrow look at a broad and complex subject. I do not know who are the members of that high level group, but I am sure some of them are good friends of mine and I do not intend to denigrate their efforts by any means. It is a pity the Information Commissioner was not more involved in the discussions in order that his experience could be drawn upon. It would not have been a bad idea to have a senior retired journalist contribute as well.I do not wish to impugn the reputations of the members of the high level group. However, when five people are drawn from more or less the same background and the same stable, they tend to look at life through the same set of lenses. It is sad that a slightly broader view was not taken. I have been in similar situations and I know well how one reacts to the circumstances with which one is presented. In that particular culture, there is a tendency to turn inward rather than look outward.The implication from the format of the Bill is of a slight withdrawal from freedom of information. It may not have been intended, but the cumulative effect of the different proposals is rather to change the burden of proof and, for example, require people to prove that something is not against the national interest rather than the other way around.Cabinets are entitled to do their business in private. I have no difficulty in supporting a proposition that Cabinet documents, narrowly drawn, would be kept secret for more than five years. A period of ten years is, perhaps, too long, but it should be something of that order. There is a real inhibition on people saying what they wish to say if they know it is going to be disclosed. I am one of those people who has an uneasy night's sleep on 31 December each year when I wonder what files will appear on 1 January containing things I wrote 30 years ago.I would find it much easier to sustain the argument for complete Cabinet confidentiality if I were sure Ministers were not at times leaking information and were not using the press to embarrass other Ministers. I am sure the Minister does not know what I am talking about. I am speaking about another jurisdiction of which I had experience. Far be it for me to draw any analogies, but Members will be aware that Ministers were trying to push their own line and secure a public constituency for what they were after. The interaction between Ministers should be robust and they should fight their corner and so on. It would be a pity if they were inhibited from doing so by having to do so in the full glare of the limelight so I support the closure of Cabinet records.What I find difficult in the Bill as proposed is the width of the definition given to Cabinet papers. I hope it will be possible on Committee Stage to think of ways in which it might be delineated more clearly and perhaps a good deal more restrictively.Another issue with which I have some difficulty and with which the public might as well is the extent to which the question of whether something is in the public interest or whether it should be released resides with the Secretary General. Having been in that position, I know the difficulties that raises for the individual. If, for instance, it was a Minister, he or she could be questioned in the House and asked to justify his or her position but, by definition, a civil servant cannot be. That is why there is a need for a referee, the Information Commissioner or some such person, to adjudicate on whether the national interest would be imperilled by the release of information. There are times, of course, when it would. Having worked in Northern Ireland, I also know that there are times when the disclosure of personal information could be extremely dangerous to people. There must be a means of dealing with that. Ordinary, reasonable people would accept that. What they find harder to accept is the blanket nature of the exceptions and the fact there is no court of appeal or no referee outside the system. After all, if one pleads national interest in court, the court will at least want to know prima facie on what one is basing it.I find it hard to understand why we are doing so much in this Bill. I am not sure the case has been made for an enormous problem which needed to be dealt with in this way. The phrase "a sledgehammer to smash a nut" runs through one's mind when looking at the Bill. The important thing for the Minister and for us is that the Government can do its work unimpeded when necessary. That is a very narrow field which can be narrowly defined. It is also possible to define the conditions in which people could be declared to be vexatious. It is unfair to expose Departments to fishing expeditions. However, where information is available and should be in the public domain, it is perfectly legitimate to make proper arrangements for that. I have no doubt that could be done.There is a danger of this Bill having been perhaps over-influenced by Civil Service caution. There may be a case of these people putting a saddle on Ministers and inviting them to ride at Beechers Brook. Much political dust and noise has been raised as a result of this which need not have been. I support the protection of the confidentiality of Cabinet discussions but it is possible to define them a good deal more narrowly than they are in the Bill. There are many good things which should be in the public domain such as background and research papers and so on. If the position of the Information Commissioner was more clearly recognised on the face of the Bill and if provision was made for the rapid and effective resolution of disputed questions when they arise, it would be a better Bill.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I remember being taken through the objectives of the legislation in 1997. I was unaware of it before then. Following that, I became an enthusiast for freedom of information and I was impressed by a Norwegian legislator whom I questioned before that legislation went through. Like me, he had been unaware of the implications. It was interesting to hear Senator Maurice Hayes talk about Civil Service caution. They went through that same thinking and became enthusiasts as well. I was impressed by Senator Coghlan who, I think, quoted the Taoiseach in 1997 who spoke about this being a catalyst of lasting change.I am speaking from the basis of an enthusiasm for something of which I had been unaware and which I did not fully understand before 1997. With all that due consideration, I would say today is one of the saddest days of my experience as a Senator. Colleagues will know me as a perennial optimist. Over the past ten years, I have generally found it possible to welcome most of the Bills which have come before us for scrutiny. I was able to do so because, for the most part, those Bills represented a step forward – a step which was sometimes hesitant but, nonetheless, a step into a new Ireland and a changing world.Today, we have been presented with what I would describe as a step backwards into the age of darkness because that is whole thrust of this Bill. This legislation harks back to an era when Government by stealth was the order of the day and when knowledge was considered to be power not to be shared with anybody outside the ruling clique of the time. This Bill seeks to drag us back to an Ireland from which I believed we had decisively moved away once and for all in 1997.To say this is not to oppose the idea of reviewing the impact of legislation. In fact, I have consistently advocated that. Senator Maurice Hayes and others spoke about Cabinet confidentiality being extended from five years to ten years. There is sense in some of these proposals. I am not arguing that there is not a case to be made for some of the changes set out in the Bill but the argument made for others is less than compelling.I refer to the overall thrust of this Bill and the manner in which it was introduced, about which others have spoken. There was no consultation with the various interests involved. As regards the manner in which the Bill is being processed in the Oireachtas, it was introduced virtually before the ink was dry. It was published on Friday but many of us did not receive it until yesterday. Some of us did not get it until today.There is what appears to be a fairly rigid timetable for getting it through both Houses. Taking all those things together, it is impossible to see how we can regard this measure as anything other than an attempt to roll back history by those who would thwart the right of people to know how we are governed and substitute for that right a closed system dominated by a largely unaccountable elite. That is the way we lived in the past.I do not for one moment doubt that the present freedom of information legislation has shortcomings which should be addressed. I am a great believer in looking back at legislation and readdressing it. However, that should take place after careful consideration and consultation. It is one thing to fine-tune a critical part of our democratic heritage, it is another to seek to undermine its very effectiveness and make it a dead letter. The forces behind this change are no friends of democracy or the people. They are not believers in open government. They are, I suggest, its enemy. They have been biding their time since the Act was passed in 1997, waiting for the moment to strike. I ask whether the Government really knows what it is doing in acquiescing in this rush to spancel our freedom and the freedom of information regime we established only five or six years ago.Does the Government not appreciate the enormous sea change that the passage of the original legislation only six years ago represented? Does it not realise the nature of the message it is now sending out to the people of Ireland by seeking to tamper with this regime in what I would call a hasty, ill-considered and self-serving way? When the Bill was passed in 1997, we all hoped it was merely a first step on the road to openness and transparency in government. We pointed to the example of the Scandinavian countries where every document of Government was automatically considered to be public property and available to everybody almost immediately. We reminded ourselves that they seemed to be able to do their business very well on that basis. We pointed to the benefits of such an approach in bringing people closer to the whole political process.We have had difficulty in persuading sufficient numbers to vote in recent times. The polls have been lower. One of our objectives should be to bring citizens into the political process. We have not been very successful in doing so. The Freedom of Information Act was the first step in that direction. We pointed not just to the experience of the Scandinavian countries but also to the experience of the United States which had a tradition of open government. We pointed to the experience of a growing number of other countries around the world which had adopted a similar approach. We were not leading the field in this. Others had done so. While we were reasonably well advanced when we came in in 1997, we were not leading the way. However, we were in no doubt six years ago that the road of openness was to be the highway of the future.In 1997 we were hopeful, above all, that the next steps we took in legislating in this area would be in the opposite direction to the one we are taking today, that we would extend the scope of the original Act by building on our initial experience and strike out further along the path to full openness, accountability and transparency. Instead we have this dreadful and shaming little Bill that is being hastily brought before us. This is legislation prepared by people who hate the very idea of freedom of information and who will do everything in their power to frustrate its concept in action. Theirs is the way of secrecy, a belief grounded in the approach that as much knowledge as possible should be kept from the citizens of this republic. They believe in putting barriers in the public's way rather than in assisting them to obtain the information that should be theirs by right.What is so saddening is that this philosophy, this world view, if I can call it that, is decisively a thing of the past. Right around the world, movement is in the other direction. To head backwards as the Bill threatens to do will have very real and practical consequences in terms of our national and political well-being. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon. I know his heart will be influenced by what we say here. Although this debate will go on for long, I am sure it will be well worthwhile because the Minister of State is a man I know will keep an open mind. I hope, if he is here to handle the Bill on Committee Stage – I gather he will not be in Cheltenham as the Minister may be – that he will take what we say into account.For the past decade or more it has become commonplace to bemoan the way ordinary people are losing interest in politics, that we have not had the sort of polls we used to have in the past, and the growing irrelevancy of Parliament to the vast majority of our citizens. While we are quick to bemoan these things, we are much slower to do anything concrete to improve the situation. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 was one step. I have always held the view that the closer people can be brought to the political process and the more they are involved in the running of the country, the healthier will be the political atmosphere created. That should be and was our objective. We were taking steps in the right direction. That is the reason I have always attached the greatest importance to the principle of openness and accountability in carrying out our responsibilities in these Houses, welcomed the original legislation with such open arms and mourn the direction we have this week decided to take.I said this is the saddest day of my time here as a Senator. I do not think that was an overstatement. This is a day the House will live to regret. By passing this Bill – I hope we do not pass it as it stands – we are turning our back on the future and taking a decisive step into the past. While I do not welcome the Bill, we could make of it something that is not as backward a step as it seems at first glance. I hope the Minister will listen to what is being said and that a sufficient number of amendments will be accepted to change the whole tenor of the Bill. The Government should change its mind. It would do far better to take the Bill back, think it over and come up with a new Bill.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I thank Senator Quinn for sharing his time.I do not know what possessed the Government to introduce this legislation. Was it because the Minister for Health and Children and the Minister for Finance were fighting about money? I would think they had gone mad if they were not. It would be better if we knew the Minister for Health and Children was putting up a strong fight to get money for his Department and that the Minister for Finance was saying he had to explain where the money was being spent. Nothing is worse than rumour and nothing could be better than knowing the facts. The aim of the Bill appears to be to try to hide what is going on in government exactly as it should be. I cannot understand the reason we must have this really heavy-handed legislation to deal with this.What worries me most about the Bill is how it will affect individuals. There will be a huge increase in the restrictions on individuals accessing their personal records. Individuals – this includes staff of public bodies – will, under the legislation, be allowed to have access only to records containing personal information on them. This is defined in the Bill as meaning information known only to family and close friends. However, individuals will no longer have access to legislation relating to them. This is very serious because misleading information is occasionally given out about people. If a serious accusation is made such as, perhaps, that a person is engaged in a paeodophile ring, how will that person gain access to such information relating to him or her? Families or close friends are hardly likely to know that. How can people remove wrong information from their records?It is extraordinary that this Bill is going through at the same time that a Member of this House and a Member of the Dáil are disputing the claim that their records are required by the Morris tribunal. The tribunal claims it needs the information to make a judgment as to what is before it. That is totally contradictory and I cannot understand why the Government has brought forward this measure at this time, apart from the fact that Government records from five years ago would be known in a few weeks' time. What of that? They will come out month by month only. It is surely possible to take this Bill more slowly.Individuals will not be in a position to be told about any confidential information held about them by a public body. This may be dangerous for them if the information is malicious or false in any way. I realise that there has only been one vexatious request in the past five years but that shows that the protection is already there. Why are we putting in additional sections?It is also of concern that more time will be taken to deal with complex cases. Those who have used the Act know how difficult it is to get information from Departments. However, the consultation period will be extended from nine to 11 weeks and the length of time which the Information Commissioner has to determine appeals will be increased from three to four months. This is a long time for an individual to have to wait for a decision, and may be harrowing for them. These matters are important for people's personal lives as well as for their careers.I am concerned at the exemption of more public policy information from third party scrutiny. Public bodies may not even confirm or deny whether certain classes of information or records exist, such as those given in confidence, those which are commercially sensitive or personal records. This is very difficult for the public to deal with. I have had representations from voluntary bodies asking how they are to scrutinise areas of public policy which may be important to them, and I sympathise with them.It is also a concern that the records of one public body might be refused if those records could affect the work or deliberations of a separate public body. This is unlimited and could mean that a hospital would refuse records because they would affect a health board or vice versa. These are huge issues and I am not sure that the Government has considered carefully enough how this will impact on voluntary bodies trying to find out what public policy is, which is their entitlement.The Bill gives new powers to the Secretary General of a Department to issue certificates to the effect that an item is under the deliberative process. I am not sure what that means but, given the situation with the Luas, the metro and so on, the deliberative process could go on for ever as there is no time limit on it.A new clause is proposed banning release of information if it could endanger the safety of a person. That is a very wide definition. Does it include e-mails from bin Laden? What does it mean? It is a very serious measure. Both of these clauses are open to abuse and are not subject to public interest tests or third party scrutiny.I cannot understand why certain matters are included in the legislation. One area of great public interest and on which an absolute ban is imposed is the costing of the plans of political parties. This was one of the most important issues in the last election. It is now said that the costing plans of the Government parties – certainly Fianna Fáil – were unrealistic. This is an issue that the public should be able to consider in order to judge how they will vote.Briefing notes and supplementary information for parliamentary business, and records relating to the business of tribunals or ministerially ordered investigations, also attract a total ban. This kind of record has frequently been used in recent years to broaden public understanding of issues and has generally been prepared at the taxpayers' expense. It is not clear why these records cannot be released.

Senator Quinn spoke about trust in the public service and the Government. He and I do business together and we trust each other 100%. I do not understand why there cannot be such trust in public officials or in Government. People trust each other to do business.Lack of information cannot be blamed for the fall in the number of people voting. It is a different matter and I am not persuaded by Senator Quinn's argument in that regard. Senator Ross went far in his contribution. I felt I was listening to a debate in Cambridge or Oxford and that the Senator was taking the position he did just to be controversial.

This country is in safe hands with regard to the quality of its public servants. It is wrong to call them an elite group who want to keep information to themselves. I never met public servants like that on any Government body of which I was a member. There is always information available if people look for it.The Bill extends the period for release of information from five to ten years and I have no problem with that.

They are an outstanding group of people of the highest integrity. We are privileged to have such an elite group serving the country. The failure of two or three politicians to hold such standards should not be used as an excuse to enact legislation where concerns about public disclosure will paralyse meetings and decision making. Those in the public service bureaucracy who make wrong decisions will suffer if they are exposed.I do not agree with freedom of information operating on a general level because I have seen its capacity to be destructive. I trust the civil servants and 99% of politicians in the same way as Senator Quinn and we trust one another when we do business.

There have also been excellent contributions by Senators on all sides of the House.Nobody wants to be here until 1 a.m. or 2 a.m., but the Opposition has been forced to take this procedure because the Government decided to complete Second Stage today. It would not be necessary to sit late had the debate been extended over the following two days.

In this regard the Government should consider repealing the Official Secrets Act. In 1996, an Oireachtas joint committee concluded that fundamental change was required to that legislation to ensure greater accountability and openness in Government. It had the approval of all parties in the House and the Government should address the issue. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.There are stark differences between the Freedom of Information Act and the Bill. When the Freedom of Information Bill was finally passed in 1997, two Governments had been party to its deliberations. There was a long period of gestation of approximately eight months before the Bill was produced and was passed by both Houses. Most importantly, there was all-party support for it.By politicising this issue in the way it was done last week, we are doing it a huge disservice. All-party support has been the essential element in any legislative assembly that has enacted this kind of legislation, specially in Australia and Canada, which take the most liberal approach. The rowing back of this position with this Bill is bad for a freedom of information regime. It need not have happened.Last Tuesday the Government decided to proceed with amending legislation but it refused to publish the Bill until Friday when neither House was sitting. It is now going through the charade of putting the Bill through Second Stage this evening and proceeding to Committee Stage next week. There has been no Opposition consultation. That is wrong because it has meant that freedom of information has become a tool of the Opposition. Members on this side of the House have been in Opposition for a number of years and they are aware of the implications of this development. Not only the parliamentary but the wider opposition use freedom of information legislation to get the maximum amount of information on the decisions-making processes. That is why it is so reprehensible that no formal consultation on this Bill took place between the Opposition and the Government on changes to a regime that had attracted all-party support in 1997. It was the wrong way to do business.The fundamental difference between the Act and the Bill concerns the extension of the provisions regarding the five year rule. I support some of the comments made on the Government side of the House and I will return to this aspect. There has been no consultation and it is not good enough that five Secretaries General, upstanding people and excellent officials, should be left in this invidious position. Some of their recommendations have been transmitted into legislation. It is wrong that they were the only people to be consulted. There has been no role for the users of the legislation.On the 9 o'clock news this evening, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment suggested that this is a media device and that the newspapers have created a head of steam over it. This is not just a matter for the NUJ or newspaper columnists or those who work in television and radio. Huge numbers of citizens use this legislation on a daily basis to extract their rights from the bureaucracy, the unmoveable object that frequently stands between them and their rights.There has been virtually no consultation with the Information Commissioner, who is the last recourse of appeal for citizens. The Government has said it favours consultation and that it is the way to do business and process legislation. The Taoiseach's action programme on regulatory reform, launched in 1998, states: "There should be adequate consultation with interested parties before new legislation is introduced." The Government's February 2002 paper on better regulation states: "One method of engaging citizens in decision making is the use of public consultation processes." This morning we saw what happened to that process. An amendment I proposed to the Order of Business which would have allowed the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to engage the public and the users of freedom of information by holding specific hearings at no cost to the Exchequer was voted down by the Government. It is voting against its own stated policy, which dates back to 2002.The recently concluded Sustaining Progress agreement identifies as a key principle the promotion of greater consultation and transparency in formulating legislation and regulation. Once again, there was no consultation with the users, the Opposition or media, all of whom use this legislation on a daily basis to ensure accountability. The saner voices of the Government – there are many – should note that the policy position they have adopted has been breached.The manner in which the Bill is being dealt with and its inclusion in the public domain ensure that the Opposition will not see any of its good measures, while those on the Government side will not recognise its fundamental injustices. I support unequivocally the fact that the proposed legislation will, for the first time, give a right of appeal to the High Court and Supreme Court where there is a difference with the decision of the Information Commissioner. I welcome this and support the fact that the maximum time limit in respect of the Information Commissioner is now four months as opposed to the previous limit of three months. That is also good but we will not have a proper exchange because the matter has become politicised as a result of the process in which the Government has chosen to engage in the House and, presumably, elsewhere.The contention that there is a free-for-all in terms of FOI requests is just not true. The Act, as it stands, automatically protects sensitive communications of a deliberative nature. Tonight, for instance, we realise how important it is that sensitive communications between the Irish and British Governments on Northern Ireland remain secret, sensitive and secure. Nobody is suggesting that that should not be the case.There are checks and balances already in place in the legislation. The Information Commissioner's decisions to date have been even-handed. Is the Government suggesting that every appeal that goes to him automatically results in his favouring those who are seeking the information? This is not the case. If one looks at the report of the commissioner, one will note that he regularly takes the side of the Government regarding decisions on whether information should be given out. There was absolutely no recognition in the Minister's speech that the protective provisions I have mentioned are already in place.Since 1997 there has been a tremendous advance. Many papers related to decision making, which were previously governed by a 30 year rule, are now governed by a five year rule. The Government is now proposing to change it to a ten year rule. We can have a debate about that issue about which I am neutral. I understand the difficulties any Government might have regarding the issue, but the Government chose, through the process I outlined earlier, not to engage us in any consultation. This is our Act and it was passed on an all-party basis in 1997. Considerable time was devoted to it, involving two Governments from both sides of the House.Let us have a debate on this issue, although I do not believe it is the most important part of the Bill. I do not think the move from five years to ten years is all that important. In many respects, letting the public know the decision making processes of Ministers is a very good thing. We all know that politics is dull and boring in this country because of certain characteristics of political parties. The bigger the party, the bigger the disagreement. An independent Member such as Senator Quinn will never disagree with himself, whereas the Labour Party, with its five Senators, will have some disagreement. Fine Gael has considerable disagreement because it has 15 Senators and I presume that Fine Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have the same problem. However, that is good.I ask the Minster to reflect on this. If we treat issues seriously we will acknowledge that there has to be real debate in parties, around the Cabinet table and between Members on both sides of the House. We should not be afraid of this. It is good that the Ministers for Finance and Health and Children are constantly at each other's throats in relation to funding because it is fundamental to the decision of whether we should raise taxes and the mechanism regarding the choice of priorities. There is a natural opposition to freedom of information from a bureaucratic level and from Government because they think there is something macho about saying we sing from the same hymn sheet when, in fact, we do not. This is also a good thing.One reason why some Ministers are quite happy to see the five year rule changed to a ten year rule is because they will be able to point out to people outside the House that they have been vindicated on stances that they took. It could well be the case that the issuing of reports could vindicate the position of a Minister who had been arguing a certain point for a long time. However, we should not be afraid of that.The most dangerous amendment in the Bill does not pertain to the five year rule but to the new powers given to Secretaries General to certify that a record relates to a "deliberative process" and is thereby exempt from release. It is crazy that we are giving this power to a Secretary General in each Department. What is the "deliberative process"? Virtually every scrap of paper, discussion and minute devoted to making a Government decision involves a deliberative process. If the Minister is suggesting that this will be exempted through the imposition of this legislation, it is foolish in the extreme. I ask that the reference to "deliberative process" be removed from the legislation immediately.During the term of the last Government we found out at regular intervals the views of the Tax Advisory Group, which advised the Government on financial matters. Frequently, its advice was at odds with the Minister for Finance, which is healthy. It is good that Ministers decide to say "No" to the moguls in their Departments and state, "I am here, I am accountable, I will take the flak and make the decision." This form of debate is not only helping democracy but is lending credence to the notion of political accountability. We should not shy away from it.The certificate that a Secretary General could issue under the new regime could not be appealed to the Information Commissioner. Not only will one not get the scrap of paper that one wanted but one will not be able to appeal to the Information Commissioner if the concept of the "deliberative process" is used as an excuse for exemption by the Secretary General. That is far-fetched and represents a rowing back of the enlightened position we had arrived at in 1997 and to which Senator Quinn referred. Furthermore, it is not fair to the officials to give them this demi-god status in terms of decision making. It is wide open to abuse.The mandatory fees for the processing of FOI requests are totally out of proportion to the spirit of the original Act. Of course there are costs, but there are considerable gains. In March 2002, PA Consulting Group presented the Minister for Finance with a report on the evaluation of the progress of the strategic management initiative. The consultants found that the degree of openness achieved under FOI is such that information is now routinely available to the public without any recourse to the Act whatsoever. Many officials do not need recourse to existing FOI provisions, such has been the change in the public service culture in five years.Moreover, the report describes a strong sense among public servants that freedom of information has made their Department or Office more open in its dealings with customers and stakeholders. The introduction of a fee for freedom of information requests is a Government reaction to the media, rather than against individual requesters. The independent PA Consulting report found that public service culture had changed because the legislation was in place. Many middle and senior ranking civil servants have changed their attitudes because of the introduction of the Act. The imposition of mandatory fees is contrary to its spirit of openness and transparency.I am absolutely opposed to the proposal not to make parliamentary briefing notes available under FOI. Frequently, such notes contain more information than answers to parliamentary questions. I spent five years in the Dáil where I found parliamentary questions to be the most important political device to keep the Government accountable. The oral question, in particular, ensures the effectiveness of Parliament because there is an easy flow between Minister and Opposition across the floor of the House. It is regressive to fail to make available under FOI the briefing notes which inform the answers to questions. I ask the Government to stop in its tracks and think about this.Senator O'Meara was correct to observe that we would not have had to hold the various tribunals if Ministers had answered questions honestly in the House. The massive sums spent on tribunals could have been saved if there had been real accountability in terms of parliamentary replies. From his extensive agricultural experience, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, will be well aware of the truth of this in respect of the late Mr. Justice Hamilton's report on the beef industry, the cost of which was in the region of £38 million.We have been told that all organisations have the right to decide how to organise their business and that the Government is no different. Its work is complex and in reaching decisions on important economic and social issues various alternatives must be examined. That is exactly my point. If the Government has the right to examine alternatives, why cannot the public be made aware of them? I ask the House to consider this question as well as the excellent contributions we heard from both sides. I hope the Government familiarises itself with the debate before it continues with its initiative to ram the Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Mistakes will be made which will be left to another generation to sort out.

That is not to say this issue is unimportant but we have been subjected to many red herrings and much distortion. I was on the Opposition side when the House considered Second and Committee Stages of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 which has been represented as nearly flawless. It has been said that it opened all doors but the freedom of information it introduced was not unfettered. The Bill before the House seeks to make quite a few improvements to the original legislation which is the reason opposition to it is concentrated on section 12.A parliamentary guillotine occurs when consideration of a Bill consists of a vote on one question put from the Chair. No such restriction has been placed on Second Stage of this legislation. It is odd to hear the Opposition request consultation on a Bill which is narrow in its scope and deals with few, if contentious, matters. There were no calls for consultation on the recent Health Insurance and Local Government Bills.

It is quite clear that in consultations the main bones of contention would be the ten year rule and the provisions relating to Secretaries General, matters on which we have heard very selective contributions. I share some of the concerns expressed by Senator Brian Hayes regarding the powers of Secretaries General to issue certificates preventing certain releases but the Bill is quite clear that these powers relate to material which has been established for the direct support of Government deliberations. This is much more restrictive than has been represented here. Oppositions Members have also failed to point out that these certificates must be revoked by a Secretary General once the deliberative processes concerned have ended.Senator Brian Hayes brings a great degree of sanity and level-headedness to Seanad debates and I dispute that he said what we were told he did. It is my recollection that he accepted the Government need to act without reference to untrammelled freedom of information to be efficient in its workings. We keep hearing about rights but there are also responsibilities to be considered in this matter. The Government bears very onerous responsibilities which have to be discharged to the very best of its ability but its members must be free to discuss the issues of the day openly and vigorously within Cabinet. If a five year rule applied, it is possible the Government would have to provide information at the end of its life about decisions made at its outset. That could have profound consequences. There have to be limitations and those proposed in this legislation are acceptable. I agree with Senator Brian Hayes that we should examine the scope of the Bill between now and Committee Stage. I am sure that this will be done.If we fail to implement this Bill, the effect will be to stymie the availability of information. No records will be kept. Everything would be done in smoke-filled rooms either by politicians or civil servants alone or by a combination of politicians and civil servants. If we did not enact the legislation, that would be the ultimate effect. That would be wrong and unhelpful and the accountability which is required would not be there. Some degree of restriction must be imposed. I believe the restriction is a prudent one and I do not believe it undermines the intention of the 1997 Act.I accept that we had a culture of secrecy. I was a practising journalist for 30 years. I was not a member of the National Union of Journalists but was a member of the Guild of Agricultural Journalists of Ireland.

If the State holds information about me as a citizen, I should have the absolute right to that information. That is a different issue from the other issue which is getting a lot of attention.Certain rights have attendant responsibilities. Section 25 of the Bill deals with records relating to the costing by a public body of a proposal of a political party. In my view this is much more restrictive than is being represented and I am prepared to see that contested. On the matter of a fee, I think it is quite appropriate to have a set fee. Other speakers have made the point that it is very different for a newspaper to seek information as against an individual and there should be a difference in treatment. The individual seeking a particular piece of personal information should be treated in a sympathetic manner. Vexatious persons making hundreds of requests for information can cause a very large liability for the State. The fee should be designed to discourage a succession of requests under freedom of information. I note that the Bill proposes to deal with vexatious and frivolous queries.If this limited protection is not introduced, no records will be created. Senator Mansergh spoke earlier in the debate about the requirements of history as opposed to those of journalism or the need for current information. Historical records will not exist as they did in the past. We had a very secretive society up to as late as the 1970s which was a by-product of our imperial past. When we were governed by another jurisdiction it was considered very unsafe to allow the natives to have knowledge of certain matters because information was power and as the natives could not be trusted to govern themselves information had to be kept from their scrutiny.There was all-party support for the introduction of freedom of information and there is still all-party support for it. What is at issue is the detail in this Bill.

I heard Senator Quinn's very eloquent contribution and I wholeheartedly agree with his argument.Senator Dardis made a very interesting point which bears some deliberation. We have inherited the British way of doing things. Our Civil Service and system of government was given to us by the British and we have stuck pretty rigidly to it for 70 or 80 years. It is a system where civil servants talk to civil servants, civil servants talk to Ministers, Ministers sometimes talk to each other and eventually a decision comes down from Cabinet. The singular feature of all this talking is that it all happens – at least in theory – in private and in secret. In theory, the public is not meant to find out anything until 30 years after the event.It is a system of government and a use of power that most of us recognise but few of us would seek to defend. Those in whose name power is wielded are kept in ignorance of the reasons why a particular decision was taken, about the lobbying for a decision or the pressure brought to bear on Ministers about a decision. Freedom of information has played its part in opening up our system of government. The committee system in these Houses has also played its part. Ten or 15 years ago there was no committee system and there was certainly no inquiry system in the committees of these Houses. I suspect that 15 years ago very few people would have known the names of the Secretaries General of the various Departments. They did not appear before committees or on television. They sat in their Departments and made decisions.The Freedom of Information Act has significantly impacted on the culture of the Civil Service which is to the service's credit. It is appropriate that those of us on the Opposition side of the House acknowledge that. When I was the Labour Party spokesperson in the other House I went to the Department of Finance shortly after the introduction of the Act in 1997 with a specific query about corporation tax. I submitted a catch-all request looking for any records held by the Department in relation to corporation tax. A very senior civil servant invited me to meet him to talk about my request. He told me that there were two ways of dealing with my request: he could ask half a dozen executive officers to make a list of the records dealing with corporation tax which could take three or four days to complete; or I could tell him what I wanted to know and he would endeavour to answer the question. I informed him that I wanted to know whether the then Government – as it had promised to do in the manifesto it presented to the people – had done anything to reduce corporation tax to 10%. He said, "No" and that was the end of the conversation.The point I am making is that I managed to obtain the information I wanted by asking a question which would not have been answered six months earlier. The civil servant would have felt, and rightly so, that it was beyond his call of duty to give me the information. He probably would have felt it improper to divulge that the Government had not attempted to give effect to a policy in the manifesto. The culture had changed, however, within that short period.The Department of Finance and the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, are good examples of this. Shortly after the introduction of the Act, and following either the 1998 or 1999 budget, I and others requested a series of 30 or 40 papers on individual tax issues prepared by the tax strategy group. After some deliberation, the Department decided to provide them. This was good because it added a great deal to our knowledge of what happens pre-budget between Departments and within the Department of Finance. Each year since then, and outside the scope of the Act, the Department and Minister have decided to publish the papers of the tax strategy group on the Internet and to give them to the public in hard copy format. This would have been unthinkable five years ago.I suspect this comes down, in part, to the personality of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, because he does not have a difficulty with people knowing that certain things were entirely his idea. He does not have a problem with people knowing he has ignored the advice of officials. He does not have a problem with people knowing that officials from different Departments took different views. While I disagree with the Minister on many issues, he is correct in this instance. People have got used to that fact. Those of us in Opposition, who might have attempted initially to score a few political points on the basis of that disagreement, have long since stopped trying to do so because it does not wash. The public have become used to it and regard it, quite rightly, as simply a healthy expression of difference.Like others, I am not sure that the extension from five years to ten is entirely wrong. I am sure, however, that several of the other measures introduced to broaden what is, in effect, a Government paper are fundamentally wrong. They will also be open to abuse. The notion, for example, that in future any communication between Ministers is to be considered a Government memorandum is in my view potentially extremely dangerous. Governments should act collectively. Once a decision is taken at Cabinet, we expect Government Ministers to defend it. It is part of the doctrine of collective responsibility and it is enshrined in our Constitution. None of us expect that each Minister or each official will have agreed at every point during a process or that they will have agreed everything three weeks, three months or three years before entering into Government. That is a fundamentally different issue.What danger is there to democracy or what problem is there with setting out, in precise form – as is the case with Government memoranda – the pros and cons of certain proposals, the views of particular Departments or the views of particular Ministers? What is the danger to public debate? Surely it is a positive element and something any healthy democracy would encourage. I hope Members will forgive me for being party political, but there is an element of the Government getting comfortable here.When one has been in Government for six or seven years – I know the present Minister of State has not – it becomes that little bit more tedious to have to come before the House. The Minister of State will find that he will be doing a lot of deputising for his senior Minister in years to come because the latter will clearly be tired not only of the Seanad, but also of the Lower House. It becomes tedious to have to go to RTE, therefore, it will be even more difficult to get him to do that. All the checks and balances which most of us regard as being part of the business of Government become merely tedious. This has clearly happened to the Government. I suspect the Bill is yet another indication of that tedium with process because that process stops one from governing properly, quickly and effectively, which is, no doubt, what most Ministers believe they are doing.Senator Dardis, on behalf of the Progressive Democrats, stated that people have rights and responsibilities and that a balance must be struck. There are many balances – some of us would argue there are too many – in the 1997 Act. Anything that is commercially sensitive, for example, can be excluded. This has frequently been interpreted to mean that anything which impacts on a semi-State company or public body with a commercial remit is almost automatically excluded. For example, an inquiry into Aer Lingus would almost certainly be excluded because the information would be commercially sensitive. This is pushing matters a little far, particularly when a company is in public ownership, has a public remit and, in many instances, a universal service obligation. That is one example of protection from information which has been extended above and beyond what is required.The most important element of the entire process is the so-called deliberative process. This is a very difficult notion to pin down. Some Departments consider a deliberative process to be simply a decision. Some consider it to be a campaign and others a war. I have on occasion requested information under the Act about correspondence which took place during the so-called Estimates campaign. Once that campaign is over and the budget and Estimates have been presented, some Departments will provide the information to which I refer. Others, however, will say that they did not get it this year, that they might obtain it next year and that they will present the same arguments at that stage and, therefore, the deliberative process is not over.As I understand it, this is the view among the majority of Government Departments and it is unacceptable. As things stand, it is possible to appeal a decision of that nature on the basis that it is not in the public interest. It must be demonstrated by the Secretary General, or whoever is making the decision, that it was in the public interest to deprive the public of particular information. There is a quite insidious amendment in the Bill which will remove that aspect. Effectively, there is now no objective test and no appeal. It will simply be necessary for a Secretary General of a Department to sign a certificate stating that the deliberative process is continuing and that certificate cannot be questioned. The Secretary General is meant to issue a certificate when the deliberative process is over, but there is no guarantee he or she will do so. The result is that if anything is under consideration in any public body – even though the section refers to Departments of State – it will be possible for the Secretary General to simply sign a piece of paper saying that the deliberative process is ongoing and, thus, protect entire swathes of information.The amendment, which takes up approximately six lines of text in the Bill, could exclude a huge number of requests made under the existing Act, which is unacceptable. It is also fair to point out that most of what comes under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is already excluded. In the process leading up to the formulation of the Act in 1997, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Department of Defence argued they should be entitled to an exclusion because everything they did was sensitive. In fairness to the former Minister of State, Eithne Fitzgerald, they were not allowed to claim that class exemption, so to speak. When they claimed that a particular item of information was sensitive from the point of view of security, international affairs or whatever, they were required to show that it was in the public interest to retain it. We are moving away from that position and, therefore, it will be possible to give these Departments a class exemption so they can basically say to anyone who seeks information that they will not get it.The issue of fees, on which I do not have a strong view, is interesting. If people were simply being levied with a €20 fee, it is not something about which I would become particularly upset. However, there will be a difficulty where a person must pay €20 for the first application. If one must make several applications, obviously, there will be multiple charges. If one appeals to the Department, one must pay again and, if one appeals to the commissioner, one must pay again. My understanding of the current system is that only newspapers are asked to pay large fees, which is reasonable. They probably go in for the most wide-ranging of applications and, if it is necessary to oblige civil servants to do a huge amount of work, it is reasonable to get bodies such as newspapers to pay a reasonable fee. I am not particularly exercised by the €20 charge, though if it militated against people making applications or requests it should be looked at again.I endorse what has been said about the way the high-level review came about. I believe that civil servants have accommodated themselves to this. Therefore, I am not sure we can point the finger at five Secretaries General and ask what else we could expect. I suspect that word came from on high, though we do not know that because we do not have the background papers, and that direction and advice to the Secretaries General came from their ministerial masters. Most Secretaries General have got used to the Act, even if it is not necessarily something they would have proposed. We should look elsewhere to criticise.To publish a Bill a few days ago and to bring it into the House today and effectively impose a guillotine is not the right way to do things. To do so in the context of a Freedom of Information Act is particularly unfortunate. Rather than restricting information we should be looking at ways to extend the right to information. One anomaly which is still on the Statute Book is the Official Secrets Act. Some provisions of that Act run contrary to the spirit of the Freedom of Information Act.There are terms and conditions in the average civil servant's contract of employment which are also contrary to the spirit of the freedom of information Act. It is still the case that a civil servant has to sign a paper committing him or her to respect the Official Secrets Act. That paper spells out what a civil servant may or may not say and warns against casual conversation during the course of which a person might reveal something which is tantamount to an official secret. An official secret is extremely widely defined in the Act and effectively comes down to whatever a person's immediate boss considers should be secret. This is a strong weapon in the hands of senior civil servants and Ministers in ensuring that civil servants remain mum and work in a spirit that is clearly contrary to the notion of free discussion and freedom of information. That provision in a civil servant's contract should be looked as a matter of urgency. Some effort has been made in the context of SMI but it has not gone far enough.What are the arrangements for Committee Stage of this Bill? Senator O'Toole suggested to me, and he has greater expertise than I in the matter of racing, that not only was the senior Minister likely to be in Cheltenham next week but that the Minister of State might also be there.

I did not intend to be frivolous this morning but my point is that it is important we have a serious Committee Stage if we are taking Second Stage in the manner in which we are. We will not have a serious Committee Stage if the senior Minister and the Minister of State are not here to deal with it. What is the point in our coming in and wasting our breath if somebody from another Department is sent in to effectively say "No" to everything? We have had that experience in the House recently. I will not mention the particular Minister of State because he, I suppose, was as much imposed upon as we were. It is dispiriting and is a discourtesy to the House if that is what happens next week. Perhaps I am casting aspersions unfairly on the Minister and he does intend to stay through the week with us.

The legislation allows the time to be lengthened from three months to four months. This is notional. In practice it takes a good deal longer than that for most decisions to be made by Mr. Murphy and the appeals commission. The practice is that as the limit approaches a person gets a phone call from the commissioner's office and is told they have not had time to look at it and asked if he would mind extending the time. If the person says "No" the regrettable result is that the appeal is refused so the person has really no alternative but to agree.It is not at all unusual for appeals to take several years to be sorted out and for a decision to be made. I do not blame the commissioner for that. For a long time he did not have enough staff but that situation has improved recently. For the system to work effectively a person needs to be sure that if he puts in a request now he will not still be looking at fighting it out in two years' time. We need to shorten rather than lengthen the time involved and perhaps we should look to provide for an absolute limit on the time it will take to determine an appeal.I am sorry we have not been able to take a more constructive approach to this Bill. There are some good things in the Bill but there are also improvements that could be made. I hope Senator Dardis is right that there will be a spirit of constructive contribution next week, that we will have a serious Committee Stage and that we will have the opportunity to make our imprint on it.To return to my first point, we made a huge amount of progress in the past ten years in the opening up of Government and in making those with real power accountable to those in whose name the power is wielded. This Bill is a retrograde one when we consider that.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	511	I am one of those in the House who did not get a copy of this Bill until I arrived here this morning, due to the deteriorating postal services in rural Ireland which should be looked into. I am disappointed by the fast tracking of this Bill through the House.Five years after the passing of the initial freedom of information legislation there is clearly a need for review. However, the proposals by Government, as outlined in the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, are a serious attack on the rights of citizens and on democracy itself. What is being put before us today contravenes the notion of freedom of information. We are told that the recommendations are based on a report commissioned by the Government from a review group of top officials from the Civil Service. We are also told that the Government accepted all its recommendations.A disturbing level of secrecy surrounds this group and its report. Who are these top civil servants? What was their brief? Was undue pressure brought to bear on them? Why were those who will be most affected by the Bill, such as the NUJ or the Information Commissioner, not consulted in regard to these proposals? All these questions and all the doubts that this Bill raises must be answered and addressed.While this Bill proposes to amend the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, these amendments are retrogressive rather than progressive. As it stands the proposed amendments are designed to inhibit and prevent essential access to important information. The proposed changes will increase the exemption period for Cabinet records from five to ten years and will ensure that communications between Ministers on matters relating to Government business are protected. Is the Government telling us that its potential embarrassment is more important than people's right to information? The changes proposed will also protect documents relating to parliamentary questions, tribunals and international relations.The introduction of up-front fees, for people requesting information under the Act, to cover administrative costs is another tax by stealth. This is something we have become used to since this Government returned to power. This Government has undoubtedly been in trouble since its re-election last summer.

Is the Government now asking us, under the guise of legislation, to assist it in electioneering? Broken promises bought one election.

The ready availability of and access to official information provided by and for the people and paid for by the taxpayer is not a privilege accorded by Government – it is a fundamental right of modern democracy.The Freedom of Information Act 1997 brought Ireland into line with other common law jurisdictions, although somewhat later than most. Australia, Canada and New Zealand, which, like Ireland have a Westminster model of government, have had equivalent legislation in place since 1982 and they were not burdened in the way our taxpayers have been over the past decade and a half with tribunal after tribunal. No one is repaying the cost of those to the State. It has been shown that people have been involved in wrongdoing but they have not been prosecuted or returned what is owed to the State.The erosion of the powers granted by this Act will have repercussions that will extend from central Government to local authorities. Every department, health board etc. will operate behind the closed doors of this amended Act. While on the one hand the Government is attempting to curb access to what it perceives as sensitive material, on the other hand it is proposing to charge for the information it is prepared to release. In a further erosion of the citizens' right to information, the Government is proposing as yet undetermined charges for future applications under the Act.The Minister should remember that it is pay-back time in regard to the illegal planning charges that were found unconstitutional by Europe. The Government seems to have learned nothing from the debacle surrounding the imposition of planning objection fees and is again apparently trying to discourage, inhibit and prevent what should be an automatic right for every citizen.As it stands, the message being sent out by this Bill is that the Government will do anything to prevent material which is potentially embarrassing being exposed to the critical light of day. Big Daddy is watching you, but on no account are you to watch big Daddy is the new definition of democracy.Fine Gael will use every opportunity available to it to stop this dishonest, untruthful Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government from ramming this Bill through the Oireachtas.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	537	As I said on the Order of Business today, this legislation is Sir Humphrey's revenge. By any standards – and I take a balanced view in regard to the legislation – the Freedom of Information Act was in need of amendment but this was precisely the way not to do it. This Bill is a mistake and we will rue the day that it is passed.The Bill was described to me by a leading bureaucrat as "very effective but quite shameless" in terms of what it does. What is proposed is impenetrable. In 1998 when the original Act was going through this House I was appalled by, and opposed to the idea that Cabinet papers would be released after five years. It was wrong and people got carried away with their own enthusiasm at the time. I believe that some people have taken advantage of that in order to support a lazy approach to things. Provided that the person seeking information is protected, there is no reason why a scale of charges could not be introduced to prevent abuse. I was prepared to look at the Bill in regard to those two issues. When I heard that these matters were being discussed I looked back at the Act some weeks ago and came to the conclusion that it made sense to discuss these matters and have some approach to dealing with them but that is where it begins and ends.The legislation is flawed and we will come to be ashamed of it. For the first time ever it gives statutory basis to the old mushroom policy of keeping them in the dark and throwing whatever they want at them. It is like constructing a Nissen hut to keep the rest of us in the dark while the Government is outside. It is the opposite to everything that was claimed at the time that the legislation would be, in terms of openness and transparency.I stood here five years ago and said I was not too taken with the idea of openness and transparency. I am on the record in this regard. At the time, I said that the word "transparent" was one used in my part of the country to euphemistically describe people who were not that bright. I never thought it was a great idea to be transparent and to go around without an unspoken thought. However, this legislation was in operation and was effective. It needed amendment but this measure atomises it, destroys its spirit and takes us very far back.We are moving regressively. This legislation is closer to Freemasonry than to open, modern, democratic government. It is all about secrecy at the top. One of the principal arguments in favour of the FOI Act was that decisions would be taken at a lower level and that the information officer in a Department would not be at the top of the structure. Today's amendment gives decision making power to the people in the firing line. This does not fit in with the philosophy of the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon's party. It would be difficult to get a majority for this measure on the Government side of the House if Members were allowed to vote for what they wanted. There might be support for the confidentiality measures and perhaps some aspects of charging but there would not be support for other sections.The Bill is an anachronism. At a time when we are moving towards more open government and more accessibility to information this amounts to a closing down which cannot be right. The Bill encourages the cynics who will look at Government, these Houses and politicians and say, "This is more of the same. They tell us nothing." One can well see how they would react in that way.The Bill resonates of Stalinism and central control. For many years I listened to Fianna Fáil talking about the democratic centralism of The Workers' Party. This Bill pulls everything back to the centre instead of moving out. It is the opposite of what is happening in Europe and what we were talking about when we discussed the future of Europe this evening. It is a move back from all those principles. This is demonstrated in the tone of the accompanying memorandum when it states, "In contrast to the current position whereby such a release must be considered contrary to the public interest.". There are circumstances in which Members on this side of the House could support some of the proposals but we cannot support the thrust of this legislation. One could not support a single section of it as it is written. If changes were proposed which everyone could discuss and have a view on, we could move forward.When we discussed the Freedom of Information Bill five years ago, Deputy John Bruton referred to government behind a transparent wall. I did not agree with those who thought that would be a good idea but that was the modern thinking at the time. Some suggested that the wall might be translucent rather than transparent in order that the light would at least be let in. We spoke of lifting the veil of secrecy. Instead of lifting a veil of secrecy we are now building an iron curtain which is regressive. It is the kind of thing in eastern Europe about which we complained for many years. We spoke of a lack of access to information which is power and freedom. It frees people and allows them a greater understanding. All thinking people will oppose this measure. We will look back on the enactment of this legislation and say it was an appalling decision.Consultation is a key part of decision making, whether in business, the marketplace or politics. I have heard the Minister of State say this in another context. I am not talking about co-government. Governments must still make decisions which has not happened in this case. The Leader referred to the five people who formed the review group. I know all five and hold them in the highest regard.

The users were not consulted. A users' group was set up to monitor the operation of the legislation but the last time it met was in 1999 or 2000. No one asked it about this legislation. Will the Minister of State tell me the correct title of the group because I would like to table an amendment regarding it on Committee Stage? We also appointed an Information Commissioner. How can one justify amending the primary legislation when the person, the fulcrum of the operation of the legislation, has not been asked for a view? The man concerned has worked at the most senior level of the Civil Service and is now the Ombudsman and the Information Commissioner. Why was he not asked? The reason is simple. Like all politicians, I do not ask a question unless I know what the answer will be. The Information Commissioner would not have given the answer the Government was looking for and so was not asked. The Minister of State knows how these things work. He could not justify what has happened. If he was asked by a constituent the reason the Information Commissioner was not consulted, he would say, "I do not know," because he is an honest man.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	541	That is what any ordinary sensible person would say. He would not even begin to try to justify it.There has been no consultation with any strand of civic society. The Taoiseach is in Northern Ireland tonight doing much hard work to maintain an agreement which establishes the importance of civic society on this island. We are discussing an issue which makes civic society important. It is one of the main bridges between civic society and the operation of Government. Civic society, whatever Government thinks that might be, was not consulted. Who was asked? The answer is those on the receiving end of freedom of information requests. That is a very one sided approach which does not bear up to any kind of scrutiny and is not something with which the Minister of State could live.The Bill is appalling on many levels and I got tired reading it. I will read a short extract:If, in the opinion of the head, granting a request would require the retrieval of such a number of records or an examination of such a kind of the records concerned as to cause a substantial and unreasonable interference with or disruption of the work of the public body.Of course, a request disrupts the work. As every Member of the Oireachtas and civil servant knows, it is an utter nuisance that meddlesome politicians can ask parliamentary questions week after week, upsetting the business of State. One can imagine civil servants saying, "We could be getting on and doing stuff if they did not ask us all these questions. We have to prepare answers, give information, explain ourselves and defend positions. This is an awful mess and could we stop it, as quickly as possible?" That is the kind of trouble that a Bill such as this causes and that is what we do not want. It does not bear scrutiny.Let us look at the next part of it: "If the request, in the opinion of the head, is frivolous or vexatious or if it forms a pattern of manifestly unreasonable requests." I firmly agree that if somebody uses these provisions for frivolous or vexatious purposes they should not be given the time of day. If somebody asked me a question which would embarrass me if I were to answer it publicly, then I would consider it unreasonable that I had been made to answer that question. It is a subjective judgment of one person. It is utterly unreasonable. Surely it is unreasonable for me to have to answer a question that might threaten my promotion prospects or show me in a poor public light or show my Department to have acted in a way that was not great. It is unreasonable; it is a bit troublesome.This turns the Act on its head. This is what it was all about in the first place. It was to reassure people that Departments and arms of the State were acting reasonably or otherwise to expose unreasonable action, whichever it was. That is what it was set up to do. Now it is being used as a reason not to make it work. Did somebody somewhere hold the view that people writing in questions to an arm of the State would in some sense not be troublesome? Of course it is troublesome and unreasonable.If I have to produce a policy document for the Minister of State by next Friday and I am suddenly hit with having to answer three or four questions from a meddlesome consumer or a meddlesome voter or an unreasonable person from the back end of somewhere else, why should I waste my time answering questions for them when I need to work on the big policy jobs for my Minister? Of course, it is unreasonable if one looks at it from that point of view but it is utterly unreasonable as well for the person who asked the question that they should not get an answer.In regard to section 12 of the Bill, I do not know where to start. What might not be available any more is a communication "between two or more members of the Government relating to a matter that is under consideration by the Government". Can the Minister give me five examples of what would not be considered by Government? I would like to know what the Government does not talk about. I thought it was running the country. What are the issues that are ruled out? What could not or would not be considered by Government? Does not the Government deal with every piece of legislation that comes through either House? Does not it deal with every policy document? Is not every significant decision taken by any Department cleared by Government? Anything like that is suddenly ruled out in its broad terms, given the way this legislation is framed.The section continues as follows "between two or more such members who form .. a group of such members to which a matter has been delegated by the Government". Any group with Government members on it now becomes privileged.John Healy would turn in his grave at the next part. In paragraph (e) there is a new definition of “Government”. For me “Government” is defined in the Constitution as having between seven and 15 members. For the purpose of this Act, “Government” includes a committee of the Government and a committee of officials. We used to hear jokes for years about the permanent Government. They were right. This is it – we have made them the permanent Government. The bureaucrats have taken over. They are now part of the permanent Government of the State. They are in there and are privileged. It is the line we used to say would never happen. It is a total close down. It is an absolute joke.It also includes members of Government and a special adviser. Special advisers are now part of Government and are covered. Can the Minister of State imagine if he was in Opposition what his party would say about this? I am another oddity on this side of the House in that I actually agree with special advisers. Most people when they are out of Government are opposed to them. Special advisers and programme managers are a good idea and make the Government work well. However, I see no reason why special advisers sitting with a Government should suddenly be protected by confidentiality and be ruled out – a special adviser within the meaning of section 19 of the Ethics Act. It does not make any sense, it is fundamentally wrong. It goes against everything we set out to do and it certainly puts a level of protection on officials which was never intended. It started off with the protection of Government and went on to protection between two members of Government and to a committee of Government. I cannot understand some of this. It now extends to any committee which includes people outside the members of Government. A committee of officials is considered to be Government. It is not just civil servants.

In terms of the protection of documents I want the Minister of State to try to listen to this with a warped mind, which he does not have, and see what he could do with it. The Bill states:A document for a member of Government, the Attorney General, the Minister of State, the Secretary of the Government or the Assistant Secretary to the Government for use by him or her primarily for the purpose of the transaction of any business.A document which was not produced necessarily or solely for the purposes of Government but which is now being used for Government suddenly becomes protected. If I have a document in my hand about which some pesky member of the public may seek information, I put it as part of the Government circuit and it is suddenly outside out of court.Although I do not have time to develop it, section 13 is full of holes. It is incorrect and it does not make sense. Section 13(1A)(c) states that a certificate under this subsection shall be final. That is not correct. The previous two subparagraphs refer to certificates which can be revoked. That is incorrect. It is unclear, confusing and it does not make sense. The section also refers to matters relating to the deliberative process of a Department. That is not what it is intended to do. It is talking about a matter that is under the deliberative process but it is written down as "the deliberative processes". The deliberative processes is the way the Department works and it has nothing to do with issues. Paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of section 13 are confusing, contradictory and will not work. This movement away from the senior official is unacceptable.I will conclude, in deference to the Chair. I have been on my feet 19 minutes and the record will show it. The Chair and I will agree on that.This Bill is a step backwards, it is regressive. Every section of it deserves to be opposed. Every section is an embarrassment to the Minister of State and any right-thinking person. Any person who looks at this with an open mind will be opposed to it. I do not normally take such a straight stand on those kinds of issues. I am prepared to listen to reason on any argument. I try to look at issues not from a biased viewpoint. This is bad and unclear legislation. It is an anachronism and legislation we should be ashamed of. It is shameful that we are trying to push this Bill through. I ask the Government and the Minister of State's party to look at it closely. I ask a few members of the Minister of State's party to advise the leadership of the party what they think of it as ordinary people in the privacy of the party rooms.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	548	It is a sad day for democracy when we have to come into the Upper House of the national Parliament to debate what it is intended to leave of the Freedom of Information Act. It is inherently contradictory in many respects, not least when one studies the Progressive Democrats' election campaign. We will never forget the sight of a particular candidate for that party who has been attributed with its success hanging out of trees like Tarzan, hanging up posters and warning us about the ills of a Fianna Fáil Administration and that the worst thing for democracy would be if Fianna Fáil got into Government on its own. He told people to vote for the Progressive Democrats which would be Fianna Fáil's watchdog. It is not even 12 months since Tarzan climbed up the pole somewhere around O'Connell Street and attempted to explain, in colourful detail, the ills of Fianna Fáil, yet today the Progressive Democrats are supporting an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act. All evening, it has denied it is guilty of guillotining the legislation but in this case, it is guilty of boning and rolling the Freedom of Information Act and throwing the remains to the dogs to eat.The manner in which the legislation was introduced last Friday leaves a lot to be desired. It was known that this and the other House would not sit on Friday and that the Members of both Houses would return to their respective constituencies on Thursday evening. That meant that most of us received the Bill yesterday morning by post, although some of us did not receive it until we arrived home yesterday evening. We have not been given an appropriate amount of time to study the Bill in the detail required in order to debate it in one evening. It is unfair on Members who have been on the road since early morning and on the staff of this House who must remain here until all hours of the morning to satisfy some smug eagerness on the part of the Government which will say it is not guillotining the legislation but is giving us ample time to debate it. We will be walking around this House at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. like zombies wondering why this debate could not have been adjourned this evening to resume tomorrow and perhaps on Thursday.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	550	Even at my age one gets a bit tired of these things every now and then.One of the most disappointing aspects surrounding this amending legislation is that the Government failed to embark on any form of consultation. I was going to say meaningful consultation but there was no consultation at all. Senator O'Toole rightly pointed out that the person central to the Freedom of Information Act, the Information Commissioner, did not even receive a telephone call or a letter asking him for his opinion on what was introduced last Friday. It is a sad facet of any Administration that it would not bother to consult the people most affected by the Freedom of Information Act.It was more than disappointing to listen to one Minister on Radio One yesterday. I will not name the Minister who more or less blamed the five civil servants. The Minister in question avoided providing real answers and went on to pontificate about the five civil servants. I did not hear any contribution this evening which cast any aspersions on any civil servant, let alone the five who drafted this. To further reinforce that point, there are provisions in the Bill which were not even proposed by those five senior civil servants. That begs the question, who is driving this Bill? What is the Government's fear? Is it trying to hide something? Is there some phobia about the Freedom of Information Act which would cause a member of the Government to break out in a rash if asked questions? What is wrong with a citizen making an application under the Freedom of Information Act to elicit information?We have preached in recent years about accountability, transparency and openness. We all know there was a small number of people who corrupted politics in this country which has led, in no small way, to cynicism on the part of the electorate. That, in turn, has had an effect on the polls in that fewer people are turning out on polling day no matter what the vote is on. All this may be attributed to that cynicism. We have also preached about the reasons for the success of the tribunals and why it was important that they were successful. The Houses of the Oireachtas set up the tribunals in an attempt to give politics a good name and drag it out of the dirt.This amending legislation goes against the very principles about which some people have been lecturing in recent years. It will not, in any way, ease the cynicism which exists and, if anything, will add to it. Has the Government not learned anything from the tribunals over the past six or seven years? If it has learned one thing, it should have been that the people are entitled to accountability and openness. Those principles were promised on many occasions by this Administration and others. That is why this Bill is a major retrograde step for Irish politics. It grinds democracy into the ground.We have seen other such legislation in this House recently. The Protection of the Environment Bill denigrates the role of members of local authorities in that it hands responsibility to set charges for waste collection over to county managers. Surely, this Bill ranks as one of the most insulting which has come before the House since the last Seanad election. It denigrates the role of democracy and, in many ways, reflects what happened in the House a few weeks ago when the Protection of the Environment Bill was introduced.I wish to outline a number of issues in regard to this Bill. The proposals were devised by insiders, the Government and a team of top civil servants, with the specific aim of excluding everybody else. Nobody else had hand, act or part in the drafting of this legislation. The Minister for Finance preached about the system in operation in Canada but what he is doing is in complete contrast with what is being done in Canada and Australia and goes against the spirit and the letter of Freedom of Information Act.The new restrictions are not about protecting security material or about protecting genuinely sensitive information but about protecting the Government and civil servants from political embarrassment. Surely if there is an issue about which to be embarrassed, it would be more brave for an individual to come out with their hands held up high instead of formulating this quick fix solution denigrating what was a perfectly democratic Act in order to cover up their own misgivings. I am sure the legislation was not perfect and that we should have reviewed it. I believe a commitment was given by the rainbow Government when the Act was introduced that after a certain number of years, it would be reviewed. That review did not take place. This Government has reneged on a promise given to this House and that is a sad and pathetic development in any democracy.I wish to touch on the section of the Bill dealing with briefing for parliamentary questions. Once again this allows Ministers to shelter behind the defence that someone did not ask the right question and so on and basically word their responses to parliamentary questions in a way which protects them from the truth. The late Mr. Justice Hamilton commented that if Ministers had answered questions clearly and truthfully and in their totality, there would have been no need to expend £35 million of taxpayers' money on the beef tribunal. That is the greatest insult to the intelligence of any nation.Why do we now have a section, the purpose of which is to provide a screen for the Minister to hide behind when asked to be accountable for his Department and budget and to follow through on that responsibility? I cannot figure out the argument that is being made. The only logical argument is that the Government wants to hide behind a revised form of the Freedom of Information Act. Is there any length to which it will not go to avoid the truth and dig holes in which to bury itself when people justifiably ask it to be accountable under the Freedom of Information Act? There is nothing flippant about this question.Another part of the legislation which is particularly worrying relates to charging for appeals. The appeals process was set up because of well grounded fears that in the absence of an appeals system the interpretation of the Act would always err on the side of a refusal, even to the point of refusing information where the Act made it crystal clear that it should be made available. That has been the experience in relation to access to information on environmental regulations. Here again, we have a system under which people will be charged for appeals. If that is not running for cover, I do not know what is.I know from recent debates that the Government does not receive constructive criticism very well. However, the Labour Party has produced its own Bill entitled the Freedom of Information (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2003. I earnestly request the Minister of State to go back and ask the Government to seriously consider the salient points in this Bill. I do not believe in being reactive in a situation like this. We are being proactive. That gives the Government no grounds for saying we are complaining but not coming up with any proposals. We have produced a Bill and would like to know what part of it interests the Minister. Is he favourably disposed to accepting constructive contributions from other Members of this House in order to at least lessen the damage inflicted upon a perfectly good Act which espoused the principles of democracy?It would be a pity if anyone believed the tripe expounded on the airwaves in recent days about the reason this legislation is being introduced. The reality is that the extent to which this Administration has gone in order to cover up its dealings defies logic. What, for example, will be the response if somebody wants to find out how much money the Taoiseach squandered on his pet project in Abbotstown? What will be the response if an application is made under the Freedom of Information Act for information as to what was behind the shady deal the Government cobbled up with the religious orders in a smoke-filled room one long night somewhere in Government Buildings which has exposed taxpayers to massive expenditure and untold litigation? Surely the ordinary people, Joe and Mary Soap, are entitled to access that information. Joe and Mary Soap would not strike a chord with this Administration because when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was introducing his budget – the one with two massive horns and a tail – he referred to Duncans, Áines, Chloes and Keiths, all modern day names, although it was to Tom, Mary and Joe whom Ministers used to refer. If further simplification is required, I will be more than happy to give it.There is an onus on us to find out who is responsible for driving this legislation, and I hope the Minister will tell us in his response. More important, was this legislation unofficially included in the programme for Government? We were given a commitment by the Leader of the House who, I believe, fervently believed her own answer when she told us there were no plans to begin tinkering with the Freedom of Information Act. We were told our fears were unfounded. One wonders at the speed at which this Bill has arrived and the relatively short notice given. It would lead any reasonable, thinking person to the conclusion that this was not an idea thought of one week ago or a month or two ago. One must, therefore, ask the Minister of State, who is here representing the Government, whether this legislation was unofficially included in the programme for Government.We are all aware that the dual mandate, although not in the programme for Government, was unofficially included in it. That, by extension, leads me to form the opinion that there is a whole raft of issues that the Government wishes to put through which would not be palatable in a democracy, certainly to the ordinary people who went to the polls last summer and voted on the basis of a plethora of lies from the Administration. How many members of the current Administration campaigned on the doorsteps in the general election, explaining the good points about democracy and trying to persuade people to exercise their democratic franchise while hidden up their sleeves was this lurid legislation which will do untold damage to the body politic and in no way reduce cynicism, increase public participation in the political system or encourage people to exercise the democratic franchise?In the past five or six years we have experienced tribunals and their effects in terms of cost and the tragic way in which the political system was abused. One saving grace and justification for expending millions of euro of taxpayers' money was that the public could hold up to a certain degree of light those responsible for this. While it is an unfortunate facet of any democracy, at least it was there and built in. It at least subscribes to the notion that people have a right to know, that they are entitled to ask questions and receive answers. It is incredible that the Government is now attempting to introduce a shroud of secrecy, of which any dictator would be proud. It is attempting to duck, dodge and hide from the questions and real issues which motivate people. It is a particularly sad day for an Administration elected mainly on two platforms, the prosperity of the economy which was a lie, and the small paddle boat being paddled by a few poodles whom we have since discovered were not particularly serious when they promised they would be the watchdogs of this Administration. I am very surprised that the Progressive Democrats have taken the stance they have on this issue. Senator O'Toole raised an important issue when he asked what their personal opinion would be if they were to make up their own minds on this issue. I believe it would be much different.History will not forgive Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats for this blatant act of democratic treachery. Any Government that has gone as far as this one in attempting to choke democracy should not and will not be looked on lightly.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I wish to address the direction democracy is taking in our society. I remember arriving in politics at a local democratic level in 1999. I was told at that time never to ask a question in the local chamber without first knowing the answer to it, which I may have done previously in my naiveté. The person who told me that was suggesting that the best tool in any political or democratic field is information. It is the biggest weapon and one of the most important instruments in the political system.Power is the exercise of control, influence and authority. Local democracy has to start at a grass roots level and that must include community involvement and participation by local people. In 1998-1999, people in this category felt they were outside the decision making process. This led to a situation where the Government began talking the language of local development groups, which was a positive development. The 2000 White Paper regarding the Government's vision of society spoke of the ability of the voluntary and community sector to provide channels for active involvement, and the participation of citizens in democracy. That is the language the community and voluntary sector heard from politicians and the Taoiseach at that time.The discussion of better local government, decentralisation, bringing power closer to the people, getting people involved and greater transparency in Government and local democracy was the language our society needed to hear. Prior to that, Irish society was hoodwinked by politicians. I have no problem saying that because politicians kept power and information for themselves; they told people they would provide medical cards and get grants for house extensions, and that they would deliver for them. The people, therefore, became dependent on politicians. That hoodwinking had a detrimental impact on our society prior to 1999 when the new use of language began.I commend the Taoiseach on his use of language and his vision in regard to the information society. He spoke of e-democracy, active citizenship and transparency through e-government. The latter was defined as electronic government, where people could access any information they wanted by computer. The Taoiseach believed that such a mechanism was the way forward for our society.That mechanism was not rocket science or novel thinking by the Government. It was a European model of regional democracy which came from countries such as Sweden, Denmark and Finland, which entered the European Union in 1995. Every country in Europe was talking about bringing power closer to citizens. That came from the active involvement of Fine Gael in European affairs. Such language was used by our ambassadors in Europe and has been brought to the fore in Ireland. Whether referring to better local government, local democracy, the devolution of power, regional government or regional autonomy, it was Fine Gael which brought such language to the State and it has been spoken from 1998 onwards.If anyone asks about Fine Gael policy, I answer that it was my party which introduced this language in its belief as part of its commitment to Europe. Fine Gael brought the language to this State but there is now a situation where this Bill is an obstacle to e-government. The Government does not want to give out information. On the one hand, it talks about the information society while, on the other, there is the iron curtain Senator O'Toole mentioned. I disagree with Senator O'Toole with regard to Deputy John Bruton's take on Government transparency, but I believe in the idea of a glass window in front of the officialdom that executes the decisions of the Oireachtas.Our system could have worked well if there had not been a fear about allowing people to access information. E-government was supposed to stand for electronic government and giving information to the people. The community and voluntary sector wants information to empower the people – Mr. Paolo Freire's language concerns empowerment – to take decisions on their own and take control of their lives. The "e" in e-government might as well stand for "Excalibur", King Arthur's magic sword. It is Excalibur government, where a sword has been stabbed in every vein of the community and voluntary sector, and of every local authority official who is working hard to bring electronic technology into our democratic process.Today is a dark day for democracy. I am not using tonight's debate in an opportunistic fashion but am a believer in information technology as a mechanism to bring power to the people. I do not believe in the hoodwink, or that we should tell people what they want to hear. We must be honest with the people and allow them to make decisions on their own. The Excalibur sword is stuck in the back of better local government reform. The confidence has been knocked out of the strategic policy committees. They and the county development boards are supposed to represent the community and voluntary sector. That sector is asking what the story is but it knows the answer – that there is too much power and information to be devolved, and that this Government does not want to relinquish that power. Why is there such fear? The Minister of State knows the answer to that question.If there is a move towards a peaceful settlement in Northern Ireland, a big part of that will be our trust in the people working North and South of the Border. While the ministerial cross-Border bodies come under this legislation, I am concerned in regard to the non-governmental cross-Border bodies which do not. We should have had an opportunity to consult and discuss the matter with these organisations before the legislation landed on our table today. There was much to talk about. Community groups are irate that they were not consulted. Were those involved in the Reach programme in the north-west consulted? They thought they had a green light from the Taoiseach to go ahead and implement their strategy. Now there is fear.This is the biggest scam in the short time I have been involved in politics since 1999. I believed in everything put on the table regarding local government, decentralisation and plans for four or five offices in County Donegal. The plans were brilliant. A citizen, from Malin Head or any little place in the north-west, would be able to come to a local office and access information. Society must evolve. As politicians, we like to control our base, perhaps in the interests of survival. Tonight while we have taken a step backwards, the opportunity is still there to bring the people on board. The consultative process has not happened. That is the reason there is genuine concern on this side of the House.I come from a community sector background where I spent time working with community groups, the voluntary and paid sectors. Perhaps I entered politics with idealistic notions that I could play a part in bringing power back to the people. Was I naive? How can this be turned around? Can the Minister instil me with any confidence or give me any feedback or reassurance that I can bring to community groups? We are trying to encourage, not just the voluntary and paid sectors which represent the citizen but also individual citizens to go and seek information from these offices. Will the Minister reassure me that they can do this? I have no great confidence that they can.Senator Minihan spoke but I know by his expression that he believes I am disingenuous in my attempts to highlight that we had the opportunity, through information technology, to bring the people with us and get them involved. We could have had a system, of which we could have been proud. This issue highlights the reason and rationale behind the Government's lack of industry, commitment and leadership in regard to the recent Nice treaty. It does not have confidence in the democratic process that occurs in each European Union country. Not every country believes in our hoodwink type politics. While I oppose this legislation and appreciate the opportunity to do so, I hope it is not too late.I thank the Minister for coming. It is a serious stumbling block that we appear to be returning to Iron Curtain days in regard to access to information. The Opposition has nothing to hide. What does the Government have to hide? While I do not believe it has anything to hide or is involved in skulduggery, there is a problem in regard to the use of power. When people are given power, they find it difficult to let it go. It is easy for me to say this, as a new politician, but we had the opportunity to allow people to empower themselves and change the way that we run the country. That opportunity has now been lost.Change comes slowly. Sometimes we are afraid of it. Perhaps the electorate did not seek change in the last general election for that reason. We must challenge the public to examine the reason it lacks belief in our political system. Tonight we are stuck in this Chamber at 11.30 p.m. trying to block legislation in which we have no confidence. We cannot understand the reason it is being shoved in our faces. The Government has missed a rare opportunity to say to the people that it will stand down, that it has listened to the Opposition and taken its concerns on board and that it is willing to consult. We will remember this night for the wrong reasons.The staff of the House have gone out of their way to stay working tonight. I thank and commend them. We are out and about and used to this lifestyle. In regard to computer technology, local authorities are seeking to ensure a filing of every politician's representations is recorded. Tonight is an opportunity for us to say what big eejits we are out till 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. Senator Moylan is an experienced politician and has done this all his life. This was never the normal 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. job. Perhaps we had an opportunity on this legislation to sell ourselves and point out that we are working seven days a week and sacrificing our lives and personal ambitions but we missed that opportunity also. What person or group of people would stay on for so long? It is commendable that they have done so and I congratulate them on it. I also congratulate the Government Senators who have decided to stay and are hopefully using this opportunity to listen to the concerns of this side of the House.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	552	I support the position of my colleagues on the Opposition benches. The Government is wrong to roll back on a modernising and reforming Act that has not been long in existence. It is mistaken in its intentions and there is great potential for a public backlash. The Bill will ultimately work against the Government's interests. I fully concur with the sentiments of Senator McHugh that the public will not take it well that powers that have been given to them are being revoked. The taking away of citizens' rights is a backward step and one that should never be taken by Government unless it is for the common good, which is not the case here. As other speakers have said, it is for the good of the Government parties, although not necessarily in the long term.Senator Quinn referred to it earlier as rolling back history and he is right. The Act that is being amended was internationally acknowledged as being good legislation. When it was being implemented there was a very considerate consultation procedure before the legislation was enacted. At the time, the Government tried to ensure that the mistakes of other countries' FOI legislation did not form part of ours.Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats appear to want to go back to old-style politics and that is the motivation behind the legislation. They are in Government for a second term and, as other speakers have said, are taking their position for granted. They are also taking the people for granted, particularly those who voted them into power. For all the Progressive Democrats have done to protect the public interest in regard to the Bill before us, there might as well be one-party Government.The Minister outlined how the provisions of the Act have been availed of and how it has changed the culture of the public service with the informal release of information. Why does the Government wish to roll it back considering the great success which it acknowledges it has been? It is not for the common good but for ulterior Government motives. The Government does not want criticism or to be politically embarrassed.I have been on South Dublin County Council since the local elections of 1999 and even in that time the council has totally changed in regard to its approach to dispensing information. It has become much more transparent and has involved the public more in consultation procedures, which is largely due to the change in culture brought about by the FOI legislation.I would have expected the Government to learn from the Nice referendum, particularly given that a second referendum had to be held. There was a new approach to the second referendum and the Forum on Europe was introduced to inform people better in regard to European issues. Information is vital in regard to getting people engaged in the political process. Providing information does not necessarily work against the Government's objectives as was evidenced in the passing of the referendum. Much of the information in regard to the referendum was of a complex nature but, on balance, people decided it was in their best interest to pass the referendum allowing for expansion of the European Union.As Senator Hayes said, debate is a good thing for democracy and we should not be afraid of it. We should welcome and encourage it and that includes the information that is behind Government decisions – information that will be restricted by the introduction of this amending legislation. The exclusion of people from information about the way Government operates will continue to disengage people from the political process. The people who lose out will ultimately be those in Government.The Taoiseach said in regard to volunteerism that there is a need to create a participatory democracy where active citizenship is the norm. The core principle of the White Paper was openness, accountability and transparency in order to provide access to information and to share it where it is relevant to the pursuit of common objectives. In the legislation before us the Government is doing the reverse – it is curtailing citizens' rights to access information. It is curtailing the right of the voluntary and community sector to information.When the legislation was enacted in 1998 it was said that the legislation would be a catalyst for profound and lasting change in our public service and it was the Government's intention to leave no stone unturned in ensuring that the necessary reforms would be carried out in all aspects of public administration. It was also said that the Act would enable members of the public to inform themselves as to the work of Government bodies, their processes, priorities and use of resources. How things have changed in the Bill before us.In April 2000, the then Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Cullen, said in the Seanad that the role of the media in using the provisions of the legislation was a good thing which would give rise to an informed and educated public. In much the same way, Deputies O'Donnell and McDaid suggested that the legislation did not go far enough. Deputy O'Donnell wished to see the introduction of criminal sanctions for public servants who did not comply with the legislation and Deputy McDaid wished the Official Secrets Act to be repealed.The deliberative processes provisions in section 13 are unbelievably broad. What issues are not the subjects of ongoing deliberations? It is the most far-reaching restriction in the Bill and could allow an Administration hostile to the release of information to label such information as relating to unresolved policy issues. The only avenue of appeal would lie with the High Court, which is an expensive option. This new procedure would allow material to be buried indefinitely if the matter is certified as ongoing.The Government has heralded that the proposed abolition of the dual mandate will bring new people into politics but I suggest that the effects of the FOI amendment will be to turn people off politics. It hides information and promotes governance as a one-sided affair. It therefore presents politics as a one-sided process instead of being about ideas and the exchange of information and debate. How can the Government say in truth that it wants to encourage greater participation in politics when it is reducing the information available to the public with the Bill, information that people need in order to be informed voters, unless in bringing in new people to politics it views them as rubber-stamps and election fodder and views the public as voting fodder in elections based on spin and propaganda?This Bill shows that the Government does not trust the people. Senator White advised that we should trust civil servants. What about trusting the people, the media and the community? The Bill does not do this. It is strange that a Senator who is so vocal in advocating the rights of some of our citizens in Colombia thinks we should hide information from our citizens in Ireland.The problems which have arisen regarding the legislation do not justify the provisions of the Bill. Such unilateral changes, without taking account of the views of all sides and all parties, are not acceptable. If there are problems with the legislation, they should be dealt with in the way proposed by the Labour Party. There should be a comprehensive review involving the Information Commissioner, the broader public and interested bodies.Charges will be a deterrent to those who wish to obtain information. In the light of the EU ruling on planning fees, it is amazing that the Government wants to introduce charges for freedom of information requests. Charges will deter poorer citizens and badly resourced voluntary and community groups from getting information. The Minister has said charges have been the exception rather than the rule. Surely this is because, in many cases, it was felt that charges should not be imposed which decision was taken by the public service body in the cases in question.The Minister has said democracy does not come cheap. The cost of spin is probably much greater. How many spin doctors are employed by Ministers? Information makes for a healthier democracy than spin. The Bill may be more damaging to the Government than the information it is trying to hide, unless there is something extraordinary about which it does not wish us to know. The Bill will be a bigger issue with the public than the Government has anticipated. Mr. Rick Snell, a leading Australian commentator currently visiting the UCC law faculty, recently expressed concern at the prospect of a public backlash to the heavy-handed approach of the Government.I thank everyone who has contributed to the debate, including the Minister and Ministers of State who have been present in the House. I also thank the staff for remaining here so late.
#PaulBradford	unknown-#PaulBradford-party	unknown-#PaulBradford-dob	unknown-#PaulBradford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I concur with what Senator Tuffy said about the staff and everyone who has assisted the continuation of this debate late into the night. During my previous term in the Seanad between 1987 and 1989 the only legislation debated into the early hours of the morning was the Bill which dealt with the abolition of the county committees of agriculture, a matter which would have taxed the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, in a previous incarnation. We ran the ACOT Bill until 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. and may do something similar tonight. On that occasion in 1988 we were dealing with a fundamental attack on rural Ireland. Tonight we are dealing with an issue of equal importance, an attack on the rights of the citizen.I have listened with interest to many of the contributions and hope the Minister of State and his colleagues are willing, at least, to consider the sentiments expressed on this side of the House. Many Members of the Opposition took part in the earlier debate on the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Senator Tuffy quoted some of what was said at the time by Opposition politicians, many of whom now sit in Government. The cry from many of them was that the legislation did not go far enough. While the Minister of State may be new to political debate in the Oireachtas, he knows how the system works. Views expressed in opposition can be reversed when a person reaches the Government benches. That is how politics always was and, perhaps, always will be. We must accept that some of those who now sit at the Cabinet table complained about the 1997 legislation not going far enough. Before they give full vent to political hypocrisy they should listen to what Opposition Senators are saying.Why are we having this debate now? What is the rush? This afternoon we heard an interesting contribution on the Convention on the Future of Europe from the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, who spoke to us about the importance of the full involvement of the citizen in debate, whether on European or domestic policy. We highlighted the fact that Ireland led the way in the involvement of the citizen in European policy making, whether through the Forum on Europe, the Convention on the Future of Europe or debates in the Oireachtas. A Member even asked how we could reconcile what we were attempting to do in the politics of Europe with this legislation.The Bill has been introduced by the Minister for Finance. I do not believe this is the type of legislation he would want to introduce. We all recollect his earlier political career as a backbench Government and Opposition Deputy in the late 1970s and early 1980s when he believed in calling a spade a spade. Now he is being forced, I suspect by the Taoiseach, to stick the spade deep into the soil. Who will benefit most from this legislation and pulling down the shutters on public information? The greatest beneficiary will be the Taoiseach, the person who did most to hoodwink the electorate in the long run-up to the general election last May. If politics is only a game, he succeeded in doing a marvelous job. He now seems to want to draw a curtain on that phase of his political career and move on, without letting the public reflect on what was done. I see no other reason this legislation should be introduced now.We are told that good governance must be considered. Since the Freedom of Information Act was passed the country has operated reasonably well, the economy has grown and the Government worked well enough to be re-elected. Why should this not continue? Why must we now start believing the method by which the Act was implemented was bad for government and the business of government? There is no evidence to suggest that this is the case.I would be the first to concede that it might be necessary to review the legislation, as promised by the Government which introduced it and agreed by everyone. Such a review should have been a detailed and lengthy process involving the appropriate Oireachtas committees, the Information Commissioner and the widest possible public consultation. Perfect legislation has never been passed in this House. I have no doubt that for all its merits the Freedom of Information Act was not perfect and, possibly, in need of review. The sudden rush not to review its workings but to throw out the baby with the bathwater is not wise or good politics.In recent weeks we have debated the whole issue of local government and local government reform. We have been asking for various debates on the issue of decentralisation and referred to the need to give power back to the people. Knowledge is surely the greatest source of power of all. If we believe in strong government, good politics, a strong Oireachtas, vibrant local government, engaging with the electorate as opposed to winning elections and a turnout at election time of 60%, 65% and 70% rather than 45% and 50%, the public must be involved in the decision making process. For it to be involved knowledge is part of the overall jigsaw.I do not suggest that passage of this Bill will suddenly change the world and that darkness will cover the earth. It is not as bad as that. Let us be real. However, it is a step in the wrong direction and sends out all the wrong signals in regard to what we are about in this House. From the Minister of State's perspective and that of his party, it sends out all the wrong signals about the overall direction of the Cabinet. It sends out a signal that the Taoiseach and Ministers are running scared of what they did or did not do, or what they promised or did not promise, in recent years. That is a bad start for the current term of the Oireachtas and the Government.To allow the people know where the Government stands, understand the economic situation facing various Ministers and Departments and the choices the Government debates, on which it presumably differs from time to time in proper political fashion, the release of information would not be disadvantageous to anybody. The more the shutters are pulled down on political debate and dialogue and the more we try to hide from the public the work of government, the worse it is for politics. Do we want a type of politics where the public is totally disengaged?Is the Minister of State aware that local elections in certain parts of Britain will take place in a few months' time? It is estimated that only 20% of the electorate will vote. That is an appalling vista of where democracy is going in Britain. That is what happens when the public loses faith in politicians and when it believes we are involved in a cover-up. While the Bill is not designed to be a cover-up, it is a step in the wrong direction.If there is a need to review the freedom of information legislation – this would not be inappropriate – it should be done in a considered fashion. What is being done here is the opposite. The Bill was mentioned on Wednesday or Thursday and published on Friday when we had all gone or were on the way home. Its first public ventilation was by the Minister of State on radio on Friday last as he struggled to make a good case for a Bill which is not good.

A few days later we are here at the midnight hour debating it. This does not make for good legislation or good politics. Will the Minister of State recognise that what is being said from the Opposition benches is at least as moderate as what his Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil colleagues said some years ago? We are attempting to have a debate about a matter of some substance and cannot be expected to tease out such important legislation over the course of a few hours, a few days after it has been published. It is bad politics which should not be encouraged in the Oireachtas. It is in everybody's interest that we practice the type of politics that will involve the public and encourage public debate and participation. This is a step in the wrong direction.I concur with those Opposition Senators and the Minister of State's Government colleagues who say that further time is required for reflection rather than rushing down the route of reversing what the Act offered. I readily concede that all the gains made under it will not be taken away but there will be substantial negatives. Why should we be afraid of allowing the public to ascertain how the country is run, learn the various ministerial positions on certain issues and see at first hand the various options, policy positions and policy papers put before various Ministers and Departments? We are all mature enough, as is the public, to recognise that Cabinet decisions are taken as a result of debate, dialogue and consensus. No one member of the Government believes he or she is always correct. The work of government is a valuable and vital part of democracy, yet we are trying to shut off public knowledge of its work. That is a retrograde step.That so many Members have indicated their desire to contribute to the debate shows how seriously we view the threat posed by what the Government intends to do. I hope the Minister of State and his colleagues will reflect on the Bill once again. It is a poor start to the next three or four years of office for them. It sends out all the wrong signals and presents a picture of a Government switching itself off from public opinion, hiding from public debate and covering up the decision-making process at a time when politicians are held in such low esteem by the public. I hope the Minister of State is willing to listen to us and respond to our views because the Freedom of Information Act was passed with the public good in mind. What we are trying to do is keep the public good to the fore.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	556	We are debating this Bill on the stroke of midnight. Nobody asked to be here. The Bill could have been taken any time because there is no rush. It could have been taken next year. A simple amending clause extending from five to six years the confidentiality of Cabinet papers would have been sufficient, if the Government was so worked up about that issue. The legislation could have been passed by this House and the Lower House in a day. We would probably have objected to it because we have a certain commitment to it. Instead, the Government decided to fillet the single biggest institutional change this country has seen in 20 years.We are here at midnight working our way through unnecessary legislation which is unwanted by most except a few members of the Government. I have listened to the lack of enthusiasm and I cite the particularly innocuous script delivered by the Minister for Finance, a man who has a wonderful reputation for coming before the House, throwing away scripts and engaging in debate. On this occasion, he came before the House, read his script and left. In my opinion, the Minister did so because – like Senators O'Rourke and Moylan – he does not believe in the legislation. One person in Government, the Taoiseach, believes in it because he has shown an incredible determination to avoid political accountability at all costs. He runs away from the Dáil at every opportunity. The reason we are here at midnight is because Deputy Bertie Ahern wants to end something which has, on occasions, made him feel uncomfortable but which has done his Government no harm. He was re-elected after all.We are here to debate a Bill which was conceived in secret. We did not know last June that a high level committee – I agree with Senator O'Rourke that this is a dreadful phrase – had been established. Almost as soon as the Government was beginning to break its promises, it set up a high level committee to review the legislation. We did not know about it until approximately three weeks ago when the information slipped out in the Dáil and the Taoiseach promptly said he would not tell us anything about it other than that he was somewhat concerned about the secrecy period of five years. We were led to believe that a few minor amendments were necessary to increase that period. The Taoiseach did not want the idea to get abroad that Cabinet papers relating to his time in Government would be made public while he was still in power. I do not know whether that means he expects to be gone from office in ten years. I expect him to be gone much sooner than that.We suddenly discovered that far more was happening. A report, conceived in secret, was drawn up to rationalise a particular party's determination to return to the world which it missed so much, namely, the world of sullen dark secrecy in which it could conduct its business. However, this type of behaviour does not go down well in modern Ireland so the Bill was presented to us at short notice. A Government which is concerned about the excessive levels of disclosure was able to withhold every scrap of evidence about the contents of the Bill until it saw fit to release it.There were no freedom of information requests or leaks which disclosed anything. The Government kept it under wraps and then announced it was worried about poor old civil servants. This is one of the extraordinary diversions about which Senator Mansergh, in particular, spoke. He stated that the purpose of the Bill is to protect poor old vulnerable civil servants who cannot speak for themselves. That is a particularly rich and unconvincing explanation and reflects an extraordinary level of priorities.This country is awash with legislation of a most offensive kind which should have been repealed years ago. It is legislation which, for example, describes people with learning disabilities as imbeciles and which any humane society would have repealed a long time ago. The legislation to which I refer has not been repealed because we do not have time to consider it, there are not sufficient numbers of parliamentary counsel to change it and we do not have parliamentary time to devote to it. As a result, we are obliged to live with this type of repulsive and revolting legislation and the vocabulary it contains. We can, however, rush through the legislation before us, which says something about the political priorities of the Government.I wish to relate some information to the House. In the coming months I will correct six projects, four of which will be long – containing approximately 20,000 to 30,000 words – and two of which will be short. My decisions and those of others like me in respect of such projects will determine peoples' futures. They will either pass or fail, obtain honours or not obtain them. Everything I write down will be open to scrutiny by the people over whose projects I adjudicate. Every decision and record will be my responsibility and will be a matter of public record. I am proud of that fact because I had a hand in changing the culture to ensure that this happened. The irony is that if I do something wrong, I can, and rightly so, be sued.I am a public servant with particular responsibilities and it is up to me to exercise these properly. However, I am then supposed to accept that there is a different class of public servant – involved in either politics or the public service – who is incapable of accepting responsibility for his or her own judgments, if they are to be seen in public, and who is inhibited in his or her actions. Am I supposed to believe that I correct examinations and mark projects differently and that everybody in the third level sector correcting examinations for 60,000 young people are inhibited in how they do their business because the students over whom they exercise authority can scrutinise their opinions, judgments, values, etc.? It is innocuous nonsense to suggest that this legislation has anything to do with the inhibition of a free expression of opinion. It might inhibit discussions on how one could help one's friends, but it is absolutely absurd to suggest that this country is apparently run by politicians assisted by civil servants who are afraid to write down an opinion because somebody else might see it.Last Saturday I listened to the ultimate shrinking violet, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, informing us that he would be inhibited from writing to his party leader to say he disagreed with some issue of Government policy if I, or some other lesser mortal, were to see the letter. This is a man who rambled the country for three years during a previous Fianna Fáil coalition expressing opinions about everybody, including his party leader, his party Ministers and, indeed, the entire major party in Government. He showed no inhibition or the slightest compunction. He again rambled the county after 1997 lecturing his party about what it was doing wrong. He left his party for a period and only returned when he was given a nice title. After six months in Government, he has suddenly lost his self-confidence. He cannot express his opinions anymore because he is afraid, embarrassed and uncomfortable and wants them kept under wraps. What a load of absolutely incorrigible, incredible and utterly self-defeating nonsense.There is something not too admirable about some of the people here trying to tell us that the problem is that civil servants are afraid to express their opinions. I have had the pleasure of the company of senior civil servants on many occasions, and one thing I know about them is that they are not in the least inhibited about expressing their opinions to me, a relatively insignificant member of the political system. It is ridiculous to suggest that people who have no compunction about having wonderfully lively, invigorating and fairly fundamental disagreements with me over a pint are afraid to write down their opinions and give them to Government because I might read them. Most of these people are more than happy to tell me what they think about me, about life, about everything. They do not suffer from inhibitions. These ideas are the product of a political culture, not the product of the Civil Service, and to suggest otherwise is an offensive nonsense which I hope the trade union which represents senior civil servants will demolish in the immediate future because it deserves to be demolished. This is a political measure, produced by a political party in cahoots with what used to be an independent party that has now become nothing more than a convenient adjunct of Fianna Fáil in order to do something that Fianna Fáil always wanted to do, which is to return us to the culture of secrecy.Let me briefly refer to the Minister's script which is quite extraordinary. I have been in and around this House for the best part of 20 years and know that when legislation is introduced for the first time, one of the things a Minister does is give the usual rhetorical flourishes before proceeding to a section by section discussion of the Bill. The Minister for Finance did not bother to do that. He made a collection of innocuous assertions based on nonsense to justify this Bill. I do not know whether it was contempt for the Seanad or for the idea he was trying to defend that was evident in his script in which he quoted the high-level group. I do not blame the high-level group. Civil servants do what they are told, what they are expected to do, because that is their role.The Taoiseach quoted with approval the high-level group's finding that the five-year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records was too short. I would argue about that. He also quoted the phrase, "It does not give Ministers the assurance that they require to commit views freely to the record if those views are to be divulged in such a relatively short space of time." The Minister is saying that the cream of our political talent, who have the support of one of the best civil services in Europe – which we see every time we have a Presidency – will not commit their views to paper because ordinary people, Members of this House or the public, would find out what they said in five years' time. What an insult to the political class of this country. If I were a member of a Government and a civil servant wrote that about me, I would hand it back to him and say it was insulting. It is profoundly insulting to suggest that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, with whom I have had delightful tangles in a previous existence as a member of the Committee on European Affairs, is inhibited from expressing his opinions because I might find out about them. Deputy Parlon was never slow to let me know his opinions and I suspect he never will be. If a civil servant wrote that about me, I would be insulted, as would any decent Minister. It is an insulting thing to say about Ministers unless the Ministers asked for something like that to be said to give them an excuse, a fig leaf to cover their nakedness or to justify the introduction of this legislation.We do not yet know much about this high-level group. Perhaps there are background papers and all sorts of other things.

We have a wonderful Information Commissioner, an impeccable civil servant with an impeccable history and integrity, but somehow he is not good enough. Governments or freedom of information officers might refuse access to information on the grounds that the documents are Government documents and the Information Commissioner might look at them if such a decision were appealed. The implication is that this would not be a good idea. It was decided to clarify matters by handing the power over to somebody who has a vested interest in doing what the Government wants, namely, the Secretary General of a Department whose primary job is to look after the Government. To pretend that this is an advance when it is the most shameful retreat from independent adjudication is disgraceful. That was done not because they are afraid of having their opinions per se released – I know none of them is afraid of that – but because they are afraid that what they are at will be exposed to the light of day. This is where the whole thing is so suspicious. When a political party which is being investigated by so many of its members and by so many tribunals about so much corruption suddenly retreats back into darkness and obscurity, everybody is entitled to believe, particularly when the arguments in favour of what they want to do are such manifest nonsense, that they have something to cover up and that they want to cover it up.The Minister's script goes on with a pathetic reference to an extraordinary exception where costs run to multiples of thousands of euro. That was a failure of Government. That sort of abuse of the Act would have been dealt with by a Government that had any commitment or capacity to manage its own affairs. Instead of managing its affairs, it has decided to change the law. It is like shooting the messenger if one does not like the message. The Minister's script continued in that vein. However, I do not want to spend too much time on it because it is hardly worth it. Why does the Government not trust the Information Commissioner? What is wrong with him? Is it that he is honest?

The Information Commissioner makes decisions according to the law and the sky has not fallen in yet. However, Fianna Fáil, with the scandalous capitulation of the minority party in Government, does not want any independent figure to judge its behaviour so it runs away at every stage. That is what this Bill is about. The Minister's speech reminds me of what a Christian Brother once said before he walloped me. He said "for fear you would and in case you might". That is what this is all about. For fear of and in case something might be disclosed, we will make sure nothing can be disclosed. That is what is going on here.I grew up in a country which was cursed by secrecy. I was here in the 1980s when a secretive, corrupt Fianna Fáil Party ruptured.

I was here when Fianna Fáil ruptured and Deputies Des O'Malley, Mary Harney, Pearse Wyse and Bobby Molloy left and founded the Progressive Democrats because they could not stick it any longer. They were right to do so. They said that the job of the Progressive Democrats was to bring decency into a political system that had been almost destroyed by the rottenness of Fianna Fáil. Now the party founded by those decent people is colluding with Fianna Fáil to return us to the culture from which it claimed it would rescue us. It is the ultimate irony.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	565	I note that the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is back for a second shift. I do not suppose the Minister for Finance will be back as he left so quickly after giving his speech this afternoon.When the Freedom of Information Act was passed in 1998, it strengthened citizens' rights and won this country great respect abroad. From a check of Dáil records, I note that at that time Fianna Fáil said that the Act did not go far enough and that it took a minimalist approach. However, Deputy Liz O'Donnell for the Progressive Democrats said that she could not foresee any Government letting sensitive information out if it meant saving its own skin. How right she was. Only five years have elapsed and the same Government – Fianna Fáil supported by the Progressive Democrats – is attempting to stifle information.When the Act was passed, it was a clear statement that we had nothing to fear from a system of accountability, openness and transparency, following decades of secrecy which assisted corruption to fester and prosper in this country. The Act proved a vital tool for citizens to vindicate their rights and hold the Government to account. The proposals included in this Bill are an attempt to seriously undermine the principles of the Act, and will significantly weaken it if the Government has its way.These proposals are to be rammed through with undue haste. No matter what the Government parties may say, this is an unprecedented attempt to push through a Bill which many Members of this House only received copies of when they returned to their offices this morning. Many Members have asked why there is such a rush to push through this Bill and why it cannot be introduced next week. It is because it might clash with the Cheltenham races which are clearly more important to the Minister than the accountability of this Government to the people.The Information Commissioner is currently formulating a review of how the Act is working and he has stated that he will report on that by next week. Is the Government prepared to wait one week to listen to what the Information Commissioner has to say? It seems it is not. The secretary of the National Union of Journalists asked, "How can we believe commitments about social and economic reforms when the rights of citizens are trampled upon in such an arrogant fashion?" Arrogance is what we are treated to on an increasing number of issues that come before this House. All Members of the Opposition opposed vigorously today's Order of Business in an attempt to halt the gallop of this Bill and to afford Members the opportunity to consult and enter dialogue with interested parties, so that their views on the Bill could be obtained.The unity of purpose shown by the Government parties and the speed with which this Bill is to be rammed through brings into question the reasons why these fundamental changes to the Freedom of Information Act are to be introduced. Is the Government embarrassed at some of the stories journalists have rooted out such as the Minister for Health and Children spending €500,000 on renovating his office at a time when patients are suffering and only emergency operations are carried out in some hospitals, as is the case in Waterford Regional Hospital? Are stories about the amount of money spent on photographers, public relations people and spin doctors for Ministers embarrassing the Government? Does the Government not want similar information published in the years ahead? I trust that, as substantive policy issues become more difficult for journalists to explore, they will be even more likely to probe such information.I wish to address the lack of consultation prior to the Bill's publication. The Information Commissioner, the NUJ and the voluntary and community organisations throughout the country were not consulted. Nobody was consulted and it was left to the senior civil servants involved to look into their hearts to decide what was best for them and the Government, and not what was best for the citizens who yearn for openness and accountable Government. I have the utmost respect for civil servants but I am unhappy that such radical change to our laws should be made purely on the basis of consultation between a number of senior public servants and their respective Ministers. It is necessary at all times to undertake a wider consultation process before any legislation is debated by the Oireachtas.The repeal of sections of the Freedom of Information Act will only add to the public cynicism about politics and politicians which has already led to falling numbers of people voting and becoming involved in our democratic process. That obviously does not matter to a Government concerned only with avoiding embarrassing revelations of the truth about its activities.The Minister in his speech was at pains to outline that the Act was extended to universities, health boards, local authorities and other bodies. I welcome that, but what is good for the goose should be good for the gander. At some of the tribunals, great play is made of councillors who voted against the advice of their officials. It was correct that this advice was available to be placed in the public arena. However, that must be contrasted with the provisions in this Bill which exclude or provide exemptions for briefing notes which assist the Cabinet in its deliberations. The Government is practising what I will call George Orwell politics – all politicians and public servants are equal, but some are more equal than others.Requests to obtain correspondence between Ministers will also be refused in future which will prevent the revelation of more embarrassing exchanges such as those between the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Health and Children which were published last year. The Government feels that what the public does not know does not trouble it.The Minister stated that the honourable intentions of the Freedom of Information Act could be abused by cranks and that it could cost a fortune to provide the information requested by them. However, this problem could be solved simply by invoking section 10 which allows for freedom of information officers to reject a request if they find it frivolous or vexatious. Why was this provision not used more often if we had frivolous and vexatious demands by cranks, as suggested by the Minister?On 21 April, Cabinet papers presented before January 1998 are due to be released to the public in some instances. However, if this Bill is passed this will not be possible for another five years. What have the two parties in Government to hide? There is not a whisper from the self-proclaimed guardians of public interest in the Progressive Democrats. The PD watchdog must be barking at a frequency at which only its fellow pack members in Fianna Fáil can hear because the electorate has heard nothing from it regarding issues such as spiralling crime and proposed increases in third level fees.This Bill may afford the Progressive Democrats the luxury of saying that they opposed certain items in Cabinet but they will have no way to confirm that that was their stance under the Freedom of Information Act. My party will oppose this Bill vigorously at every possible opportunity, using every parliamentary mechanism to defend the existing Act. We will press the issue convincingly, comprehensively and cogently on every Stage to ensure the Government is not sheltered in any way from the critical gaze of the public.Many Senators have stated that this is a sad day for democracy. It certainly is when one sees Government parties putting forward legislation such as this, which nobody requires or has demanded. It demonstrates that their priority is to stay in power for as long as possible and to hide any embarrassing items from the public. That is what this Bill is about and the Opposition will do everything it can to oppose the Government in its efforts to deny people access to the information to which they are entitled.The Government is taking a regressive step and we will do everything possible to highlight its inadequacies and let the people know about the false promises that were made prior to the election. As has been stated, there was not one word in the programme for Government about introducing this Bill and no reference to cuts, hidden or otherwise. There was no reference to any Bills being introduced without advance notice and this is the first Bill to come before us that falls into this category. Are we to have many more? It is like turning back the tide to Iron Curtain days because information is being suppressed.It is sad to say that this type of legislation is being foisted upon us by the Government in 2003. It is an absolute shame and a negation of democracy. We are disgusted that we are here at this hour of the morning debating a Bill. We could, if the Government had taken the matter seriously, discussed it for a few hours tomorrow. This would not have been a problem for any of the Members, including members of Fianna Fáil to whom I have spoken. However, the Government is intent on ramming this Bill through, at whatever hour of the morning pleases it. I hope people will ask frequently what the Government has done and what it has to hide.

There was an element of gombeenism which I disliked. Gombeen men used to enter my town wearing Crombie coats and used to tell me what a great town it was and what a great business I had. They used to make loads of promises during election campaigns and when they were over, they disappeared. However, they always returned before the next general election and I was a fool because I was taken in by them.I wonder if we are now going back to that closed society of nods, winks and gombeenism. I do not want to do so. I was elected in 1999 and believe I was elected to make a difference. Respecting the electorate's desire for honesty and integrity, I am thankful that the first time I had to use the Freedom of Information Act was last year. I had to use it when I tried to play ball with the Government. Three years ago the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, said he would decentralise 10,000 jobs to areas that previously had none. Roscommon County Council drew up a proposal and spent many hours outlining why Roscommon should benefit from decentralisation but, to date, not one job has been created through this process.Two years ago, the Department of Social and Family Affairs was allocating 100 jobs to Sligo. However, I knew that it had no office space in the town. I asked the Government representatives of the day to locate the jobs in my town of Boyle because we had an office and told them it would be much cheaper.

I play my politics by giving credit where it is due. Unfortunately, not one telephone call was made to the Minister and the jobs were created in an office in Sligo town which has no car parking facilities and which costs the Exchequer three times more than it would in Boyle. I had to use the Freedom of Information Act to access the information I sought which made me see how this Government was squandering money. Jobs were not being created and I used the Act to highlight the manner in which my constituency had been undermined and left out.The legislation was originally proposed in the Fianna Fáil and Labour Party programme for Government in 1992 and the rainbow coalition of 1995 to 1997, led by Fianna Gael, brought it to fruition. The Fianna Fáil Opposition did not dispute its introduction, but took the view that the legislation was fair. I reviewed the debates on the original legislation and I would like to cite Deputy McDaid, if I may name names.

That is at odds with his claim to be at the grassroots.

That she is a prophet can be seen from the fact that her words have come true.

The Government she and her party are members of is amending the legislation five years later to deny the people an informed view of the thinking behind its policies. The Government fears accountability and transparency, concepts I am sick of hearing its members refer to.One of the most objectionable aspects of the Bill is the view on which it is based. The Government's deliberations took place in secret without the input of Kevin Murphy, the Information Commissioner, who has statutory responsibility to enforce the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act. The review group was composed of five Secretaries General, which makes it sound like an Argentine junta. These are the people who led with regard to the legislation before the House.

This is a back-stairs exercise and an assault on the spirit of openness and transparency of the original Act.During 2001, 15,428 freedom of information requests were made to an ever expanding list of public bodies.

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	585	There was an increase of 12.4% on the 2000 figures and of 34% since the figures submitted in 1999. Despite the public perception, only 3,123 of those 15,428 applications were from the media and that represented an increase of 23% from the previous year. What is there to worry about when ordinary citizens request information? On occasion, requests were turned down, but the information was always leaked somehow.There have been clear instances of use of the Freedom of Information Act to further the agendas of Government Departments. Last week, The Irish Times made an FOI request regarding speeding offences by Ministers and we must ask if that has influenced the decision to amend the legislation. Plans to restrict the Freedom of Information Act pose a serious threat to openness and transparency.In response to questions in the Dáil, the Taoiseach stated that the five year rule was impracticable and dangerous as it could lead to the release of information relating to the Belfast Agreement negotiating papers. The restrictions on papers relating to security and Northern Ireland provided for in the existing Act mean that could not happen.We should note in our deliberations on these matters the Canadian review of its legislative provisions in this area. The Canadians ensured consultations with all stakeholders and we should do the same. Among those who should have been involved are the Office of the Information Commissioner, the freedom of information central policy unit and the freedom of information citizen and business advisory groups which were established by the Department of Finance to provide feedback on the operation of the legislation.

I take that role seriously and I represent the people enthusiastically. I was nominated by the Irish Kidney Association and I spent a great deal of time researching the Health Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2003, which I concluded was fine legislation. The World Health Organisation has praised our health insurance system. Members on the Government side have asked why we are opposing the legislative amendment before the House tonight when we did not oppose the Health Insurance Bill, but it is ridiculous to claim it is because we are weak. I want to ensure that useful Bills are passed by acknowledging them as such, but if I see poor legislation before the House, I will point it out. It is not my intention to score political points, but the statement to the effect that the Opposition is weak got my blood boiling. It was wrong to make it.

#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The introduction of the Freedom of Information Act should have been staggered and the ten year rule might not be a bad idea. It would be preferable if everybody had an opportunity to take a year out in order to consult the various bodies involved, but, instead, the legislation is being pushed through. That is something with which I do not agree.Years ago the principal of my school was going to a meeting where difficult questions were expected to be asked. When I asked what he intended to do he said that he would give those posing questions the mushroom treatment, namely, keep them in the dark and fill them full of "you know what". The Government is not treating this country in the way a democracy should be treated. It is applying the mushroom farm principle by keeping everybody in the dark and piling on the "you know what".In the past only a certain number of privileged people had access to information, which was the key to everything. Every small town and village had a self-appointed leader who had the ear of the county manager, the local politician or the local clergy. I grew up in that era and I do not want to see it return. Everyone, not just politicians and the leaders of business, should be able to gain access to information.I am aware that some Members on the other side of the House oppose the Bill, but I also know that when the vote is called they will vote in favour of it. This new amendment to the Act will not be enacted until April, so I call on every citizen to use the existing legislation on freedom of information until then. Everybody should request details under the Freedom of Information Act on any aspect of Government policy or action which they believe is wrong. I will be requesting information on how this amendment was drafted and what consultation was involved. I will expect satisfactory replies which I can use in the future.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I wonder what it will take to elicit a further response from the Government side of the House? We have had three Fianna Fáil contributions and two from the Progressive Democrats. Senator Mansergh for Fianna Fáil expressed many reservations about the Bill. He commented that this proposal will increase the secrecy period from five to ten years and that the next Fianna Fáil Government would probably extend it to 15 years. He is obviously not very enamoured of the contents of the Bill. Senator Maurice Hayes clearly and openly said that he had many reservations about it, while Senator Mary White said that it is not necessary to have any freedom of information.Senator Dardis stated that the Opposition had no contribution to make. On reflection, his contribution was nothing more than a rehash of Deputy Michael McDowell's attack in the Dáil during a debate on a Fine Gael Private Members' motion. In making his contribution, Senator Minihan displayed arrogance in the extreme.There is only one sentence of explanation provided in the explanatory memorandum to the Bill but there are five pages of arrangements, which is, I believe, unprecedented. After decades of secrecy, we must see the Bill in its true context. In 1997 we could get information under the Freedom of Information Act about what had been happening in Government over the years. Now it seems that the current Administration can no longer tolerate the intrusion of the media. I compliment the media in its use of freedom of information.Over the years each Minister in turn has failed to respond to legitimate questions and to give the necessary answers. They concealed the truth in those answers.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	610	I wish to refer to an incident of a kind with which the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will be familiar. I made representations on a REPS application to the Minister for Agriculture and Food during the previous Government's term. I asked about 20 questions in various ways in order to extract a certain amount of information, but I failed in that regard. I had to resort to the Freedom of Information Act to request access to the file. I was eventually given the file and it was incomplete. I knew this was the case because some letters I had written to the Department officials and to the Minister were missing. I complained to the Minister and I re-applied for the complete file but I was again given another incomplete file. On this occasion some of the letters that were missing from the first file were included in the second file and vice versa. One of the letters had a comment written on it by a senior official of the Department who is well known to the Minister of State because he encountered him when he jumped on the bandwagon in respect of the recent farmers' protest. The officer challenged the Minister of State in regard to the credibility with which he participated in the campaign. The officer wrote on the file, which was available in the Department of Agriculture and Food, that there should be no reply to the former Deputy Burke on the question. They are the facts of the matter. If Senator Daly can refute that, I will yield to another point of order from him.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	612	The Bill is designed to conceal and muffle in whatever way possible information that would embarrass the Minister of State who said that transparency and accountability were the most important traits he would bring to his party and the Government. I refer him to the statement made tonight on the plinth by the Tánaiste – I will not repeat it – which indicates where the sincerity lies. He may not be aware of the statement and should ask the Tánaiste about it.On the Government's coming into power, the media immediately became suspicious of many of the events which took place during the lifetime of the previous Government and during the run-up to the election. It was clear to the media that it would get answers under the Freedom of Information Act, whereas TDs and others had failed to do so. Since then there has been revelation after revelation, which has clearly upset the Government, so it rushed to stop it. We want to delay the legislation in order to get the information which is still within Government but which is not available to the public. The public, the NUJ and the Information Commissioner have been excluded from these consultations. The fear of the Government about some of the revelations that may come to light may make it impossible for it to continue. It wants to remain in power and ride out the tide of the current difficulties and it hopes better days will emerge. We all look forward to better days but I hope the Government will not be in a position to ride out the current difficulties because the people have yet to answer. They will answer in the local elections in a year's time and in the European elections. It is only then the Government may get an opportunity to reconsider the issue.The membership of the body makes interesting reading. It includes Mr. Dermot McCarthy, General Secretary to the Government, Mr. Paul Haran, Secretary General, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Miss Julie O'Neill, Department of Transport, Mr. Dermot Gallagher, Department of Foreign Affairs and Mr. Eddie O'Sullivan, Department of Finance, a combination of people who are hyper-sensitive to what may come from the Department of Finance, on the one hand, and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, on the other. Unfortunately, there is no representative from the Department of Health and Children. If we could see the exchange of views, whether written or oral, between the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, it would put the public at ease. The vibes and tension between the two Ministers in regard to the allocation of funding were there for everyone to see without written scripts to prove it.

Why are they all missing? I accept that the Leader contributed. I gather from the contributions of others that they are not satisfied with the legislation. The legislation has sent reeling every group with an interest in freedom of and access to information. The criticisms emanating from reasonable people must be noted by the Government. If it intends to proceed with the haste with which it began on this occasion, everyone will know it is hiding something and that it will continue to do so.I will conclude by giving one more example which clearly indicates that without the Freedom of Information Act people would be at a very serious loss. A psychiatric patient living in the Mid-Western Health Board area, who was treated by a consultant for a long period, left the jurisdiction of that health board and went to live for a time in the Western Health Board area where satisfactory treatment was received. When the patient was sufficiently well and asked for the file to which he or she was entitled principally to find out whether the original consultant was still charging fees, access to the information was not provided by the Mid-Western Health Board. The file was likewise suppressed by the Western Health Board. It was only through court proceedings that the person eventually gained access to the file.A Minister in the previous Administration directed by regulation that access to information under the terms of the Act could be widened in certain instances. For example, relatives of deceased persons and parents of handicapped persons could access information. This must be contrasted with the attempt by the former Minister for Education and Science to deny a family its right to secure an education for their child with special needs to the point where it had to have recourse to the courts. It is a disgrace that the Bill provides that certain files may not be accessible for a period of up to ten years.This legislation will bring shame to the country, which was applauded for the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act in 1997. The Government wants to abuse that legislation to cover for its inadequacies and the shenanigans in which it engages. I hope this House and the Lower House will use all the means at their disposal to express their indignation at the manner in which the Bill has been introduced and the way the Government intends to process it.

It is outrageous. The last four contributions have been made by Fine Gael Members. Members of the Fianna Fáil Party appear to have lost their tongues. We were elected to the Seanad to voice concerns about legislation, but Members on the Government side are failing in this task.It is clear that the Government is concerned about the way the use of the Act is damaging its reputation. Last weekend, the Sunday Independent obtained information under the Act regarding the expenditure of €500,000 on the refurbishment of the Minister's office at the Department of Health and Children in the same week that 20 patients waiting for dialysis treatment encountered severe difficulties in some Dublin hospitals. It has also been revealed that the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, is planning to sell the family silver to make up for shortfalls in other areas. It is proposed to sell some State owned properties.

Earlier tonight, I researched the debate on the Freedom of Information Act. Deputy O'Donnell spoke of her regret that the Official Secrets Act had not been repealed when the original legislation was being passed. She said there was little point in announcing a principle of openness and access to information if everything sensitive to the authorities can be excluded by way of exemption. Deputy Woods complained that the Bill would maintain the culture of secrecy within the public service, while Senator Liam Fitzgerald said Departments were presided over by Ministers who deliberately and blatantly refused access to information. Those views were expressed only five years ago.I agree with the description of the Bill as being the work of a select group of civil servants, who worked behind closed doors and consulted nobody. The Ombudsman and Information Commissioner were not consulted, nor was the NUJ. The Bill will grant extraordinary powers to senior civil servants and constrain the role of the Information Commissioner.The Bill was produced with undue haste. It was agreed by the Cabinet last Tuesday and only published on Friday, but many Senators did not receive it until they arrived at the Chamber today. It never arrived at my office. This Second Stage debate is being held at a ludicrous hour, when most citizens, as should be the case, are asleep, and Committee Stage will be rammed through the House next week.

#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	633	The proposal regarding the exemption of the records of Cabinet deliberations is outrageous, particularly when the public depends on information leaked to the newspapers. The Government is expert at leaking information, especially against its own members. Senator Maurice Hayes referred to this. It is embarrassing that when the Government is concerned about concealing information, it engages in selective leaks. For example, the rail review strategy is three months overdue, but every so often the newspapers publish snippets of information on its progress. It demeans democracy and the House.I grew up in a culture of tribunals, which were created to address the problems created by secrecy and gombeenism. I hope we can move away from that. I am struck by the hypocrisy of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. During the general election campaign, he climbed ladders to warn against the dangers of one party Government, but he has yet to come down to earth since taking up office. He is now proposing a curtailment of the work of the tribunals and acknowledges that they are a huge expense for taxpayers. At the same time, he wants to amend the Freedom of Information Act. There is an inconsistency here. If we want to create the circumstances where future tribunals are unnecessary, it is important to provide information to citizens as they request it.Freedom of information originated from the idea that there was a need for transparency, openness, accountability and inclusiveness. It was pointed out by previous speakers that section 10 provides that people can refuse to give extra information in cases where unreasonable requests are made by the same, or different, people. Therefore the origin of the Bill is no longer justified.People in the voluntary sector are worried by the proposed changes. They feel that it flies in the face of the White Paper on Supporting Voluntary Activity which was only published in September 2000. The Government at the time, which was of almost the same composition as the present one, acknowledged the need to create a participatory democracy where active citizenship is the norm. It acknowledged also that voluntary activity is a vital element of democracy and that a strong democracy enhances and protects the capacity of citizens to participate. Under this legislation the Government's plan to curtail citizens' access to information will directly undermine its stated desire to create a more participatory democracy where active citizenship is fostered.I appeal to the Leader, who is an experienced politician, to see sense and postpone the debate for now and allow further speakers, especially from the Government side who seem to have disappeared or lost their voices—

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	639	It just goes to show how seriously we are treating the issue. The publication of this Bill is a sad day for democracy and for Irish politics. It denies people the rights they had under the 1997 legislation to get the information they seek without hindrance.The words "openness, transparency, accountability and for the public good" have been used in regard to the Progressive Democrats. Fianna Fáil also aspires to these values. I cannot see how these words fit in with this Bill. Words that fit better are "secrecy, arrogance, lacking credibility and bringing politics into disrepute". For the past couple of years we have tried to improve the image of politics and politicians. This legislation does nothing to serve politics.This Bill promotes the suppression of information instead of freedom of information. The Government is there to represent and work for the people and to provide them with the information they need. This Bill is a step backwards. The 1997 legislation was excellent. Perhaps it needed to be reviewed but that should have been done in consultation with everybody concerned. This Bill does not follow a review after a consultation process but is presented as a fait accompli. That is not how we want to do business or how business is done in general.It is a shame in the first place that we had to bring in the Freedom of Information Act 1997. That Bill was necessary because people could not get the information they needed. In cases where an individual looks for information, from a Minister, a Department, a chief executive officer or whoever is in charge, and that information is not forthcoming, the 1997 Act comes into play. If information was given out freely we would not have had to introduce that Act.This Government has found the 1997 Act troublesome. It feared it and found it a nuisance because it meant the Government had to supply information. We are talking now about the Government from the top down rather than the bottom up. I do not understand why all of these amendments are being introduced. Vexatious claims were mentioned but there were very few of those. Any that there were could have been dealt with on an individual basis. Could this legislation be a cost-cutting exercise? The process did cost money but it costs money to deliver any service. I believe this is the reason for this legislation which is another cost cutting exercise. It denies the public the right to the information that they deserve.The imposition of fees for information is another aspect of the Bill which I abhor. It reminds me of the fee imposed on those who wish to lodge an objection to a planning application. That fee was brought in by the previous Government which involved the same two political parties. The fee made it difficult for certain individuals, who wished to make their views known or to have them put on the record, to lodge objections.

As far as I am concerned we are dealing with further stealth taxes.Another serious aspect of the legislation concerns the release of Cabinet information after a period of ten years rather than five. There may not be much difference but is this being introduced so that the present Government will not have to release information which would have been available to us under the previous Act? If this Government were not in power we might consider ten years a fair length of time but I question why this is being changed at this point in time.The 1997 Act served the people and operated in their interest and for their good. This new Bill will not do that. I ask those on the Government side to consider this. The number of amendments in the new Bill will make a mockery of what we believe freedom of information should be about. I oppose the Bill.

No thanks!" In spite of this, one party Government appears to be a reality. The Progressive Democrats have been shown to be redundant. It is a joyous day for politics that this has occurred.I can remember a few years ago when the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, was in the wilderness.

There was a very interesting statement by Deputy O'Dea, now Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He was once famously described as Mighty Mouse in Limerick and a church mouse in Dublin. He was most vociferous in speaking on the FOI legislation and actually said it did not go half far enough. His silence in regard to the amending legislation speaks volumes, as does the silence of Government Senators.I do not have any problem being here at 1.30 a.m., although there are many places I would prefer to be. It is an exercise in parliamentary democracy for us to express our strongly held views on this regressive legislation. As someone who is new to politics and has not used the FOI Act up to now, I have been struck by the number who have been in contact with me in recent days to express their serious concern in regard to this issue. As Senator Feighan said, while it is an issue that affects journalists, the vast majority looking for information are ordinary Joe Soaps who are most concerned about the amendment to the legislation.

Fine Gael opposed this move vehemently. I also strongly object to the possible introduction of a fee in order to get information under the FOI Act which should be provided free of charge. It is a retrograde step to ask people to pay.I was taken aback by the comments of Senator White. Perhaps she did realise what she was saying when she said she did not believe in freedom of information.

The programme which was launched in 1999 stated there should be adequate consultation with interested parties before new legislation was introduced. That is a statement and a half which ranks with the pre-election statements to the effect that there would not be any cutbacks about which I spoke previously. What consultation did we have on this issue?I have the utmost respect for the Secretaries General faced with the task of bringing forward proposals for change to the Freedom of Information Act. Senators have already stated how unfortunate it is that Ministers appear to be hiding behind these five civil servants and letting them take the blame for the legislation before us. It is the Government which is to blame. The Taoiseach's broken promise in this regard can be added to the list of broken promises that have emerged since the general election. I wonder what will be next.One issue of particular interest to me is that of Sports Campus Ireland. I cannot help but feel that another reason for delaying the publication of Government information for longer than five years is to prevent potential embarrassing revelations regarding this project.

It was tremendously politically embarrassing to the Government. This legislation is an attempt to avoid further embarrassment. A previous speaker referred to Deputy O'Donnell's statement in 1997 that Governments would not disclose information which would be embarrassing. Perhaps she was correct and that is the reason she is supporting the legislation as I presume she is. I look forward to her not supporting it because if she is to stick to what she said, she should not be supportive of it.The Progressive Democrats call their party a liberal one. They are aligned to the Liberal group in the European Parliament. What would the other Liberal parties in Europe think of this legislation?

The Information Commissioner is the one charged with responsibility for the Freedom of Information Act. It beggars belief that the Government did not consult him before publishing the Bill. Likewise, it is ridiculous that there was no consultation with the NUJ when journalists make up the single biggest FOI user group.

I can understand that it would be embarrassing for them to speak on this issue.The Bill will allow a State organisation to refuse an application if it would impose a substantial and unreasonable interference on its work. The current legislation provides that frivolous requests need not be dealt with. How is the word "unreasonable" to be defined? People have a right to information. On the Order of Business I can seek a response from a Minister on a particular matter or a member of the public can seek information under the Freedom of Information Act. Who is to judge whether something is unreasonable? This is certainly open to misinterpretation. I do not agree with this provision.This is ill-thought out and rushed legislation. Although it is vitally important, the explanatory memorandum consists of only two or three lines. The Bill is being rushed through in an unseemly manner. I am sorry to see the attitude the Government has adopted and, with my colleagues, will oppose it at every turn.

This morning we will further advance a subversive Bill designed to cover up the mistakes of this and the previous Government in the past six years. When I hear from my colleagues on the Government benches that this Bill was created to further the public interest, I wonder when increased cynicism and distrust of public officials became such an important part of the public interest. More than this, I wonder when they became so crucial that they must subvert even the normal political process which governs the actions of this House. Senators on all sides did not have time to consult on the Bill, to adequately prepare for the debate or to contemplate all of its negative consequences. Some Senators, of whom I am one, only received a copy of this convoluted legislation today. Had I not gone home this evening I would not have received it even then.

#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	711	The hour is late. I will get the Leader another time.This Bill is not in the interests of the people or the civic spirit of the country which will suffer as a result. The honesty and integrity of government are critical to maintaining the faith of the people it serves. Experience has shown that this is best achieved through relative transparency and ease of access. Experience has also shown that these ideas are foreign to the Government. This explains the Bill which is before us today. The Government wants to cover things up.Government, in all its forms, has a tremendous impact on the people. As elected representatives, we know this only too well. Every day we hear from people who are having problems with interacting with or receiving information from the Government and who need our help. These are not small problems. Government decisions control access to health care, housing, planning and social welfare and plunge agriculture into crisis. People's lives are affected in a very real way by what the Government does and how it does it. The least people deserve is to be able to learn and understand. If we were doing our jobs correctly and operating with the public interest at heart, we would have nothing to fear by helping them achieve this goal.In terms of transparency, the Bill's implications are clear. There is no doubt that certain information must remain confidential to the Government and I do not believe any Member would argue otherwise. In addition, I do not believe anyone would argue that, as time passes, changes to the Act will be necessary. We must make the process as streamlined as possible in order to allow relevant information to be practically dispensed and give the Government the freedom to operate in the public interest and help protect the policy of those in the public and private sectors. One would think that the best way to do so would be to spend reasonable time conferring with the person most directly concerned, namely, the Information Commissioner, Mr. Murphy. The first thing any normal parliament or Government would do would be to consult the Information Commissioner. However, the Government did not deem it necessary to do so.I wish to quote from a statement the Information Commissioner made in respect of the Freedom of Information Act, which is relevant to the Bill before us. He said:I am fully satisfied that the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act as they stand are more than sufficient to protect all of the essential interests of Government. Nothing in the operation of the FOI, bar the odd accident, suggests otherwise.How can the Information Commissioner's exclusion from the process be justified? If he is so incompetent and if his views are so inconsequential, why has he retained his position? If he is not worth consulting, he should not be in the job? Who, in a sincere attempt to improve the legislation, would cause the impetus for change to be removed from the five wise men chosen by the Government? Three wise men were appointed to consider the economy, while five were put in place to review the Freedom of Information Act.

For that matter, who would wait for the expiration of the first five year period before suggesting change? Those in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are the only people who would do so. The Government's stated motives cannot be accepted and they certainly cannot be trusted.There has been much comment about the concerns of the Government in regard to media access to information. If the Government had done its job with integrity, openness and honesty, there would be no concern. We would be in a position to hear the plain and varnished truths, before they were submitted to the spin doctors, and we would know what was happening. However, the Government is not allowing that to happen. Surely it is not taking into consideration the interests of some future Fine Gael Government? Is that what it is trying to protect—

That would be a change.In response to comments made earlier, I must state that the real problem is that Fianna Fáil has been too long in Government.

#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	747	—it was regarded as radical and reforming and had the potential to make a significant contribution to the way public bodies conduct their business and how they relate to the public. By and large, the Act has achieved this. No Member has given credit to the fact that since the Act was passed, 67 bodies came under its remit but that number has expanded to almost 380. One of the first jobs I did as Minister of State was to extend it to a further 20 bodies, one of which was the National Roads Authority. The Government has embraced the Freedom of Information Act and has extended the number of bodies that come within its remit. There is a recognition that legislation which impacts to the extent the Freedom of Information Act does on all public administration cannot be frozen in time. We have had five years' experience of the freedom of information legislation during which time it has been kept under constant review. A number of amendments were deemed necessary.Some Members did not have as much opportunity as others to read the legislation but the Government has decided to extend the period of protection for Cabinet records. Members have different perceptions of what was said but I heard a number of Members opposite accept that the move to shorten the period from five to ten years' is not a bad one and that people do not have a major difficulty with it.The Government has proposed a number of limited measures to protect records which are intimately bound to the exercise of collective ministerial responsibility, such as ministerial communications relating to live Cabinet agenda items and records of committees set up in direct support of Cabinet. If Members look earnestly at the legislation, they will see that limited changes have been made.The experience abroad supports a high level of protection for information which, although not directly linked to discussions at Cabinet level—

I think he repeated his comments on four different occasions.There is a real concern that the freedom of information legislation has had a detrimental effect on the business of Government. Records are being created not only for the purpose of providing advice or an informed background to a decision but people are keeping an eye on how the advice will look or play in the media. That is a real problem. People are looking at how it will come out under the freedom of information legislation and at how somebody who seeks that information, the media or otherwise, will portray what was sound advice for Government in terms of making decisions. That is not a good way for any organisation, Government or otherwise, to conduct its business.Stronger protection for records created during the deliberative process is, therefore, necessary but such protection will only apply during the decision making process. Once a decision has been taken, records will fall to be released. There is no change there. The bulk, or 99.9%, of the 52,000 requests made in the different areas would still be possible.A number of key themes emerged in the contributions, including consultation, the introduction of up-front frees and the certification by Secretaries General of the deliberative process. There has been much focus on the question of consultation. The Government must take decisions on how to order its business in a sensible and practical way. The freedom of information legislation cannot be the major determinant for the Government decision making process. If one is afraid of what will come out—

The high level group was set up by Government to advise in the light of experience of the operation of the Act to date and issues mainly relating to the operation of Government. The aim of the group was to strike the appropriate balance between maintaining the integrity of the Cabinet and the underlying deliberative process and ensuring appropriate level of openness and transparency in the public interest.The group did not operate in a vacuum. It considered, inter alia, the 2001 report of the Information Commissioner on compliance by public bodies. It also considered the Civil Service Users' Network report of 1999 and the views of the FOI central policy unit of the Department of Finance which monitors the issues and the difficulties arising from the operation of the Act as part of its remit.

I do not believe the Government needs to apologise for the way it has gone about its work.In regard to up-front fees, the proposal to charge an up-front fee for the FOI stems from the recommendations of the report by the Civil Service Users' Network on the operation of the Act. The intention behind the recommendation is to encourage responsible use of the Act and to better reflect the cost to public bodies of FOI. It is worth emphasising that the Act already requires fees to be charged except for personal information or in exceptional cases. That is very clear in the Act. Such fees relate to the cost of searching and retrieving records and of photocopying. In practice, however, such fees are often not charged due to the additional burden of work imposed by the relevant provisions. It is, therefore, fair to say that the original intention of the Oireachtas that fees should be charged has not been given full effect.

The Government has decided that more certainty is needed in this area so that records which relate to ongoing deliberations of Departments are not released into the public domain prematurely and in such a way as to undermine the process of Government. It would be dangerous to release information if decisions have not been taken. Under the provisions of the Bill the Secretary General of a Department will decide whether a deliberative process is in progress or has been completed. Where he or she decides the deliberative process is still ongoing, the Secretary General will issue a certificate and the relevant records will not be released. At the end of the deliberative process, the Secretary General will revoke the certificate and records will be released.

There have been liberal references to other countries. I refer to Australia. The Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister has the power to certify that the document is a Cabinet document. Such a certificate establishes conclusively that the document is exempt. That is the position in Australia. In New Zealand a record may be withheld if it is necessary to maintain the constitutional conventions which protect collective and individual ministerial responsibilities or the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers of the Crown and officials.

Neither does it apply to records the purpose of which is to brief Ministers of the Crown in relation to matters that are before Cabinet. In the UK, specific protection is afforded to ministerial communications. Protection is also afforded to information which would or would be likely to prejudice the maintenance of the convention of collective ministerial responsibility or which would or would be likely to inhibit the free and frank provision of advice or exchange of views for the purpose of deliberation.When one looks around the free world, we have a very liberal regime here.

I confirm to the House that senior civil servants are covered by the Standards in Public Office Act.The issue of political party costings was raised earlier although I am not too sure who raised it. It may have been Senator Higgins. The practice whereby political parties have been able to have political proposals costed in confidence by the Department of Finance has provided a very valuable contribution to political debate over the years which has been of benefit both to Government and Opposition parties. There are compelling public interest arguments in favour of the Department of Finance being in a position to provide independent, objective advice on costings of particular policy proposals from political parties on a strictly confidential basis, based on the most up-to-date data available. This is of particular importance where such proposals are being considered and are likely to be put before the electorate as part of a party's political manifesto, thereby raising expectations among the electorate which would eventually lead to increased pressure on the public finances.Senator Brian Hayes referred to the Official Secrets Act. I am not clear on his question. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 overrides sections 4, 5 and 9 of the Official Secrets Act.Reference was made to parliamentary questions and the exemption of briefs. Parliamentary questions are answered in the Dáil. The questions are a matter of public record. Other documents and notes are often attached to these answers to give the Minister a wider understanding of the relevant issue. It is my view that it would be inappropriate to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain access to these records. The answer to the parliamentary question is what matters.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I thank the Minister of State for Finance, Deputy Tom Parlon, for remaining here until this unearthly hour. The issue I wish to raise is one with wide-ranging consequences. It relates to CoAction West Cork, an organisation which for several years has provided sterling service to people with special needs and adults with learning dificulties, and their families, in the West Cork region.At issue is the core funding deficit which now exists in CoAction. I stress that this is not an issue of general funding. The core funding deficit in CoAction has arisen because it has never received permanent funding for four services that it provides. These services affect 21 children and adults and have been operating for between five and seven years. For the past four years, CoAction has had to use over €1 million raised voluntarily to subsidise the day-to-day running costs of services to children and adults with learning disabilities. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, acknowledged, in reply to a question in the Dáil on 27 February last, that voluntary fundraising has been necessary to meet needs identified in existing services which have suffered through Government under-funding of their core budgets.This year the CoAction deficit will be much larger than in recent years, due to increased costs to match national pay scales. For reasons beyond CoAction's control, in previous years a number of positions remained unfilled. In its 1997 document Enhancing the Partnership, the Department of Health and Children undertook to deal with core funding deficits in agencies like CoAction. It did this for Cork city based agencies such as the Cope Foundation and the Brothers of Charity in 1998, and it is fair to assume that the large service providers in this area mopped up the initial funding.After a three year delay an independent consultant conducted an evaluation in September 2001. His report highlighted the ongoing core funding deficit for the services provided by CoAction and confirmed the necessity of continuing these services and the need to maintain existing staffing levels, although he recommended additional staffing. He also informed the Department of Health and Children that CoAction expected a deficit of over €500,000 in 2002, yet the Department provided only an additional €63,500 to add to the organisation's budget.The services provided by CoAction, in particular those for which it receives no funding, have been developed and maintained only by the extraordinary fundraising efforts of parents and voluntary members. I am sure that many voluntary organisations can pay the same tribute to their members but, given the financial constraints on this organisation, it is particularly inspiring that the parents of these children, and others closely associated with it, have felt obliged to engage in this type of fundraising activity. The financial crisis faced by CoAction is demoralising for its members and could have a negative effect on fundraising efforts. In 2003, it is not acceptable that almost 20% of the funds required by CoAction has to be raised voluntarily.On 24 February 2003, due to lack of core funding from the Department of Health and Children, CoAction was forced to announce service reductions, service closures and staff redundancies. The services affected include the Bakehouse, a premises which CoAction acquired in Bantry town and which will close at the end of March. Reendonegan Group Home will operate on a five day basis instead of its usual seven day basis and respite weekends for children and adults will be reduced by 75%, a loss of over 1,000 respite nights. Summer camps, which have traditionally been funded by CoAction, will now be provided on a pay-per-cost basis. It is also widely believed that in eight months time CoAction will run out of funds.The argument has been made, quite unfairly, on some sides that CoAction spread its wings too wide. CoAction would not have embarked on these services if there was no need for them. It is dealing with the most vulnerable members of society. This brings home the reality of the budgetary cuts and it is distressing for the people involved that this issue has resulted in redundancies, restriction of service and closure of some units. I stress again that this is a core funding deficit issue which is not generally acknowledged in terms of funding the organisation.I appeal to the Minister to look favourably on the idea that €1.5 million per annum would be appropriate to address the core financial deficit. This is not a large sum of money in the context of the Book of Estimates and would be of major benefit to people with disabilities. I appeal to the Government urgently to address the core funding deficit in CoAction.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-04 00:00:00	Prelude	805	On behalf of my colleague, Deputy Martin, Minister for Health and Children, I thank the Senator for raising this matter and giving me the opportunity to outline the Department's position on this issue.In recent years the Department of Health and Children has provided funding to meet identified needs in existing services. It has also provided funding to put in place new service developments to meet needs in residential, respite, day and other support services. These needs arise from the changing profile of persons with an intellectual disability or those with autism which has increased the number of older and medically fragile people availing of these services, in particular residential services. They also relate to issues such as underfunding of base budgets, including the need to consolidate elements of services previously funded from sources such as fundraising. The Department has sought to address these issues as resources have permitted.It was agreed that this process should continue, albeit through new, more appropriate mechanisms, as outlined in the report Enhancing the Partnership, which dealt with the framework supporting the transfer of responsibility for funding intellectual disabilitv service providers to the health boards. These providers had been funded directly by the Department. A second report, Widening the Partnership, dealt with the application of that framework to voluntary service providers for those with an intellectual disability, such as CoAction West Cork, funded by the health boards. Between 1998 and 2002, additional funding amounting to €27.2 million was allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism to meet identified needs in existing services.The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all programmes, including services for people with an intellectual disability. Between 1997 and 2002, an extra €188 million in revenue and €139 million in capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services to persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism.This year, the Department has allocated additional funding of €13.3 million to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services to children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to €340 million over seven years. Of this amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.This funding has brought about very significant and unprecedented developments in the services. Between 1997 and 2002, around 1,700 extra residential places were provided, most of them based in the community. This figure includes new residential respite places which were developed in 1997 and 1998. Between 1999 and 2002, about 465 dedicated respite places were also provided. In addition, around 2,950 new day places were provided between 1997 and 2002.Despite this very significant investment over recent years, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists, particularly for residential services, even though the number of people in receipt of such services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with intellectual disabilities are living longer than previously, adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision to this section of the population.While it is regrettable that the level of investment achieved in these services in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, the Department of Health and Children will work closely with the health boards and other service providers in relation to the service provision this year.The Seanad adjourned at 2.45 a.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 5 March 2003.
