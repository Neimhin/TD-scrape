        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">As the Taoiseach will be aware, the main issue to dominate tomorrow's G8 summit in Scotland will be the effort to solve the plight of the people of Africa. It is worth bearing in mind that, in every ten minutes we speak in the House today, 60 children will have died of a vaccine-preventable illness and 80 babies under a month will die worldwide. A woman in the developing world will die every second in childbirth. Every 30 seconds a child dies of malaria. Six thousand people will die today from an AIDS-related illness. By the end of this year, just like every year, whooping cough will have killed 300,000 children, and diarrhoea will have killed 600,000 more under the age of five.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The Taoiseach and his Government obviously cannot prevent these tragedies from occurring. However, I am annoyed that in September 2000, with no election in sight, he made a solemn commitment to the UN Assembly, before the eyes of the world, that the Government would achieve the UN target of 0.7% of GDP by 2007. He made this commitment based on the information available to him with the consent of his Government and on behalf of the people of Ireland. When it became politically expedient for the Government to break that promise, it did so.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">This country can be very proud of the outstanding work done by our NGOs which dispense aid all over the world. It is a pity that our reputation in the eyes of the world is now being besmirched by the fact the Taoiseach broke the promise he made on behalf of the people and the Government. Some time ago, he stated in the House that his job was to answer questions when asked. In light of this, let me ask him a question now: when will this Government achieve the Taoiseach's commitment to donate 0.7% of GDP in overseas development aid? Why has he postponed making a decision on this matter until some time before September, at which time the House will not be sitting and at which time there will be no opportunity to raise these matters with him? If the Taoiseach's job is to answer questions, he should state when the Government will make this announcement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">As I stated previously, I would like Ireland to be the number one subscriber to overseas development aid in the world. We lie at about number seven or eight in the world. This is an extraordinary achievement for this country and everybody should be proud of it. We subscribe the better part of €600 million towards overseas development aid, more than the entire capital programme for health in this country. Every year we are increasing our overseas development aid package by a vast amount. In the last budget, the first by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, a €1.8 billion package for overseas development aid for the next three years was outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I am thankful that we are now able to help NGOs to do their job. They cannot do it without the money. I am proud that under the Governments I have led, we have increased our overseas development aid contribution from €150 million to over €600 million. With the packages that have been announced, this will amount to approximately €700 million by 2007.</p>

The behaviour of former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, with regard to the nursing homes issue would, according to the former Ombudsman, make previous Ministers squirm in their graves. Ministers of State, Deputies Callely and Tim O'Malley, managed to read the brief but did absolutely nothing.

He then went on to accuse me of bluffing when I told him what was in the Conroy report, saying I had not read it or seen it.

          <p eId="para_65">In February 1999, Assistant Commissioner Carty was appointed by the Garda Commissioner to investigate allegations that gardaí in Donegal had engaged in criminal and unethical behaviour. In July 2000, over a year later, Assistant Commissioner Carty submitted his report, which was the investigation file, to the Director of Public Prosecutions who is independent. A few months later, in August 2000, Deputy Commissioner Conroy forwarded a 37-page summary of the Carty report to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This was not the Carty report itself. At that stage, the DPP was considering the Carty report and its recommendations and prosecutions. That is the process. He would get the file and then consider it. A number of civil actions relating to Donegal were well under way at that stage and a number of complaints were with the Garda Complaints Board.</p>
          <p eId="para_66">In light of the controversy at that time, the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, sought a preliminary opinion from the Attorney General in June 2001 regarding the options open to him to have the matter inquired into. The Attorney General replied immediately that he required sight of the full Carty report before he could furnish an opinion. The Attorney General, while agreeing that a public inquiry was the most attractive option — and he said that — advised that since tribunals of inquiry have to be conducted in public, this could seriously prejudice pending prosecutions. A tribunal could not be conducted while prosecutions were ongoing. He also advised that a tribunal could be established if the truth did not emerge in the cases that were pending.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">In November, four or five months later, having consulted the Director of Public Prosecutions, on foot of the Attorney General's request to see the Garda file, the Garda Commissioner gave an edited version of the Carty report to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This consisted of those parts of the Carty report considered to be relevant to the defence of the civil actions related to events in Donegal. This edited version was a bulky document and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions remarked that it would be difficult for persons reading the case to make sense of the issues without sight of the papers. In November, Shane Murphy was appointed to review all the papers and advise on how best to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">The fact is that the full Carty report was given to the Department in late January of 2002. Mr. Murphy submitted his report at the end of the same month. The following week, in February 2002, the Government approved in principle the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry. That approval came a week or ten days after the full report was given. Just a few days after the full Carty report was given, the Government approved the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry and the drafting of a Bill to amend the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act to facilitate the holding of such an inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">As I have said a number of times, there was no delay or holding back. The cases were being proceeded with and it is the role of the Director of Public Prosecution to prosecute such cases. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had not got the investigation file.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">The Attorney General, when he was asked for advice, said that a tribunal would be best but that it could not be held in public while cases were pending. I do not know why Deputy Rabbitte persists with this issue because all of the records, dates and information are available. I can make a list of these publicly available for people to see. I read the full Dáil debate on the matter last night and it is quite clear what the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, said to the House on 23 May 2001. It is there for everybody to read.</p>

          <p eId="para_72">When the Taoiseach reads the Dáil debates at night I would ask him to focus on some of the language that he uses because language ceases to have any meaning when he issues a reply like the one we have just heard. The fact of the matter is that the then Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, claimed throughout 2001 that he had the Carty report. As time is limited, I will furnish one quotation. On 23 May 2001, Deputy O'Donoghue said, at column 1414 of the Dáil debates, "The investigation by Assistant Commissioner Carty was completed and presented to me and, in turn, to the Director of Public Prosecutions." That was on 23 May and he repeated that point to Deputy Howlin and others. Last Wednesday, 22 June 2005, the Taoiseach came into the House and said: "A partial version of the Carty report was eventually furnished in November 2001..." That is a straightforward untruth. The report was furnished on 1 August 2000. The Taoiseach uttered a straightforward untruth and he has now picked up the habit of his former Attorney General, Deputy McDowell, of trying to throw sand in people's eyes about when is the Carty report not the Carty report; when is the Carty report the Conroy report; and what is the difference between the report and an investigation file needed for prosecution. Opposition Deputies were not talking about an investigation file for prosecution, which was the defence that the Minister advanced. We were talking about the hair-raising report from Mr. Noel Conroy, who acted quite properly and who, within a month of the report being delivered to Mr. Pat Byrne, summarised it and sent it to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in easily intelligible terms. The Minister did nothing and a year and three months later, when we put down a motion in the House calling for the matter to be investigated, the Government voted it down.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The current Minister, Deputy McDowell, has stated that he could not engage in such an inquiry because he had not received the full Carty report. When, as Attorney General, he was advising on the legal redress scheme and could not get the relevant report because of the secret deal cooked up by the Taoiseach and Deputy Woods, he quite properly said that he would withdraw from giving advice because he could not get the documents from Deputy Woods. However, he did not say the same in this case and he has now dropped the Minister, Deputy O'Donoghue, in it to the extent that the poor fellow is ashamed to come into the House, go on radio or television or to present himself anywhere. He is properly embarrassed, as he ought to be, about having read the Conroy report and done nothing about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">There has been no debate in this House on the report from the National Economic and Social Council, Housing in Ireland: Performance and Policy, published six months ago. I am not aware of any response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to the recommendations of the NESC report. Will the Government accept and implement the recommendation that there should be an increase in permanent social housing units, owned and managed by local authorities, of the order of some 73,000 units between 2005 and 2012? This is a key recommendation of the NESC. Will the Taoiseach note that the NESC report cites evidence from other states showing that only through increased social housing provision can the housing crisis in this State be seriously tackled and also the terrible tragedy of homelessness for so many?</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Does the Taoiseach accept that Part V of the Planning and Development Act is failing to deliver social and affordable housing which I have acknowledged it has the potential to deliver? Does the Taoiseach recognise that the subsequent Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2002 allowed developers to shirk their responsibilities under the original legislation and through the giving of money, land or units on other developments they are able to avoid the responsibility of providing social and affordable houses in key developments? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, indicated there were only 390 units — I ask the Taoiseach to take note of that figure — of social and affordable housing provided under Part V of the Planning and Development Act up to the end of September 2004?</p>
          <p eId="para_98">Has a cost benefit analysis been carried out on the transfer of land, the proposed swap of land in Government ownership with developers in exchange for so-called affordable housing units?

          <p eId="para_101">The Government was very glad to receive the NESC report and also the PricewaterhouseCoopers report and the other work done on housing. As the Deputy knows, the Government rate of building social and affordable housing and housing is higher than anywhere else in the modern world. It stands at 20 houses per 1,000 people as against a rate of three houses per 1,000 people in Britain and five in the United States.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">Some 30% of all houses in the State are new houses which is an enormous achievement. The Government is delivering strongly on social and affordable housing programmes with 13,000 benefiting under the broad range of social and affordable housing programmes in operation since 2004. Record levels of funding are being allocated to local authorities for their housing programmes this year. The total Exchequer provision for both capital and current expenditure for 2005 is €1.3 billion which is 20% over the provision figure for last year. This represents a seven-fold increase in the past seven years. I know the Deputy will be very supportive, as I am, of such investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">The Deputy is correct in that changes were made in Part V. The supply of social and affordable housing has been boosted by the implementation of Part V. It took some time to implement the provisions of Part V and there were changes and delays following much lobbying in the House. Whether or not those were justified, I accept delays occurred but it is up and running. It is envisaged that more than 11,000 units will be delivered from the various affordable schemes between this year and in 2007. The needs of a further 6,000 households are expected to be met through other social housing measures, including houses completed by the voluntary co-operative sector. The long-term housing needs of approximately 5,000 current recipients of rent supplements will be addressed through new rental accommodation schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The local authorities are also producing five-year action plans for social and affordable housing programmes. The primary aim of these plans is to ensure housing is delivered in a manner which breaks the cycle of disadvantage and dependency which still exists in some areas and I accept the point made by the Deputy on that matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">The Deputy asked about the transparency of the land swaps. The Harcourt Terrace site was the subject of an initial feasibility analysis which concluded that given its present zoning it would only realise about 30 apartments on site in addition to some commercial developments. The analysis found that its maximum value would be extracted by facilitating a commercial development focused on the owner-occupied market, for example, a law practice for which demand is strong in that area. The recommendation was to consider an exchange of the site as a pilot scheme to test the Government's fast growing approach to early delivery of affordable units. The net consideration for the site was determined in the analysis at €15.6 million which is €2.6 million over its pre-sale valuation of €13 million. This equates to approximately €39 million per acre for that area and reflects the top of the range for sale prices achieved in the city centre. Dublin City Council acted as project managers for the site. Sixteen bids were received on an open tender and Durkan Homes was identified as the prime developer from a short list of three bids.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The advantage is that rather than having a site which would have required the State to take considerable years to develop — it takes four years to complete a building project on a site — the State was enabled in a matter of months to go to the market and have 193 apartments. One hundred and forty families will be in their apartments by Christmas as a result of this decision and 53 more early in the new year, rather than having to wait for the longer process. The Government has now made six other sites available. Any reasonable person would agree this process is a fast-track approach. I accepted the point made in the House on many occasions. It is a fair point and it was raised by Deputy Rabbitte many times. I am here again answering questions from Members because we have effectively done things, as is always the case. The Deputy asked if a proper feasibility study was carried out and my reply has shown it was.</p>

As this is the last Leaders' Questions of this term, the House should deal with the issue being raised, which is social and affordable housing. The Taoiseach refers to the building programme in total which includes private building which we know is currently at an unprecedented level. However, that will not address the focus of my question which is the 50,000 housing units for people who are still on local authority waiting lists throughout this jurisdiction. When the Taoiseach refers to a cost benefit analysis regarding specific cases, under any cost benefit analysis there would be a greater return for this State if the lands were given to local authorities rather than in swaps with private developers.This is what is needed. What of the NESC recommendation in respect of a tax on second homes?

What is the Taoiseach's position in respect of the continuation of section 23 tax relief when clearly it is contributing to ever spiralling house prices particularly in the city of Dublin where it is having a devastating effect on the potential of young couples to aspire to first-time home buyer status? It is having devastating consequences. Centre city communities are being ravaged. Those who have lived generationally together are being forced to move out to suburbia and into far distant counties, including my constituency. There is clear neglect. As the Taoiseach said yesterday, it is time he lifted the telephone and talked to his brother in terms of his portfolio responsibility.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_108">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_135">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_136">The National Implementation Body, which includes employer and trade union representatives, operates under the chairmanship of my Department. Its purpose is to oversee delivery of the industrial peace and stability provisions of the Sustaining Progress agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">The body has met on a number of occasions recently to assist in the resolution of industrial relations disputes in both the public and private sectors. Meetings of the body also provide opportunities for informal discussion of some of the broader issues relating to the social partnership process and the industrial relations climate generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">I should make clear that the National Implementation Body does not seek in any way to duplicate or substitute for already well-established industrial relations machinery. The role it serves is complementary in helping to identify and overcome obstacles to effective participation in these wider processes. The body will continue to meet, as necessary, to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">I addressed the Biennial Conference of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in the Waterfront Hall in Belfast on Thursday last. In the course of my speech, I addressed the issue of housing. One of the central issues in housing is affordability, and we have for some time been working to provide increased numbers of affordable houses under a variety of schemes, including the affordable housing initiative which we agreed with the social partners in Sustaining Progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">While considerable progress has been made, our priority now must be accelerating delivery of affordable housing units. In this context, I announced during my speech in Belfast that we are creating a new agency, to be known as the affordable homes partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">The role of the AHP will be to drive and co-ordinate the delivery of affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, with particular reference to the Dublin metropolitan area. The AHP will help to accelerate the Sustaining Progress affordable housing initiative on State land, and will work closely with relevant Departments and local authorities to ensure a "whole of Government" approach to affordable housing developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">In the first instance, the agency will be working within the existing planning and development framework. However, if additional legislative powers prove to be necessary, they will be made available. In the meantime, consideration is to be given to approaches dealing with land options and a "use it or lose it" scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">The Government intends to address more medium-term issues for the provision of social and affordable housing in the early autumn. This process will be informed by the outcome of the statutory housing needs assessment currently under way and the work under way by the Housing Forum in reviewing the effectiveness of the existing social and affordable housing schemes in the context of Sustaining Progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">A copy of my address to the conference has been laid in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_109">
            <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_145">The National Implementation Body met recently to discuss the difficulties between the Department of Health and Children, the Health Service Employers' Agency and the Irish Nurses Organisation in regard to the full implementation of the health care assistants' programme. Part of the recommendations, as the Taoiseach will be aware, was the establishment of a high level group representative of the main interest groups, including An Bord Altranais, to examine the outstanding recommendations contained in a report termed the Effective Utilisation of Professional Skills of Nurses and Midwives and that such work should be finished by September 2005. Was that high level representative group set up and, if so, is it currently carrying out that analysis? Does the Taoiseach expect it will have concluded its business by September of this year? Does he consider any further action needs to be taken at this point by the National Implementation Body? Does he have information as to how many cases that body considered during the past 12 months?</p>
            <p eId="para_146">In respect of the threatened strike of nurses intended to take place in June but which was averted once the pay increases of between 3.5% and 5.5% were not withheld and were paid by 1 June, does the Taoiseach consider the issue of acuity recognition in terms of the degree of pressure, stress and responsibility with which various aspects of the nursing profession have to deal should be considered under the benchmarking process?</p>

            <p eId="para_149">Since the beginning of 2004 it has met 15 or 16 times.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_151">In regard to the health care assistants' programme, the body met the management side and the INO representatives. Following those discussions, the body noted that the INO had no principal objection to the implementation of the modules of the health care assistants' programme and it recommended immediate and full co-operation with all the preparation and training arrangements. It recommended the establishment, as the Deputy mentioned, of a high level group representative of An Bord Altranais to examine the outstanding lists. This work is ongoing and will be completed by the end of September. It also noted the issue of nursing practice and delegation.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">In regard to what should be included in the benchmarking process, it is a matter for individual groups to make their cases and put forward their submissions. They can do that under the benchmarking process. The issue raised by the Deputy is, to the best of my knowledge, a legitimate issue that the profession can put forward under those arrangements.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_115">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_153">I refer to the Taoiseach's address to the congress in Belfast. Will he say something more about the new affordable homes partnership agency? Is it in place? If not, when will it be put in place? Of how many people will the agency comprise? Mr. Des Geraghty has agreed to act as chairman. What other kinds of people will be on the agency? Will the powers be vested in them to gift lands to developers in return for housing elsewhere? Has the Taoiseach any concerns as to whether there is a value for money question to be addressed regarding, say, an immensely valuable site such as Harcourt Street? How do we, as taxpayers, know that we are getting value for money? If we take Harcourt Street as an example, is everything tied up and are the "i's" dotted and the "t's" crossed in terms of what exactly is the <i>quid pro quo</i> for the swap, the alternative locations the developer who will benefit from getting Harcourt Street is offering, how many units can be put on them, etc.?</p>
            <p eId="para_154">Has the Taoiseach any concerns about inner city regeneration and building, in the sense that it seems what we are encouraging here is the construction of more office blocks? The people working in those office blocks will be put out in the commuter belt and they will have to commute to the office blocks in the city and so on. I know there has been unconscionable delay. The then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, tried to address some of these issues when he held that office. Is the plan well thought out to gift these valuable sites to developers in return for housing elsewhere, with all the implications for city living that are involved?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_116">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_155">Before I go to those questions, I should make it clear that there are no gifts involved in this initiative. It is a commercial deal, a swap, with costs being put on the sale. The details have been worked out and I will go through some of them. There is nothing for nothing for anyone. Dublin City Council managed the project and professional assessments were made of what the site could be used for. The advantage in terms of the Harcourt Street analysis is that planning would be forthcoming for 30 apartments, with a commercial use for another part of the site. If this were to be done in the inner city as a private project, given all the time it takes to do these things, it would take four years at best. The largest developers will say that it takes between four and six years from the time they purchase a site to getting a likely return on some of it. I have had endless information from all the local authorities which confirms that this is case. I do not quite understand why it takes so long, but apparently that is how it works.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">In this case, Durkan, the developer, won the contract out of 16 tenders. There was no shortage of applicants. Eventually there was a shortlist of three and Durkan ultimately won. It will have 140 of these units in south Dublin ready by Christmas and people will be occupying them, as well as another 52 units. For the swap of that site we will build 30 units or perhaps more. By early in the New Year, within nine months of the deal being completed a month ago, we will get 192 units. In all of this Dublin City Council is doing the project management. There is no point in another group doing it. It is best to do it that way. I can give the Deputy some details about the initiative itself. The initiative comes about from the experience gained in the past few years regarding the agreement on the 10,000 sites. We were able to get the sites but it was an exceedingly slow process to get on with matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">The affordable homes partnership will be established as a corporate body under the Local Government Services (Corporate Bodies) Act 1971. The reason is that it can be done immediately and we can get ahead forthwith. The establishment order for the partnership will be made shortly by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and will be circulated in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It will provide a statutory structure around which a board and support staff may be put in place immediately. The affordable homes partnership will be subject to public service corporate governance disciplines, including audit and appropriate ethics requirements. Initially the board will consist of seven members, the managers of the four Dublin local authorities and three independent members. Mr. Des Geraghty has been invited to serve as chairman and has agreed. The names of the other independent members will be announced, I hope, within the next week.</p>
            <p eId="para_158">The partnership will have an experienced chief executive and a small dedicated staff comprising personnel with a proven track record, principally on secondment in the early stages. It is a question of initially seconding people with proven experience in this area, rather than going through a long interviewing process. The chief executive will be an <i>ex officio</i> member of the board. Arrangements have already been put in place for the appointment of the chief executive and other staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">The affordable homes partnership will have responsibility for a range of tasks, mainly for a short-term period of three years, at least initially. It will drive and co-ordinate the delivery of all affordable housing development, that is, quality houses at a reasonable cost in the greater Dublin area. In conducting its role the partnership will pay particular attention to increasing supply within the Dublin metropolitan area, with regard to the local authorities' five year action plans on sociable and affordable housing. The partnership will co-ordinate approaches as regards the development of supporting infrastructure, such as transport, water, education and other community facilities. The approach will be to prioritise projects within existing capital envelopes in a concerted and co-ordinated way to facilitate the necessary affordable housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">It is intended that the partnership will take responsibility, as far as practicable, for the present affordable housing system — that is the 10,000 sites on State lands in the greater Dublin area, where it is necessary that this initiative should lead to their accelerated development. The partnership will be tasked to undertake a series of measures to bring additional land for housing development, including the consideration of proposals from builders, developers or local authorities for the utilisation of lands not currently zoned for housing but which may be suitable for development.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">The partnership will also publicise and communicate with the public in general on affordable housing availability and development. In fulfilling its communication role, it will work with local authorities to simplify contact by members of the public on the choices available and the tailoring of individual requirements. There are now about eight or nine different schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">Regarding the priority of increasing affordable housing in the Dublin metropolitan area, the partnership will be mandated to ensure that the annual target of at least 16,000 units identified for Dublin is met. As a particular requirement this will ensure that the response is aimed at addressing issues of affordability that remain a significant source of concern. In this area, the growth of commuter-based development in Dublin and surrounding counties has resulted in significant human, social and economic costs due to the deficit in affordable housing in the capital. Therefore it is important that supply contains a sufficient component within the affordable category, whether as private housing or under the affordable schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">In order to increase the supply of land available for affordable housing in the greater Dublin area, the affordable homes partnership, as one of its earliest tasks, will call for proposals from the holders of land that may be suitable for housing development, including land that is not currently zoned for housing, regardless of its ownership. In order to assist the progressing of development of suitable lands using existing planning mechanisms, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government intends to issue policy guidance which will reinforce the policy context in which zoning and planning decisions take account of the goal of providing additional housing in the affordable category.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The partnership will undertake an audit of their lands with local authorities with a view to the most active use of such holdings for affordable housing schemes. The principle to be used in this initiative is that the land should be located in an area where there is a need for such housing, to ensure that suitable development land is adjacent to existing developments and capable of integration with such settlements — community facilities, schools, public transport — and the land, ideally, should be capable of being built upon within a short timescale. It should be serviced or serviceable.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Value for money will be based on the final unit costs of housing, including any servicing, having regard to specified quality and timescales of delivery. I have quite an amount of detail on swaps. Perhaps I will send Deputy Rabbitte a memorandum on that area. On the basis that everyone believes the Harcourt Street project is a great success — I hope it will be and something does not happen — a second phase will begin on Harcourt Street because only a small area was tested in the pilot project.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">Land at Gormanston, Model Farm in Cork, Athenry, Magee Barracks and Backweston is also being put on the market to see what it can generate. Most of these sites are not serviceable and it will take a considerable amount of time for the State to make them serviceable. In this way, it is hoped we will get serviceable sites either built or about to be built, rather than stretching out the process until 2010 which would be the case without a swap. We will probably not get the same interest — I hope we do — or value as for the Harcourt Street site where we are getting 190 apartments for a relatively small site. At least the other sites would speed up the process but, again, it would have to be project managed by local authorities, instead of the State also getting involved. It is worth making this effort to have the land developed because the other way is painfully slow.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">The issue which interests me in swapping sites and the reason I went with this approach, although I can always see the dangers in these kinds of things, is that the affordable selling price for the units after the swap involving the Harcourt Street site will be between €150,000 and €170,000, an average discount of 33% of the market value. For the citizen, our constituents, this is a considerable reduction. In this case, the individual on the list is given good quality housing in a good area for a very attractive price.</p>

          <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_117">
            <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
            <p eId="para_168">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I would appreciate getting the information he promised to allow me to examine the matter in more detail. To help me understand the concept, does the Taoiseach have a figure on file for the value of the Harcourt Street site? I understand he indicated that the agency is charged with delivery of the entire 10,000 units and that, whereas other sites in the ownership of the State will be put out to tender, the agency will not be prevented from developing some sites in its possession if it wishes to go through the procedure and deliver houses itself. Is that correct?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_118">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_169">The value for money analysis of the Harcourt Street site was carried out as part of an open and transparent procurement process conducted by Dublin City Council, as the project manager for the site. The site was put out to tender and 16 bids were received and evaluated against predetermined criteria. A shortlist of three bids was examined and Durkan Homes was identified as the preferred bidder. We are receiving a net consideration for the site of €15.6 million, which is in excess of €2.6 million above its pre-sale valuation of €13 million. This equates to €39 million per acre, a frightening figure but that is how the world is today. It reflects the top of the range of sale prices achieved in the city centre in recent years. It is extraordinary stuff.</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_122">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_173">I wish to make one further point in case I cause confusion. The partnership will look after any of the 10,000 sites located within the Dublin metropolitan area. Any sites outside the area will be looked after elsewhere. The partnership wants to keep the system small by having a small board and staff, using local authority structures and seconding staff rather than getting into the interview process and trying to make a big impact.</p>
            <p eId="para_174">Another issue of interest has not yet emerged and Deputy Rabbitte's question offers an opportunity to raise it. Everybody gives out that there is a lot of land around Dublin, often lying derelict or used for anti-social behaviour, which is sometimes owned by the local authority and sometimes owned by God knows who. I am sure Deputy Rabbitte will have had the same experience of this in his constituency as I have had in mine. If a developer or local authority believes it could put this land, which is not zoned, into use, it could propose a project to the partnership. The partnership, within the existing structures, would then try to fast-track the development of the land purely for affordable initiatives, taking into account the needs of local residents. I have made the point to the partnership that if it were to try to make it attractive for local residents to get rid of what is probably an eyesore by guaranteeing some local participation in the affordable housing allocation, such projects could become quite attractive operations. If local residents believe it is house building for the general housing pool, they will probably not find it attractive. It will be interesting to see what emerges in regard to this aspect of the plan which has not had much of an airing, although it should have been aired because if many of the nuisance sites could be brought to the agency and planning and zoning were quickly secured, not alone could one get more affordable housing but one would also get rid of many of the nuisance sites.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_123">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_175">I will ask two questions relating to the Taoiseach's speech to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions in Belfast. ICTU has set out a number of priorities in advance of the new round of partnership talks. Top of its list is tackling the widening gap between the low and high paid, which is not new. Given the growth in this gap under Governments led by the Taoiseach, does he foresee a time when we will be able to turn around this trend and effectively reduce the gap to bring about some equity?</p>
            <p eId="para_176">My second question is related to the affordable homes partnership plan. I assume the creation of the partnership is an acknowledgement by the Taoiseach of the failure to quickly meet the commitment to build 10,000 social housing units. It is clear the plan is a good deal for developers who will no doubt be happy to get their hands on lucrative land in return for building what are known as affordable homes. I understand the affordable homes in question will be sold at 20% below market price, whereas the Taoiseach indicated to Deputy Rabbitte that they will be sold at 33% below market price. Will he clarify the difference?</p>
            <p eId="para_177">What criteria will govern the selection of the lucky developers who will be charged with taking responsibility for delivery of the partnership project? Will selection be determined simply by the price given to the State or will the criteria include obligations on the developers to pay subcontractors they engage promptly and operate to a set of standards laid down by the Government? Will the Taoiseach outline what such criteria might be, given the experience of a significant number of subcontractors who protested outside the House yesterday, having been effectively stung for hundreds of thousands of euro owed to them by contractors working in the pay of local authorities? I understand the Taoiseach is aware of the matter. What criteria are in place to prevent a recurrence of this type of serious non-payment of Bills?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_124">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_178">As always, the Deputy has tried to turn the issue around by saying the partnership offers good value to the developer when everybody else believes it offers good value to the individuals concerned, as I have outlined. The argument as to whether tax reliefs should be continued is fair. The Minister for Finance is reviewing these.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">The analysis the Deputy has come to is that approximately 300,000 people have homes outside the country. I believe that he has come to this analysis himself. I am not going to tell people not to have a second home. I am not ideologically opposed to people having a second home. It is difficult enough to live in one.</p>

The Government now proposes on Friday to introduce a Bill and take all Stages. This is the fourth time the Government has put through all Stages of a Bill in a single sitting without notice to the Opposition.

It is imperative that we have a full debate on what is an important element of the overall EU action plan. This has implications for our security, our civil liberties and our human rights. All these matters are affected by the content of the proposition and, more importantly, in the context of the EU action plan which was introduced four years ago and yet the House has never debated it. It is irrelevant of what one's view may be of its content. Whatever opinion I may have, others may have one that is totally contrary. On principle, the House should be addressing the proposal. The greater number of Members simply do not know what it contains or what effects it may have on the rights of citizens of this State and other EU member states. The House should not permit something to go through on a nod and a wink without Members fulfilling their duty of proper inspection. That is why I again object to No. 18 proceeding as proposed.</p>

          <p eId="para_353">A matter raised by the Taoiseach, on behalf of the Government, has been about competency and this is the last time he will be in the House before the summer recess unless he turns up tomorrow. Nine of the 13 Bills on the list published by the Chief Whip, which were due to be published, have not been. These include the Abbotstown sports campus Bill, the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, the Foyle and Carlingford fisheries Bill, the sea fisheries Bill, the employment permits Bill, the employees (provision of information and consultation) Bill, the diplomatic relations and immunities (amendment) Bill, the criminal justice (international co-operation) Bill and the tribunals of inquiry (evidence) (amendment) Bill. Only four of the 13 Bills listed have been published. That is an appalling record.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Chief Whip, after due consideration by the Cabinet, published the work for the Legislature for this session, that is, 13 Bills to be published and debated in the House, but we find at the end of the session that nine have not been published. That is an appalling record in terms of competency. It does down the Chief Whip who struggles away against the vagaries of politics each week. Will the Taoiseach comment on that? Can we have an assurance that when the House comes back, the list of Bills proposed to be published for the autumn session will be realistic and that Deputies will know it is seriously intended to deal with the body of work on the list produced by the Cabinet?</p>

          <p eId="para_355">There are two issues. We have just had a vote on a Bill which passed all Stages in the Seanad where it was introduced and we now want to pass it in the Dáil. It is a short, technical Bill which was opposed even though it helps an Internet based aircraft register which will be based in Ireland. It was opposed not because Deputies were against the Bill but because the Chief Whip is trying to complete Bills from 2004 which have been around for a long time. There is not much point in putting forward a number of new Bills when we cannot even clear existing Bills. We are criticised for guillotining Bills that are not of great significance. If we could clear Bills more quickly here, it would be far better. One of the proposals of the Whip is that we spend more time on legislation, so that we could try to speed up the process.</p>

Does the Taoiseach agree the claims should be up to and including the summer recess?

          <p eId="para_379">We must recognise that the Taoiseach's presence is a critical issue when dealing with Dáil reform. Any package of reforms would have to include the Taoiseach's accountability to the House on a Thursday. Many Deputies would be open to the idea of extended time at the beginning of the week, if some of the areas to which the Taoiseach alluded could be accommodated, including Private Members' time. Why should Private Members' time be confined to Tuesday and Wednesday evenings? There is a tendency in the greater part of the media to ignore much of what is raised. Matters on the Adjournment could be reconfigured to allow Members, especially backbenchers, a greater opportunity for a more fulfilling participation on the floor of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">These are all important matters, but the Chief Whip's current proposal is all about reducing the accountability of the Government. It is not about enhancing engagement or accountability to the House. The proposal is therefore flawed and will make no progress unless it addresses properly the issues to which I referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The very restrictive way in which the Order of Business operates also needs to be examined. There is a failure on the part of the Taoiseach to respond properly to specific questions put to him. The need for debate on critical areas is ignored. A point made on the Order of Business today was completely ignored by the Taoiseach. He gave no response. A Deputy has just left and we must make our own judgment on what the silence represents. We spent much time today debating the NESC report on housing. The Taoiseach has given no indication, six months later, on whether the House will be allowed to debate it. Will the Government provide time in the resumed session in late September? The Members want to address these important issues on the floor of this Chamber. It is incumbent on the Government to provide those opportunities.</p>

It does not work that way. If people want to have sensible dialogue, the Whip will be around most of the summer and he will be glad to hear from them. There must be a sense of give and take. People come with a shopping basket and demand what they want. Others will demand something else. We will continue to have what we have had for the 28 years I have been in the House and for the 28 years before that which is Adjournments at night time.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_516">copies of which were laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann on 16 June 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">I am pleased to move this motion, the adoption of which by both Houses of the Oireachtas will pave the way for the planning and development regulations to be amended in three different ways: first, to make it a requirement for shops that wish to change into an off-licence or to sell alcohol to obtain planning permission; second, to facilitate consideration of the need for an environmental impact assessment, EIA, of peat extraction projects, that are currently exempted development, by referring to criteria set out in the environmental impact assessment directive; and, third, to reflect in the Irish planning regulations a technical change to annex I and annex II of the environmental impact assessment directive which lists project categories that require environmental impact assessment. The change is needed because the environmental impact assessment directive has been amended by the Aarhus Directive 2003/35/EC.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Positive approval of this House is needed for any change to the exemptions under the planning code, whether the change adds an exemption or limits exemptions, as these changes do. I had suggested that these changes would be discussed in an Oireachtas committee. I believe that would have been a much better approach from the point of view of everybody in the House but particularly from the point of view of the Opposition. It would have been a good and appropriate use of committee time. That format would have allowed for a freer and more extensive exchange of views than is possible in the 60 minutes we have available in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">As Members will know, I have for a long time been an advocate of the more extensive use of parliamentary committees, particularly for technical issues such as those under discussion here, not least because it allows the Opposition parties to make a positive input. Members will accept that I have been forthcoming in that regard. I have always been willing to listen and involve the Opposition and, where possible, to change. Oddly, the proposition was opposed by the Green Party and I am mystified as to why it chose to do that. The party is not represented here now so we will probably never know.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">The first amendment will require shop owners who wish to change the use of their premises to an off-licence to obtain planning permission. Under the planning and development regulations 2001, a change of use from a shop to an off-licence does not currently require planning permission. This has always struck me as very odd. Planning permission is needed to open a chipper, for example, yet no planning permission is needed to open a full-blown off-licence to sell all forms of beer, wines and spirits. Whatever about chippers, there is no shortage of off-licence outlets. The Commission on Liquor Licensing, Interim Report on Off-Licensing, published in May 2001, evidently shared my long-held view on this. It recommended that permission should be needed for a change of shop use to an off-licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The number of shops changing use to off-licence or expanding into the sale of alcohol has increased significantly in recent years. The increase in off-licences has arisen both from changes to the restrictions on the transfer of an intoxicating liquor licence and from changes in the way in which people socialise and drink. These changes have had an impact on our streets and communities. There is therefore a land use issue that must be tackled through the planning code. By bringing the matter into the planning code I am giving local communities and councillors a say in the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">I have therefore decided to amend the definition of a shop in the planning and development regulations 2001 so that a shop changing use to that of an off-licence, or expanding what it sells to include alcohol, will in future require planning permission. The change will not affect the sale of wine as a subsidiary to the main use of the premises as a shop. The sale of wine from a corner fridge, which is a minor element of the overall trade of the shop, will not be affected by this change. Lest Members jump to any conclusion, they should note that the Commission on Liquor Licensing supported my conclusion on this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Roche</from>
          <p eId="para_528">The change will allow planning authorities to exercise control over the major increase in large-scale off-licences and address the genuine concerns of local communities. The change is a very positive step. It will give local communities a direct input into the development and  establishment of off-licences in theirareas.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">This has been an area of genuine concern for communities in recent years as more and more outlets for the sale of beer, spirits and wine have sprung up. It is not my intention that this proposed regulation should be used to prevent consumer choice or to inhibit competition. Rather, the intention is to give communities and councils a right to determine what can and cannot happen in their planning areas. The change will ensure better planning in our towns.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The second amendment will facilitate consideration of the need for the environmental impact assessment of peat extraction projects, which fall under the heading of exempted development, but which could have significant effects on the environment by reference to criteria set out in the environmental impact assessment directive. The criteria in this regard relate to the characteristics of the proposed development, its size, use of natural resources and so on. The environmental sensitivity of the areas affected is also a consideration, as is the potential for significant effects.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">At present the planning regulations of 2001 exempt those involved in peat extraction from the requirement to apply for permission and conduct an environmental impact assessment in the case of peat extraction in a new or extended area of less than ten hectares, or peat extraction in a new or extended area of ten hectares or more where the drainage of the bogland commenced prior to the coming into force of these regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">The European Commission has indicated a concern in this area and action is needed. This change is a response to that concern. Following negotiations, the Commission is agreed that its concern regarding the transposition of the environmental impact assessment directive, No. 85/337/EEC, as amended by Directive No. 97/11/EC, as it relates to peat extraction can be resolved by a qualification to the existing planning exemption. The exemption would not apply where peat extraction is likely to have significant effects on the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">This would allow the planning authority to assess whether a peat extraction project would have a significant impact. Where it would have such an impact, the authority can step in and require the preparation of a planning application and, if necessary, an environmental impact statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">The Commission is solely concerned with peat extraction activity covered by the planning exemptions but outside of special areas of conservation and natural heritage areas. Peat extraction in these designated areas is subject to separate conservation controls not touched on in this change.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The designation of peatland sites in natural heritage areas should be substantially completed by the end of July 2005, other than in respect of a relatively small number of sites where proposed designation is under appeal. Therefore, the Commission's sole concern relates to peat extraction of less than 10 hectares outside designated areas. I apologise to the House for the extraordinarily complicated nature of this subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">We are confident this amendment to the planning regulations will greatly assist in avoidance of a daily fine for non-implementation and will not have any dire impact on traditional peat extraction or turf cutting.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The final amendment is a technical amendment to Schedule 5 of the 2001 regulations reflecting a relatively minor change to the environmental impact assessment directive, annexes I and II. Part I of the schedule lists the project categories for which an environmental impact assessment is mandatory. Part II lists the project categories for which mandatory thresholds have been set.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The amendments are designed to ensure that any change to, or extension of, a project in Part I will, in itself, require an environmental impact assessment where such a change or extension meets any relevant threshold in Part 1. As currently drafted, such an assessment is mandatory only where a development increases by 25%, or an amount equal to 50% of the appropriate threshold, whichever is the greater. This is more likely to have an impact on other member states than on Ireland because Ireland has a propensity to use environmental impact assessments much more frequently than other member states.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">This change to the lists of project categories transposes part of Directive No. 2003/35/EC, commonly known as the Aarhus directive. This directive provides for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and amending with regard to public participation and access to justice. The transposition of the Aarhus directive will, for the most part, be achieved through regulations under the European Communities Act 1972, and further amendments to the planning and development regulations. Work is in progress on the latter two sets of regulations. I intend that the necessary implementation measures will be adopted during the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">On the overall position on European Union environmental legislation, I assure the House I am fully aware of the importance of timely transposition and correct implementation of such legislation. There are now some 200 items of European Union legislation transposed in this country, including more than 140 directives. The challenge following transposition is effective implementation. In cases where the Commission feels member states have failed to satisfactorily transpose European Union legislation into their national laws and implement it effectively, the issue is raised in correspondence with member states. If agreement is not reached on how to address the issue, the Commission may take a case to the European Court of Justice. However, the vast majority of issues are resolved without recourse to that court.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">The European Commission's fifth annual survey on the implementation and enforcement of Community environmental law showed Ireland's overall performance to be average in comparison to our European Union partners. This means we are not "bottom of the class", as is often suggested, particularly by the Green Party, whose members are not present. However, it also means we still have much work to do in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">My Department, through the local authorities, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of Environmental Enforcement continues to work towards maintaining a high level of environmental protection for Ireland, and to addressing any alleged cases of infringement of European Union environment law.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The task force, which I established in my Department to address the range of environmental complaints against Ireland in a more comprehensive way and which was mentioned previously at a meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, has been fully operational for some months. In addressing its work, the task force has intensified engagement with Commission officials. They have been very positive in that regard. The task force has also intensified engagement with the implementing agencies in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">The task force has undertaken a systematic analysis of each case that is the subject of infringement proceedings by the European Commission and for which my Department is responsible. This analysis has facilitated accelerated responses by Ireland to Commission concerns in a number of cases. It should also help to improve our response to any infringement complaints in future, and to provide full information on the excellent ongoing work being undertaken towards fulfilling our compliance with our European Union obligations.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I commend these amendments to the House. As I stated at the outset, the amendments are very technical. It would have been far more productive if we had all agreed to handle these technical matters at a committee meeting. I know Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in general agreement with me in this regard. A committee meeting would have been a much better way to proceed than proceeding according to the requirement the Green Party imposed on us, which its members are not present to meet.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_548">I would like the Minister to be a man of his word. In a recent reply to a parliamentary question by Deputy Olivia Mitchell, he stated he would, in a very short period, introduce changes to the Planning and Development Regulations 2005. One of the commitments he made in the reply — I do not know whether he or his Department officials wrote it — was that he would address the need for a uniform planning application form throughout the country. The reply stated he would also address the fact that a very significant number of applications are actually turned down by local authorities, as brought to his attention by Deputy Olivia Mitchell. These two issues are very serious. I understand from Deputy Olivia Mitchell that approximately 50% of the applications in her area are turned down by the county council because of errors made in filling out application forms. Has the Minister honoured his word regarding these issues? Has he made the necessary changes to the regulations? Clearly, they have not been made. Neither is there clarity of thought or intent, which the Government ought to demonstrate in dealing with these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">In spite of all the changes the Minister is making, any existing premises that has a licence from the courts to sell alcohol can and will continue to do so. There is no change whatsoever, provided they continue to comply with the law in every respect. However, every new business, convenience store and shop around the country can sell wine from the fridge. It does not need to be the substantial business of the premises, but can represent a very large portion. It will not be the Minister's concept of a little corner fridge, and that is where he is making a mistake. He is requiring people who want to sell beer, which has a lower alcohol content than wine, and spirits to apply for planning permission. However, he is not requiring those who sell wine only to do so. His proposal is ambiguous and lacks clarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">The interim report of the liquor licensing commission strongly disputes some of the issues. The Minister refers to councillors and the community having a say with regard to an off-licence. Due and proper space is given for that in the courts. It is very clear that an applicant for an off-licence must comply with the usual conditions regarding suitability of premises and the other grounds for objection as contained in section 18 of the 2000 Act. The applicant must go before the court and due notice should be given. This is to ensure general conformity with legislation and to give the public and authorities proper grounds for objection. When people object to an application, they are not objecting on grounds of planning or the physical premises but because they do not want it in their neighbourhood and perhaps it has been badly run in the past. All the issues and objections people raise can be dealt with properly and entirely through the courts system.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The commission recommends: "Should a full off-licence be required ... then the applicant shall be obliged to obtain planning permission and shall satisfy the Court at the hearing ... that any conditions have been complied with." This is in the interests of good planning practice and conformity with general practice to ensure that the lay-out of the premises is suitable. It does not make sense to introduce a planning application process for the sale of beer and whiskey but not for bottles of wine. Deputy Perry informed me that for every bottle of whiskey sold, ten bottles of wine go out the door. The Minister has swallowed this line——</p>

          <p eId="para_557">The Minister should not open his mouth too soon. I will not suggest that he will turn the country into a nation of winos. Alcohol is a very serious issue and the people who spoke up at the commission against this proposal should be listened to. The members of the commission considered that the acquisition of a full off-licence for any premises involved a change of use of which the public should be made aware and should be entitled to object to at the planning stage. This recommendation was not acceptable to Ms Carmel Foley, the Director of Consumer Affairs, Ms Isolde Goggin of the Competition Authority and Mr. Brian Whitney representing the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the grounds that any genuine planning issues are already covered by existing planning and licensing laws and this provision presents an unnecessary and unwarranted barrier to entry to the business.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Ms Ailish Forde, RGDATA, considered the scrutiny of the courts to be sufficient and the involvement of planning authorities inappropriate. On the other hand, some of the members were of the view that a planning permission requirement should also apply to new wine-only licences. These members were Messrs. Frank Fell, Licensed Vintners Association, Michael Murphy, IBEC, Tadgh O'Sullivan, Vintners Federation of Ireland, and John Power, Irish Hotels Federation.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">On one side people are trying to vindicate consumer rights and competition and on the other there are people with an interest in the business. The Minister has clearly taken one side——</p>

Perhaps the Minister should have considered the sale of beer, but he did not take that option. In America, low-alcohol beers are available in convenience stores, but not those with a higher alcohol content. The availability of spirits and alcopops is a very serious issue. The whole situation is a mess and the Minister has not thought it through. I therefore oppose the regulation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_567">This issue was discussed in 2000 and there was a significant amount of debate on this specific proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">I am disappointed the issue of afforestation has not been considered in respect of the regulations. There is concern in the Minister's county, as well as in many other counties, because the provisions do not allow a mechanism for public objection to forestry in instances when a community or individual is completely isolated by the type of forestry development taking place. The only mechanism available at this time is to object to the grant support that they may be eligible to apply for through the Department of Agriculture and Food. Will the Minister look at that specific issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The issue of peat extraction is close to my heart. This proposal has been brought forward because of the decision by the European Court of Justice. What has been the major change with regard to that decision from September 1999? This issue was discussed and debated in the House in 2000. A proposal was put forward at that time and the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said that with regard to the environmental impact assessment, he was examining the requirement to reduce the threshold of 50 hectares. He said that this would address the concerns of the European Court in a transparent manner and that there should be no further difficulty when it was done. However, it seems that there is further difficulty. Where did the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, slip up with regard to this issue? He seemed to be incompetent in respect of many areas when he was in charge of this brief, but how did he slip up with regard to this specific matter?</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The word "significant" gives rise to huge concern in my constituency where people who cut turf, either for their own use or on a small commercial basis, could be roped in under this definition. Many bog owners and people with turbary rights cut turf on an acre plot. Half of the plot has been traditionally cut out and most active plots are approximately half an acre in size. Once the turbary rights are exhausted people must find some other form of fuel. However, the difficulty is that if one takes turf cutting on a contiguous basis on a bank of turf where individuals all along that bank have half-acre plots, one could very easily reach some of the thresholds in the regulations. Then some official in the local authority or an alleged do-gooder from some part of the European Union, who is visiting here and wants turf-cutting to be abolished because all the turf in his or her country has been cut, could decide that the turf-cutting has a significant effect. All of a sudden, individuals who are cutting three or four spreads of turf for their use and that of their neighbours will have to apply for planning permission and conduct an environmental impact assessment. That is the concern about these regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">The way that environmental impact is defined in the regulations could give rise to a situation where people who are cutting turf on a small, commercial basis or for their own use will be required to have an environmental impact assessment carried out because of the issue of taking a number of turf banks together along a particular bog. In that scenario, it is not just one individual half-acre plot. There could be a number of plots along the bank to be cut. That would be the normal procedure in that an operator would come in with a digger and a hopper, cut along the length of the bank, the turf would be spread out, dried, saved and then transported.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Livelihoods are at stake. Many contractors have put significant investment into upgrading their equipment. There has been much talk about the impact of turf cutting on blanket and raised bogs, but there has been very little acknowledgment of the fact that operators have moved away from the use of the sausage machine, owing to the assistance and encouragement provided by my colleague on this side of the House, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and now use the hopper procedure which does not have the same type of negative environmental impact. As well as that, we must realise that we are talking about small plots on the edge of bogs. The majority of bogs in this country are either State owned or State controlled. We are referring to half-acre plots in many cases, and sometimes even smaller than that, on the edge of bogs. Cutting turf in such plots using a hopper will not have a detrimental environmental impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">I do not know the reason for these new definitions and changes in the rules. The former Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said that he addressed this issue in 2000, so how have the sands shifted regarding the same European Court of Justice decision? I would like an answer to that question. I would also like a firm commitment from the Minister that this will not have an impact on turf-cutting on a small, commercial basis or by individuals on their own or a neighbour's bank in County Roscommon and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">Will the Minister examine a proposal that was put forward to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government, for the development of a wetland wilderness park in the cutaway bogs of the north midlands? It would have a major economic benefit from a tourism point of view in that region. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to that proposal which is being submitted to his office.</p>

          <p eId="para_575">I agree with the Minister that this motion should have been considered by an Oireachtas committee where we could have teased it out in greater detail. I do not accept, however, the Minister placing the blame for that on the Green Party. Obviously, Deputy Cuffe can answer for his party in that respect, but I do not buy that the Minister did not bring his proposal to an Oireachtas committee because the Green Party objected to it. If that were the case, many proposals that are brought to the House or to committees would never appear. It is the first time I have ever heard that a Minister would not bring a proposal to a committee because an Opposition party of any size objected to it. I do not buy that argument.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_577">There is a different reason, which I will come to in a moment. The motion has the potential to cause uproar in rural areas. The proposals before the House relating to peat extraction are a Trojan horse. The Minister may be right in saying that the proposals arise from the judgment of the European Court of Justice and the prospect that this country will face a daily fine of €26,000 if the issue is not addressed. However, the European Court of Justice imposed that fine two years ago. The Minister had two years to bring the issue before an Oireachtas committee; he did not have to leave it until the last week before the Dáil rises for the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Furthermore, the issue first arose six years ago in 1999 and the Government had plenty of time to bring proposals on this issue to an Oireachtas committee or into the body of the House if it was of the mind to do so. We now have a motion, introduced two days before the Dáil rises, which will give rise to set of circumstances which will result in people who have traditionally cut turf for their own use on their own bogs now having to obtain planning permission and undertake an environmental impact assessment before the turf can be cut.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">When the uproar starts — and this is where I come back to the Green Party — and the back bench Deputies of the Minister's party and the Government parties are confronted with it in their constituencies, they will blame the Green Party. They will say that the Green Party would not allow the matter to be discussed. That is what the blame of the Green Party is about.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_581">Let us examine what is being proposed here. The Minister has found a formula to get around the judgment of the European Court of Justice and it is that an environmental impact assessment will be required where there is a significant impact on the environment. However, if one examines the criteria for that, one sees that they are wide open.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">Deputy Naughten is right. If this was a situation where one was talking about individuals cutting turf with their own sleán on their own bank in their own bog, it would probably be fine. However, that is not what is happening now. These days a machine goes onto a bog and cuts turf for a number of people. By my reckoning, once a machine is cutting for around 20 people, it will be covered by these regulations and the operator will have to submit to an environmental impact assessment. This is why this issue should have been teased out in an Oireachtas committee and not in the last week of the Dáil session. It should have been dealt with long before now. This matter was held over until the last week, if not the last minute, so that the Minister could be in and out in no time and when the turf hits the fan, so to speak, he can blame the Green Party. That is the politics of this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_587">I expect that the Minister will confront a few angry public meetings on this issue in his own county. That is all in front of him, but what I want to nail here is the bit of political cleverality, to coin a phrase, that is being engaged in by the Minister to deflect the flak that will inevitably arise from this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Two issues have been used to dress this up and make it look like it we are dealing with some wider amendment of the planning regulations. The first is to do with off-licences and I do not have any disagreement with the Minister's intent. Clearly where a shop selling sweets and newspapers is converting to an off-licence, it should be required to apply for a change of use permission. However, the situation is not always as clear-cut as that example and the Minister has left it ambiguous.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The new off-licence arrangements are very often in conjunction with an other activity which takes place in the shop. Typically, a filling station builds a new 24-hour shop, part of which sells alcohol. It is not entirely clear and I am not entirely clear in my mind whether it will be necessary for those who have already done so to apply for retention. I am not clear as to where the distinction lies between what the Minister describes as wine being sold from a fridge and part of a shop being used for the sale of alcohol and neither is it clear which activity will require planning permission. I am not clear if there is a distinction between the sale of wine and the sale of beers. Is the sale of beer from a fridge exempted from planning permission whereas the sale of beer outside a fridge requires planning permission? It is a pity the House did not have more time to tease out these areas of ambiguity.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I refer to the definition of "shop" in the motion. The sale of hot food is also being excluded. I am a little puzzled at this provision. Many shops sell hot food nowadays, in particular, filling station shops with a takeaway hot food counter. Will separate planning permission be required for the hot food arrangement? Some newer supermarkets also sell hot food. Will they be required to apply for a separate planning permission? I note this is listed in the definition of what is being exempted from the definition of a shop.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The second area turfed in, so to speak, with the peat extraction issue which is the reason for this motion, is the Aarhus Convention. What is delaying the implementation of the convention and why is only a portion of it being given effect in these regulations, particularly when the convention was to have been implemented last weekend? Why is the entire convention not being implemented? We had an exchange in the House yesterday about the Minister's planned infrastructural legislation. Why is the thrust of that proposal moving away from the Aarhus Convention? The convention is partly about making information on environmental matters available to the public but it is also concerned with the right of the public to participate in environmental decision-making from an early stage. The public does not have the right to be involved at an early stage in respect of major infrastructural projects in particular. In the case of the third pillar which is the right to challenge in a court of law public decisions made with regard either to information or public consultation, the thrust of the proposed legislation is away from the Aarhus Convention. I ask the Minister to address two questions. Why is only a part of the Aarhus Convention being implemented? Why does Ireland appear to drift away from the principles enshrined in it?</p>
          <p eId="para_592">This motion is to amend the planning regulations and to address the area of exempted development. I am surprised the Minister did not take the opportunity to address the problems associated with the erection of mobile telephone masts and antennae. The Minister must be aware that considerable problems have arisen in many parts of the country with regard to the erection of masts and antennae on public property and claims being made that they are exempted development. Bodies such as CIE or ESB have erected them on their sites and claim exemptions because they are related in some way to their activities or are part of a shared facility for some other purpose. This is an issue that has caused considerable problems. If this motion is concerned with changing the regulations on exempted developments, I am surprised the Minister did not take the opportunity to deal with this issue. The answer to that question is connected to my first point about this motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This motion is about slipping through the dramatic change in peat extraction and turf cutting under the guise that this is some innocuous, technical change in planning regulations. When those members of the public who will be affected become aware of it, the Minister and his colleagues will then blame it all on the Green Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">I agree with the previous speaker and with the Minister when he stated that this motion should have been referred to a parliamentary committee for discussion. This would have provided a better opportunity to tease it out and the exchange of information would have been a better exercise than this present one which is in the old format of both sides shouting across the floor of the House at each other. While I am not totally convinced by the conspiracy theories it would have been a better format than the one we are currently enjoying.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I welcome the regulation relating to off-licences because this is an area requiring tighter regulation. A walk through O'Connell Street will provide examples of small shops and supermarkets substantially engaged in off sales of alcohol and the consequential contribution of that activity to disturbances. Significant alcohol-related disturbances have occurred on St. Patrick's Day in recent years. The off-licences in O'Connell Street cannot be blamed for all those disturbances but it provides an example of where the situation needs to be checked.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">The reference to hot food causes me some concern. Modern living is convenience living and people will call into whatever little shop opens up. Most filling stations and local shops now have a hot plate area offering a range of hot, precooked food. I am worried they may be caught in the net. Such services are an integral part of modern living. If those shops were to seek planning permission and face objections from a competitor up the road and then be required to go through the process of an appeal to An Bord Pleanála, it would be a retrograde step and I would not welcome such a move. The hot food element is sufficiently regulated.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_356">
            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_601">As the Deputy is aware, my Department, supported by Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each Department to report on progress on the implementation of RAPID and details of funding allocations to the projects that fall within the remit of their Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">However, Departments were asked recently to track funding against specific projects submitted in RAPID plans from each area. While this exercise is still under way, I am informed by ADM that Departments have to date reported a spend in the order of €300 million in RAPID areas since the inception of the programme. It should be noted that this amount relates solely to specific projects in RAPID plans and does not include funding for RAPID areas by Departments, which are in addition to the RAPID plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">Despite a slow start the RAPID programme is now making a valuable contribution in disadvantaged communities. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, tackling disadvantage will require long-term commitment by Government and in this regard I believe that the RAPID programme should continue beyond 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_604">The programme is progressing on a number of levels in tandem and clearly the benefits at local level are becoming evident. In the first instance, many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans are being dealt with more effectively at local level. A dedicated fund of €7.5 million has been put in place in 2005 to support small-scale capital projects, through co-funding with other Departments or local agencies as appropriate. I have announced a number of co-funded schemes this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_605">Further funding has been allocated to two schemes that operated in 2004. Total funding of €4.5 million is available over two years —2005-06 — for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme, which is co-funded with local authorities through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Small-scale capital works to enhance the physical environment within local authority housing estates and flat complexes are supported under this scheme. The RAPID playgrounds scheme, which provides funding for the development or refurbishment of playgrounds has also been launched again this year, with total funding of €3 million being provided by my Department and the Department of Health and Children through the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_606">This year I announced a new traffic measures scheme for RAPID areas with total funding of €2.025 million. This scheme is being co-funded with local authorities and will support small-scale capital works to improve road safety in RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_607">Total funding of €4.6 million is being made available by my Department and the Department of Health and Children through the Health Service Executive on a 50:50 basis to support a range of health and community projects in RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_608">My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, recently invited applications for funding under the community based CCTV scheme. My Department will provide funding in addition to resources allocated by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to successful applications from RAPID areas that are endorsed by the area implementation teams. A number of other co-funded measures are under consideration and I expect to make further announcements on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">As regards the larger projects from RAPID plans that have been submitted to Departments, these will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect that Departments will deal with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will also continue as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">Special provision was made by the Government for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. RAPID areas have benefited from 57.5% of the €56.2 million in funding allocated to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Discussions are ongoing with Departments regarding prioritisation of other non-capital actions included in the AIT plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">As the Deputy is aware, the RAPID programme is running in conjunction with the National Development Plan 2000-2006. While no formal decisions have been taken on the lifetime of the RAPID programme, the indications are that it will continue post-2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_618">A number of years ago, prior to 2002. I can provide proof of that for the Minister if he so wishes. However, that is another broken promise. An estimated €300 million has been spent under the programme. All Departments have been asked to submit reports on funding under it and so on. Departments must not have spent much under this programme because they are not shouting about it. The Minister's colleagues in Government are not shy when it comes to making announcements on the spending of money. Why is there not a separate subhead for this programme in each Department's Estimate? In that way we would know exactly what is spent on the RAPID programme. The people do not know the exact amount being spent on it, and they need to know that.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">People were led up the garden path in terms of the RAPID programme. People in my community became involved in this issue, attended many meetings and met elected representatives to put forward new ideas for projects under the RAPID programme. They have plenty of ideas but funding under the programme is not coming through quickly enough. The Minister's Department was allocated only €7.5 million for the programme this year and €4.5 million last year, and his Department is central to this programme. I hope we will hear major announcements in regard to the programme next year and the year after.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">The Minister has twice publicly said, for which I commend him, that the RAPID programme is essential and should continue. Is there something about it we do not know? Is there a doubt about the future of the programme when the NDP comes to an end in 2006 because now and on a previous occasion the Minister said that he called for it to continue, hoped the money allocated for it would be increased and that it would continue to operate? Is there a fear that funding for the RAPID programme will be cut and will that programme lose out if there is a change to the NDP?</p>

            <p eId="para_621">As I explained to Members previously, the RAPID programme was about front-loading expenditure under the national development plan, under the existing headings. For example, under a housing heading, the idea was that a RAPID area would get priority over other areas when housing allocations would be made by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. For example, under a health heading, there would be a scoring up in the case of a RAPID area. That is what the programme is about. If the Deputy were to check the press releases when the RAPID programme commenced, he would note that is what the programme is about.</p>

            <p eId="para_623">If the Deputy has the information I am seeking, will he make it available to me? The figure of €2 billion that is mentioned by everyone was also mentioned to me shortly after I become Minister. I asked people to gather all the press releases when the RAPID programme was launched, but I did not find any reference to that figure in them. If someone can give me that quote I will be eternally grateful because I cannot find it. However, I suspect that the Taoiseach said that there was a €2 billion provision for social inclusion measures in the national development plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I cannot find any specific reference to that figure in all the documentation I was given. I asked my civil servants to check through documents for a specific commitment of €2 billion for RAPID areas. I accept it is stated somewhere and I am not trying to allege that the Deputy is making it up. If it is stated, what we are talking about is the spend, in other words, expenditure on a health centre and so on. The figure I quoted of €300 million does not represent social inclusion spend, it is matched off against what was in the RAPID plans, which would not tally with the total spend in the areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">We are serious about addressing needs in areas of deprivation. However, we need to focus not only on the total spend in those areas, which is important, but also what the funding is spent on. I gave a classic example on an earlier occasion of the right way and the wrong way to allocate funding. A great deal of money was spent — I remember it being spent — on the building of Ballymun flats 30 or 40 years ago and they are now being knocked down. That money was badly spent in that there was no social planning and so on. What is happening in Ballymun today is different because there is a buy-in to that by the local community. There are many strands to RAPID and it is not all about money, though money is incredibly important. However, the second thing that is different this time is that we are looking for buy in from communities. That is absolutely essential so the money is well spent in terms of the social dividend it gives to the communities in RAPID areas. We could be obsessed totally in seeing it as a money gain. It is not as simple as that. It is a matter as well of spending the money in a way the communities recognise will improve their lives.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">On the last point I totally agree with the Minister. We have to give value for money and there is a need for buy in from the communities and so on. We have had that in many areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">They have put forward plans and the funding is not coming. I certainly will find the statement made by the Taoiseach in this regard. I know the Minister did not say it. When it is brought up on this side of the House it is as an attempt to back the Minister's fight to get more money for RAPID. That is the only reason for raising it, not to embarrass anybody and certainly not the Minister. It is to prove the point. People were given commitments and now we want that money brought forward so we can get results. My fear is that people in disadvantaged areas are not getting all the help they need. They are getting it in certain places but more could be done. Other Departments need to buck up and do more. We all know that if much more money was being spent on the RAPID programme, we would hear about it, so €300 million is the maximum. That is a long way short of the €2 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">Does the Minister know whether there is to be increased funding for the RAPID areas next year, even in his own Department? Are there commitments in place? As regards the long-term future of RAPID, is there something we do not know about? That is a cause of some worry and it is something the Minister has referred to on a few occasions.</p>

            <p eId="para_632">I will try to answer the questions briefly. The first thing I find, meeting co-ordinators, chairpersons of AITs and directors of community and enterprise services in the various local authorities, is that there is an enormous buy in to RAPID now. If the Deputy had been at the recent meeting we had here in Dublin, he would——</p>

            <p eId="para_634">——have found a very positive view. Since it is coming up to the summer break, we have a DVD that was made by the RAPID groups all along the west coast. A copy is being made available to every Member of the Oireachtas so they may see what the RAPID communities are saying about themselves. I had no hand, act or part in the preparation of this DVD, and neither had my Department. This was something they decided to do for themselves. They are saying it is a positive story and I suggest we listen to them rather than what the media tell us they are telling us, which is very different.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">——about this and that is why CLÁR is different because it pre-dates that section. I had reservations about the measurement of front-loading because it was spending under the national development plan. I felt, very simply, that it would be good to have a small fund that could be co-funded with other Departments to deal with all the myriad of small projects that came through as RAPID plans that could not be in the national development plan because they are too small, but are still needed. I thought this was a great idea and certainly the RAPID areas think it is fantastic because it is delivering on the ground fast. It is very special to them and it is interesting that people want to get into the RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">The Deputy asked about the long term. The reality is that we do not have a national development plan after 2006 for roads, so nobody can say with certainty what the road programme will be like after that. Similarly, I cannot say on a technical level, since there is no NDP after 2006 and because this is linked to that plan, that RAPID as it is today will be exactly the same after that date. I do not doubt in my heart and soul that RAPID will exist in some form similar to what it is at present. I would not have put so much time and effort into it if I was not 100% certain that it would be. Finally, we have extended the whole RAPID thought process way beyond where we started, for example with dormant accounts. The figure I mentioned, 57%, was not in anything at the beginning. It was not part of the programme. The equal measure of €7 million was ringfenced. It is fair to say that Departments and Government agencies are now beginning to realise that RAPID is there and will continue to be for the long term and that it needs to be given priority across a whole range of issues, even those which were not part of the original idea.</p>

Ceapann tuismitheoirí go gcuireann an córas oideachais isteach ar a n-iarrachtaí an Ghaeilge a thabhairt don chéad ghlúin eile mar theanga bheo. Tá sé seo á chur ar ceal, agus ní éiríonn leo aon dílseacht a chothú don Ghaoluinn sa chéad ghlúin eile.

Aontaím go bhfuil dúshlán dochreidte ann. Ar an taobh eile den scéal, chuala mé daoine ag labhairt ar líon na scoileanna atá ag múineadh trí Bhéarla, ach caithfear cuimhneamh, mar shampla, go gclúdaíonn sé sin scoileanna in áiteanna ar nós Bhaile an Chláir, Tír an Oileáin agus mar sin de. Is é an Ghaeltacht mar atá sainorduithe tugtha di a bhí i gceist, agus tuigimid le fada an lá nach bhfuil an Ghaeilge in uachtar i measc an phobail i gcuid de na ceantair sin.</p>

Tá comhchainteanna agus plé leanúnach idir mo Roinn agus an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta le féachaint cén chaoi ar féidir linn déileáil leis na dúshláin atá ann ó thaobh chúrsaí oideachais sa nGaeltachtde. Is fiú nótáil, ag éirí as tuarascáil Choimisiún na Gaeltachta, go raibh mo Roinn i dteagmháil leis an Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta ar son an choiste comhairligh Gaeltachta chomh fada siar le Bealtaine 2003. Ba é ansin a tháinig an tuarascáil seo chun cinn, mar bhi an t-eolas ag teastáil uainn, agus anois tá sí á feidhmiú. Beidh sé tábhachtach go bhfeidhmeofar í. Thiocfainn go hiomlán leis an Teachta.

Nach bhfuil sé i bhfad níos tábhachtaí airgead a chaitheamh ar an scolaíocht sa nGaeltacht seachas ar an Acht Teanga nó, fiú amháin, ar an stádas oifigiúil atá bainte amach ag an nGaeilge san Eoraip? De réir na tuarascála, bíonn 10% de na daltaí a thagann amach as na bunscoileanna agus na hiarbhunscoileanna sa nGaeltacht ar bheagán Gaeilge. Fágann 25% de na daltaí an bhunscoil gan ach leibhéal réasúnta Gaeilge acu. Tagann 8% acu amach as na hiarbhunscoileanna gan ach leibhéal réasúnta Gaeilge acu. Nach n-aontódh an tAire liom? Más rud é go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i mbaol — agus is é sin an rud atá á rá agam anois — má theipeann ar an nGaeltacht, teipfidh ar gach rud. Nár cheart don Rialtas tabhairt faoin scéal seo go práinneach agus rud éigin substaintiúil a dhéanamh? Tá an t-am ag druidim orainn anois. Tá an meath ann le fada, agus is ag dul in olc a bheas an scéal. Tá an Rialtas ag déileáil le rudaí atá teibí— cáipéisí nach léann éinne a aistriú go Gaoluinn. Ar an láimh eile, áfach, tá an Ghaeltacht i mbaol. Tá Gaeilge na ndaltaí atá ag freastal ar na scoileanna ag dul i laige. Tá an scéal ina phrácás ar fad.</p>

         asked the

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_661">I remind the Deputy that responsibility for housing persons with mental or physical disability rests with my colleagues, the Ministers for Health and Children and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. However, with regard to the context in which the Deputy has tabled the question, he should note that the development of new piers in recent years both on the island to which he refers and the adjacent mainland has satisfied a key remit of my Department to provide safe access to the island in question. In addition, his reference to the abandonment of a cable car project to the island — incidentally, the only island to which such a service is under consideration — is inaccurate.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">The facts are that a grant of €1.84 million was approved by me to the relevant local authority for the provision of a cable car and associated services to the island. Furthermore, the local authority was recently authorised by me to purchase lands which had been the subject of compulsory purchase order processes so that all realistic options for providing the cable car service could be usefully explored.</p>
            <p eId="para_663">In addition, my Department has engaged in discussions with Ireland West Tourism and the local authority with a view to ascertaining the tourism potential of the project and is actively examining the feasibility of securing partners from the private sector to build and operate the facility.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_392">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_664">I welcome the Minister's reply because many people on the island in question believe the cable car project is dead. I acknowledge his comments in this regard and welcome any progress on the project. The late Pól Ó Foighil — God be good to him — was very proactive on this issue and the Minister has visited the island on many occasions. I also welcome improvements in the piers and in access to the island, without which islanders would be stranded.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">People with illnesses experience considerable difficulty travelling to and from the island and have been looking forward to having a cable car facility, which should have been developed a long time ago. Constituents of mine have suggested that in light of the length of time required to develop the facility and the problems it has experienced, it might be preferable for them to be rehoused on the mainland. What are the Minister's views on islanders suffering from illness moving to the mainland? While I appreciate that housing people with disabilities is the responsibility of other Departments, will the Minister consider facilitating people with cancer who may need to move to the mainland for a period or older people who wish to live close to medical services which are unavailable on the island?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_393" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_666">Unfortunately, as the Deputy will be aware, only a small number of people live on Inishbiggle, an island which has experienced a significant population decline in recent years. I doubt if anybody on the island is in any doubt as to the Department's position on the cable car project, given that I visited the island during my most recent visit to County Mayo and spent more than an hour explaining the precise position and the parameters within which I was working. I also promised islanders that I would inform them if the Department had approved the project once my discussions with Ireland West Tourism and others had concluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">The tragedy is that the cable car project could have proceeded many years ago had it not been for various local difficulties and objections lodged at various stages. While people are entitled to object, the Department had to wait until all the problems were overcome before issuing compulsory purchase orders and so forth. The scenario I faced in spring was that, on the one hand, I had a report on my desk indicating that the cable car facility could not be justified purely as an island project while, on the other, I was facing a deadline as regards the decision to purchase the land required for the project. I took the decision that the deadline was too close and I had not done enough homework in terms of examining the project's tourism potential to defray some of the costs of constructing a cable car facility. As a result, I instructed my officials to inform Mayo County Council that it should proceed with the purchase of the land in question to ensure the project would remain intact.</p>
            <p eId="para_668">The Department will have to make a decision on the issue. I have always believed, conditional on a wide range of factors falling into place, that the project has island potential as well as significant tourism potential, particularly in light of the development of Ballycroy. This development potential will only be realised, however, if the cable car operator drives it.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">The question of old people living on the island who need to move to the mainland is a catch-22, although it was not meant as such, in that if I am seen to be proactively encouraging or assisting people to leave the island, others on the island will argue that my intention is to kill the island. However, if I do not get proactively involved in assisting those who need to leave the island, I will be accused of not looking after people's needs. If someone is seriously ill, the local authorities should look favourably on an application from that person and I would make a strong case that if there were good medical or social reasons for a person to leave the island, the fact that he or she has a house on the island should not be a reason for not giving that person a house on the mainland. I would articulate that view on behalf of someone on an island who needed mainland residence because of illness if I was asked to. I do not want someone saying that because a person has a perfectly good house, he or she can stay there. If illness is involved, and if it would be better for his or her health to stay on the mainland, it would be right and humane and I would make that point to any local authority. My experience, however, is that local authorities are sympathetic. They are trying to keep the same balance as us — not to depopulate the island in a driven fashion and to take a social view of individual circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_670">I appreciate that the Minister was on the island and that he is sincere but people have been waiting for so long that they do not believe what they are told.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">Dedicated helicopter emergency medical services would make people feel much more secure on the islands. The Minister knows of the tragedies that have occurred on the islands. There is currently a delay in getting the definitive medical treatment the helicopter emergency services would bring to the islands. Would the Minister support this? It does not fall within the remit of his Department but he might ask his colleagues to support helicopter emergency medical services. They would be a great boon to older people on the islands and a reason for people to stay there.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">Inishbiggle has one of the best helipads in the country and my Department put it in. I recognise that helicopter evacuation in terms of illness or other emergencies is vital. Doctors based on the islands full-time always tell me they get an excellent service from both the search and rescue helicopter and the Air Corps.</p>

            <p eId="para_674">I have kept in touch about this. There is more than one doctor on the Arann Islands and I have not received any complaints about availability, particularly from the Arann Islands, which have the largest population and the most calls out. Other doctors on the west coast have said the same.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_675">It is not just a question of availability but having the right equipment to do the job. People have been become hypothermic while waiting for intensive care medical treatment that helicopter emergency medical services would have but the Air Corps and search and rescue units do not have. I worked on Clare Island and Inishturk and I can vouch for the fact that while the service is welcome, it is not dedicated and its availability and the equipment it carries depends on the other jobs it must do. The helicopter emergency medical service would be a flying intensive care unit that would bring definitive medical treatment to people on the islands.</p>

        <b>Mr. English</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
        the main aspects of the national drugs strategy for which considerable progress remains to be achieved; the way in which he intends to ensure that all of the 100 recommendations in the strategy and those amended through the mid-term review of the strategy are implemented in full by the strategy’s end; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_404">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_682">The Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion agreed the report of the steering group on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy in April and it was published earlier this month. The report is the culmination of the mid-term review, a comprehensive review process launched last year and included extensive public consultations.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">A steering group, chaired by my Department, made up of the relevant Departments and agencies, as well as the community and voluntary sectors oversaw the review. External consultants also assisted the steering group. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at this mid-point stage and, in this regard, the group concentrated on identifying adjustments to the existing strategy and highlighting priorities for the second phase up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">The steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound. There are encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when the strategy was first launched which suggest that our current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving effective. At the same time, however, the review highlights the need to re-focus priorities and accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008. In this context, new actions and amendments have been identified. These changes should help strengthen the strategy and enable it to better deliver its aims.</p>
            <p eId="para_685">Ten of the strategy's existing actions are being replaced, seven of the existing actions are being amended and there are eight new actions that aim to address issues such as family support and rehabilitation. The review found that 49 of the original 100 actions outlined in the strategy are completed or of an on-going nature, progress was on-going on a further 45 and there were six actions on which considerable progress has to be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_686">Of the six, actions 61 and 72, relating to halfway houses and drugs training for professionals, are of a long-term nature and require considerably more work to bring them about and this is continuing. Other actions are the subject of specific recommendations in the mid-term review, such as the eleventh action on the community policing fora, action 63 on needle exchange and action 77 on meeting the Oireachtas committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">On action 23, the Irish Prison Service advises that it would not be useful to undertake a review at this time. It would be more beneficial to introduce the new prisons drugs policy and to undertake the review when the new policy has been in place for a reasonable period to allow for meaningful evaluation. It is proposed that the review will be initiated in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">On monitoring the strategy, the mid-term review has been a very useful exercise, allowing for a stock-take of progress at this mid-point in time. The strategy will continue to be monitored through the interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair and through the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion. The IDG meets regularly to assess progress by Departments and agencies in achieving the targets set for them and any obstacle to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light and discussed at these meetings. Reports on the implementation of the strategy are presented to the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion on a regular basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">My Department, in conjunction with the relevant Departments and agencies, will draw up a revised framework for the implementation of the recommendations in the mid-term review, including timescales. This will be presented to the IDG in the coming months.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DamienEnglishFG" eId="spk_405">
            <from>Mr. English</from>
            <p eId="para_690">The mid-term review showed some progress but I fear we might become complacent. There are still many problems because progress is not balanced, it has been made in the city but the problems are growing worse in the regions, with a report yesterday showing that deaths had risen ten fold. The new framework should concentrate on all areas and not just the city. There is no point fixing one problem while other problems are developing around us, which we ignore. Effort must be put into work in the regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">How many of the regional drugs task forces have submitted plans? Have those plans been reviewed? What plans exist for funding them? Will the Department play an active role in pushing for results? There has been a lack of urgency in dealing with the regional drugs task forces in recent years. It is too easy to say they have not reported or submitted their plans. The Department must drive the regional task forces to get results and make changes. The Department cannot do everything but it must give them a bit of a push and display a sense of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The Minister of State is not responsible for all the problems but he is the man in charge of driving these projects. How proactive is the Department of Health and Children? According to the Department's figures, 59 initiatives are still awaiting implementation. What role will the Department of Health and Children play? Is it considering a withdrawal of support from the drugs task forces, leaving them to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs?</p>
            <p eId="para_693">The Department of Health and Children failed to provide immediate access for drug abusers to professional assessment and counselling by health board services in all areas. There are major waiting lists. That is the fault of the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive which have failed to develop enough drop-in centres and half-way houses for which there is a major demand. In the judicial area, the rolling out of the community policing fora is badly needed as they do work. Communities must become involved in solving their problems and young people must be involved in projects in their areas, getting to know the gardaí through the community policing fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">Not every Garda station has a specific drug unit or squad. A station may have access to one or be able to request a drugs unit from headquarters. This is not good enough as a rapid reaction is needed. The Garda will put more effort into tackling other criminal activity which is easier because drugs offences are more long term.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_695">Progress has been considerable. Seven of the ten regional plans have been submitted. The first tranche of resources of these will be announced in the next ten to 14 days. The Department is driving it through the national drugs strategy team. The problem has spread to other Leinster towns as evidenced with the recent deaths, which are sad. That is what the regional task force plans will attempt to address. We have not always got co-operation from some towns, which I do not wish to name.</p>

            <p eId="para_697">However, some of these towns have adopted the attitude that the problem does not exist or if it is ignored it will go away. The only way to tackle a problem is by providing services. Treatment is one of the main pillars of the strategy, which is focussed through the Department of Health and Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">There were indications that some new people in the Health Service Executive were trying to back off on this as the drugs strategy is not the only problem the executive has. Some new brooms would rather it went away. However, I believe we have successfully handled this issue.</p>

Táim sásta freisin go n-éireoidh leis na comhlachtaí poiblí na dualgais reachtúla a thitfidh orthu go céimiúil faoin Acht a chomhlíonadh agus go deimhin go nglacfaidh said leis an dúshlán le meon dearfach agus sa spiorad ceart. Ar ndóigh, beidh gach scéim dréachtaithe ag na comhlachtaí poiblí i gcomhthéacs agus ar bhonn na n-acmhainní, idir airgead agus foireann, atá acu nó a bheidh ar fáil dóibh le linn thréimhse na scéime. Ní féidir gach rud a bhaint amach thar oíche agus, mar a dúirt mé ón dtús, is í an aidhm atá agam ná go mbeidh feabhsúcháin á mbaint amach, thar thréimhse roinnt scéimeanna b'fhéidir, ar leibhéal agus ar chaighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí a bhíonn á gcur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge, de réir éilimh.</p>

Tá scéim mo Roinne féin faoin Acht don tréimhse 2004-07 foilsithe freisin ó 30 Meán Fómhair 2004 agus tá sí ar fáil anois mar eiseamlár do chomhlachtaí poiblí eile.</p>

I measc na gcomhlachtaí sin tá Ranna, údaráis áitiúla, boird sláinte agus institiúidí 3ú leibhéil. Tá na dreacht-scéimeamma sin á scrúdú ag oifigigh mo Roinne le tamall anuas agus tá áthas orm a chur in iúl go bhfuil cuid mhaith de na dréacht-scéimeanna sin daingnithe agam anois.

            <p eId="para_706">Tá roghnú an chéad ghrúpa eile de chomhlachtaí poiblí, a mbeidh mé ag iarraidh orthu dréacht-scéim a ullmhú, idir lámha agam agus tá i gceist agam fógra faoi sin a dhéanamh go han-luath.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as ucht an fhreagra sin. Go dtí seo, áfach, níl ach 25 comhlacht poiblí agus Roinn i gceist. Céard atá le rá aige faoin bhfigiúr a luaigh a chomhghleacaí, an tAire Sóisialta agus Gnóthaí Teaghlaigh, an Teachta Brennan, go gcosnódh sé€500,000 forálacha an Achta a chur i bhfeidhm sa Roinn sin? Cad atá le rá aige faoin urlabhraí de chuid Aer Lingus a dúirt nach bhfuil siad sásta leis an Acht, ós rud é go mbeidh siad in iomaíocht le comhlachtaí príobháideacha nach mbeidh forálacha an Achta ag baint leo? Céard faoin meastachán sealadach a cuireadh isteach anuraidh go gcosnódh sé€8 milliún do na comhairlí contae agus cathrach forálacha an Achta a chur i bhfeidhm?</p>
            <p eId="para_709">Tá a fhios ag an Aire go bhfuil mé á cháineadh féin agus ag cáineadh na Roinne le fada ós rud é nach ndearnadh aon mheastachán ceart ar na costais forálacha an Achta a chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán. Déarfaidh mé an rud seo leis, áfach. Bhíomar ag caint inniu mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht i mbaol. Is é an rud atá ag goilliúint orm ná go bhfuil seans ann go mbeidh cáipéisí nach léifidh éinne á n-aistriú go Gaoluinn. Deir daoine go ndéanfar an rud céanna leis an mBéarla — go mbíonn cáipéisí Béarla ann nach léann éinne agus nach aon stró é an rud céanna a dhéanamh ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Ní aon fhreagra é sin. Is ceart na cáipéisí Béarla nach léitear a chur ar ceal freisin. Sin an rud is tábhachtaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I ndeireadh na dála, áfach, tá an chuma ar an scéal go gcosnóidh sé cuid mhaith airgid forálacha an Achta a chur i bhfeidhm go hiomlán do thart ar 642 comhlacht poiblí agus Roinn. Céard faoi Aer Lingus, Bus Éireann agus Bus Átha Cliath, áfach? Tá siadsan in iomaíocht le comhlachtaí príobháideacha agus ní bheidh na forálacha seo ag baint leo sin. Sin rud ar cheart don Aire díriú air freisin. Nach bhfuil sé in am anois meastachán a dhéanamh ar cé mhéad a chosnóidh sé go díreach don Stát agus do na comhlachtaí poiblí an tAcht seo a chur i bhfeidhm? Níl mórán airgid ag aon Roinn, agus go mórmhór ag na húdaráis áitiúla — airgead a bheadh á chaitheamh ar rudaí nach bhfuil aon fhiúntas ag baint leo i ndáiríre. Beidh neart cáipéisí ann agus an-easpa leitheoirí.</p>

            <p eId="para_711">Maidir le hAer Lingus, mar is eol don Teachta, tá soláthar san Acht le haghaidh an ruda a d'ardaigh sé.

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_713">Má bhíonn gá leis, cinnte. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth go raibh Aer Lingus ag tagairt dó sin. Bhí sé ag caint ar fhógraíocht, agus níl aon rialachán déanta agam faoi fhógraíocht, agus níl aon mhaith do dhaoine bheith ag caint ar rud nach bhfuil ann.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">Maidir leis an rud a dúirt an Teachta faoin Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh, tá€500,000 curtha ar leataobh aici sna Meastacháin le haghaidh fheidhmiú an Achta. Deir sé sin dhá rud. Ar an gcéad dul síos, deir sé go soiléir nach raibh seirbhís cheart trí Ghaeilge á cur ar fáil ag an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh go dtí seo.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">Molaim í as ucht a gcearta a thabhairt do lucht na Gaeilge. Má chosnaíonn sé an sciar sin den bhuiséad, bíodh sé mar atá. Tá súil agam nach bhfuil mé mícheart sa bhfigiúr. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil sé luaite anseo áit éigin, ach níl mé in ann mo lámh a leagan air. Más buan mo chuimhne, tá an Teachta ag caint ar an séú cuid de 1% de bhuiséad riaracháin na Roinne Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh. Tá sé sin níos lú ná 0.2% den bhuiséad riaracháin. Seo an dearcadh atá agam air. Má tá costais ag baint leis na dualgais dlíthiúla a chomhlíonadh, sábhálfaidh sé sin 0.2% áit éigin eile. Níl sé substaintiúil. Níl sé ábhartha i gcomhthéacs bhuiséid iomláin.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">Níl costas dá laghad ar na heagraíochtaí Stáit a bhí ag cur a gcearta ar fáil do lucht na Gaeilge. Mar shampla, níl aon chostas ar fiú caint air do mo Roinn féin. Bhí muid ag déanamdh gach rud dá bhfuil sa bplean. Níl sé ag cur aon chostais breise orainn. Níl aon chostas, mar shampla, ar Údarás na Gaeltachta cloí leis an Acht Teanga, mar bhí sé ag feidhmiú i gceart. Is beag costas atá ar Oifig an Ombudsman mar bhí sí ag déanamh na rudaí atá riachtanach de réir an Achta. Mar sin, má tá comhlachtaí áirithe a bhfuil costais orthu, sin le rá nach bhfuil seirbhísí á gcur ar fáil acu. Tá dreamanna eile nach bhfuil aon chostas ag baint leo mar bhí an tseirbhís agus ceart á dtabhairt don dream a úsáideann Gaeilge sa tír seo. Is fadhb do chuile chomhlacht é taobh istigh dá chuid acmhainní tosú a fheidhmiú taobh istigh den dlí.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">Cuirim mar seo é. Tá an-chaint ar mhíchumas. Beidh costas ar sholáthar a chur ar fáil do dhreamanna míchumais. Titfidh sé sin amháin ar an dream nach raibh cothrom ceart á dhéanamh acu do dhaoine le míchumais go dtí seo. Ní thitfidh aon chostas ar an dream a bhí ag cur seirbhís cheart ar fáil. Má tá costais ar dhreamanna áirithe, is mar go raibh easpa seirbhíse agus mar gur theip go hiomlán is go huile ar na treoirlínte deonacha a chuir an Teachta Michael D. Higgins ar aghaidh nuair a bhí sé ina Aire agus é féin ag maíomh gur réitigh sé sin fadhbanna seirbhíse trí Ghaeilge. Is léir gur theip air. Má tá costas anois air, is mar gur theip ar na treoirlínte deonacha a raibh an oiread sin gaisce á dhéanamh astu.</p>

Nár cheart féachaint ar cén úsáid ar féidir a bhaint as an airgead ar son na Gaeilge? Tá an chuma ar an scéal go bhfuil an Ghaeltacht i mbaol, agus sin an phríobhfhadhb atá ag an Rialtas seo.

            <p eId="para_749">My Department was allocated €31.5 million to fund drugs initiatives in 2005, which represents an 18% increase on last year's budget.

Funding will also be allocated to implement the action plans from the regional drugs task forces. In this context, the Deputy should note that I will make initial allocations to six of the regions in the next few weeks. Seven plans have been received and this allocation will consist of a first tranche of the funding. A third round of capital funding under the young peoples facilities and services fund in local drugs task force areas will also be announced shortly. A further round of funding through the premises initiative for community-based drugs projects in local drugs task force areas will also be made this year. Moreover, additional administrative supports for some local drugs task forces will be rolled out.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The Deputy should also note that in addition to the initiatives noted earlier, over recent years a large number of projects which were initially developed through the local drugs task forces and the young peoples facilities and services fund have been taken into the mainstream by various Departments and agencies. It is estimated that in monetary terms, these make up a further €19 million to €20 million so that in total, a sum of more than €50 million has been invested in projects which started at local drugs task force level and which continue on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">This Government continues to tackle the drug problem in the most comprehensive way possible. In this context, the Deputy should note that the mid-term review of the drugs strategy, which was published in early June, found that there are encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when the strategy was first launched. This suggests our current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">It is like the leaving certificate where one gets extra points. The Minister of State will have a busy summer travelling throughout the country announcing these funds and handing out cheques. I look forward to pursuing him as he does so. However, many of these programmes are under much pressure and need increased grants because of increases in the costs of insurance and staff. Can he examine the programmes which have received grants over recent years to see if it is possible to provide them with extra money? These announcements, which include some new schemes and some new places, will be made in the next few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">With regard to multi-annual funding, is it possible to give projects a commitment over a number of years? In that way, people will not be obliged to spend half the year trying to raise money through golf or poker classics or by whatever means to guarantee money for the following year. They could get on with the job we need them to do, that is, tackling drug abuse and helping young people go down different routes by keeping them busy doing something else. Are there any plans to go down that route?</p>

            <p eId="para_761">I did not catch the Deputy's first point. On the multi-annual funding, all the funding is rolled out in accordance with plans submitted and approved. That part is all right. When the projects are in place for a certain period of time, they are evaluated. The theory is that they are mainstreamed back into the Departments of Education and Science, Health and Children and so on, and the funding becomes part of the establishment thereafter. They must be evaluated and examined. Every project does not get the nod or approval. A project might get approval in part. Once projects are mainstreamed, there is consistency of funding. That is built into the system thereafter. What was the Deputy's first point?</p>

Does the Minister of State accept this is a reality for many people? Is he aware of the widespread intimidation of communities every night of the week? There are two areas in my constituency where everything seems to close down after 9 p.m., where there is violence, fear and intimidation and where people are afraid to leave their flat complexes or estates. What response would the Minister of State encourage as part of the strategy to deal with this problem? Is he aware that many of our ports and small harbours are used to import dangerous drugs?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_768">There is a problem in the drugs area and there is a strategy in place to deal with it which is receiving considerable funding from Government. Over the past seven or eight years, approximately €200 million has been provided through the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund, not to mention all the money spent by the Garda and Customs and Excise on law enforcement and by the Department of Health and Children on treatment and on education and awareness campaigns. We only provide the money which goes to the local drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_769">I do not know what the Deputy means by a more targeted response. We have just done a mid-term review of the strategy. All the State agencies and voluntary and community groups were involved in it and had an input. The review took almost 12 months. There has been exhaustive consultation so that everyone can feel part of and claim ownership of it. What has emerged is the product of everyone's involvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_770">There is crime and there are areas in which there are difficulties but we have provided nearly €100 million through the young people's facilities and services fund, including €3.2 million for the new hall in Donnycarney in the Deputy's constituency. We realise it is not enough just to tell young people not to get involved in drugs. One must try to give them alternatives and point them in the direction of healthy sporting or other pursuits. Much money is being spent in that way.</p>
            <p eId="para_771">The youth service, certainly in the Dublin area, has been totally revitalised in recent years through money from the young people's facilities and services fund. It tries to give people in "at risk" areas the opportunity to keep away from drugs and that is part of the way in which the strategy operates.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">The demand for housing grants under the Housing (Gaeltacht) Acts has not increased in the past few years. Indeed, following increases in the number of applications from 1,025 in 1998 to a high of 1,486 in 2000, the numbers have fallen back incrementally to 911 in 2004. It is expected that the number of applications this year will be comparable with last year. This is a reflection of the success of the scheme in improving the housing stock in the Gaeltacht over recent years to a point where the level of applications appears to have stabilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">In terms of expenditure on the scheme, €4 million was allocated for Gaeltacht housing grants in 2004. However, expenditure did not reach the level anticipated, with €3.5 million of the allocation being spent. An allocation of €4 million has been made for 2005 and it is expected that this amount will be spent in full before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_775">This is one of the good schemes in the Gaeltacht. I wish to ask about older people, particularly those living alone, who want to seal their houses against the elements, that is, windows, doors and so on, and want central heating. Are the number of applications in that category going up or down? If they are going down, is it an indication that, after a number of years, the back has been broken in respect of the number of people whose houses require this type of renovation or refurbishment? It is very important that older people are looked after in this regard. I am interested to know the trends in this regard and what the Minister sees as the ongoing need in that sector in the Gaeltacht areas.</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_776">There is a simple explanation for the numbers. The Deputy might remember that my predecessor, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, ended the grants except for over 65 year olds but, to cut a long story short, they were restored following some issue with the Ombudsman. I agree with the Deputy that it is a fantastic scheme. There are a number of attractions. The amount of money concerned is fairly small and is limited. The scheme is now means-tested and it is quick, efficient and demand-led.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">In 1999 I changed the rules and, for the first time, people installing central heating as an essential repaid became eligible for grant assistance. At that time the maximum grant was £2,300 and it was increased to £4,000. We increased the island grant considerably to £12,000. The effect of that was a huge rush of applications. The fantastic beneficial effect was that many people, particularly elderly people and people living in poor circumstances, got central heating for the first time because of the change in the rule. There is a rule that once one gets the grant, one cannot get another grant for seven years. Many people received the grant three, four or five years ago and cannot apply for a grant for further works until the seven years have elapsed. The most common applications are for repairs to doors and windows and for central heating, things in which one can make a significant dent with approximately €5,000. Some 75% of the cost, or €5,000, is provided. Considerably more money is available to those on the islands because the cost of building on them is much higher than on the mainland.</p>

            <p eId="para_778">Grants were paid in respect of 151 new houses last year. Is there a trend whereby people who had left the Gaeltacht are returning to rear their families or to settle? Would grant applications indicate whether that is happening to any extent?</p>

            <from>Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_779">I do not think so. There was a rule change. In the old days if one did not live in the Gaeltacht at the time of application, one could not get the grant. We changed that rule and said we would sanction the grant even if the individual was not living in the Gaeltacht at the time of application but that we would not pay it until he or she was permanently resident there. We found, for example, that someone got a job in west Kerry who was living in Dublin. The person wanted to build a house but was technically not eligible for the grant because he was not living in the Gaeltacht at the time of application. We changed that, but to safeguard the integrity of the scheme, we do not pay the grant until we are satisfied that the person is permanently living in the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">I do not have figures on the number of people involved. That would not give us a good indication because in many cases someone moves to the Gaeltacht for a job, rents a house and then builds a house. Therefore, it would be very difficult to ascertain how many people are coming back into the Gaeltacht and then applying for housing grants.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_783">I propose to take Questions Nos. 18 and 34 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_784">The progress on the new volunteering package, which I announced in March 2005, is as follows. Core funding will be provided to six volunteer bureaux, totalling €900,000 over the next three years. The Department has recently provided funding to the Ballyfermot volunteer bureau and, subject to completion of contracts, funding for 2005 totalling €50,000 will be made available shortly to the remaining five bureaux and to Volunteer Centres Ireland for the recruitment of a development officer. ADM Limited has requested proposals from all of the partnership companies relating to the further €500,000 of local area partnership funding which was ring-fenced for measures that encourage volunteers and volunteering.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">With regard to the Cohesion Fund of €500,000, I hope that the Department will shortly be in a position to make a call for proposals through the city and county development boards of which the volunteering initiative will form part. Funding up to €600,000 is being provided to support the young social innovators programme, including the annual showcase awards, which will receive €75,000 per annum over three years. A total of €45,000 of that has been paid by my Department to date towards the YSI showcase awards for 2005 and, subject to completion of contract, funding of the YSI programme of €125,000 per annum will be made available shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">Funding up to €110,000 per annum will be provided by my Department to put the community learning programme on a sustainable footing over the next three years. Funding for the 2005-06 academic year will be made available shortly subject to the completion of contracts. This programme is a relatively new teaching method in our educational system which works by integrating classroom learning in any subject with suitable volunteering activity. The programme has been running on a pilot basis in the Dublin Institute of Technology since September 2001 through the school of hospitality, management and tourism with 12 students involved. By 2004 there were 65 students involved across a wide range of volunteering projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">The institute's aim is to have the community learning programme method incorporated in all faculties over the next three years. It is my hope that this initiative will serve as a model for other third level colleges over the coming years. The DIT community learning programme includes provision for ongoing review, and the effectiveness of the Department's funding will be assessed within three years.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_788">I thank the Minister of State for that reply. When a parliamentary question was tabled in April on the issue of locating volunteer centres on the campuses of third level institutions, he indicated that in this context he would discuss the relevant matters as they arose with the Minister for Education and Science. I welcome the initiative in DIT as it is moving in the right direction. However, it needs to be spread out geographically. The idea of having volunteer centres on the campuses of universities and institutes of technology is an important initiative as younger people are exposed to the voluntary sector and are educated in community development. This amounts to loving one's neighbour, especially when one's neighbour is in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_789">There are also recommendations in the joint committee report. One of them was for an element of volunteering in the transition year. Another was to carry the junior certificate CSPE on to leaving certificate level. These are not directly within the Minister of State's Department, but he indicated that the issues on third level volunteering would be discussed with the Minister for Education and Science as they arose. Has there been any discussion in the interim?</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_790">I do not think so. The package announced was for €2 million per annum, which is all we can do at present. It includes the aspect on second level and third level. The young social innovators annual showcase awards were held in Dublin six weeks ago. About 2,000 students were at it and the project is done in transition year. That group existed before we got this funding, but the funding, at €200,000 per annum for three years, will help to promote the project. Many of the projects now being carried out in transition year have a volunteer ethos. It introduces young people to different social projects, many of which are about drink and drug addiction, caring for the elderly and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The third level project which we are supporting exists to create a volunteering ethos among young people. We are trying to make it part of a programme where the students get grades and credits for it. We have not yet done anything about a bureau on campus. We felt that this project would attract young people in second and third level and would give them a taste of volunteering. It is to be hoped that they will carry that on with them into later life. We have not developed it beyond that which we have already announced. I was in DIT a few weeks ago and some of the questions related to education policy. My interest is just to encourage volunteering. I cannot take over the Department of Education and Science. I understand what the Deputy is saying and we may get an opportunity to look at that.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I look forward to the Minister's explanation on that. The other issue relates to off-licences. I am happy enough to see wine sold from a fridge in a corner of the store. How will the Minister be prescriptive about that? Can he keep it to a small scale? The issue relating to turf cutting is not unique to the midlands. We in County Louth have our own meadows, though I will not sing "The turfman from Ardee" for the Minister. Turf cutting continues to this day right up into the Cooley Mountains. I am concerned that small, individual plot-holders who cut turf for domestic use may be caught by the provisions and look forward to clarification on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">We should remember that regulations and by-laws on the use of four-wheel vehicles and quad bikes caught a number of sheep farmers, which was not the intention. Sheep farmers require quad bikes to travel on mountains for legitimate purposes and have no intention of damaging the hillside environment. I understand, therefore, the concerns of other speakers that domestic or small-scale commercial turf cutters will be caught by the regulations. The Minister's body language tells me we should have no major worries in this area. I look forward to his response.</p>

I am not convinced that cobbling together provisions on off-licences will deal satisfactorily with the issues involved. I am not sure, for example, that alcohol should be available for sale at garage forecourts as it makes little sense to have shops attached to petrol stations which are bulging with alcohol.

          <p eId="para_820">Peat must be acknowledged as a finite resource. The principle behind environmental impact assessment is to consider where there will be an impact on the environment. It makes sense to regulate peat extraction as we cannot continue with a slash and burn approach to finite resources. We must look carefully at saving such resources, especially in the context of the purchase by the Dutch and other governments of bogland for the Irish Government to hold in trust. It is indicative of their lack of confidence that the Government is doing enough on the issue. I am worried by the exemption of one of the largest peat extracting interests in the country, over which there is a significant question mark.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I cannot understand why the Minister is only partially incorporating the Aarhus directive in the regulation. Why is there a delay in incorporation in the context of provision for the right to challenge in a court of law public decisions which have been made without respect for environmental law? As such provisions are seminal to proper planning and development in the State, I am at a loss to understand why the Minister has failed to transpose the directive wholly and completely. My guess is that it is an example of a Government policy to make it more difficult for the public voice to be heard. The Government first charged members of the public €20 to make a planning submission, then prevented them from appealing a decision unless they had made a submission in the first instance and is now about to embark on a course of action which will deny individuals to make appeals by removing the opportunity for a second bite of the cherry. Such provisions do not serve the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Given the Minister's pride in being a good European, I cannot understand why he pleads as his reason for introducing the regulation the probability of a daily fine by the EU. Fear of fines is not a good reason for the introduction of regulations.</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_825">I received a note yesterday explaining the regulations. I understand changes in the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 which removed the restriction on the transfer of licences to any part of the State have led to the establishment of many off-licences in urban areas. Changes to establish necessary planning control over the significant increase in the number of large-scale off-licence premises and balance consumer interests are needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">I represent a primarily urban constituency, much of the development of which is recent. While it is the kind of area in which one would expect to see new pubs, I have mainly seen new clubs, hotels and off-licences. This observation is relevant to the point which has been made about the way in which people circumvent the licensing laws in the development of new facilities. I have seen supermarkets and forecourts expand from the sale of wine to more extensive sale of all kinds of intoxicating liquor. One sees in these outlets rows of alcoholic products in response to public demand which in turn has responded to changes in pricing policies. In contrast to the scenario in the case of tobacco, it is clear that increases in excise duties have changed patterns of behaviour rather than reduced the level of alcohol consumption. One hears from taxi drivers that they regularly bring to discos people who are drunk before they leave their houses. A fundamental change in behaviour has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">My aim is to establish the motivation behind the regulations. Is the intention to limit the number of off-licences or to respond to the aim of publicans to reduce competition, with which they clearly take issue? It is not at all clear that the regulations will modify behaviour as the fundamental issue in that context is price. If one's aim was to modify behaviour, one would revisit the Intoxicating Liquor Act which caused the changes rather than make regulations. I cannot see how the regulations can be implemented in practice where, for example, an application is made to build a supermarket which can be licensed in a commercially-zoned area. It is very difficult to see how local authorities would turn that down, and if they do turn it down, how would An Bord Pleanála respond to that, given that the establishment is in a commercial zone? Will the regulations be accompanied by directions to local authorities? Will local authorities be issued with guidelines by the Department specifying what is required from them in terms of the number of off-licences that is desirable. I am not clear on how the regulations actually——</p>

          <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_829">I am not convinced it will solve the problem because although many things are regulated when people make a planning application they often end up getting permission. It will not stop every off-licence so which ones will be stopped and how many?</p>
          <p eId="para_830">Kildare is an area with significant wetlands. I have a difficulty with what I perceive to be a reactive change rather than a proactive change, in that the regulation appears to be designed to avoid a fine rather than being based on a definite idea about how wetlands should develop. The one organisation that has had a positive role in getting us to value our bogs is the European Commission. I would hate to think that what we were trying to do is more or less to get around a sanction it is trying to impose for a very good reason. I am concerned about what will be the result of this. Too often we have seen situations where the likes of Bord na Móna has applied for cutaway bogs to be used as landfills. It appears that the only value put on wetlands is an economic one, rather than for their value as a distinctive habitat, from a tourism point of view or simply because they have existed for centuries before any of us arrived.</p>

          <p eId="para_882">That I am bringing forward this legislation on peat extraction, demonstrates my willingness to meet the European Commission's concerns on Ireland's performance in the environmental area, a point touched on by Deputy Cuffe. This change in natural heritage areas, NHAs, will meet the outstanding concerns of the EU Commission and the Court of Justice. Deputy Gilmore asked what has changed. The reality is that the Commission has been in continuous contact with us on this issue. It is anxious that we should ensure that planning authorities have the possibility of stepping in to halt industrial scale peat extraction where that is necessary. I remind Deputies that we are talking about peat extraction in excess of 10 hectares, which is 24.71 acres. That is certainly not a year's supply for a farmer.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">Deputy Naughten raised the issue of forestry, which is not dealt with in these regulations. Telecommunications masts were dealt with by Deputy Gilmore, who again shows signs of senility in this matter, because these issues were dealt with in the 2001 regulations and discussed at some length. I contributed to the discussions. As a spokesman on environmental policy I am amazed that Deputy Gilmore appears not to be aware that masts now require planning permission. Matters like this——</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1036">In page 43, line 1, after "regulations" to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1037">"following the approval of each House of the Oireachtas".</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">It is critical that any provision made under section 55 of the Bill, or any regulations made under such a provision, should be brought before the Oireachtas. The power given under subsection (5) means that the Minister may make regulations to exclude the application of subsection (3), which relates to the exemption of farmers from carrying out particular procedures, such as administering an antibiotic or another form of medicine. Currently, procedures such as the paring of sheep hooves and the dehorning of cattle are done on a regular basis. The administration of medicines, whether as doses or inter-muscular injections, are exempted at this time and a farmer can carry out such procedures under section 55 of the legislation. It is only right and appropriate that this is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I have no difficulty with the principle that the Minister can bring forward regulation exclusions because procedures may change at some stage in the future. However, it is vitally important that they receive a positive decision from the Houses of the Oireachtas before the Minister implements any of the regulations. We have witnessed the situation in terms of prescription-only medicines, and there is no guarantee that it will be debated by the Houses of the Oireachtas. I hope we will be given the opportunity to tease out the issues when the occasion arises later this year. However, we do not have a right to debate the detail of those regulations. It is up to members of the Opposition to table a motion in order for them to be debated and the Government can then use its majority to block it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">The situation is the same in this case. If we are to water down the rights of farmers to carry out various procedures on animals, it is imperative that the Minister is able to present a definitive argument to the House as to why he or she believes the regulation should be brought forward at that time and why there should be a restriction with regard to the procedures farmers can carry out on their farms and on their animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">Amendment No. 14 is similar and elaborates on the issue of regulation of veterinary practice. Under section 59, the regulations provide for the practice of veterinary medicine by non-registered persons. Again, the issue is what will be exempted from the regulations. This was discussed on Committee Stage and it is self-explanatory. However, amendment No. 10 is critical. It is imperative that these issues are put before the House and teased out in detail and that the Minister explains why farmers should be precluded from carrying out a particular procedure, whatever that procedure.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">This is similar to one of the amendments we discussed yesterday and the reasons for the discussion are the same. When regulations are being made it is very important that there is an opportunity to discuss them and their implications. There is no automatic right that we would have a full debate, if necessary, on the regulations. We highlighted this issue as it related to a different amendment yesterday and, indeed, it was raised on Committee Stage too. I do not want to rehash the entire argument now but I agree with Deputy Naughten that it is important that the option should be available that regulations come before the House and we have the opportunity to discuss them in detail.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBrowne2" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_561">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Browne)</from>
          <p eId="para_1043">As the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, pointed out, this issue was addressed in detail on Committee Stage. Deputies Naughten and Crawford again propose, by means of amendment No. 10, that regulations made under section 55(5) must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas. They also propose, by means of amendment No. 14, to change the form of laying procedure, to be followed when the Minister makes regulations regarding emergencies. This latter amendment also has implications for section 55(5).</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">In the case of sections 55 and 59, provision is made for the laying of ministerial regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas, with the standard 21 day annulment procedure. The main purpose of these regulation-making powers is to enable the Minister to deal with difficulties that arise under section 55(2) or section 55(3). Therefore, this provision is generally not intended in any way to broaden this provision but rather to do the opposite, if necessary. In these circumstances, the requirement to lay the regulation before the Oireachtas, as set out in the Bill, is a more appropriate approach and, therefore, I do not propose to accept these amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_562">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1045">The Minister of State is making my argument for me. I accept that the reason for the procedure and the provision is not to broaden but to restrict what were, up to now, common agricultural practices carried out by farmers on their farms. Subsequent to the Minister bringing in the regulation, there will automatically be an additional cost to farmers because what the Minister will do is exclude a particular procedure which, up to that point, was carried out by farmers and rule that it will have to be carried out by a veterinary practitioner. That will mean a fee for the call-out of the vet and the cost of carrying out the procedure, whatever it might be. In those circumstances, the Minister for Agriculture and Food should be prepared and willing to come before this House to explain why he or she believes that such a restriction should go ahead. The standard procedure with the 21 day annulment clause is not appropriate in this case because it does not provide for this issue to be debated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">In 2000, the then Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government accepted an amendment providing for the bringing of procedures and regulations back before the House for debate. Indeed, that is what we did earlier today regarding that Department and the Planning and Development Bill. I cannot see why such a provision cannot be allowed here, especially as it relates to this particular issue. It is critically important that farmers are protected, that the Minister gives detailed reasons he or she is bringing forward these regulations to restrict procedures that would have been standard up to that point, carried out by farmers on farms across the country.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_1047">As I said, the Minister for Agriculture and Food has given this matter serious consideration since the Committee Stage debate. She is happy that the precedent in this House has always been that the making of an order would be placed before both Houses of the Oireachtas with the standard 21-day annulment provision, except in exceptional circumstances. Deputy Naughten has referred to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, but in my Department, where we introduce levies or charges, they are always laid before this House before the regulation is made by the Minister. The Minister for Agriculture and Food is happy that what she is doing is correct and is in accordance with precedent in this House over many years.</p>

          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1048">The difficulty is that this is a charge. The reality is that when the Minister excludes a particular procedure that up to now was carried out as a standard operating practice on a farm, it will mean a charge because it will be up to a veterinary practitioner to carry out that procedure. That is why I believe that such a regulation should come before the House.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1182">"56.—A person may transport an animal to a veterinary premises under the meaning of <i>Part 9</i> for the purposes of first aid or medical assistance in an emergency, without complying with normal animal movement regulations.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">I tabled this amendment because it came to my notice from talking to a number of farmers in recent weeks that where Caesarean sections, especially emergency ones, must be carried out on cattle, it has increasingly become the case that veterinary practitioners want the animals to be brought into their premises to carry out the procedure. Up to now the vast majority of Caesarean sections on cows were performed on the farm, but this is not now the case. Given the difficulty this requirement presents and having regard to the provisions of the animal movement regulations in place, it is imperative to make provision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">The Minister said on Committee Stage that the animal health Bill would deal with this issue, but that Bill is still promised and nothing has happened in respect of it. That Bill has many implications and it will not have an easy passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas. In the meantime farmers will be left in an unenviable position in that they will not be cross-compliant if they bring an animal to a veterinary practice for a Caesarean section. This is the practice in some parts of the country and vets will not perform the procedure on the farm, rather in their premises. In light of that, I ask the Minister of State to provide for such circumstances by accepting this amendment to ensure that farmers will not be in breach of the regulations until we can thrash out this issue when we debate the animal health Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">I support this amendment on the basis that if there is not such a provision, farmers will face a difficulty if such an emergency were to arise. An animal welfare issue may arise under the Bill as drafted. If the Bill were passed, a farmer who moved an animal in such an emergency may technically be in breach of the law or, alternatively, the farmer may decide not to move the animal if he or she is to operate within the law. That would be an invidious situation. On that basis I support the amendment.</p>

As Deputy Naughten said, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, outlined the reason she would not agree to this amendment. First, it is not a matter for this legislation, rather it is more appropriate to the animal diseases legislation. Second, there would be serious doubts about providing for such a general exemption to animal movement rules, particularly in the case of highly contagious diseases. The matter would need careful consideration and it is not one for this legislation. It will be discussed when the animal diseases legislation comes before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1192">I raised this issue on Committee Stage because under the legislation, as drafted, it seems harsh that it is a criminal offence for a vet to advertise or use any qualification that is not registered on the register. The deletion of the words proposed in the amendment would address that anomaly. If the qualification in question is one a vet holds, it seems harsh that the use of such a title should give rise to an issue of criminality. Acceptance of this amendment would clarify the position to the effect that a vet is committing an offence by claiming to have a qualification which he or she does not have and it is not necessary that the qualification be registered on the register to avoid criminal liability. A vet should be obliged to register all the details but such provision could be dealt with elsewhere in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1194">Deputy Upton proposes to delete the phrase "the details of which are registered on the Register" from section 56. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, indicated on Committee Stage that she would reflect further on these issues. Subsequently, she had the matter further examined in the Department in consultation with the Attorney General's office and the Veterinary Council of Ireland. As has already been indicated, the current wording of this section is primarily designed to ensure that the public is not misled as a result of a registered person displaying, for example, on the signage for his or her premises a title or a qualification which he or she does not in reality possess.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">Sections 46 and 50 make provision for registration of specialties and additional qualifications where they would be a matter of public record and could assist a member of the public in choosing the best practitioner. It is desirable that letterheads and signage belonging to a practice should match the qualifications registered with the council and that an incentive is provided with a view to ensuring that this is the case. However, as has been said previously, if a person merely overlooks the registered qualification or specialty which that person genuinely holds, it would simply be a matter for him or her to rectify this when attention has been drawn to the oversight by the council. One could not envisage a person being subject to disciplinary proceedings in a situation where he or she has failed to register a qualification which he or she possesses unless that person, having been advised of the oversight, refused to do so. Accordingly, the words which are registered in the register could play an important part in ensuring that the public has accurate information available on which to base the choice of practitioner. The Minister consulted the Veterinary Council of Ireland and the Attorney General's office and both were of the view that the amendment is not required.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1199">", including the issue of prescriptions and prescription only medicines,".</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">I do not accept the argument put forward by the Minister on Committee Stage for not accepting the amendment tabled on this matter. The veterinary profession is strongly lobbying that its practitioners should be the ones who would be entitled to issue prescription only medicines in this area. That is not provided for in the directive on this area that we will receive from Brussels but that is the interpretation veterinary surgeons are putting on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">While veterinary surgeons are seeking to have the right to write prescriptions and issue medicines, the practice to date has and will continue to be that they do not issue the medicines, rather they get their staff to do so. The medicines are given out and the prescriptions are written up later. That is what happens on a day-to-day basis. If veterinary practitioners want to have the right to issue prescriptions and particular medicines, the practice of doing so should be solely a matter for them. I do not understand why a person who is qualified to issue medicines in an animal health store or in a co-operative cannot issue them because of a change in the regulations while a veterinary practitioner can get a person who has no qualifications but simply works under the banner of a veterinary practitioner to issue veterinary medicine.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">In her response to an amendment on this matter on Committee Stage, the Minister said acceptance of it would mean that only vets could issue prescriptions but as the Minister has repeated on numerous occasions, this is not the legislation to deal with that matter. That type of action should be specified. If it is designated that a vet should issue a particular type of prescription, he or she should not be able to pass that off to an unqualified employee to issue the medicine.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1203">I support this amendment based on what Deputy Naughten has just stated. It is a rather unusual situation if the vet may pass along the facility to write or deliver a prescription when somebody else, for example, in a co-operative cannot do it. This has been the tradition up to now. If it were to be made fair, including this amendment in the legislation would take care of matters. There has been a good deal of discussion with the various interested parties on the issuing of prescriptions and it is a critical area. This is an important amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_1204">I refer to amendment No. 13 in the names of Deputies Naughten and Crawford. The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, indicated on Committee Stage that she did not believe that this amendment was appropriate for this legislation. There is separate legislation on animal remedies involving the number of statutory instruments made under the Animal Remedies Act 1993. On the point at issue, that is, who is to be allowed to prescribe prescription-only veterinary medicines, this is already covered in the Animal Remedies Regulations 1996 where this function is reserved to veterinary practitioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">There are concerns arising from the forthcoming implementation of the new EU legislation, particularly with prescribing. However, as the Minister pointed out on Committee Stage, this amendment, if accepted, would copperfasten in primary legislation the exclusive rights of veterinary practitioners as prescribers — from which Deputy Crawford's remarks on the previous occasion appear to be the opposite of his objective. In any event, given that the question of prescribing falls under the animal remedies legislation, I suggest we deal with this matter in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">I would have serious concerns if this were to copperfasten in primary legislation the rights of veterinarians only to prescribe because I have had representations from numerous bodies and back bench and Front Bench Deputies on this issue arguing that vets should not be given exclusive rights. The Minister is quite adamant that if this amendment were accepted, we would be saying in effect that vets only can prescribe and that is not acceptable.</p>

Section 57 makes it an offence for a registered person to employ an unregistered person to carry out practices that should normally be done by someone who is registered. The reality is that prescription-only veterinary medicines are being issued by the staff of veterinary practitioners. If at some future date intramammaries and other medicines were to be made prescription-only, the reality is the vet would not be around to issue them. A member of his or her staff would do it. Whether it is in this legislation or in the regulations that are coming forward later in the year, if the issuing of particular medicines is limited to a vet, then it should only be the vet who issues them and not his or her staff. Some of the vets are looking for the powers to issue medicines but do not want to deal with the practicalities involved in the day-to-day issuing of them. That is the reason for the amendment. I accept what the Minister of State is saying. I ask him to ensure that this anomaly is addressed when the animal remedies regulations are being dealt with because it is imperative that the system is not abused. I hope that the list available to vets is extremely limited and reduced from what it is at present. On the issue being discussed, if a vet is required, then it should only be a vet.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">I agree with Deputy Naughten's interpretation. What the amendment does by including this phrase is to state clearly that the vet must be the person to issue prescription-only medicines in this particular context. The other issue is one that must be debated separately, but to include the amendment does not mean that only vets may issue those prescriptions. That is not what is intended. However, if the current situation in practice is that people who are non-veterinarians issue prescriptions and other people are precluded from so doing, then it is fair that this part of the amendment should be included in the legislation.</p>

We discussed this on Committee Stage and the section as it stands is very broad. There is a contradiction between the side note, "where persons convicted on indictment of an offence", and the text which refers to persons convicted of an offence triable on indictment, which includes summary offences which are not tried on indictment. The danger is that these could include a multitude of very minor offences. The problem with section 83 is that there is no test, criterion or requirement by which the council should judge whether a person should be struck off the register by reason of having been convicted of an offence. The amendment would use the wording set out, for example, in section 47(2)(<i>d</i>). That makes it clear that merely being convicted of an offence <i>per se</i> is not sufficient but that the offence should be one which renders it, in the opinion of the council, inappropriate for the person to practise veterinary medicine or nursing, as the case may be. It cannot just refer to any offence, rather to one that specifically relates to where it is inappropriate for the person to practise the profession of veterinary nursing or medicine.</p>

          <p eId="para_1225">I support Deputy Upton's amendments. She has made a valid point. An ambiguity exists within the legislation which should be addressed. It is appropriate that it should be addressed in this manner. A person might be convicted of something that is completely unrelated and may have nothing to do with how he or she practises as a veterinary practitioner. While it may have no implications for practising veterinary medicine, it seems that the council's hands will be tied in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_1226">Following the raising of these issues by Deputy Upton on Committee Stage, the Minister undertook to return to this matter again when the legislation came back into the House. She has given further consideration to it and had consultations with the Office of the Attorney General. She believes the Bill as drafted strikes the correct balance. An example by way of illustration is a practitioner who steals €500 from a client. Such an offence could be tried in the District or Circuit Court. However, if proceeded with in the lower court, this should not of itself prevent the council from looking into the matter since, taken in context, it is a serious matter. The current provision does nothing more than give the option to the council to proceed. If, having considered the matter, the council decides to do so, the normal procedures will kick in, including a full right of appeal to the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">While I fully understand the concern for the rights of the accused underpinning the amendment, balance is required. I emphasise that this is a "may" provision and, as such, does not imply that a person will be automatically struck off because of such conviction. The council will be required to examine the matter thoroughly and reach a view on whether the person's ability to practise has been compromised and whether the profession might be damaged by virtue of the person remaining registered. For this reason, I remain of the view that a reasonable balance has been struck and, in light of the Minister's consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, it is not proposed to accept the amendments.</p>

          <p eId="para_1238">The purpose of the amendments is to address an anomaly in the Bill. Under the legislation as framed, the Minister of State, a veterinary practitioner, surgeon, schoolteacher or any other professional may cross the road to help out a neighbour if one of his ewes is in difficulty lambing. A veterinary nurse is the only person who is prohibited from assisting a neighbour in such circumstances. He or she may carry out a procedure such as pulling a lamb on his or her own farm, provided he or she is a farmer. Under the wording of the current provision and the definition of a body cavity, once a veterinary nurse assists another person by putting his or her arm into a body cavity to try to pull a lamb, he or she is committing an offence for which he or she may be struck off the register.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">The House will be told it will be possible to turn a blind eye to this provision and the circumstances I describe will not arise. Human nature being as it is, it is certain that at some point an elderly man living in a rural area who has a ewe in difficulty and cannot reach a vet will knock on a neighbour's door to ask for help. If his neighbour is a veterinary nurse, she will no longer be considered a farmer the moment she leaves her premises to carry out the procedure. Instead, she will be considered a veterinary nurse and, as such, is prohibited under the legislation from carrying out the procedure. This unfair anomaly must be addressed and the amendment proposes to do so. I ask the Minister of State to accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1241">Deputies Naughten and Crawford have again proposed amendments covering the carrying out by veterinary nurses of minor medical or surgical procedures. The effect of these amendments would be that ministerial regulations would be required before nurses could become active in this area. When this matter was discussed on Committee Stage, the Minister drew attention to the amendment she had agreed in the Seanad by which nurses would be permitted to carry out functions of this type on the direction of a veterinary practitioner. She also pointed out that the Bill provides for a definition of the word "minor" in the context of medical or surgical procedures. In light of this and given that we are not adopting a similar approach in respect of other tasks a nurse may carry out on the direction of a veterinary practitioner, it is not necessary to provide for ministerial regulation-making powers in this sole instance. Accordingly, I do not propose to accept the amendments.</p>

We must all live in the real world in which we will experience increasing difficulty securing sufficient veterinary practitioners to service rural areas. The majority of veterinary practitioners who complete their training will move into small animal practice. In addition, elderly people who have stuck to the land and may not have proper procedures or equipment or the required housing will call on neighbours for assistance, as people have done for generations. Under the legislation as framed, if the neighbour is a veterinary nurse, he or she can be struck off the register for providing such assistance. This is wrong and the section must include provision to cover genuine emergencies. Animal husbandry issues and human nature must be considered. I ask the Minister of State to ensure that if a veterinary nurse acts as a good samaritan, he or she will not jeopardise his or her career.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1262">In page 89, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1263">"(3) Where an authorised officer takes possession of or removes from the premises for examination and analysis, any animal pursuant to <i>subsection (2)(h)</i> which is not the property of the registered person concerned, then—</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1264">(<i>a</i>) the authorised officer shall take reasonable steps to notify the owner of the animal of such seizure or removal, within a reasonable time after taking possession of or removing the animal, save where it is not possible to identify the owner notwithstanding reasonable diligence,</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1265">(<i>b</i>) where the owner so requests, the authorised officer shall return the animal to the possession of the owner unless there are reasonable grounds to believe that the owner is responsible for serious ill-treatment or neglect of the animal, and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_1266">(<i>c</i>) where an animal is returned to its owner following seizure or removal under this section, the subsequent production of the animal in proceedings (including disciplinary proceedings) under this Act shall not be required, and the production of photographic or scientific evidence regarding the condition of the animal shall be sufficient in any such proceedings.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The Minister agreed on Committee Stage that she would look at this amendment. It would protect the property rights of the owners of animals on the premises that are raided by authorised officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">There is no difficulty with the authorised officer seizing the property of the vet because it is intended the legislation will provide for that. It is important, however, that any third party who is a client of the vet and whose animal is in the surgery at the time is protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">The first part of the amendment states that the authorised officer is not required to get permission from the owners in advance but must notify them after the event. That is reasonable and practical. It is then up to the owner to request the return of the animal and if that request is made, the animal should be returned unless the owner is going to mistreat it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">When the animal is returned, production of the animal in court or before the veterinary council is not required and scientific evidence is satisfactory. It might be practical to bring a Manx cat but it might not be best practice to bring a Friesian cow to a court or sitting of the veterinary council.</p>

          <p eId="para_1271">I agree with Deputy Upton, particularly on her last point. Whatever about bringing in a Friesian cow, I can imagine trying to bring in a Limousin bull — it would cause severe difficulty. It is fair that an unrelated third party who has an animal on the premises should be given proper notification. The amendment is balanced. It would protect the inspectors who might have to remove animals and protect the rights of the owners of the animals, particularly animals as valuable as a Limousin bull.</p>

          <from>Mr. Browne</from>
          <p eId="para_1272">Arising from concerns expressed in both Houses, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan, agreed to substantial amendments to this section under which investigations by authorised officers of the council at veterinary premises will be carried out under a search warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">Amendment No. 28 deals with the seizure of animals in the context of investigations. The Minister explained on Committee Stage that she could not accept this having taken into account the legal advice of the Attorney General's office. She has since given the matter further consideration and, where authorised officers of the council seize animals belonging to a third party, they will be assumed to take on a duty of care for the animals and it is reasonable to assume they would inform the owner. It is not, however, appropriate to cover such procedural matters in primary legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">There are also concerns about paragraph (<i>b</i>) of the amendment where there would be a more specific difficulty. There may be cases other than potential ill treatment where it would not be possible or appropriate to return animals to the owner. The animals may have been given banned drugs requiring their removal from the food chain. Bearing in mind the substantial amendment which the Minister accepted on Committee Stage on veterinary premises, the correct balance has been struck and, accordingly, we do not propose to accept the amendment.</p>

          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_1275">This amendment would protect the rights of the owner. The Minister of State made assumptions in his response, which is not always best practice legally. Significant issues arose in the recent past related to the seizure of animals and the right of people to enter premises. That is why the rights of owners should be particularly well protected in the legislation. I accept that if banned drugs are present, it would not be reasonable or practical to return the animals to the owner but where there are no grounds for suspecting ill treatment of the animal, it would make sense that the owner would be informed and the animal returned. It is important primarily from the point of view of protecting the rights of the owner of the animal.</p>

When the legislation went before the Seanad, a number of significant issues were flagged which the Minister took on board. To her credit and that of her officials, when the Bill came before this House — traditionally it can be very difficult to have amendments accepted when the Bill is passing through the second House — the Minister was flexible in accepting reasonable amendments. Credit is due to all involved in this dramatically improved Bill. There will be significant battles in the next couple of months with the animal health Bill where many of the issues raised with the Veterinary Practice Bill will again be raised.

        <heading>International Interests in Mobile Equipment (Cape Town Convention) Bill 2005 [Seanad]: Second Stage.</heading>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_617">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1282">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">The purpose of the Cape Town Convention is to make it easier to finance the purchase of aircraft. There are two parts to the convention. The convention itself provides a general framework for an international legal basis for financing moveable assets. It is accompanied by a protocol containing more specific arrangements for aircraft assets. It is envisaged other protocols will be developed to deal with railway rolling stock and space assets, but these are not dealt with in the Bill. The Schedules contain the text of the convention and of the protocol relating to aircraft objects. For convenience, when I refer to the convention, I will also be referring to the aircraft protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">Aircraft are expensive items, even when bought second hand. It is a rare occasion that an airline can afford to acquire additional aircraft without borrowing. However, because aircraft move between countries, it is not easy to borrow for an aircraft as for industrial or commercial property. In the case of a building or a plot of land, the bank lending the money for its purchase will always know where the property is situated and what law applies in connection with a lease or mortgage on the property.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The purpose of the Cape Town Convention is to create a uniform international legal framework for loans and leases for aircraft so an aircraft can be the asset securing the loan. This framework will provide lending institutions with stability and certainty about their ability to repossess aircraft that are subject to loans or leases if the borrower fails to make the contractual payments. If, at the time of the default on the loan payments, the aircraft concerned is in any country that has ratified the convention, the courts of that country will apply the rules of the convention to determine who may take possession of the aircraft. By reducing the risk for lending institutions, the convention will enable lending rates to be reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">This will obviously have benefits for airlines and, ultimately, for passengers. It will be of particular benefit to the less developed countries where access to large-scale finance is more difficult. As a concrete example of this, the US Government's Export-Import Bank has offered reduced interest rates in respect of loans to airlines in countries that have ratified the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">An important part of the convention is the creation of the international registry. Its purpose is to record the existence of loans and leases covered by the convention and to establish priority between them on a first come, first served basis. The registry will operate over the Internet on a 24 hour, seven day a week basis. To gain the protection of the convention, a loan or lease must be recorded in the registry. If two or more loans for the same aircraft exist, which is quite common, the loan registered first will have priority over later registrations. Members of the public, as well as those in the aviation and financing industries, will be able to search the registry to discover if loans are recorded for any particular aircraft. Only appropriately authorised users will be able to add or change information in the registry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">A substantial number of the world's aircraft leasing and financing companies are located in Ireland. In addition to direct employment in those firms, their location in Ireland has resulted in a considerable volume of high-profile work for Irish legal and accounting firms. My Department has supported this project for several years. At an early stage we made it clear we were anxious to have the registry located in Ireland to underscore our long-standing commitment to international aviation and to support aircraft financing activity in Ireland. My Department participated in the preparatory work leading up to the diplomatic conference in Cape Town in November 2001 where the convention was adopted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">With the valuable assistance of senior Land Registry officials, my Department contributed to the work of the international registry task force, established to define the role and operation of the registry. One meeting of the task force was held in Dublin Castle in January 2000. It was decided at an early stage that a competition would be held to select the operator of the registry to ensure its efficient operation. It was held by the International Civil Aviation Organisation in the first half of 2004. I was delighted when an Irish company, Aviareto, was unanimously selected as the winner at an international conference in Montreal in May last year. Other bids came from Canada, Singapore and Spain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Aviareto is a small PPP project between my Department and SITA, a major international company owned by over 700 aviation companies worldwide. It is the world's leading provider of global information and telecommunications solutions to the air transport and related industries. It has offices in Letterkenny and Dublin, employing 60 people in Ireland. The company recently announced the expansion of its activities in Letterkenny, which will employ more than 120 additional staff. Aviareto will be a small employer with probably fewer than ten staff and will be based at SITA's Dún Laoghaire offices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">The convention will come into force when it has been ratified or acceded to by eight countries. So far, there have been six ratifications and accessions by Panama, Ethiopia, Nigeria, the United States, Pakistan and Oman. Due to Ireland's long-standing support for this project, and especially because Aviareto was selected to operate the registry, it is my ambition for Ireland to be one of the first eight ratifying countries, and I am sure the House will support me in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">The registry will not take over the role of the Irish Aviation Authority for registering the nationality of Irish aircraft or regulating aviation safety. It will only be concerned with recording the existence of leases and loans for aircraft. It will do so for aircraft throughout the world, not just for Irish aircraft. When considering the Bill, it is important to note there is no obligation to use the registry or to make use of the convention. The Bill will not impose changes on people who do not wish to take advantage of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">Aircraft financing involves large sums of money. All the parties to a loan or lease will have professional legal and financial advisers. Consequently, we can be satisfied all users of the registry and the convention will do so on the basis of carefully considered decisions. It is also important to note the convention will not affect the status of financial interests where the parties choose not to register them. It will not affect cases where the financial interest was created before the convention comes into force in the relevant country, even if the interest is subsequently included in the registry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">This is a short Bill. Most of the text is contained in the Schedules, containing the convention and protocol. Sections 1 to 3, inclusive, contain standard provisions in legislation such as the Short Title, purpose of the Act and interpretations. Section 4 provides that the convention and protocol will have the force of law in Ireland. The convention and protocol will only apply where people have chosen to take advantage of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">Section 5 empowers the Government to make various declarations that are permitted under the convention and protocol. These allow a certain amount of tailoring to take account of national circumstances. As the convention has been formulated in a way that closely reflects common law legal systems, such as we have in Ireland, the declarations are primarily for the benefit of countries with other legal systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Section 6 contains standard provisions in connection with making orders, such as the inclusion of consequential provisions and specification of when an order takes effect. Section 7 specifies that the High Court is the appropriate court. Under the convention, disputes involving the registry must be heard in the Irish courts because the registry is based here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">Section 8 requires courts to take notice of the convention and protocol. Section 9 requires that proceedings for damages must take account of compliance with the relevant articles of the convention. Because the registry will be a computer-based system, it is important for users to comply with its requirements if they wish to have its protection. It was never intended that the registry would have responsibility for checking the quality or accuracy of the information placed in the database, which is the responsibility of the users. The registry will be responsible to ensure that no errors are introduced while the data is stored in the database.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">Section 10 empowers the Minister to subscribe for shares in the registry company, Aviareto, to an amount not exceeding €40,000. The Minister's shareholding will be an important indication of Irish support for the convention and protocol as well as the registry company. Section 11 prohibits a court from making an order that would prevent the registry from providing the services prescribed by the convention and protocol. This section does not prevent anyone from pursuing a claim for damages against the registrar. However it is important to ensure that a dispute with one party cannot affect the operation of the registry for the benefit of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">Sections 12 to 14 are standard provisions pertaining to orders including the laying of orders before the Oireachtas and the usual opportunity for either House to pass a resolution to annul an order. Section 15 is a standard provision in respect of the Minister's expenses under the Act when enacted. Section 16 inserts standard provisions into the Act that implements the Montreal Convention pertaining to the making of orders under that Act. These include the laying of orders made in respect of the Montreal Convention before the Oireachtas and providing for possible annulment by either House. Because of a deadline to enact that Act before the expansion of the European Union on 1 May 2004, it was not possible to include these amendments before it was enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">This convention represents an important and welcome step forward in the legal framework connected with aviation finance and having the international registry located in Ireland is a great achievement. I congratulate all those involved in that process and I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OliviaMitchell" eId="spk_618">
          <from>Ms O. Mitchell</from>
          <p eId="para_1301">I welcome this Bill to the House. The Minister is aware that I inquired as to its status a number of times as I too was anxious that it would come before the House before it rose and would be transposed into Irish law. Consequently, I welcome the fact that it has being taken this week. On behalf of the Fine Gael Party, I am happy to give it my support.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">As a result of the 9/11 attacks and reinforced by subsequent international events including rising fuel prices, the entire aviation sector has been subject to a climate of uncertainty, to put it mildly. It brings uncertainty for manufacturers, financiers, lessors, exporters, importers, airlines and for ordinary air passengers. The Air Navigation Bill passed by this House last week was a result and possible manifestation of that uncertainty, whereby the State found itself forced into a position to provide air carriers with insurance cover for potential dirty bomb damage, because the entire commercial insurance business had simply withdrawn from that market. However possibly perversely, alongside that uncertainty the world is becoming increasingly dependant on aviation. At the same time increased globalisation and the changing axis of the world economy towards Asia mean that everyone, including Ireland, needs certain, affordable and easier access to safe skies. It is essential for Ireland as an island country both to have that kind of access and certainty itself and that it is available internationally to the people with whom we hope to trade and do business. I welcome the proposed incorporation of the Cape Town Convention into Irish law as we must welcome anything that brings certainty and predictability to such a high-stakes sector which is so subject to fluctuation, natural disaster and as we saw from the 9/11 attacks, to the evil machinations of Man.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">As the Minister stated, the main objectives of the convention are to bring about efficient financing of aircraft and engines by promoting uniformity of contract through the protocol as well as predictability for those with a security interest in the asset concerned. This will bring a win-win situation. It means higher sales for manufacturers as financing becomes easier. It means easier access for emerging economies to such finance, as the level of risk for them — usually it is their Government — is reduced. It means reduced financing costs and enhanced access to different types and sources of funding for airlines. Moreover, younger fleets mean that greater fuel efficiencies are available to such airlines. In addition, this benefits passengers, in reduced air fares, improvements in an increased flow of services as well as more routes. It also increases safety for passengers because it means fleet replacement is made much easier, so one has a younger, and consequently a safer fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">It also brings benefits for Governments, in particular for developing countries, but also in developed countries where the national airline fleet purchases have been funded or backed by Government guarantees, as the greater degree of certainty about the enforcement of rights will bring lower costs for them. Even for Governments such as our own, which is contemplating privatisation, the risk reduction associated with the convention means that other cost-effective sources of finance have opened up to airlines that might previously have had — I use the word advisedly — the cushion of State-provided finance or guarantees.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Our own Irish airlines, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, are both expanding airlines that plan to expand their fleet and this legislation comes at the perfect time for them. Both will benefit significantly from the discounts likely to be offered to airlines of ratifying countries. I have read that one US bank is offering a 33% premium reduction for aircraft delivered before September 2005 for ratifying countries. This kind of incentive will be quite common for early participation in the protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1306">Ratification has a particular significance for Ireland in that the bid by Aviareto to operate the international register was successful. I am unsure whether the Minister is aware of the point, but a condition of the contract was that the winning bidder would ratify the convention. As the host country to the registry, other EU countries have been looking to Ireland to give the lead and I hope they will now quickly follow Ireland's example and transpose the convention into their own laws. This will ensure a flow of funds to the registry, which obviously needs funds to function properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">As the Minister noted, the contract to operate the registry was won against stiff international competition and it is of no small significance to Ireland. It is quite a feather in the cap of this company and the stakeholders. Did the Minister state that it was a joint venture company? It is not an insignificant achievement and it puts Ireland on the world aviation map and puts us at the cutting edge of the financing sector of aviation. Hence, for Ireland and for international aviation, it is a very good day's work. I am happy to support this Bill on behalf of Fine Gael.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_619">
          <from>Ms Shortall</from>
          <p eId="para_1308">I welcome this Bill on behalf of the Labour Party and we are happy to facilitate its speedy passage this evening. The fact that work has been carried out so quickly on this Bill to enable the ratification of the protocol and convention is a positive development. We welcome the object of the convention in terms of facilitating the easier financing of aircraft purchase through assets based arrangements and do not wish to do anything to delay that process. There are undoubted benefits to Irish airlines in the speedy passage of this legislation and by signing up to the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">At a time when the future of airline travel is based on the low cost model, it is critical that the EU plays a part in facilitating the purchase of aircraft, which will enable the various airlines to continue to provide a low cost model to travellers and facilitate easy access to air travel. We can all remember the days when the prices of tickets, even to London, were outrageous. We very much welcome the developments which have taken place in the past 20 years or so. To the fore in that was Ryanair to which we all have much to be grateful in terms of the development of that market. It has certainly forced the hand of Aer Lingus in terms of wising up to the modern airline market, changing its cost base and developing attractive air traffic costs and fares attractive to the public. It was forced into that competitive situation which has been good and from which we have all benefited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">Why is the Minister not prepared to remain involved with Aer Lingus? Why has he taken such a hard line in terms of the future of the national airline? This type of asset-based financing is one of several options available to Aer Lingus in terms of replacing its fleet. Much has been made by this Minister and his predecessor about the urgency with which Aer Lingus needs to access capital, yet nobody has managed to put a figure on it. We know from the chairman of Aer Lingus that it has had no difficulty in financing the replacement of its short-haul fleet. It could easily look after the replacement of its long-haul fleet as a State company. There are numerous options, including this one and long-term leasing arrangements. Aer Lingus would have no difficulty raising loans, for example, and there is always the option of State investment in the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">I again put on record my grave concerns about what the Minister proposes to do in regard to the national airline. There are many key national strategic interests which the Minister and the Government, as representatives of the shareholder, should bear in mind in terms of the future of the national airline. I reiterate my concern about the direction the Minister is taking as there is no reason Aer Lingus cannot stay in State hands. A number of Government spokespersons, particularly the Minister's predecessor, are particularly disingenuous about the situation in Aer Lingus and the possibilities for the future. I presume we will come back to that when the Minister gets advice from those he proposes to employ to advise him following the taking of the decision. We will return to that matter later in the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">To return to this Bill, I congratulate the Minister's officials who were involved in the preliminary work and design for this legislation and the international registry. Obviously very impressive work was carried out and the proof of that is the fact that Ireland has been unanimously selected as the winner of the competition organised to select the operator of the registry for the first five years. That is undoubtedly a feather in our cap in terms of aviation development. Great credit is due to SITA and the people in the Department who brought this about. We have been very successful in this regard and it will be an important catalyst in terms of Ireland developing a strong role in the financial aspects of the aviation industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">As I mentioned, we are very happy to facilitate the speedy passage of this Bill. However, I hope the Minister will take on board the small number of amendments I tabled in good faith and which are intended to improve the Bill. I was disappointed last week when we dealt with the Air Navigation and Transport (Indemnities) Bill in that I thought the Minister was somewhat churlish in not accepting an amendment for which he accepted the need. It seemed he did not want to accept it to avoid the inconvenience of having to table an amendment and any slight delay. I hope the Minister will be generous and accept some of these amendments, the purpose of which is to improve this short Bill. I look forward to the Minister's generosity in that regard.</p>

          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1314">I thank the Deputies for facilitating the Bill and for their strong support for it. This is a great win for Ireland on the international stage and it amplifies once again the strength of the Irish financial services sector and the important role of Ireland and Dublin in international finance in general. I think that was a key element in the international competition which Ireland won against some pretty stiff competition, as the Deputies said. It was a surprise to some that Ireland won and there was much angst because we did.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">The convention will reduce the financing costs for airlines but it certainly will not deal with any other issues in regard to companies seeking finance in terms of trying to lever on assets. One of the Deputies referred to one bank offering a 33% reduction in terms of rates. We know this is available. I will not, however, rehearse many of the arguments I could put to Deputy Shortall about Aer Lingus. I do not hold an ideological view on the company. If it were at all possible and if the company could have a realistic future in State hands, I would be the first to support that. No State airline has a future. That fact is accepted. I had discussions yesterday with trade unions on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">I was travelling recently and I picked up a magazine — I think it was <i>The Economist</i>, although I am not absolutely certain — in which the international assessment was dismissive of what would be left in Europe in terms of airlines, irrespective of sales and so on. It was firmly of the view that the only four airlines left in Europe in a short period would be Lufthansa, British Airways, KLM and Air France. It did not see any other airline surviving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Aer Lingus is unique in what it has achieved to date. We must capture what it has achieved and give it life into the future. The Deputy was right that it is not about the money. That is one of the issues. The issue is commercial access, working in the markets, decision-making processes etc. I am pleased with the way matters are proceeding and people on all sides are up for the challenge. I hope we can clarify some of the questions Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall raised in respect of the future. We look forward to that. I thank the two Deputies for their support for the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_1321">I tabled this amendment for reasons of clarity. I received this Bill a while ago and when I read the Title I did not think it had anything to do with the Department of Transport. The Title is very confusing and would suggest that the Bill had something to do with mobile telephones. We suggest acceptance of this amendment to change the Short Title to "This Act may be cited as the Air Navigation and Transport (Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment) Act 2005". The existing Title is very misleading and we suggest a Title similar to the Air Navigation and Transport (International Conventions) Act 2004 be adopted. As the Title stands, an ordinary person would think it had something to do with mobile phones.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_1322">It is not appropriate to link the Bill with the Air Navigation and Transport Act for two reasons. First, the convention is about financial matters rather than air services. Second, it is envisaged that the convention will apply to other non-aviation financial matters, including railway rolling stock and space assets, for which additional protocols are being prepared. That is why the convention refers to mobile equipment specifically, as the issue is much broader than that of air transport, the aspect with which I am dealing today. The Bill does not deal with railway rolling stock or space assets. Further legislation will be needed to apply protocols to such matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">The Cape Town Convention was news to me but everyone in the airline business knows about it. The convention is not specific to air transport; it covers mobile assets right across the spectrum. It is also about financing, rather than services and so on which are dealt with in other Bills. I do not propose, therefore, to accept the amendment.</p>

A contract can be said to be done when all relevant parties have signed it but in this case parties will continue to add their signatures to it.

The registrar is a company with a contract with the International Civil Aviation Organisation for the purpose of carrying out functions under the convention which specifically allows the registrar to be sued for negligence. The purpose of section 11 is to prevent a court from making an order at the request of one aggrieved party that would prevent the registrar from continuing to provide service for all others. In other words, if one airline company was involved in a dispute with the registrar and decided to sue, it would not be able to obtain an injunction to stop business being carried out with other airlines.</p>

          <p eId="para_1352">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill designed to establish a driver testing and standards authority. I welcome the fact that the new authority will be based in Ballina where the headquarters of the existing driver testing service is located. While Ballina is not in my constituency, it is on its border and I am sure many in Sligo-Leitrim as well as Mayo will be delighted at the location of the new authority. The decision to locate such an important authority in the west of Ireland is another example of the Government's commitment to the retention and development of life outside Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">Since the driving test was first introduced in 1964, more than 2.4 million tests have been carried out. Driving tests are conducted to ensure that each user of a motor vehicle has attained an appropriate level of competency, which is of critical importance at a time in which approximately one person is killed on our roads each day. It is essential that those who use motor vehicles are qualified to drive them. The test is the first step in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">The increase in the number of cars on the road has been matched by an increase in applications for tests. There are currently in excess of 120,000 applications for tests on file with the result that the waiting time is now approximately 38 weeks. While there has been some reduction in waiting times, 38 weeks is still far too long. I welcome the Minister's announcement that the Bill is a first step in a process to reduce waiting times still further. People should not have to wait for between 30 and 38 weeks to undergo a test which is why we must aim to ensure that applicants can be confident of taking tests within a couple of weeks of applying. It will be the duty of the new authority to ensure a proper service is available to members of the public within a reasonable time of applying for a test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The issue of what constitutes a driving test has received a great deal of attention in the media. Before I consider the contents of the test, however, I will discuss preparation for it. It is currently the case that any person may operate as a driving instructor provided he or she has a full driving licence. As the Minister has already stated, driving instructors are not currently required to register, in which context, like many other Members, I have been approached by people working in the industry. It is ludicrous that there are no regulations in place to require driving instructors to establish their bona fides. Members of the public approach instructors to learn to drive before undertaking the test, but in the industry to which they turn anyone can set up a business without there being a check on his or her qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">I stress that most instructors are eminently qualified, having undergone training to reach the requisite level of competence and that a register exists on which more than three quarters of instructors are listed. The register has been compiled with funding from the Department of Transport and attained ISO 9001 accreditation. To become a registered person, it is necessary for an instructor to demonstrate that he or she has attained a certain level of proficiency in instruction. I suggest to the Minister that one of the first functions of the new authority should be to regularise the position of driving instructors to allow members of the public to have confidence that their tuition is being provided by a fully approved person. I welcome the Minister's commitment to allowing existing instructors who can show that they are bona fide operators to continue to teach before undergoing the appropriate competency tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">To undergo a test a driver must be familiar with the driving of a car. As this can only be achieved through repeated practice and instruction, it is necessary to provide for provisional driving licences. Considerable media attention has focused on provisionally licensed drivers and their rate of involvement in fatal accidents. Some commentators have stated the holders of provisional licences are responsible for the deaths of at least 10% of those who die on Irish roads, while others have suggested the real figure may be as high as 20%. It is often forgotten in this debate that before an applicant is granted a provisional licence, he or she must undergo the theory test introduced in 2001. The test consists of computerised questions with multiple-choice answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1358">It might be possible to include in the theory test a driving simulation similar to those that feature in many computer games to examine the ability of a test applicant before he or she obtains a provisional licence. A simulation test might prepare an applicant for the process of driving a car. Likewise, the requirement by a provisional licence holder to display the letter "P" should be rigorously enforced. This will ensure other motorists understand that an inexperienced driver is driving a car. However, at the end of the day, nothing beats the presence of an experienced instructor with a learner driver in a car.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">While I recognise that new and more involved questions must be asked of drivers as to how the mechanics of the motor vehicle operates, the reality is that most, if not all, modern cars have a very comprehensive console which indicates if such things as oil or brakes need to be changed. A frequent requirement of drivers is to have the ability to change a tyre, yet this is not tested in a practical manner by the current test. I suggest that a more practical approach to new elements of the driving test might be of longer term benefit. I welcome the Bill and commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_646">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_1360">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this very important Bill. Road safety is a key concern of everybody, as it should be. The carnage on our roads must be tackled urgently. Almost every year the number of road traffic fatalities increases. In 2004, 379 people were killed on our roads, an increase of 34 victims compared to the previous year. In the past decade, 5,000 people have lost their lives on our roads. Road traffic accidents leave their mark on families and communities. The community in which an accident takes place is also affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">A substantial number of people have already lost their lives on our roads this year. In many cases, the reason for the accidents related to the condition of the roads. Poor surface is an urgent issue and the quality of national primary roads leaves much to be desired. Potholes, dangerous bends, temporary traffic lights, and gridlocked traffic, coming into small towns and villages give the illusion that one could not possibly be on a main road in one of the wealthiest states in the world. It is shocking that road users are expected to tolerate these deplorable conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">Poor signage is also a serious problem. This week I received several complaints about drivers going in the wrong direction around a roundabout outside Cashel, which only opened late last year, because the signage is so confusing. Signs are supposed to help motorists not confuse them and lead them into potentially life threatening driving errors yet this is what often happens. It is incumbent on the Department of Transport to ensure road signage is plentiful, helpful and clear. Signage has not improved, particularly on smaller country roads. In fact, it has disimproved in recent years. This matter must be addressed urgently by whoever is responsible, local authorities or the Department of Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">It is obvious the Government will not tackle in a hurry the deplorable state of our roads. Therefore, it is critical that the drivers on our roads have sufficient skills to handle what generally amounts to bad driving conditions. As driver error is the main cause of most accidents we must move urgently to upskill our drivers. Young people in particular must be targeted in this context. We are all aware of the sense of jubilation with which young people drive cars. They are convinced they will be able to brake if necessary and they enjoy the thrills of travelling at high speeds. Tragically, reckless behaviour often has grave consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1364">The majority of people now choose to drive and it makes sense for aspects of driving to be addressed in second level schools. Driving theory and an adequate understanding of the cause of road accidents, and the consequences of speeding, drink driving and so forth should be included in second level education. Respect for vehicles, cars, motorbikes, trucks or tractors, is a lesson that must be learned early. Young people do not understand how powerful those machines are and how they are capable of inflicting great damage and loss of life if not treated with the caution and respect they deserve. Such matters must be understood from the start not learned the hard way, as happens with so many young people and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1365">Teachers are the best people to communicate with young people on driving safety. Transition year would be an ideal time to teach young people about driving skills, its responsibilities and the consequences of careless driving. This would be an ideal opportunity for young people in rural and urban areas to learn this life skill. I often observe leaving certificate students driving to school in their parent's cars. Transition year would provide an ideal opportunity for young people to learn driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1366">The long waiting lists for driving tests adds to the problem. It is possible to drive for up to five years on most roads in Ireland without having to sit a test. When a responsible young person chooses to sit a test he or she can be left waiting for up to a year in most cases. In Clonmel, for instance, the waiting period for a driving test is 53 weeks. The driving test centre in my constituency in Tipperary town is slightly better at 51 weeks. Constituents contact me every week of the year looking for their driving tests to be expedited, as in many cases it is required for their work. This is a deplorable situation. I commend the people involved in driving test centres for their courtesy at all times. The waiting time for driving tests must be improved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1367">Many people are put off sitting their driving test sooner rather than later because they have heard stories of friends and acquaintances who failed the test for simple reasons. A learner driver should only fail a test if he or she is deemed unfit to drive. The aim of the tester should not be to catch the learner driver out on a technicality. There is a clear need to ensure that all testers are trained to an appropriate standard and to implement common testing standards across the country. Ongoing supervision and quality control of driving testing is essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1368">The number of cars on our roads and the technical nature of our testing system often necessitate driving lessons from a qualified instructor. Lessons are normally sought when the long wait for a driving test is finally coming to an end rather than before an individual starts driving on the roads, which would be far more logical. The cost of driving lessons may contribute to this. Many young people struggle to afford steep insurance premiums and only fork out money for expensive driving lessons from a professional instructor when they really need to. This should not be the case. Driving lessons should be affordable, particularly for those driving for the first time. They should be the first resort of the learner driver rather than the last. The Department of Transport should examine seriously the possibility of introducing more affordable driving instruction for younger drivers. The possibility of incorporating a requirement to take one or two affordable driving lessons into the conditions for receiving one's first provisional licence is worth considering.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">Our speeding laws are almost laughable. As a regular traveller from County Tipperary to Dublin, I note that I am frequently overtaken by cars travelling well in excess of the speed limit. Many fail to slow down when passing through villages and towns. I often wonder how anybody living along routes such as that between Dublin and Cork manages to cross the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">There are other anomalies to be considered. As I travelled to the Munster hurling final in Cork last Sunday, I was amazed by the number of motorists pulled over by gardaí. Motorists actually believe the road into Cork is a motorway. There is a dual carriageway with a wide strip in the middle and motorists are certainly confused. I know of one who was pulled over and told by a garda while travelling to the match on Sunday that the road was causing considerable confusion. Motorists do not know the correct speed limit and are driving according to a higher one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1371">The issue of speed limits needs to be addressed. Changes should be marked clearly. The next time the Minister of State is travelling to Cork, he should look——</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_651">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1377">I am pleased to make a contribution on the Bill and that the Minister of State with responsibility for driving standards is present. It is probably one of the most important subjects we can discuss in the House. It is a matter of life and death and absolutely essential that we all work together to ensure regulations are in place to considerably improve the standard of driving.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">The standard of driving in Ireland is appalling. People from other countries have said this to me and are flabbergasted at how bad it is. Very often young people are blamed — we are familiar with the statistics in this regard — but none of us is innocent of driving to a poor standard. For instance, many do not know how to negotiate a roundabout properly. In addition, many of the markings on roundabouts are very confusing. When the Minister of State is in Cork, he might encounter some roundabouts which are such that one does not know where one is. Some are extremely dangerous. Road markings need to be very clear in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">Colleagues have spoken about road signs and the need to ensure they are adequate and located such that motorists are adequately warned that there is a turn-off ahead. Often one finds a sign on or beyond a turn-off, which is crazy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">Let me address another matter concerning road safety and driving standards. It is very hard to drive along a country road if hedgerows are almost meeting at its centre. On the last occasion we spoke on a related Bill I asked the Minister of State to consider this matter, particularly in the light of the growth rate of hedgerows at this time of year. Pedestrians are forced to walk in the middle of the road. Cars are also forced to drive in the middle. I know issues arise regarding wildlife, for example, but it is most important that hedgerows are cut to ensure roads are visible, especially around towns and because we are encouraging people to walk and cycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">I know many parents who will not let their children out on the roads in the countryside because they are too narrow and the hedgerows are growing out to the middle. Children are not allowed to cycle — rightly so — because it is too dangerous. Walkers also have major problems, especially around towns. The Minister of State should consider providing for one-way systems near towns whereby some roads could be designated for cyclists and walkers in consultation with the relevant local authorities. Perhaps he will talk to representatives from local authorities and consult local people to determine whether this would be possible but it should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">We can talk all we like about driving standards and testing but if the roads are unsafe for various reasons, the best driver in the world can have an accident. If he or she goes around a corner and meets a pedestrian or an oncoming car at a point on the road where the briars are growing out to the middle, he or she has nowhere to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">I have two young men at home who are starting to drive. Therefore, I have a vested interest in this matter. One is almost 20 years of age and the other is just over 17. Even the smallest of cars nowadays are high-powered and can travel at high speeds. When I drive with my lads, I repeatedly tell them to slow down and take it easy. I am thankful they are beginning to listen. Unfortunately, however, many young people do not listen and drive far too fast.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">I am very concerned about the fad among young people of buying older cars and spending considerable time and money souping them up. If one drives around, especially in my area which is to be found not too far from that of the Acting Chairman, Deputy Sherlock, one will find doughnut shaped marks on the road. People seem to be driving at high speed and, on approaching crossroads, pulling the handbrake such that the car spins and the tyres produce black rings on the road in the shape of doughnuts. I do not know if the Minister of State who is very experienced and knowledgeable on most matters has ever seen them. It is very scary to see drivers engaging in this practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">Certain drivers are attaching a device to the exhaust pipes of their cars to increase the noise levels. It is quite intimidating to hear such a car approaching, especially on a narrow road. The Minister and the Garda should investigate these noise emitters. They should be removed and not allowed to be used. They have no purpose, especially on a souped up car. The noise of cars should be kept below a certain level for everybody's sake.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">It is not right that engines are placed in small cars which are more powerful than the original engines. I believe this is illegal, although I stand to be corrected. The traffic corps should start examining the engines of suspect cars to determine whether they have been souped up or changed or whether they are much more powerful than they should be. The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the driver testing and standards authority, which will have primary responsibility for the delivery of the driver testing service. Other functions will include the testing and control of driving instructors and vehicles. It is important that instructors are properly trained and registered. They should be taught how to teach people to drive. As a former teacher, I recognise that teaching is a craft. Some of the current teachers are extremely good and others are not. Therefore I welcome the measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">The Bill also covers outsourcing, the establishment of subsidiaries and participation in companies, as well as the making of a service agreement between the authority and the Minister, which will set out the functions and tasks to be carried out and performance targets. The Bill places a duty on the authority to promote, develop and improve driving standards and to conduct its business at all times in a cost effective and efficient manner, which is to be expected. The authority will receive policy direction from the Minister for Transport and produce an annual report. This is all fairly standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">I welcome this Bill and the establishment of the authority, which will have some control over the driver testing system. It will also be charged with the development and improvement of driving standards, including the issuing of driving licences, testing of vehicles and regulation of driving instructors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">Unfortunately, except for sections 4 and 6, the Bill makes little provision for how all of this will be achieved. Everything else appears to be standard. Sections 4 and 6 are the meat of the Bill and deal with the issuing of driving licences, vehicle testing, regulation of driving instructors and the regulation of mechanically propelled vehicles. The Bill is vague on what it will do. The authority will promote development and improvement of driving standards and, with regard to this, it may make such recommendations to the Minister as it considers appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">We should seriously consider the introduction of advanced driving courses, which are crucially important. I spoke on this matter previously as a result of speaking to an experienced professional driver. He believed he was a good driver until he did an advanced driving course and discovered that he was not half as good as he thought. When professional people from the UK sat with him and taught him how to drive according to advanced standards he discovered his mistakes and the ways in which he could improve his driving. He was a professional driver and on the road every day but he welcomed the opportunity to do the course. Perhaps the Minister should enter into discussions with insurance companies so that anybody who does such a course gets some form of a reduction.</p>

It is rare for people to be taught how to drive at night, on ice or in bad conditions, which is when most accidents occur. Driving instruction must incorporate driving at night and in the rain. At this time of the year, when days are long, young drivers in particular think everything is fine. However, it is a completely different situation in the winter, especially when the hour changes and dusk sets in earlier. It takes time to get used to that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1399">The Bill has been criticised by consultants Farrell Grant Sparks for its limited functional remit in its report to the Department. The report called for centralised responsibility for all aspects of road safety, including vehicle and driver testing enforcement and road planning, within a road safety authority. This wider remit would offer a more focussed approach to limiting the causes of road accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">I hope action will be taken to reduce long waiting lists. Currently, more than 100,000 provisional licence holders are waiting to sit the test. The average waiting time is ten months and in some parts of the country it is 14 months. The waiting time in Ireland is far longer than in other European countries. The average waiting time in Northern Ireland is four weeks. A longer waiting time means a larger proportion of provisional licence holders on the road and high insurance premiums for these drivers. With a pass rate of approximately 50%, many young drivers are unfairly penalised for holding provisional licences when they may be competent drivers. This matter must be dealt with and we should have shorter waiting times. A provisional licence holder should not drive on the roads unless accompanied by a fully licensed driver. This is not happening in practice as shown by the figures. Waiting times should be shorter and provisional licence holders should be accompanied at all times by a fully licensed driver.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">Once their test is completed, people consider themselves fully-fledged qualified drivers and think they can put the boot down. The Minister of State should consider the possibility of a plate with a "P" indicating probation driver being placed on a car for a period of six months after the test. This would show that the driver has just completed the test and can drive on his or her own. However, the newly qualified driver would know that if he or she went over the speed limit he or she would get increased penalty points and this would keep him or her in line somewhat. It is important because newly-qualified drivers are inclined to put the boot down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">There is a need to incorporate driving instruction in secondary schools, particularly transition year. Some people have mentioned having an area of land close to the school, such as a non-public road, for use in training young people to handle cars. This is important in terms of controlling standards. Theory and road safety should form a module in transition year, which is the time to do it. Most schools have a transition year programme. I am slow to suggest that schools can solve every one of society's problems and that we should overload them. However, this would be a welcome measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">Along with the issue of driving standards is the matter of driving under the influence of drugs. Perhaps the Minister of State could let us know of the type of tests that indicate whether a person has taken a banned substance, such as cannabis or ecstasy, and is now behind the wheel. How is that currently tested and is it effective? What statistics exist? I ask for the Minister of State to take this issue seriously and am very interested in his response. Otherwise he can communicate the information to me privately in writing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1404">The Minister of State is a very good man when it comes to raising public awareness for all types of issue. Perhaps he will do so with regard to the issue of drivers getting tired behind the wheel and falling asleep late at night. Other countries have addressed this serious issue. There were a number of road accidents in my part of country recently, and it has been suggested that the driver fell asleep at the wheel, crashed the car and was killed. The Minister of State should raise awareness by way of television advertisements that tell people that if they feel drowsy while driving, they should not slap themselves to stay awake, turn on the radio or open the window. Rather they should pull over and put their head down, whether it is day or night. It can be very hard to stay awake in the early hours of the morning and the Minister of State should take this on board as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1405">In many European countries not only does an individual have to pass a theory and written test, there is also a compulsory requirement to attend theory classes beforehand and undertake practical driving lessons with a qualified and registered instructor before a candidate can attempt a practical driving test. That should be built into this legislation; that a person would take, for example, ten lessons. Until a candidate passes a practical driving test it should not be legal for him or her to drive a car, except in the company of a professional driving instructor. The Government, in the national road safety strategy for 2004 to 2006, set a target of reducing road fatalities to less than 300 per annum. In 2004, 325 people lost their lives on the roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_1406">In addition to tackling speeding and drink driving, an effective means of reducing the number of fatalities on Irish roads is to engender a responsible attitude to driving in drivers from the beginning, by making a certain number of professional driving lessons mandatory before learner drivers are allowed to drive on the open road, even if accompanied by a licensed driver. Once these lessons have been successfully completed, learner drivers should be encouraged to apply for a driving test immediately. This would help to cut down on the number of provisional licenceholders on the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_1407">It has also been suggested that the size and power of cars driven by younger drivers should be controlled. Furthermore, perhaps the speed at which such cars can travel should also be controlled, so that they can only travel at a certain speed. It is possible to do this, I understand, by inserting a regulator into the engine of the car to control speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1408">Unfortunately, figures from the National Roads Authority and the National Safety Council show that driver error was the cause of 81% of all crashes — both fatal and those resulting in injury — from 1997 to 2002. Male drivers aged between 18 and 24 represent the largest group of those drivers involved in crashes, at 24%. There are no figures, I understand — unless the Minister of State has them — to indicate how many of these drivers were provisional licenceholders. However, the NRA notes that, statistically, those aged between 17 and 24 are 7.7 times more likely to be involved in a fatal or serious injury collision. Given the age range, we should assume that a reasonable proportion of these drivers are provisional licenceholders or are, at least, less experienced drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1409">In Ireland, for every mile driven, a 17 year old male is seven times more likely to be involved in an accident than a middle aged man. Research carried out in the United Kingdom suggests that an 18 year old driver is three times as likely to be involved in an accident as a 48 year old. This trend is reflected in the road casualty statistics of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the United States of America, which shows that the younger the age limit for driving, the higher the proportion of casualties in the relevant age bracket. A larger proportion of those aged 17 are hurt or killed than those aged 18 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1410">As I said earlier, the National Safety Council notes that the primary cause of death in single vehicle accidents is speeding. Younger males are more likely to take risks when driving than older, more experienced men. I spoke earlier about the need for practical instruction through professional and fully qualified driving instructors to deal with that issue. The fact that anyone can offer driving lessons is ludicrous and is an area that needs urgent attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_1411">It is not only young drivers who drive dangerously. Older drivers also drive dangerously and I urge the Minister to introduce advanced driving courses to address that problem. It must be remembered that while we talk about road deaths, there are also road injuries, in some cases horrific in nature. There are young, chronically ill people in hospitals and nursing homes whose lives have been ruined. Families are tragically affected by a member being injured, possibly badly, for life. This is something that we must not forget — the number of people who are injured. Perhaps the Minister of State would consider making known how many people are badly injured each year on the roads and not just the number of people killed. I wish the Minister of State well with this legislation, which is very important.</p>

          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1412">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill 2004. This is important legislation as there is a major public safety aspect to it and we have seen many deaths, injuries and horrific accidents on our roads recently. We all have to be vigilant and responsible when driving. Those in high office must obey the laws of the land on drinking and, particularly, driving when over the limit for alcohol. It is simply not acceptable for a former Minister to be involved in a drink-driving case, involving driving down the wrong side of a motorway. It is not acceptable nor is it understandable and the sympathy expressed in some quarters amazes me.</p>
          <p eId="para_1413">This is not a personal attack on anyone. It is about straight talking. If someone is out of order, involved in anti-social behaviour while drunk, he or she should be told straight out that such behaviour is wrong, whether that person is a former Minister, a family friend or a neighbour. Drink driving is anti-social behaviour and it is not acceptable. Gross irresponsibility should never be an option. People who have been involved in drink driving, who have caused major destruction on our roads, should be very careful.</p>
          <p eId="para_1414">This is also not a case of kicking someone when he or she is down. It is about telling a person straight out that he or she was wrong, out of order and should grow up and accept responsibility. We all have a duty, as legislators, to lead by example and sitting on the fence on such a major public safety issue is simply not an option. This is not a case of taking the high moral ground. It is about trying to do the right thing across all sectors of society. It is a challenge for us all. Our citizens are demanding leadership and a change of hearts and minds. This debate must be part of that process on the question of road safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_1415">With regard to the detail of the legislation, we see that the purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of the Driver Testing and Standards Authority, whose primary responsibility will be the delivery of the driver testing service. Other functions relating to the testing and control of drivers, driving instructors and vehicles will be transferred to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">Recently we saw an horrific crash in County Meath and I express my sympathy to all the families involved. We need to be very conscious of safety and, in particular, safety on buses. All school buses should be inspected in a professional and objective manner and should be driven by competent and professional drivers. Some school buses provide examples of good practice regarding seat belts and other issues. I would also encourage the Minister of State to look at the idea that when a school bus stops, all traffic around it also stops to allow children to alight in a safe manner. This practice is already in operation in the United States and would save lives here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">A number of Deputies have mentioned learner drivers. Learner drivers get a bad press. The vast majority that I know — and it has been my experience over the past 20 years — are very careful drivers. Because they are only starting to drive, they are very safety conscious. In fact, many learner drivers are more safety conscious than some of the so-called qualified drivers. It is unfair to give learner drivers a bad press because the vast majority of them — I would say more than 90% — never had any accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">On the matter of school buses, a constituent of mine advised me recently that school buses are dangerous and that not enough inspections are carried out on them. I ask the Minister of State if this is correct. Regarding Bus Éireann, is there a competent examination of all buses, including their tyres, engines, brakes and fire safety facilities? Is there a system in place that will allow us to have maximum confidence regarding road safety and road worthiness? Another constituent of mine has told me that mechanics are sometimes afraid to sign off on safety issues for buses and that senior managers often intervene to provide the sign-off. Is this correct? I do not know, but it is a serious issue that needs to be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">The role of education in road safety and driving is important. Education can assist everybody in pursuing road safety in a competent and professional way. Indeed, many of our primary schools do an excellent job in this regard. Road safety is already part of the school curriculum and many primary school children visit the traffic schools, do courses and watch videos on the subject. I commend the primary school teachers for their excellent work in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">Given that the Minister of State is in the House, I would also like to raise the issue of road safety as it relates to the Dublin Port Tunnel. There are issues in this regard about which we must be vigilant, particularly tunnels, fire safety and the collapse of roofs. We have seen damage done to over 205 homes recently. We have also heard complaints about the roofs and sections of the port tunnel. There are safety concerns regarding the tunnel. I raise these issues because they are relevant to the debate tonight.</p>

          <summary class="Right" eId="sum_126">—(Minister for Foreign Affairs).</summary>
          <speech by="#LizODonnell" eId="spk_663">
            <from>Ms O’Donnell</from>
            <p eId="para_1424">I wish to share time with Deputy Carey.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this timely debate. I note the Minister's lengthy, comprehensive and informative contribution to the House last night in which he addressed the motion and dealt with all of the cross-cutting issues which affect the global poor. I fully recognise the comprehensive nature of the motion tabled by the Green Party dealing as it does with issues of aid, arms, trade and the environment, all topics to be addressed at the G8 summit. However in the time available to me I want to focus on Ireland's overseas development aid programme in the context of our foreign policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">Like it or not — this may be uncomfortable for those on the Government side — Ireland's aid budget is the dominant issue for public discussion and has been for some time since it became clear that the Government had allowed the target date of 2007 to slip. As a former Minister of State with responsibility for this area of policy for five years and as the person who brought the proposal to Cabinet that Ireland should reach the UN target of 0.7% by 2007 and stood with the Taoiseach in New York as he announced it to the international community, I feel a particular responsibility and personal disappointment that, for reasons which have never been properly explained to the House, this policy decision has been reversed. Certainty was removed while our intentions were left open-ended. Worse still, in some quarters there has been a slow unravelling of the principle of reaching the UN target. This doubt will persist among citizens and in the House until a new date is set by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The policy decision that Ireland should reach the UN target by 2007 was no ordinary policy initiative made on the hoof or spun by way of a press release. There were extensive pre-Cabinet decision negotiations, arguments and preparations over a protracted period. The decision was in accordance with the then programme for Government of the two parties. Moreover and more importantly, it enjoyed the support of all parties in the House, the social partners, the churches, the trade unions and the business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Following the Cabinet decision, there was an extensive year long review involving stakeholders, representatives of international organisations, the Secretaries General of three Departments and other eminent persons to put in place a comprehensive blueprint to underpin the expansion of the programme. It was approved by the Cabinet. The issues examined included the geographical spread of the programme, capacity issues, staffing and resource issues, the mix of activities in our programme of renown, a review of our model of aid and a limited range of new policy matters, specifically a focus on HIV and AIDS in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">We decided to deepen our engagement with Africa, increase the capacity of missionaries and NGOs which depend on our resources for their excellent work and carefully expand into other poor African countries on a gradual basis. East Timor was chosen as a new priority country. We also looked at developing a programme in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1430">This was all laid out in the review of the aid programme mentioned. I say this not to be unhelpful but to make the point to colleagues that those who say the decision was unplanned or, in some way, premature are wide of the mark. All the work was done and the decision was copper-fastened by a Cabinet decision and announced to the international community. It was planned; we took the decision in our senses and meant it at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">There is agreement to be found in the motion, as amended, which is to be welcomed. The motion calls on the Government to set a new target date and an important concession has been made in the amended motion. The Government has agreed that a new target will be set before the Taoiseach attends the millennium summit in New York in September. While this is a welcome development, there is a question as to what the timeframe will be.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The abandonment of the target date of 2007 has understandably met with genuine criticism. Whatever appraisal is made of Ireland's performance in the provision of ODA, it should be fair as the truth is important in these matters. It is fair to say, however, the Government has moved away from meeting the UN target by 2007. That is a fair and true statement but regrettable. However, I will not attempt to justify it, as others have done. I regard it as indefensible as a political decision and the Government has been rightly criticised, including by Members on this side of the House and members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. However, it is also fair to say Ireland's aid programme has increased by €387 million, from €158 million in 1997 to €545 million today. It is also true that Ireland remains a leader among nations of the world in terms of the size of its <i> per capita </i>contribution to overseas development aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">Ireland's aid figures are certainly respectable and above the EU average and greater as a percentage of GNP than those of any of the G8 countries, as the Minister outlined to the House last night. Our focus on the least developed countries is commendable, as is our position on debt cancellation. The fact that all of Ireland's aid is untied is to our credit. This does not take away, however, from the political reality that a solemn commitment made by Ireland to the international community and the poor of the world has been reneged upon. The Taoiseach has stated we are not alone in this decision. The aid sector is littered with broken promises. Many promises and undertakings have been dishonoured by others. It should be remembered that the UN target was set over 30 years ago and remains unreached by all but six countries. Ireland took the conscious decision to buck that trend as our way of marking the millennium. It was to be a testament to our humanitarian and civilised values as a nation. We cannot now seek cover by hiding with other defaulters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">The sad political reality is that aid budgets in every country are the most vulnerable to attack and plunder to meet competing domestic demands. That is precisely the reason I, when Minister of State, argued for and achieved a multi-annual financial package and an agreed schedule of incremental allocations to bring us to the year 2007, thus liberating the programme from the annual Estimates wrangle, in which the aid budget is pitched against other domestic priorities. Notwithstanding the agreed programme, slippage was allowed to happen and our aid programme is again enmeshed and competing with legitimate domestic funding priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1435">I welcome the fact that guaranteed increases have been agreed for a three period, amounting to a total accumulated budget of €1.8 billion. However, these must be seen as minimum increases and additional funds will have to be allocated if a credible advance towards the UN target is to be achieved by a newly set date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">As I said on a previous occasion in the House, the global poor do not march on parliaments; they are out of sight and out of mind. At times the squalor and hopelessness of their lives render them and their plight forgettable and difficult to consider. Thankfully, a new alliance is growing among our citizens, young and old, based on activism and idealism, as will be evident tomorrow. I welcome this as a solid contribution to Government policy from civil society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">Jeffrey Sachs said recently:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1438">We cannot simply close our eyes and hope that Africa's problems will resolve themselves, because they will grow steadily worse if we continue to ignore them. That is not good for anybody, neither for Africans, nor for rich countries. Right now, Africa has 900 million people, most of them impoverished, but in one generation, that number will exceed 1.5 billion people struggling against disease, instability, hunger, and violence. So the problem will not go away on its own. We must help solve it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">Recently Kofi Annan said in Dublin that coming to the aid of the global poor was not just about charity but about enlightened self-interest. We ignore the global poor at our peril, in a world that is increasingly inter-dependent.</p>
            <p eId="para_1440">My central point concerns the integrity of solemn commitments. Ireland gave a solemn commitment. We made that promise in our full senses to the international community. Making that commitment meant first winning that argument within Cabinet and this House and with the social partners and the NGOs. That is the central principle that underpins the commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1441">In the debate on this issue Members on all sides of the House must be resolute. We cannot reopen the argument on the principle of solidarity with poor countries and in meeting the commitment to reach the 0.7% target. We cannot begin to unstitch that. It was the right thing to do when the commitment was made and it is the right thing to do now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1442">I look forward to the announcement shortly by the Government of the new target. It is a critical point on which our partners in Africa, and in particular, our own people will judge our credibility and integrity.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_664">
            <from>Mr. Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_1443">I am pleased to speak on this motion. I compliment the members of the Green Party on tabling it. As I said to Deputy Eamon Ryan earlier, it is very much an omnibus motion but it gives us the opportunity to focus on key issues. Like Deputy O'Donnell, I too am a member of the foreign affairs committee and I too was one of those people who agreed, on a cross-party basis, to support our commitment to reach the 0.7% target by 2007. I am disappointed and take no pride in having to stand up here and say we have not achieved it. I am not critical of the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Connor Lenihan, who is doing a fine job, or of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It was a solemn commitment entered into for very good reasons. We should, in so far as we possibly can, honour that commitment at the earliest possible date. I am well aware of what commitments have been entered into at EU level but we can do better than that. I recognise that we are being lectured by the great and the good but we take our responsibilities seriously.</p>
            <p eId="para_1444">I have been in various locations with Members of this House. I was at the UNCTAD Conference in Sao Paulo — information on which I found among my papers this afternoon — with the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and others around this time last year where the issues of trade and development were addressed. I listened to people like President Museveni of Uganda talk about his vision for Uganda and Africa. I did not agree with everything he said but he set out his stall in a coherent and strong manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1445">I have seen the work Development Co-Operation Ireland has done in Uganda, the work done on HIV-AIDS projects, the co-operation among Trinity College, St. James's Hospital and projects in Kampala and work on the malaria projects. I recognise the success of these projects in reducing child mortality. I saw projects on education, HIV-AIDS and health. I recall it being an emotional occasion when I saw hundreds of children walk down a mountainside in the Tigre area of Ethiopia last September on their way to school to sit, in the case of one school, in a class of 102 students but they would not have been going to school were it not for the support of Irish taxpayers, Development Co-operation Ireland and this Government. The fact that we have been able to contribute towards the training of their teachers and the development of their curriculum has made a great difference in Ethiopia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1446">During the course of my visit there I met a disparate and disjointed group of opposition politicians who were reluctant to meet us because there were afraid. However, I was pleased to see how well the opposition did in the recent elections in Ethiopia. I am concerned about the fallout, the oppression and the killing that has taken place. I have made the point to the Ethiopian authorities that our support of Ethiopia is not unconditional, but our support involves support for good governance. One point we made clear to President Museveni last year was that we support the emergence of a strong opposition as well as a strong government party there. Developing countries must realise that there is a price to pay for agreeing to be supported by countries like Ireland. They must have a vibrant, critical opposition and a critical media.</p>

            <from>Mr. Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_1448">I am delighted they are here. In that respect, I fully support the motion and the Government's amendment to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1449">I want to slightly shift the focus of the debate. I have a healthy scepticism of promises which cannot be kept. The Taoiseach, in all sincerity, meant to keep that promise on behalf of the Irish people. It is regrettable that circumstances have dictated otherwise. I hope everybody here on an all-party basis, the NGO sector and civil society will be able to encourage the Government to be as courageous as it possibly can in fulfilling its commitment to meet the 0.7% target at the earliest possible date — I mean a good deal earlier than 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1450">I want to focus on the issue of trade. We cannot have aid — we can but it will not work — without trade. I was interested to note that today the Minister of State, Deputy Ahern, in speaking at a function in Farmleigh mentioned that central to Ireland's approach and that of our EU partners is a commitment to respond positively to the concerns of developing countries. He said this is considered to be an essential part of the Doha development agenda and it is clear that there will be no successful conclusion of the negotiations unless it is shown that developing countries are being treated fairly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">Trade, aid and development is very much a coherent package. Ireland has a good record. It is a pity we are arguing among ourselves about how the implementation of aspects of this policy are to be furthered but I believe this will be resolved and we will be able to return to an agreed agenda on a way forward in supporting Africa, South America, Vietnam, East Timor and many others who have benefited from our support and we have benefited, in turn, from our involvement in communities in those countries.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" eId="spk_667">
            <from>Mr. Andrews</from>
            <p eId="para_1452">I have two proposals, the first of which concerns the economic partnership agreements. It has been widely acknowledged that there are serious dangers involved in arriving at these types of agreements. Through the european affairs committee we were about to raise this matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan. He raised it with the General Affairs and External Relations Council of the European Union to his credit. He explained that Members of this House were concerned about the manner in which those trade agreements are being decided. It seems that the European Union is saying that its hands are tied by World Trade Organisation rules and this is the case. The World Trade Organisation requires that free trade agreements must have reciprocity. In other words, these countries must open their markets in the same way as we open our markets, and the Lomé agreements are in breach of the requirement of reciprocity. The waiver that the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries are currently enjoying will lapse at the end of 2007. My proposal is simply that the Irish Government should argue that free trade rules that apply to EPAs should be linked to the attainment of certain development indicators, in other words, that the stricter interpretation of reciprocity would not kick in until certain standards in regard to education, health and social welfare are achieved. This would require a change to rules in regard to the WHO or at the very least a ruling on an interpretation of existing rules. That would be a positive measure for the Irish Government to take in the context that everybody shares the same view.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The second proposal arises from a debate on alternative methods of funding the millennium development goals apart from traditional aid. One of the proposals the Minister, Deputy Cowen, rejected recently, and rightly so, was in regard to an air tax because it would distort domestic economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">It is not my proposal, but the idea I would support is to tax the exports of armaments. One amazing statistic I saw recently was that since the Second World War 2% of wars have taken place in the developed world but 98% of armaments have come from there. That really says it all. Some 20% of armaments are required for the defence of countries. Everything else carries a moral question mark with it and a global tax on armament exports is something the Government should fight for, as an alternative and as an additional form of funding for the millennium development goals.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach (Mr. Kitt)</from>
            <p eId="para_1455">I welcome this debate. I thank the Green Party for allowing us to have the debate. As the House is aware I have been Minister of State with responsibility for ODA twice in my career, in 1993-1994 and in 2002-2004. I am especially pleased to be here in the company of another former Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy O'Donnell and my colleague, the current Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, as well as Deputies in other parties who have played a major role in this area over many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">I am proud to have played a role in the transformation of a Government programme which is the visible expression of our national solidarity with the poorest people on earth. Our national ODA programme, Development Cooperation Ireland — the name was chosen when I was Minister responsible — has always had a very high reputation for its quality and effectiveness. Development Cooperation Ireland reflects precisely what we are all about, acting in our role as partners to the countries that we are bilaterally involved with, especially in Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">The massive increase in the programme's funding over the years 2000-05 has propelled Ireland into the league of major donors. During my time as the Minister of State responsible, one of my key objectives was to communicate to the public how the Government was transforming the programme, how much money was being spent and what the impact of this money was on our developing country partners. I am convinced that unless we bring the people with us, we will lose the battle. I am also convinced that this debate will help greatly in shaping the Government's policy. I say that in a generous way to our Opposition colleagues. Ideally, it would be great to have an agreement tonight. I do not believe that is possible, but that is why this debate is so important. It is a pity we do not have more debates of this type.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">There has been an intense focus on development aid as an abstract statistical concept. We talk in percentages of gross national income, GNI, and statistical targets. I want the debate to focus more on both the volume of aid and innovations in policy. In 2000 when the Government set a timeframe for reaching the UN target our aid volume was €254 million. In 2005, ODA will reach €545 million. ODA has more than doubled in volume over the past five years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1459">In 2002, the UN and the World Bank called for a doubling of ODA by all donors to meet the millennium development goals. We have doubled aid in five years. No other donor in the OECD area has increased aid volume at such a rate. The Government will continue to give substantial and sustained increases in ODA in the three years 2005-07. Over this period our aid volume will increase by a further €190 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1460">The setting of a timeframe to meet the UN target in 2007 has galvanised the system. In effect, the aid budget is now ringfenced and is guaranteed substantial annual increases in volume. I acknowledge the role my colleague, Deputy O'Donnell, played in that initiative. That ODA enjoys a protected status in the budget reflects the Government's commitment to meeting the UN target. The Government has indicated it will set a new timeframe for meeting the UN target. This will ensure that aid volume will continue to increase in the coming years in a steady and sustained way until the target is met.</p>
            <p eId="para_1461">There are unique elements to our national aid programme which underpin its effectiveness. For a start we do not tie aid. Even donors that are often quoted to us as models still tie significant portions of their aid programmes. I have seen that in many countries I have visited, especially in Africa, over the years. Our aid is concentrated in the poorest countries. We have had a disciplined and focused approach to ODA. Our programmes are mostly concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa, and in regions of dire humanitarian emergency. We do not have a sprawling and unfocused programme where ODA is spread thinly among many recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Our aid programme is enormously innovative in terms of its policy and its delivery. When I was Minister of State in 2002-04, the OECD conducted a peer review of our programme. The conclusion was that we had one of the most innovative and effective programmes of any donor. The OECD sees us as an international leader in promoting new approaches and in delivering effective aid. As we increase ODA up to the UN target, I want this debate to focus more and more on the content of the programme and on its effectiveness. The massive increase in aid volume allows Ireland to stake out an international leading role in new and exciting areas of development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">I will mention three that I strongly supported as the responsible Minister of State. It is not fully appreciated in this House that Ireland is one of the leading international donors in the area of HIV/AIDS. Our aid programme recognised the potential scale and impact of the AIDS epidemic well before many other donors. Ireland was one of the first donors to have a strong and coherent strategic approach to fighting the disease. In particular, it strongly supported research into an AIDS vaccine, one of the most innovative and exciting scientific research projects in the world today.</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">We need to bring our national expertise in information and communications technology to bear on our aid programme. The ICT industry has a strong record of developing new approaches to dealing with problems. As our national aid programme expands, I would like to see it develop a strong partnership with the ICT sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1465">Ireland's ODA programme is now focusing more and more on the role of trade of the private sector in promoting the economic growth that is essential for long-term development. I established the Private Sector Forum, a vehicle for encouraging dialogue between Development Cooperation Ireland and the Irish private sector. I would like to see Irish expertise in food technology, in pharmaceuticals, in construction and other key areas of the economy brought into a partnership with our aid programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1466">Development Cooperation Ireland, in partnership with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has also done a great deal of work in the area of trade and development. As one of the most globalised economies in the world, as an EU member state that strongly supports the CAP, and as a country deeply engaged in fighting poverty in sub Saharan Africa, Ireland is uniquely placed to talk about issues of trade, agriculture and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1467">I have been involved in trade and development issues for many years. I participated in the talks at WTO level at Seattle, Doha and Cancun and worked closely with my other ministerial colleagues. The debate about the CAP and Africa has been too simplistic. For a start, all of the countries we work with in Africa are net food importers. Under the EU's Everything But Arms Agreement, they already have guaranteed access, duty and quota free, for their exports to the EU market. The real issue for them is not the CAP. It is how to build up their domestic productive capacity to avail of the new market opportunities on the EU market. So many times I have witnessed this as I have travelled abroad in Africa and other places. In Sierra Leone fishermen who were trying to sell their products abroad, did not have the capacity and could not deal with all the regulations. It is so frustrating to see so many fine agricultural producers, as in Zambia and Malawi, for instance, who did not have the capacity to deal with all the bureaucracy and sell and market their products. There is so much work we can do in those areas and working closely with trade policies at EU level with agricultural Ministers, we can get into those areas in a more profound way. Any rational analysis will show that the total liberalisation of the world agricultural market will not benefit the poor of Africa. It will benefit Brazil, Australia and the US where economies of scale mean that food can be produced at costs far lower than in the EU or Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1468">To listen to some Deputies one would think the Government had sat on its hands for the past five years. I want the figure of €545 million in ODA to be at the forefront of this debate. I want the figure of €1.8 billion in ODA over the next three years to be foremost in the public mind. These are ODA levels that were unimaginable just a few years ago. They are figures of which we should be proud. They have allowed us to create one of the most progressive and dynamic aid programmes in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">The real debate we should have is on how to ensure that as the programme increases towards €l billion, we will use it effectively to fight poverty. I am convinced we will make progress on this issue as we approach the millennium summit in the UN in September. This debate needs to look at new ways of delivering aid, new partnerships between the aid programme and dynamic parts of the private sector and new approaches to fighting disease.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_669">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1470">I am pleased to be able to speak on this very fine motion proposed by the Green Party, an Comhaontas Glas. It is much more than an omnibus motion. It is a linked motion with an integrated approach and one I fully support.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">On behalf of the Labour Party, we are not suggesting the Government has sat on its hands. We are suggesting that the Government has broken its promise given before the United Nations and with appalling consequences. This debate is not an occasion for self-congratulation but one of deep shame. I appreciate the presence in the House of two previous Ministers of State with responsibility for development co-operation, Deputies O'Donnell and Kitt, for whom I have the greatest respect. The current Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, also honours us with his presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The context in which discussion of the motion takes place is that of the world millennium development goals, eight targets adopted by the United Nations General Assembly in 2000. The goals can be summarised as follows: the reduction by half of those living in poverty and hunger by 2015; the achievement of universal primary education; the elimination of gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005 and at all levels by 2015; the reduction of child mortality among under fives by two thirds; the reduction of the maternal mortality ratio by three quarters; the halting of the spread of HIV-AIDS, tuberculosis, measles and malaria; the ending of environmental degradation and the achievement of a sustainable environment, a most welcome feature of this motion; and the creation of a fair global partnership for development. The final millennium goal is seldom discussed by the media simply because it imposes obligations on the richest countries and those who possess great power in the area of trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473"><i>En passant</i>, I will make a few points on the contributions I have heard this evening. Anybody who suggests the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, as negotiated, are fair or rules based must not have read the text. I appreciate Deputy Andrews’s interest in EPAs, which are much worse than the World Trade Organisation. For example, they re-introduce the Singapore issues, which were dropped between Doha and the resumption of the talks next December. Put simply, they are unequal bullying arrangements applied to African countries by Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">Professor Jeffrey Sachs, a person to whom many speakers justifiably referred, has summarised the impact of the eight millennium goals were they to be achieved between 2005 and 2015. I will speak as plainly as I can on this issue. If the goals were achieved, 500 million people would be lifted out of extreme poverty, 300 million people would no longer suffer from hunger, 350 million fewer people would lack access to clean water, 650 million people would have greater access to sanitation, 30 million children who would otherwise have died would be alive and the lives of 2 million women who would have died in childbirth would be saved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The achievement of the millennium development goals constitutes the greatest moral challenge of our time. Politically, it offers the best possible basis for a secure and responsible world. Socially and culturally, it vindicates the right of different societies to exist and flourish, tell their own stories, access their own memory and imagine their own future. Economically, it makes possible the emergence of new and exciting models of connection between the economy, society and culture. Ecologically, the achievement of the goals in the context of sustainable development would constitute a contribution to the planet as a whole that would stand as a contrast to the desolation visited on our common inheritance by irresponsible despoliation and abuse of resources in what is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the developed world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The achievement of the millennium goals will require a new partnership between the developed and developing world. It has implications for trade, aid, debt relief, reform of the international financial institutions and politics at every level.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477"><i>En passant</i>, I will put another question to the Minister of State <i>du jour</i>, Deputy Conor Lenihan, and his predecessor, Deputy Kitt. If they want reform of the international financial institutions, will they agree that officials from Development Co-operation Ireland will be nominated to serve in the advisory section of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank alongside officials from the Central Bank and Department of Finance? It would be interesting to have a straight answer to this straight question. Equally, if we were ever serious about achieving the target of allocating 0.7% of GDP to development co-operation, why was the Cassidy report on manpower requirements of DCI not implemented?</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">Before I deal with the sanctimonious notion that it may not have been possible to spend all the money envisaged under the 0.7% commitment, was it ever intended to spend it? Are staff changes and recruitment indicative of any serious intent?</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">As Professor Sachs puts it in his report to the UN Secretary General entitled, Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1480">Fortunately the costs of achieving the Goals are entirely affordable and well within the promises of 0.7 per cent of GDP made at Monterrey and Johannesburg. The required doubling of annual official development assistance to $135 billion in 2006, rising to $195 billion by 2015, pales beside the wealth of high-income countries — and the world's military budget of $900 billion a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1481">I am glad reference was made to militarisation. In 2004, the United States budget for military expenditure was $450 billion dollars, while its expenditure on the tied aid it provides, which amounts to 0.15% of GDP, was $15 billion. The cost to date of the Iraq war is more than $180 billion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1482">To return to Professor Sachs report, he states that "the increased development assistance for the Goals will only amount to one half of one per cent of rich countries' combined income." We should recall that those affected have been made many promises previously, including the new international economic order of the late 1970s which, I recall clearly, made an appeal to self-interest but was quickly cast aside as a single hegemonic neo-liberal model, established itself in the developed world and became an imposed instrument by the international financial institutions on the developing world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1483">Previous speakers referred to trust. It is important we do not break our word again. We gave a commitment to a world in which 2 billion people live in poverty, 30,000 children die every day, 500,000 mothers died last year during pregnancy, 3 million children died from AIDS last year, 120 million children have no access to primary education and 1 billion people have no access to sanitation, with all the medical consequences of this.</p>
            <p eId="para_1484">We do not need to be reminded of these terrible and entirely avoidable statistics, or perhaps we do at a time when our Government is breaking its promise to the poorest of the poor. A UNICEF report in 1989 calculated that the additional financial resources required to meet the most essential of human needs by the year 2000 would be between $30 billion and $50 billion dollars per annum, approximately one twentieth of military expenditure in that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1485">We were here before — in 1989 — when we looked forward to 2000. In that year, primary health care could have been made available at a cost of around $5 per person, primary education or adult literacy could have been provided at a cost of $25 per person and basic sanitation of piped water would have cost $6 per person per annum. The opportunity of responding at the end of the 1980s, like the opportunity of creating a new economic order at the end of the 1970s, was lost. Trust is, therefore, crucial as we face into the challenge we have accepted of achieving the world millennium development goals by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">The worst aspects of the Government's failure thus far to meet the commitments solemnly given to the United Nations General Assembly in September 2000 is the betrayal of trust involved and the bad example it gives not only to fellow members of the European Union but to the entire international community. We no longer compare ourselves to countries such as Norway which has raised its commitment to 1% of GDP. Instead, the Taoiseach this morning compared himself to President Bush. There is a moral message in this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">Ireland was held up as an example to others when the Taoiseach stated unequivocally that we would reach the UN target of 0.7% in 2007. Our commitment was particularly appreciated in continents such as Africa, which so desperately need untied aid and genuine assistance with their task of development, and the votes of African countries followed. Now, Ireland will be remembered as the country that became too rich to keep its promise to the poorest of the world. No other logical construction can be put on the Taoiseach's comments today other than that if Ireland had entered a recession, he would have been able to keep his promise. Unfortunately, however, as a result of Ireland becoming rich, he cannot keep it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">The world we have made, and that we are now in the process of remaking, is increasing its military expenditure and reducing its expenditure on aid. In 1995, global military expenditure was $864 billion while the estimated global expenditure on the treatment of AIDS, TB and malaria was $15 billion. Between 1945 and 1995, 23 million people, military and civilian, died due to war. In the same period, 150 million died due to AIDS, TB and malaria. These matters can be addressed now.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Today and every day, 3,000 people die from malaria, three out of four of them children. Every year 1.5 million die from TB and 8 million are infected. Those are just some of the features our commitment was to address when it was given in September 2000. They have not changed. We have changed in our commitment. The world to which our commitment was addressed has got worse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">Next year there will be a review of where all countries stand in the achievement of these goals. The special representative appointed by Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, to canvass for achievement of these goals is a former Development Minister, Eveline Herfkens. She has expressed her grave disappointment at Ireland's announcement that it will not meet its commitment. Those who had welcomed Ireland's commitment will see the breach of trust and the bad example it gives as little more than a betrayal.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">Already there is a shortfall on the commitments made towards fulfilling the millennium development goals. The AIDS-HIV action programme has a shortfall of more than 50%. As the directors of a number of non-governmental organisations have pointed out, more than 8,000 people die from AIDS every day and, in that context, our Government's decision is "a shameful breach of faith with the world's poorest people", as Mr. Hans Zomer of Dóchas said when speaking for a group that represents 34 development organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1492">The Government announced its commitment in September 2000. It was a commitment that it repeated as late as the 58th General Assembly of the United Nations in 2003. It included the commitment in its Government programme. It negotiated with the trade union movement on the basis of the commitment with the assumption that the mid-term point would be 0.45%. The Government never reached that, and now its achievement in 2005 is at most 0.41%, including the additional €10 million being spent on tsunami relief. At the present rate it would not reach its 0.7% commitment until 2028.</p>
            <p eId="para_1493">I wonder if the Government realises the support here for honouring our commitments on aid, for being a leader in the case for fair trade, implementing a meaningful cancellation of debt and being courageous in supporting such initiatives as the Tobin tax. There is every evidence that the public have a morally more advanced position than the Government on each of these.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">Tonight we are not just discussing aid, but an integrated approach in a comprehensive motion that includes debt, trade, reform of the international financial institutions and ecological responsibility. We should remember that in some of the poorest countries, debt service exceeds the combined health and education budget with consequent loss of life for, among others, children. If developing countries increased their share of world exports at 1999 prices by 5% it would be worth $350 billion, seven times total aid. A 1% export increase would reduce world poverty by 12%. What we do in aid, even if it is untied, and I acknowledge that, is but a portion of what an unequal world of trade and a pernicious world of debt is robbing from the developing world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1495">The present round of debt cancellation is an extremely welcome first step to lighten the burden on many African countries. We must ensure that issues of debt, trade and aid are taken together when considering strategies for the development of the world's poorest countries. Beyond these basic steps there are other crucial development issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1496">So far the G8 and its major contributors have been silent on reform of the international financial institutions, as have we. The conditions imposed by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank can impede the benefits of debt relief and increased aid. Zambia is a good example — the price of debt relief there under the limited heavily indebted poor countries debt initiatives was the privatisation of the Zambian National Commercial Bank in which many small people have deposits. Under public pressure the Zambian Government withdrew from its proposal. The cost was $1 billion in debt write-offs and the Government has had to reintroduce the proposal and there will be a bid for the bank from a consortium located in South Africa.</p>
            <p eId="para_1497">The development debate is now very much narrower than it was when I first began speaking about it in these Houses in the 1970s. An example is the failure in recent times to address the issue of appropriate technology transfer. If models based on indigenous or appropriate technology that were labour intensive had been chosen — and many of the countries towards which these were addressed by way of assistance were 70% rural in nature — they would have had a better effect in encouraging participation and would have been preferable to forms of technology transfer at the top end which suited multinationals, donor governments and receiving elites who did not use them for the benefit of the countries involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1498">Such models have been rejected at times in favour of models of capital intensive technology. If a different model of technology of transfer had been used, countries would be further along in developing food security, getting clean water and sanitation and the basic infrastructure needed for agricultural production and innovation in the production of such products as might in time make it to the export market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1499">The opportunity must be taken to massively increase the expenditure on education and health and use the relief of debt cancellation for such purposes. More importantly still, it must include participation, advocacy and empowerment measures. The nonsense must stop of thinking that they are not part of the development agenda, we must end this sneering undercurrent that advocacy is somehow less than other direct food relief.</p>
            <p eId="para_1500">As for trade, which will be a litmus test for the major global economies, we must never forget that a 1% increase in trade by developing countries would reduce poverty by 12%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1501">While the elimination of corruption is important and the reform of governance necessary, it is surely more positive to concentrate on strategies and opportunities for the development of civil society that will come from the social expenditure made possible by debt cancellation. The Labour Party's decision to lodge the commitment on overseas development aid in legislation is but a first step in an integrated approach such as that outlined in the motion towards tackling the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">I would like to dispose of the suggestion that we would not be able to spend this additional aid effectively. When Trócaire made its submission to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs in November 2004, it said:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1503">In the context of achieving the Millennium Development Goals, the World Bank and IMF have estimated that at least $30 billion could be absorbed by poor countries immediately, rising to over $50 billion per year in the medium term. The World Bank and IMF have found that an immediate doubling of aid could be used effectively in Ethiopia.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">Another myth is that debt relief or increased aid has not been used well. In Benin, 43% of HIPC debt relief, achieved with severe conditions, went to education in 2002, allowing the recruitment of teachers for empty posts in rural areas. A total of 54% went to health, of which a fifth was used to recruit health staff for rural clinics, and the remainder was allocated to implementing HIV-AIDS and anti-malarial programmes. In Mali a monthly stipend is provided to more than 5,000 community teachers using HIPC relief. In Niger a special programme that focuses on rural education, health, food security and water systems has been fully financed through HIPC. In Malawi, HIPC resources have been used to train 3,600 new teachers a year. In Burkina Faso, 39% of HIPC relief has been spent on education, 33% on health and 28% on rural roads.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">The poorest of the world need an integrated, sustained commitment across all of the issues of debt, trade and aid. We could have spent the money; they needed it. The Government's White Paper, which is being travelled around the country, must deal with all of these issues across the relevant Departments such as Foreign Affairs, Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A White Paper that descends to being an internal document in Foreign Affairs would be of limited value.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">The people of Ireland, and those who support this motion, do not want to be remembered as the country that became too rich to meet its solemn commitment to the poorest of the poor in the world at the time of greatest need, when good example and leadership required that we do otherwise. We want something other than that. It is important, even now, to call on the Government to announce, as soon as possible, its commitment not just to the 0.7% target but to the changes required across the relevant Departments and international financial institutions that will give us the integrated reform the motion proposes.</p>

I find it interesting to note the Fine Gael Party, like the Government is not prepared to accept it in all its provisions.

            <p eId="para_1511">Equally, the reneging of the solemn promise given by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, at the UN to meet the 0.7% GNP target, sullied the good name of Ireland in a most unnecessary and reprehensible way. If for no other reason than to restore Ireland's honourable good name, the Government must reaffirm Ireland's commitment to this target at the forthcoming UN millennium summit. I accept that the overseas development aid contribution of €1.8 billion between 2005 and 2007 will mark a significant increase in Ireland's aid programme. We could indeed be proud of it, if it were not for the commitment given, which now appears to be an act of hypocrisy and opportunism at a time when a seat on the security council was the motivating factor and not justice for the world's poorest countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1512">I am not interested in the posing of mega-rich rock stars telling us what we must do with the tax we pay, when they themselves do not pay their own fair share of tax for anything, whether for our hospitals or aid to Africa.</p>

            <p eId="para_1514">Ireland must honour the commitment of the 0.7% target sooner than 2015, the date given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, this morning. International social justice is to a significant degree dependent on fair trade. A real test to our commitment to achieving justice for the less developed countries is to review, a reasonable term, all subsidies given to producers in the developed affluent world. We must re-examine the effect of those subsidies on the less developed world.</p>

            <p eId="para_1515">In 2000 the Millennium Declaration adopted by world leaders represented a declaration of solidarity with all those in the Third World. The overall goal was to lift 300 million people out of extreme poverty and to save 30 million children who would otherwise die before their fifth birthday. To achieve these goals, Ireland made a commitment of devoting 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid by 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1516">In 2003, we reached 0.41% which put us ahead of Australia at 0.25%, Greece at 0.21%, Italy at 0.26% and the US at 0.14%. However, we were still behind other countries like Belgium at0.61%, Luxemburg at 0.8%, the Netherlands at 0.81% and Norway at 0.92%. These statistics disprove the Taoiseach's claim that Ireland is up there with the best in Europe. While we are not at the bottom, we are certainly not near the top. Our levels are less than half of the highest in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_1517">We need to live up to our commitments to those who depend on us for their very survival. We have reneged on our promises. As a nation we cannot hold our heads up and do this. As the second richest country in Europe, we should be leading the way along with Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands. Instead, we are defaulting on our commitments. For a nation that has a proud history of sending missionaries and aid workers to Third World countries, in poor and hard times, we now have a binding obligation to keep our promises in good times. The Minister of State at the Department of Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, said there was an impression we are not doing anything. We are, but it is not enough. Just two years ago the Taoiseach told the World Bank that the need for increased overseas development aid was more evident than ever and that Ireland would reach out to those less fortunate than ourselves. That time has now come.</p>
            <p eId="para_1518">We need to revisit the proposals from the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development on the new sugar regime. While we know the effects of these proposals on Ireland, they can be offset by compensation payments. However, for countries like Ghana these proposals are a disaster. It already has a preferential trade agreement on sugar with the EU. However, the new proposals will cut 60% in prices and devastate Ghana's sugar industry. Last week I listened to the President of Ghana say that while the recently announced debt relief was welcomed, the proposed sugar regime would instantly wipe out the benefit of the cancellation three times over.</p>
            <p eId="para_1519">I commend this motion to the House and I congratulate the Green Party on putting forward such a timely and comprehensive motion which reminds us of our solemn commitments to the poorest of the poor.</p>

            <p eId="para_1520">I congratulate the Green Party for putting forward this composite motion, spelling out clearly the deficiencies in what we are doing for our poorer brethren of the world. We must have a conscience about this matter because Ireland was a country where entire families were wiped out by TB and it was ravaged by famine and emigration through  which so much of our population was decimated. These days, few people die of TB and malaria in the developed world. However, for the developing countries this is a different story where they are the largest killers. These are conditions about which something can be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1521">In the past in Ireland, TB was related to poor living conditions, basic sanitation and housing. This is the prevalent situation in the Third World. Knowing about it gives us a responsibility to tackle the issue. While some efforts are made, much more could be done. Targets have been set and every speaker has outlined the need to reach the 0.7% of GNP target to be devoted to overseas development aid by 2007. However, this commitment was broken. It is an indictment of where we stand as a country and a society. It behoves us to get on the right track with our responsibility to developing countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1522">AIDS is not just a health problem but a massive threat to the entire global community. Some 7,000 people die of AIDS and over 40,000 are being infected with HIV every day. These are major figures and 95% of these people are from developing countries. This tells the entire story. There are entire communities of AIDS orphans. These situations arise because their parents infected with HIV have not had the basic drugs to ensure a longer life. Speaking of longer life, an examination of the life expectancies in developing countries is telling. If we had the life expectancies of these countries, very few, if any Members would be here. For instance, life expectancy at birth in Mozambique is 41 compared with 77 in Ireland. Infant mortality at birth in Mozambique is 137 per 1,000. One can go through a list of other countries such as Lesotho where life expectancy is 35 and Zambia, where it is 32. These figures tell their own story. I wonder what we can do about them.</p>

            <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1523">The Government amendment to the Green Party motion is replete with hypocrisy. It acknowledges the need for international agreements to control the international trade in arms, to assist conflict resolution and to prevent the terrible cost to human lives and economically. The same Government has allowed our island to be a military aircraft carrier for the biggest imperialist superpower and arms merchant in the world to launch a murderous invasion of Iraq in support of a transparent lie that has killed and maimed tens of thousands of innocent people. It supports logistically the ongoing occupation of Iraq by this imperialist superpower. We cannot take this Government seriously in its commitment to the poor of the world after that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">The billions of humanity and the hundreds of millions of children who live in poverty, have no clean water and suffer disease and homelessness want to see poverty made history. However, that will not be achieved by well-meaning millionaire rock stars and artists cooing to the alleged gentler side of international establishment politicians who are the main spear carriers for the major multinational corporations which rob those poor countries with trade agreements and by other means, just as brutally as their forebears did with cannonballs and sailing ships in a past era.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">These are the same multinational corporations such as Shell which sent five decent Mayo residents to jail today. The courts have turned logic on its head to facilitate Shell, sending residents to jail to stop them from opposing works for which no consent has been given by the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and with no qualified risk assessment yet put into the public domain.</p>

            <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
            <p eId="para_1530">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important motion and I compliment the Green Party on tabling it. We live in an age of unprecedented wealth and prosperity and yet inhumane things happen. We are in a position whereby 30,000 children die every day and 800 million go to bed hungry. These statistics are not satisfactory and aid has a critical role to play in achieving goals. However, it is not a magic bullet or a cure-all for all ills. Experience has shown that where aid is deployed efficiently as part of a wider development strategy, it makes a lasting difference in helping people to lift themselves out of poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">However, approximately two thirds of the money currently spent on aid could be described as phantom aid in that it is not available for poverty reduction in developing countries. I am concerned about recent examples of this phenomenon. The value of such aid is deflated by excessive administrative costs, extravagant spending on overpriced technical assistance from consultants, double accounting of debt relief and tying aid to trade from donors' own firms. I am concerned about such practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">How much of Ireland's contribution could be classified as phantom aid which has been devalued by an administrative bureaucracy and other costs, such as monthly salaries of $6,000 and $7,000 and upwards? I have seen situations where administrators on such salaries have operated amidst rank poverty. It is gross and some form of example should be set. The World Health Organisation has people on such salaries in developing countries and it is immoral.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">I would like to see developed countries sponsoring, if one can use that term, individual countries. For example, Ireland could be the lead country in Ghana in terms of the aid sent there rather than giving small amounts of aid to every African country in the hope that the problem goes away. If each developed country were to adopt an under-developed country and provide the core people there, one would not have the same cost in administrators in X number of countries throughout Africa. This concept should be tackled and examined — efforts could be made to develop it as the G8 summit meets — because considerable sums of money are eaten up by administrators and it is not sensible to have such duplication of effort. One would be in a better situation to judge whether one was receiving value for money and one could report back on progress to one's own people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1534">Currently, the main argument is whether we are giving 0.7% of gross national product in aid. I am unsure as to whether it should be the biggest issue. We should consider how the money is spent and if there is a point to what we give. Is it hitting the target and getting results?</p>

          <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_685">
            <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
            <p eId="para_1535">The debt burden on developing countries is a symptom of the disease at the core of the international financial institutions, namely the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The role of these two anti-democratic bodies in world politics must be challenged. My party demands the overhaul, reform and democratisation of the IMF and the World Bank. These institutions and the interests they represent are responsible for the debt crisis. Every action they take is designed to benefit developed states at the expense of developing states. They were designed for this purpose and they are structured in a way which subjugates the interests of the developing countries to that of the powerfully developed states, in particular, the USA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">These institutions have played a major role in the growth of inequality in the world. The voting rights within both these bodies are stacked in favour of developed states and completely against developing countries. The selection procedure for the IMF and World Bank leaders are totally undemocratic as the presidency of the World Bank is always reserved for a North American. Voting rights within the IMF are based on the entry fee or share bought by a country when it joins. This share is calculated according to its economic and geopolitical importance. The number of voting rights to which each country is entitled is based on its share value. It is unacceptable that the USA has a blocking minority vote.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">Many developing states burdened by debt are within their rights under international law to refuse to pay these debts on the basis that the debt is odious, that is, where a despotic power contracts a debt not according to the needs and interests of the state. The notion of odious debt was invoked in Cuba in 1898, Costa Rica in 1922, Namibia in 1995 and Mozambique in 1999. When the notion is successfully invoked, the state debt becomes the personal debt of those responsible during the dictatorship and cannot engage the financial resources of the state. The fact that it is open to developing countries to pursue such a course must be highlighted and promoted by Governments concerned with the issue of debt burden on developing countries. This State should actively encourage such states to invoke the notion of odious debt where possible. People must understand the reason certain states will be opposed to the abolition of world debt. It is because to them, it would amount to giving up a tool of control and subjugation, giving up the method by which they carry out the economic colonisation of developing states. It is the method by which they force their liberal economic agenda on a large part of the world with disastrous consequences in terms of poverty, hunger and disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Citizens of developing countries are disempowered as economic policy is decided by the IMF and the World Bank. This is done by way of the structural adjustment programmes which are imposed on indebted countries and which have dramatically aggravated the problems facing those states. Their central aim is to impose economic policies approved by Washington upon developing countries. Unfortunately, as is usual, we do not have enough time for this important debate. Debt cancellation must be accompanied by the ending of structural adjustment programmes and the thorough reform of the international financial systems as nothing less will end this scourge which plagues so many people in so many states around the globe at this time.</p>

            <from>Mr. C. Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1541">I made no promises. I was very happy with the contributions and was particularly struck by Deputy Andrews's suggestion on the arms trade. Deputy Michael D. Higgins spoke about the shameful situation in that we live in a world where the arms trade garners and takes up so much human resources in terms of money spent while so little is spent on development aid generally throughout the world. Both Deputies expressed very fine sentiments in the debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1542">Deputy Gregory was right and I take the opportunity to reaffirm Ireland's official position that we are happy with the G8 decision but that we are in favour of 100% debt cancellation for all heavily indebted nations. Only 18 nations will benefit from the G8 summit decision and we would like the other 20 nations to benefit as well. We would like to see debt write-off for all countries in similarly distressed situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1543">Deputy Connolly made a very interesting point about aid effectiveness. As we increase the volume of overseas development aid, or official development assistance to the developing world, we must guarantee our aid is given in an efficient and timely fashion. Last March, as Minister of State representing Ireland, I was proud to promote this agenda strongly at the OECD in Paris. We are now laying down timeframes on aid effectiveness. I was one of the first in Europe to call for this particular measure and I am glad the OECD has adopted it. It has adopted a series of indicators and it will adopt more by September in a bid to be present, so to speak, at the millennium summit in New York in September. We must have a timetable for action on aid effectiveness as well because it is not only about increasing volume amounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1544">I am glad to say that while in New York in the past day or two, I met Mark Malloch Brown, the head of the UNDP and chief of staff for Kofi Annan. He again paid generous tribute to the Irish aid programme for its effectiveness and what we contributed and continue to contribute on an ongoing basis. It is another signal that we are doing something right on this issue. He also made the point, which I have made in this House previously, that my senior Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, would not have been appointed as an envoy under the UN system to look at the reforms needed in September had we not been playing our part very generously in respect of overseas aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1545">I point Deputies to the fact the Action Aid survey recently rated the Irish aid programme the best in the world in terms of the quality of the programme and the way it delivers. That reaffirms an earlier assessment by the OECD. We played a strong part in the recent European commitment to bring an extra €20 billion into play in terms of development and setting an interim target of 2010 and a final target of 2015 for the European countries. The development ministers made that absolute commitment and it was followed up at the Council of EU leaders which the Taoiseach attended. That absolute commitment was made by all 15 of the original member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">The G8 package is welcome but I point out that we need to see the details of it. Far too often in the past what seemed to be very generous G8-style debt relief measures by the Bretton Woods institutions turned out to be far from generous when the details were considered. I urge people to be somewhat cautious about this particular announcement. We must see the details which, as far as Irish official policy is concerned, must include additionality for the countries involved. There must not be debt relief, which is given with the one hand, but with less amounts in terms of volume aid flowing from those institutions, whether IDA or otherwise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1557">I wish to talk about solemn commitments, climate change and fairness. Since the foundation of this State, Ireland has had an excellent reputation in assisting developing regions of the world. In the fields of education and health care, the Irish, initially through the religious orders and in more recent times through the aid agencies, have earned an enviable reputation in assisting the less well-off of the world. That reputation is in danger of being squandered. In a time of unprecedented economic prosperity, it is shameful that reputation is being tarnished.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">It was tarnished by our Taoiseach reneging on the solemn commitment he made on 3 September 2002 when he stated that the decline in overseas development aid in the 1990s was shameful, indefensible and inconsistent with the commitments given at Rio. The Taoiseach reiterated Ireland's absolute commitment to achieving by 2007 the UN target of spending 0.7% of GNP on overseas development assistance. That is what the Taoiseach said but it will not be delivered. That has damaged Ireland's reputation in the United Nations, with developing countries and in the international diplomatic sphere. It is not good enough to renege on that commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">In terms of climate change, Ireland did well under Kyoto and was given very generous allowances. However, it will still be an uphill struggle to achieve them. We were allowed a 13% increase from 1990 until the 2008 to 2012 period. We are already double the increase we were given and it will be very difficult to achieve the original target within the period. We are close to the bottom of the league in terms of distance from targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, and the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, must switch tack but that is a good news story because it will mean improvements in the quality of life, better bus services, towns and cities designed around people rather than cars, rural bus services, better long distance rail services, a shift in energy policy to wind turbines, tidal turbines, biomass and away from sugar into ethanol. I am not convinced the Government is making that switch and that its heart is in it. There must be a significant change in that regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">It will be difficult and expensive to buy our way out of climate change but it will not be a matter of life and death. For people in developing countries, climate change is already a matter of life and death. In those countries, famine, disease and poverty, in many instances caused by climate change, are already killing people. Subsistence farmers cannot wait for the rain to come the next year and, as a result, they die. The richest countries in the world are causing climate change. We are causing it — the G8 and those countries that have wealth. From a moral perspective, it is crucial that Ireland plays its part and that we assist those countries to the best of our ability. It is not good enough to talk about what will be chopped in Ireland in order for us to fulfil our commitment. It is imperative for the Minister of State to make the commitment to increasing our development aid. Tens of thousands of children are dying every day in the developing world because he has not made that commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The European Commission has already made strong commitments on climate change. It has made a commitment of 15-30% reductions by 2020 and 50-80% reductions by 2050. It is crazy that Ministers here are continuing as if nothing will ever change. It is crucial that Ireland plays its part and it is about fairness, about contraction and convergence. It is about ensuring that people in developing countries are given the same kind of allowances we will be given. We must ratchet down emissions. If it does not happen on the Minister of State's watch, it will be much more difficult to have reductions in climate change in the future. We must make that commitment and it is not good enough to water down our motion. It is not good enough to avoid the science and to avoid the facts.</p>
            <p eId="para_1563">Climate change is a science and the Minister of State must give a commitment that he will make those changes. We must look at what increase in global temperatures is acceptable and we must deal with that. We must set a target and work backwards from that. Ireland does not even have an up to date climate change strategy. It is years out of date and we have not seen any commitment to revising that within an appropriate timescale. I want the Minister of State to make a commitment to achieve what we have put down in our motion. I do not want him to do it in a wishy-washy Fianna Fáil way, but in a scientific way with a commitment that our Taoiseach gave three years ago. I think that is fair, it is equitable and it should be delivered.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_699">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_1564">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a gabháil ar son an Chomhaontais Ghlais leis na Teachtaí Neamhspleácha agus leis na páirtithe go léir a thugann tacaíocht don rún. Listening to the strong criticism of the Government from Deputy O'Donnell, I expect the Progressive Democrats will also support the motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1565">I thank the individual NGOs, many of which are here in the Visitors Gallery, church groups and people who have influence, who are making a difference and working to make poverty history. It is welcome that the Government is prepared to come part of the way along the road to supporting our motion, but it is very disappointing that it is not prepared to support the motion in its entirety. Instead, the Government has amputated the bulk of our motion and for the sake of showing superiority of numbers, is forcing a vote on a watered down amendment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1566">This motion is a call to action. It is a call to action for justice, upon which the Green Party would act if in Government. This Government has demonstrated willingness to respond when called upon by another country. After 11 September 2001, when thousands died as a result of two planes smashing into the twin towers in New York, another plane smashing into the Pentagon and another crashing in Pennsylvania, all at the hands of hijackers, the Government unquestioningly acceded to the wishes of the US Government for an increase in refuelling and overflights of high-tech killing machines. If four airplanes crash causing less than four thousand deaths in one day, bringing about so much focus, prayers and even a toleration and complicit co-operation with an illegal and bloody invasion of Iraq, what would be the response of the Government if an equivalent of 300 jumbo jets crashed every day? The equivalent of 300 jumbo jets crashing every day is 40 million people per annum, which is the estimated total who die from hunger and hunger related diseases, as well as AIDS. Half of the passengers on these virtual airplanes are children. If the Dáil was to respond to world hunger and poverty in anything like the way it responded to the attacks on 11 September 2001, we would work on this issue every day of every week until avoidable hunger and disease was ended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1567">Our motion sets out a template for this work, including debt cancellation, trade justice, restricting the arms trade, climate change and — the Minister of State does not need reminding — the commitment to increase overseas development aid to 0.7% of GNP by 2007, as was promised. Debt cancellation requires cutting a deal with the debt holders. For the Government, this is the biggest peace process of all. I ask the Taoiseach to bring it on. As someone who claims to be a negotiator, let us see how serious he is when it comes to dealing with world poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1568">Trade justice is denied to most post-colonial poor countries. The world trading system is corrupt and unjust and free trade is compounding these problems. It is time to change the rules. For example, 25 million coffee producers face ruin as the price of coffee has fallen 50% in the past three years. Farmers are selling at heavy losses. Vietnamese farmers get only 60% of production costs. Is it any wonder desperate farmers turn to producing heroin and cocaine and exporting misery to the west? The west created that misery for those farmers in the first place by impoverishing them. In the poorest 48 countries, three products — tea, sugar and copper — constitute 75% of all trade. Between 1997 and 2001, the price index of each fell by more than 50%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">As a start, let the Government state that it will do what it must do to levy the Tobin tax on international financial transactions. Ireland has a role to stress that famine is not an option and that selling arms to the poor is not an option. That goes for Shannon Airport as much as the comfortable suggestion of taxing the arms trade, which will hardly affect Ireland. By an accident of history and the work of people like Frank Aiken, Seán McBride, Mary Robinson, John O'Shea and Bob Geldof, Bono and others, Ireland has some moral authority to set the agenda. Does the Government have the courage to say that we must live more simply so that others can simply live? This month, the Royal Society of Scientists in the UK, along with the authors of the report, Africa — Up in Smoke, warned the G8 leaders that unless deeper cuts in emissions of CO2 gases take place and unless funding goes to environmental regeneration such as re-afforestation, we will not see an end to poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">Does the Government have any residual integrity left to keep its word? The wrist bands that many of us are wearing remind the Minister of State to keep his word. The commitment to increase overseas development aid to 0.7% of GNP by 2007 is the promise that has been broken. Before travelling to New York for the UN millennium summit in September, we ask that the Minister of State and the Taoiseach bring this House back from the recess to state clearly the date for the implementation of that promise. They could at least restore some of the lost integrity and trust that has damaged this Government irreparably.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The poor have given the rich cheap tea, cheap coffee, raw materials and oil over the years. In turn, we ask the Government to support the motion in the spirit of consensus building to create international solidarity between the Irish people and the poor. It is only with leadership from countries like Ireland as a post-colonial nation that poverty will be made history. I ask Members, please, to support the motion.</p>

        <summary title="motionProposal" eId="sum_132">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_700">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1705">The debate on this Bill is important because we are dealing with issues of public safety, particularly in the transport and vehicle sector. There is an onus on every legislator and politician to ensure school buses are safe for school pupils and students. The number of Bus Éireann buses with seat belts is 1,539, while 1,493 buses are without seat belts. These figures, which are the most current and accurate figures available, relate to a survey undertaken by Bus Éireann in October 2004. Given that 1,493 buses do not have seat belts, it is evident that we have a major problem. We must face up to this matter. I appeal to the Minister to ensure these buses are brought up to date and provided with proper seat belts. We have already seen the negative impact of this and the many accidents that have occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">On a positive note, there are many examples of good practice in providing safety on buses for schoolchildren. My experience is of the services dealing with St. Michael's House, particularly on the north side of Dublin. I witness daily how children with disabilities are supervised in a very professional manner when they are collected from their homes. I commend the staff of St. Michael's House and especially the people involved in the bus company that provides this excellent service. Not only have they safe, up-to-date and modern buses for the children, there are also excellent staff on board the buses. Children are properly supervised before the bus moves off and seat belts are put on them. The staff are most progressive and thoughtful. Thousands of families appreciate that very much. We must examine seriously the issue of buses which still do not have seat belts. If it is not acceptable in a private car, it cannot be acceptable for a school bus service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">Regarding the broader issue of standards and driver testing, it is important that the preparation for testing is professionally done. We must accept that this will be a major issue in coming years as motorways become more common. Motorways are generally safe and have reduced accident levels. It is important that more care is taken on minor roads, particularly in rural areas where many tragic accidents occur. Motorists have a responsibility to be careful and fair to other road users.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">Many cyclists can be irresponsible at times. There is a duty on them to act responsibly. When driving into the Dáil, we regularly see cyclists clipping our cars, breaking lights and generally behaving badly. We should not be afraid to say this although it might not be politically correct. The reality is that many cyclists do not adhere to the rules of the road and this should be made plain to them. Motorists have major concerns in this regard. Some people consider that cyclists should undergo a test on road safety because there are many bad ones. Jumping lights, clipping cars and driving on footpaths are not safety options. Pedestrians, cyclists and motorists should be responsible. It is very important that we bear a certain amount of personal responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1709">The purpose of the Bill is to provide for the assignment of additional related functions to the driver testing and standards authority; the performance by the authority of its functions by means of outsourcing, the establishment of subsidiaries and participation in companies; the making of a "service agreement" between the Minister and the authority which will set the functions and tasks to be carried out and the performance standards to be met by the authority in the discharge of its functions; the placing of a duty on the authority to promote the development and improvement of driving standards and a duty to conduct its business at all times in a cost-effective and efficient manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">The Bill also proposes a policy direction by the Minister to the authority. I welcome the section that achieves this because it is very important. The Minister must provide leadership on this issue. I urge the Minister of State to do so in respect of public safety because leadership must come from the top.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_702">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_1712">The purpose of the Bill is also to provide for the appointment of a board of directors and a chief executive officer. I hope this will be achieved in a very professional and objective manner. The Bill will also provide for the auditing of the authority's accounts by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and the production of an annual report to the Minister by the authority. I welcome these provisions because they are very positive and secure.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">Section 13 provides that the Minister shall designate a member of the board to be chairperson for a term of office of five years. This is a fair provision. It allows the chairman time to settle into the job and, subsequently, to get on with the job. At all times, the chairperson will have a very responsible and key role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">Section 16 provides for the transfer of staff from the Department of Transport to the authority and for the appointment of staff to the authority. The section provides that the terms and conditions of employment of staff transferred from the Department of Transport shall not be less favourable than those already enjoyed by the staff and that scales of pay to which such staff were entitled shall continue to apply, unless agreed otherwise with a recognised trade union or staff association. This section also provides that the number of persons and the grades of staff of the authority shall be determined by the board with the consent of the Minister with the agreement of the Minister for Finance. This section must be considered seriously. We must have the full support of the staff and they must be committed and dedicated. I welcome the provision that the terms and conditions of employment of staff transferred from the Department of Transport shall not be less favourable than those already enjoyed by the staff of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">I also welcome the fact negotiations must be held with a recognised union or staff association as staff interests must be looked after. As a former active trade unionist, I believe this is very important because there is a decline in trade union membership, particularly in sections of the private sector. I recently had the experience of dealing with a company the staff of which were not members of a trade union and who suffered the consequent negative effects. In this regard, section 16 is relevant and a reminder to us all that we should ensure the trade union movement and recognised staff associations are given a positive role in respect of the driver testing and standards authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">Section 28 provides that the authority will make an annual report to the Minister in such form as he or she may direct not later than six months after the end of each financial year and for the annual report to be laid by the Minister before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This section is very important because it is about accountability and people facing up to their responsibilities and ensuring they will provide a professional and quality service. We have noted examples recently where standards in the public service have not been up to scratch. It is important that an annual report be made to the Minister not later than six months after the end of each financial year and that it be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. This will ensure Members will have the opportunity to debate it and make recommendations. Ultimately, Members are trying to improve road safety and driver testing standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1717">It is very important that we consider the Bill in great detail in respect of public safety, including driver safety and the safety of cyclists. As I stated, we have a responsibility to ensure that high public safety standards are set, particularly in respect of the safety of children. Drink driving is no longer an option for the vast majority of motorists. We have made progress in this regard but we must face up to the reality that there is a small minority of drivers who are not adhering to the standards. We must accept responsibility for this, as must the individuals concerned. We must ensure they are guided in the right direction, otherwise there will be major negative consequences on our roads, particularly a decline in safety standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1718">The Bill contains some very important constructive elements, which I welcome. We must have standards and a strong emphasis on public safety, including driver safety. It is particularly sad to hear about the high number of people who are injured while driving. Sometimes their accidents do not make the newspapers. One usually hears about the tragic deaths. When the issue of injuries becomes topical, it is usually dropped as a topic in newspapers within a matter of days. Every year, many people are seriously injured and disabled and suffer very badly because of accidents.</p>
          <p eId="para_1719">The elements of the Bill I have outlined are all very important. It is important that we ensure school transport services are afforded the maximum support and that funding is not an issue in their provision. We must ensure that responsible, careful and professional people are involved in the transport industry. In fairness to many of them, there are examples of good quality drivers in the State. However, we must be constantly vigilant to ensure the safety of passengers, particularly young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">We should reward good driving practice, be it that of personnel in the private sector or public sector. A reward system should apply to excellent drivers who have served for years without having been in an accident or the subject of a complaint. If somebody who has been driving for Bus Éireann for 30 years has an excellent road safety record and a commitment to the safety of children, he or she should be recognised and rewarded. Any progressive Minister would consider this proposal because it is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721">A constituent of mine feels there is a number of loopholes regarding the way mechanics and engineers examine school buses. Given that the constituent has made this allegation, the onus is on me to put on the Dáil record the fact that people are concerned that some of the buses on the road might not necessarily be of the highest standard. I urge the Minister to address this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1722">I welcome the Bill. This debate is very important because the question of public safety, including driver safety, is very important.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1723">On 15 June I stated in the Dáil that the multinational corporation General Electric was involved in a legal manoeuvre to compel the Industrial Development Authority to pay millions of euro for land belonging properly to the Irish people, and that General Electric used these proceeds to finance pressurised redundancies at a company called Diamond Innovations. I am reliably informed that the company in Clonshaugh Industrial Estate responsible for the legal scam at the expense of the taxpayer was not GE or Diamond Innovations. I made the initial statement in good faith on foot of information supplied. However, that was incorrect and the statement that GE or Diamond Innovations was involved was also incorrect. I wish to express my regret in that regard.</p>

I am Chairman of the Oireachtas Committee on Enterprise and Small Business and we have been carrying out work with regard to the insurance industry. It is of the utmost importance that this Bill passes through all Stages before the summer recess. Some 350,000 drivers are still waiting to obtain full licences.

          <p eId="para_1725">I compliment the Minister and Government on bringing this legislation before the House. Four Bills were promised to deal with insurance. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board was established and the Civil Liability and Courts Act, which dealt with fraudulence, came before the House. Those who make fraudulent claims will be punished and fined and made to pay the entire costs for any claim found to be fraudulent. This is the last of the four promised health and safety Bills and I congratulate the Taoiseach and Government on what they are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1726">There are between 60,000 and 70,000 uninsured vehicles in Ireland at this time which is unacceptable. Some 375,000 drivers are without full licences. A significant tightening up is required. I am calling for the speedy establishment of the traffic corps which we witnessed first hand in New York where it has proved very successful. The monitoring of the penalty points system has been lax since the first six months of its introduction. It was initially a great success, but people know it is not being monitored in the way they expected and are adding another five and ten miles to their speed. As a result of its traffic corps, crime in certain parts of New York fell by 30% because criminals had to get from A to B.</p>
          <p eId="para_1727">These are some of the points we have picked up and gained experienced of in the course of our insurance inquiry and I bring them to the attention of the Minister of State. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_705">
          <from>Mr. McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_1728">I compliment Deputy Cassidy on his chairmanship of the committee of which I was a member in 1997 during my first term in the Dáil. I realise the valuable work undertaken by the committee and the impact it has in encouraging new legislation that will help those seeking licenses and insurance as well as the business sector. This legislation is also to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">The issue raised by the Deputy regarding insurance is one on which the committee has worked extremely hard. I am aware of the work it does and continues to do and it is yielding results. Fleet insurance is beginning to shown signs of decreasing, in some cases by up to 20%, provided one fulfils certain employer obligations. I confess my interest in this regard. It is essential that the committee continues to highlight problems within the insurance industry, maintains pressure with regard to the need for change in legislation and ensures that insurance companies are answerable to the committee and appear to have a role in the context of their dealings with fleet and individual insurance and the way in which standards are set and maintained. I commend Deputy Cassidy on his work in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">Deputy Finian McGrath spoke about the school bus system. I express my sympathies to all concerned in the tragic accident. Much can be learned from that event and we must learn as we go along. The school bus fleet leaves much to be desired in terms of safety and the average age of vehicles. We must examine best practice in other countries and immediately apply it here. If investment is needed, which it undoubtedly is, then the State should not fall short in making the money available to the operators or those involved in ensuring the safe transport of children from home to school. Whatever is required to attain that level of safety, whether it is carers or seatbelts, should be provided and adhered to. I encourage the Minister of State to pass on the message of this debate to the relevant Minister. There is unanimity in the House in terms of what needs to be done with the school bus service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">The service also needs to be modernised and made more flexible in the context of the families who will occasionally require it. Too much bureaucracy is attached to the implementation of school bus routes in this country and there is too little application of common sense with regard to the route and standards which need to be adhered to. I join Deputy Finian McGrath in asking for action in this area sooner rather than later. Money should not stop the modernisation of the school bus fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">When discussing the legislation, we must also highlight the need for special funds for urban areas. Too many local authorities, county and borough councils and corporations must deal with the increase of planning applications, the construction of new roads and the implementation of safety measures within a very confined budget. At the same time, they must provide the necessary road signage, which is currently deplorable. It is very difficult to follow road signs, of which there is a lack in certain areas. It is unhelpful to tourists and to those who cautiously move along the roads and motorways, looking for exits and points of destination. I would encourage greater investment in general signposting and the proper mapping out of urban centres in terms of signage, as well as safety and cautionary signs. Little funding is made available to local authorities in this regard. We must recognise the shortcomings of road networking in urban centres and provide funding. People drive on these roads, subject to the signs, and this also applies to those sitting tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1733">The country has experienced considerable growth in prosperity and each household now has two or three cars. Public transport is very poor in rural Ireland in terms of connectivity with urban centres and inter-urban routes. It needs to be developed and this slow process is being embarked upon. However, it should be delivered with greater efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1734">Young people need other forms of transport and many are queuing up to take their driving test. Many rely on it to get a job and employers are often forced to supply the would-be driver with a letter stating that they have a job subject to passing the test.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735">It highlights the frustration, particularly of young people seeking employment, and of many others who are relying on a system which is creaking under pressure to deliver tests.</p>
          <p eId="para_1736">The legislation is timely. I hope it has an efficient passage through this House and that the parts of the Bill aimed at delivering driving tests to those that are waiting on the list — Deputy Cassidy gave a figure of 370,000 — will result in such people getting their tests earlier, from people who are qualified and who understand what is required on our roads and motorways. The waiting times in some areas, particularly in Carlow-Kilkenny, are simply unacceptable. The fact that in some cases and on some days people have to travel from Dublin to Kilkenny to carry out those tests is also an indication of how the system is creaking and in need of reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1737">Having looked at the waiting lists that exist and the number of accidents occurring on our roads, there is a need for testers to be fully qualified and up-to-speed with changes in terms of European standards and what is required on Irish roads. There is also a need for concentration relating to the instruction being undertaken by those waiting on the lists. I know many young people who are anxious to have some off-road learning, to have a site, perhaps a private one, available to them where they could begin their driving instruction at a cost effective and affordable price. Their future employment prospects rely on the cost being affordable. Otherwise, we will find more and more people taking a chance, going out on the roads uninsured and without a licence. There are far too many uninsured people and some have no licence either. We need to understand why they are there, rather than simply going after them and catching them, ensure they are brought back within the system, are encouraged by an affordable testing system to take instruction and a test and qualify and obtain the appropriate insurance. Unfortunately, as the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, chaired by Deputy Cassidy, has highlighted time and again, the type of insurance required is simply out of reach of many people, particularly the young.</p>
          <p eId="para_1738">In the context of the provisions of this Bill, I am glad that under section 9 it will be open to the authority to engage in the publication and production of materials relating to the promotion of better driving standards. I am told by those that provide driving instruction that they have to go to the United Kingdom to get the most up-to-date information on signage and instruction for those taking a test or driving on public roads. The Irish equivalent of such information is simply non-existent or else is so out of date that it is not relevant. A number of Irish driving instructors have been purchasing material from the authorities in the United Kingdom and adapting it to Irish needs and the standards that are set here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">Likewise, under section 12, I am glad the numbers appointed to the board of the authority will be not less than six and not more than 11. Those appointed to the board should have a relevance to the authority and should have certain qualifications to assist them in serving on the board. That is very relevant in the context of road safety, quality of instructors and so on. Perhaps the bodies that represent driving instructors or the consumer should be represented on the board of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">I have argued on many pieces of legislation about accountability to this House. I am pleased that under section 27 there is an obligation on the board that is appointed to account to the Comptroller and Auditor General. Far too often in legislation passed in this House we have ignored the responsibility we have, as legislators to take the financial accounts of the bodies that we appoint, to peruse them, comment on and analyse them and to make recommendations. As vice-chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am glad to say we are taking a far more rigorous view of bodies and are ensuring straight talking regarding those bodies, or quangos, that are accountable to the House. On a regular basis we invite such entities to appear before us and ensure they answer the appropriate questions, including those put to members of the committee by the general public. This is a good example of legislation that includes provisions which recognise the need for greater accountability in the context of how we do our business as legislators.</p>
          <p eId="para_1741">There is a need to look at the heavy goods vehicles and how they are licensed. I am glad the Minister for Transport in his recent communications — he has many of them relating to Members of the House — has outlined the agreement he has made with the Irish Road Haulage Association. I know he has had many meetings with that organisation, that various issues of relevance were discussed and agreements were reached. I see the association having a major role to play with regard to safety on our roads. I know sites are being looked at in the context of providing instruction and testing for heavy goods vehicles and I hope that Kilkenny will be a real player in that regard. There is a need to ensure counties outside those with the main cities have a role to play in the context of instruction and testing for heavy goods vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">We have seen many reports, on "Prime Time" and elsewhere, on the road haulage area. I came from that industry and was a driver of a heavy goods vehicle in my earlier life. Drivers of such vehicles can contribute both positively and negatively but with a small amount of work with their representative body, they could have an enormously positive contribution to make. I urge the Minister to continue his work with that body to ensure we have a greater degree of safety relative to the type of vehicles that are on the road and the type of testing that is conducted. The ongoing participation of the representative body, either with the new authority or directly with the Minister, is absolutely essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">The National Car Test has concerned me for quite some time, particularly the length of time it takes to organise a test, as is also the case with the tests for heavy goods vehicles. We should get to a point with this legislation and the conduct of our business with both the private motorists and haulage companies where we are able to deliver a test almost immediately with no waiting time. It was brought to my attention recently that taxis often have to wait an unreasonable length of time to have even a new vehicle tested. That is very unfair and should be dealt with immediately. The cost for the yearly test for a taxi is unacceptably high. Taxi drivers are delivering a service and trying to make ends meet but the regulation and the bureaucracy that surrounds the system has grown to a point where it is inefficient and not cost effective. It needs to be adjusted to take account of the demands of the marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">If we are making changes in this area, we should begin by showing the Irish Road Haulage Association and the taxi drivers' representative bodies that we are serious about our business, understand their difficulties and are able to adjust the system to create one that is more efficient, cost effective and will address their problems. That is a challenge for the Minister and if he rises to it and works at it he will achieve a lot for all of those involved in the industry, resulting in a greater awareness of safety and of the positive contribution road hauliers and taxi drivers can make in the context of making our roads safe and the industry more efficient.</p>

        <speech by="#IvorCallely" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Transport" eId="spk_706">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_1745">I thank Deputies for their positive contributions to the debate. I acknowledge the general welcome afforded to the Bill by Members of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1746">In the course of the debate, Deputies raised issues, some of which directly relate to the Bill and others to road safety in general. The purpose of the Bill is to establish the Driver Testing and Standards Authority whose primary responsibility will be the delivery of the driver testing service. However, I can confirm to the House that consultants engaged by my Department have recommended that the DTSA be given a broader remit to make it a more viable organisation and enable it to better contribute to issues of road safety. I agree with a number of speakers who suggested considering options for a wider road safety remit for the DTSA. This may present an enhanced prospect for integrating and improving road safety functions. I have had numerous meetings with the insurance industry and am confident it would welcome the prospect of integrating and improving road safety functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">I am advised that the establishment of a separate public sector body to deliver the driving testing service and take responsibility for other functions more appropriate to an executive agency than to a Department is also an opportunity for the assignment of other functions relating to general road safety to the authority. It is proposed that the Bill be amended to include enabling provisions which will allow for the transfer to the authority of additional functions with a bearing on road safety. The functions include the promotion of road safety awareness. The Bill already provides that the authority will have a general duty to promote the development and improvement of driving standards. In this context it is appropriate that road safety education and promotion be transferred to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748">The feasibility of transferring the Department's responsibility for functions relating to vehicle standards, much of which derives from EU legislation, is also being considered. It is suggested that some of the detail and technical aspects of this work might be appropriate to transfer to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">It may also be appropriate that aspects of road safety research be transferred to the authority which will effectively have a significant input into road safety through driver training and testing and vehicle testing. Areas relating to road haulage may be appropriate to the authority, as referred to by a previous speaker, my good friend and colleague, Deputy McGuinness. Given the likely remit of the authority, we should consider a change of name for the authority and this was referred to by a number of speakers in the debate tonight, including another good friend of mine on the Opposition benches, Deputy Stanton.</p>
          <p eId="para_1750">Many Deputies observed that the Bill does not make specific provisions as to the manner in which the authority will carry out its functions. The Bill defines the functions of the authority and provides for an organisational structure within which the authority will operate. It sets out the responsibilities of the chief executive officer who will report to the board and provide that the authority will be empowered to engage in certain commercial activities and to borrow money. Crucially it requires the authority to carry out its functions to certain standards as determined by the Minister of the day. It will be a matter for the chief executive officer and the board to determine how best to carry out the functions assigned to the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1751">Deputy Ryan made a specific reference to the creation of a board to oversee the work of the authority. Section 12 of the Bill sets out specific criteria for the selection of membership of the board, as referred to by Deputy McGuinness. Given the range of functions to be discharged by the authority, the board will have a significant responsibility for giving direction and support to the CEO and staff of the authority. I congratulate Mr. Noel Brett who has been appointed as chief executive officer of the authority and wish him well in his role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1752">Deputies called for reform of the driver licensing system and the registration of driving instructors. The strategy for road safety 2004-2006 states that driver licensing regulations will be amended to discourage long-term reliance on provisional licences. A range of measures to achieve this goal is under consideration in my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1753">The issue of the accountability of the new authority to the Oireachtas was also raised. The chief executive officer will be responsible for the propriety of the authority's accounts and the economic and efficient use of its resources and will be accountable to any committee of the Houses of the Oireachtas set up to examine its affairs. The Bill provides that the chief executive officer shall have regard to any recommendations of such committee relevant to the authority's functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1754">Many of the contributions from Deputies focused on the driving test and the means by which it could be improved. I concur with those seeking enhancement and improvement of the test. The test follows an EU standard and it is similar to the test in the North and in the United Kingdom. It is interesting to note that testing on motorways or night-time testing is not a feature of the test in these islands. Despite this, the UK has a relatively good road safety record when compared with other EU countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1755">The purpose of the test is to assess whether a person has reached a certain standard of driving competence. Deputy Stanton stated that passing the test does not mean a person is an excellent driver and ready to take on any situation and this point struck a chord with me. The process of developing further driving skills and experience is ongoing over years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1756">The issue of variations in the pass rate at different test centres was raised. This is a fact of life and is also the case in other countries. Various reasons have been advanced, such as demographic factors and standards of instruction. The Bill gives the authority the responsibility for the regulation of driving instruction. This will require those in the industry to meet predetermined standards which will cover not only their own ability to drive but will also ensure that those meeting the standard will have the necessary instructional skills to deliver the message to the novice driver. The registration process will benefit driving instructors. Persons taking lessons will have greater confidence in the quality of instruction given and this will lead to better and safer drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757">Deputy Shortall and others raised a specific issue concerning the treatment of existing driving instructors. All instructors must demonstrate that they have reached the required standard in the interests of ensuring an appropriate standard of instruction applies throughout the country. During the period of transition when all new instructors will be required to undergo appropriate tests, existing instructors who can show they are bona fide instructors will be allowed to continue instructing before undergoing the appropriate competency tests. The length of the transition period and the manner in which the competency of existing instructors is assessed during that period will be considered in the context of the drafting of regulations to require instructors to be registered to give instruction for reward and the establishment of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758">Deputy Olivia Mitchell referred to motorcycle accidents and I agree with her that this is an area of concern. Motorcycle riders are especially vulnerable on the roads. The road safety strategy 2004-2006 proposes an implementation of a programme of compulsory initial practical training for motorcyclists. Work is ongoing with financial support being given to the Irish Rider Training Association to facilitate the development of a network of motorcycle instructors which is an essential prerequisite for any programme of compulsory training.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">I do not believe there is a need for compulsory training as the instructors are available. I hope more motorcyclists will avail of the existing programmes. As a motorcyclist myself I was recently approached by a noted well-known media personality who, like me, is back motorbiking following a period of years off the bike. He brought to my attention the motorbike course run by Fingal County Council on which I congratulate the council. The Garda Síochána also organises an excellent training course and commercial instructors are also available. Motorcyclists should be encouraged to avail of these courses. A working group has also been established to examine the standards that must apply to such training and how such training might be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1760">Deputies referred to long waiting times for driving tests. I accept the point that there should be little or no waiting period for a motorist who is ready to take the test to be called for it. That is the service I would like to see in place. My officials in consultation with the Department of Finance agreed a package of measures to reduce the numbers on waiting lists by up to 80,000 by the end of next year. Engagement with unions about the implementation of these measures has commenced. The measures include an additional productivity incentive in the form of a bonus scheme for testers, the details of which have to be finalised in consultation with the staff, the recruitment of additional driver testers as well as outsourcing a block of tests to an outside body. An outsourcing option is necessary to make significant inroads into the backlog of tests within a reasonable timeframe. The outsourcing arrangements will include provisions to ensure that a consistent and high standard of test is delivered. There is no question of allowing standards to slip.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">I wish to clarify the number of driving testers employed. There are 117 testers, six of whom were formerly retired. The number is one fewer than at this time last year and compares to 66 testers in 1998. In addition to the testing corps, there is a chief tester and ten supervisory testers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1762">I was asked about the gender balance among driving testers. Eight of the 117 testers are female. I encourage females to apply for the position of driving tester and there is no barrier to prevent females from joining the driving tester service. When these figures become known, we might be able to encourage more females to join this service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1763">Deputy Ring asked whether staff from my Department joining the DTSA would retain their Civil Service status. The proposal is to transfer members of staff to the authority with a guarantee that their existing terms and conditions will be protected. I am concerned that the retention of Civil Service status and the consequent alignment of the grading structure in the new authority with Civil Service structures might prove to be overly restrictive on the authority in carrying out its functions, which may require a more flexible staffing structure to apply. Nonetheless, I recognise that staff have genuine concerns that I am prepared to consider with a view to alleviating them in the most effective way possible without compromising the ability of the DTSA to deliver a quality service. I intend the process of setting up the DTSA to be open and transparent and to go forward in the spirit of partnership with all the staff associations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1764">I do not accept Deputy Ring's characterisation of the legislation and the setting up of the DTSA as a money making racket. Safety on our roads is an extremely important issue and this Bill is a serious attempt to tackle it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1765">During the debate many Deputies referred to the accident rate among young people. There is no doubt that young people, particularly young males, are over-represented in accident statistics. There are the consequences that young people can under-estimate danger while driving and over-estimate their driving ability and skills. Novice drivers do not have the same level of automatic driving skills as experienced drivers and such skills take time to develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_1766">A national analysis of young driver accidents in 2000 carried out by the National Roads Authority highlights the scope of the problem. In 2000, the fatality rate was much higher for those aged 18 to 24 than for any other age cohort. The death rate in the age group 18 to 24 years was more than ten times higher for males than for females. This is also reflected in the difficulties facing young people in obtaining motor insurance at a reasonable premium. The most frequent occurring error for young drivers involved in two-vehicle collisions is exceeding the safe speed limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767">There is a perception that provisional licence drivers are more involved in accidents but there is no substantial evidence to support this view. Of the 232,820 drivers who incurred penalty points as of 30 April 2005, only 6% were provisional licence holders. The formation of good attitudes to driving is of particular importance. Accordingly, young people are the target of much effort to promote road safety in Ireland and in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1768">Deputy Stanton mentioned that two of his children are coming into the league of young motorists and I am in the same class as the Deputy in that respect. I note the responsible attitude to driving not only among my children but among their friends. I have the height of admiration for young motorists today. They seem to be far more responsible than the previous generation in many aspects related to motoring, in terms of——</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_1770">——in terms of speed, the consumption of alcohol and everything else that goes to ensure road safety and good driving. I take this opportunity to congratulate our young people on their responsible attitude in the manner in which they go about their driving. I hope the insurance companies will acknowledge that and accommodate them by offering them more appropriate renewal premiums. In response to such a request the insurance companies will point out that they must examine the statistics and that when there is an improvement in that respect they might be able to accommodate that request. I hope that working together we will be able to continue to make the types of developments we have witnessed such as the one to which I referred regarding the responsible attitude of young motorists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">The National Safety Council has developed a number of educational programmes for pupils of primary and secondary schools. The Garda Síochána has a great programme in place involving a limited number of personnel. The Garda Commissioner might consider increasing the number of gardaí involved in that safety programme. There are great programmes available to schools. The National Safety Council focuses on younger road users. A strategy of its safety awareness campaign is that it is very much directed at the young driver.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">A number of Deputies referred to a captive audience among secondary school pupils in transition year in terms of participating in such programmes. I support the view that this opportunity should be explored in greater detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">A noted driver with a successful track record in motoring, particularly in rallying driving, and a good friend of mine, Rosemary Smith, has been promoting a programme for some time that would be of enormous benefit if targeted at transition year students. A difficulty in introducing such a programme, as pointed out by a number of Deputies, would be the manner in which it could be rolled out nationally. While we can examine that, there are other steps we could take to explore opportunities, particularly in co-operation with the National Safety Council, the Garda Síochána and the Department of Education and Science, in regard to the curriculum and opportunity presented in transition year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">Deputy Stanton referred to the opportunity presented in this area during transition year and he referred to substance abuse. He referred to two other points to which I wish to refer, one being the impact of tiredness on motorists. I clearly signal that tiredness can kill, a point to which Deputy Stanton alluded. I encourage local authorities to place a warning sign to this effect — as I have witnessed in some counties but more particularly overseas — in their catchment areas. Records show that tiredness can kill. Deputy Stanton also referred to pedestrians and cyclists. I encourage local authorities to favourably examine pedestrian and cycling strategies as these are important factors if we are to encourage people to walk and to cycle, a point to which the Deputy alluded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1775">Deputy Cassidy raised the issue of the cost of motor insurance. I am pleased to inform the House that I have had one to one meetings with the chief executive of each insurance company operating in Ireland and I have also had a round table meeting on this issue. I am progressing in such interaction with the insurance companies to address a number of issues to which Deputy Cassidy referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">Deputy McGuinness referred to the Garda traffic corps, school bus transport and signage. Good progress has been made in regard to the Garda traffic corps. I do not know the exact number of personnel who were in the Garda traffic corps but it was approximately 300 and we are increasing that number to just shy of 500. We have a target to increase the number of personnel to 1,200. We have put a management structure in place in this regard including an Assistant Commissioner, an inspector and so on. We have also begun to improve the supports that are available by way of vehicles as well as through information technology and so forth. The establishment of the traffic corps is under way and it is to be hoped we will see the benefits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">School bus transport has always been a matter of major concern. I again sympathise with those involved in the Kentstown tragedy. That has put a particular focus on school bus transport. I am pleased to inform the House that my Department, along with the Department of Education and Science and others, is determined to be as proactive as possible to ensure that the best international standards prevail in school bus transport. I must be cautious as we are awaiting the reports of the investigation arising out of the Kentstown incident and I hope these will be available as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">I refer to two other issues raised by Deputy McGuinness. One is signage. I support the view that directional and safety signage are important and can be of great additional benefit. We are talking about very small money in this regard, so it is not a financial issue.</p>

        <speech by="#JimmyDevinsFF" eId="spk_722">
          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_1795">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for allowing me the time to speak on this important legislation, namely, the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004. This legislation comes to the House from the Seanad where it was passed recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1796">There has been much discussion both within the House and outside on health matters. The provision for the health service costs approximately €11 billion in the current year and I strongly believe that the service patients receive must be of the highest order. For that to happen it is essential that the staff delivering the service are well-trained in the first instance and, in the second, they are subject to a continuous statutory process of regulation during their professional lives. Members of the public must have faith in the professionals who treat them. They must be assured that they are suitably trained and fit to practice to the highest standards. If this does not occur, the public might have some doubts about the persons treating them being suitably qualified. That is the purpose of regulation — to ensure that members of the public know they are receiving a service from people who are competent and properly qualified to deliver it. That is why this Bill is important and timely.</p>
          <p eId="para_1797">At present only a handful of health care staff are subject to statutory regulation. These include nurses, dentists, doctors, opticians and pharmacists. However, many other professionals supply valuable services in health. This Bill aims to regulate 12 different health care professions: chiropodists, chemical biochemists, dieticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, orthoptists, physiotherapists, psychologists, radiographers, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. All these groups provide a vital and valuable role in the provision of health care. I strongly believe that the system of regulation, which must be done on a statutory basis, will ensure that members of the public will have people supplying their care that are competent and fit to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1798">I have no doubt that the 12 professions I have mentioned which are the subject of this Bill, provide excellent services and that their members are properly trained to do so. However, once the Bill becomes law, the protection afforded to the public will be greatly enhanced. In practice each profession will be regulated by a registration board comprising 13 members, six of which will be members of the respective profession, while the other seven — a majority — are from outside the profession and nominated by the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1799">It is important that the seven nominated people include a member or members of the public so that the views of the users of the particular health service are represented. Only in this way may transparency be achieved. Once transparency and openness is present, trust will be delivered. For too long within health care and outside it, professions have operated within their own narrow structures of governance. By bringing in outside viewpoints, a greater degree of understanding of how a profession operates is achieved. The end result is of benefit both to the patient and the particular profession in question. This has already happened in medicine and I have no doubt that the Medical Council is now a much stronger and more effective body as a result of the contributions of its non-medical members. The views of the consumers of each service will be heard and acted upon, thereby ensuring that the profession as a whole is strengthened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1800">I also welcome the establishment of the overall health and social care professionals council, which will have 25 members, one each from the 12 disciplines I have mentioned, with the remaining 13 coming from outside. This council will ensure consistency and uniformity of practice among the 12 registration boards under its control. When a complaint is received by the council, I hope it will be dealt with in a logical manner. It will be reviewed first by a preliminary procedure committee which will decide if the complaint is sufficiently serious to warrant further action. In this way, frivolous complaints can be dealt with expeditiously, while genuine complaints will be more thoroughly investigated. In the interests of fairness and transparency, genuine complaints should be dealt with quickly and without delay. Having a complainant wait for years to have his or her case heard is wrong and would act as a deterrent to openness and transparency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1801">I also welcome the fact that most complaints will be heard in public. If it is believed that the case has been caused by a practitioner's ill health, either physical or emotional, it will be heard in private by a specific health committee. The list of sanctions which may be imposed on a practitioner if he or she is found guilty of misconduct is comprehensive and ranges from censure to erasure of the practitioner's name from the relevant register. By having such a wide ranging complaints procedure, members of the public can have confidence that the highest standards of behaviour from their respective practitioners are maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">I refer to Part 7, encompassing sections 78 to 80, inclusive, which deal with the protection of titles. It is important that there is no confusion among members of the public regarding the use of a title to describe a particular profession. Before I was elected to the House, I worked as a general practitioner and had contact in my work with members of all the professions I mentioned and which are the subject of the Bill. At all times, I was very impressed by the high standard of the professional work I encountered. All the professions, in their own respective ways, play a vital role in the workings and delivery of the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1803">However, a degree of confusion surrounds one profession, namely, with regard to the titles of physiotherapy and physical therapy. All over the world these titles are interchangeable, especially in the United Kingdom, Northern Ireland and the United States. I understand the professional qualifications and requirements are the same for both titles in 92 countries. Indeed, the world representative body is known as the World Confederation of Physical Therapists and has consultant status with the United Nations and an official relationship with the World Health Organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1804">Physiotherapy in Ireland is a four year degree course awarded by four universities, namely, Trinity College Dublin, University College Dublin, the College of Surgeons and the University of Limerick. Courses have been in existence for more than 100 years and the first school of physiotherapy was founded in 1905, exactly 100 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1805">If physiotherapists all over the world are known as physical therapists, surely the same should apply here. Consumers, that is patients, should have a clear understanding of the qualifications and training of each professional they attend. The same position should apply in Ireland as applies all over the world. Perhaps this issue will be addressed when the Bill is referred to committee but there must be no confusion and no chance of confusion in the minds of members of the general public as to the qualifications of the profession they attend.</p>
          <p eId="para_1806">I wish to refer to a comment made by a previous speaker in regard to the workings of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, of which Deputy Neville is a prominent member. The speaker referred to the committee's recent prolonged deliberations on the Travers report. From the start of the joint committee's hearings on the report, it was obvious that certain members were determined to ensure there would be a political killing.</p>

        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1811">In response to Deputy Devins, it was very disappointing that the views of the Opposition were not accommodated in the report of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, as they have been in many committee reports on issues about which opinion has been diverse. In fairness to the former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, diverse opinions were accommodated under his chairmanship. Another committee of which I was a member, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, also accommodated highly diverse opinions on the issue of property rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1812">I welcome this opportunity to contribute to the Health and Social Care Professionals Bill 2004, which provides for the establishment of a system of statutory registration for certain health and social care professionals. In the brief time left to me, I ask the Minister of State to assist me with regard to information I sought from his senior Minister by means of parliamentary questions. The information requested is usually provided within four days of tabling a parliamentary question. On 10 May, I asked the Minister to provide data on the budget for suicide research and prevention in 2005. I have tabled a similar question each year for many years and usually receive a reply within four days.</p>
          <p eId="para_1813">It is important to have this information as it enables me to participate in debate on suicide prevention and research. On tabling the question on 10 May, the Minister, instead of issuing a response, referred it to the newly established Health Service Executive. Seven weeks later, I still await the information requested. It is frustrating that I was provided the information in previous years within four days, which allowed me to participate in debate on the issue of suicide and exchange views with Ministers on the matter. As the recess approaches, I do not have the facility to elicit the information as the Minister would refer any further parliamentary questions to the Health Service Executive again. Will the Minister of State please——</p>

          <from>Mr. Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_1815">I appreciate the Minister of State's undertaking. I ask him to consider another issue about which there is no point submitting a parliamentary question because it, too, would be referred to the Health Service Executive. In May each year the Fine Gael Party tables a parliamentary question to the Minister for Health and Children requesting statistics on deaths by suicide and various subcategories such as gender and age group for the previous two years. On submitting a similar question last week, I was informed the information was not available. I do not understand the reason statistics on the various categories of death by suicide are not available from the Central Statistics Office given that it was available in May of previous years. I appreciate a different Department may be responsible but, again, the absence of these statistics stymie debate on the issue of suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1816">I welcome an opportunity to discuss the Bill and appreciate the tolerance of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in allowing me to ask the Minister of State for assistance in the matters I have outlined. Sometimes the reason doctors refuse to make a complaint against a colleague is not to cover up issues but because genuine protection is not afforded to doctors who are concerned about certain practices and wish to make a complaint. The Dr. Michael Neary case is a good example of how colleagues and other professionals may become concerned about the consequences of making a complaint.</p>

          <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_730">
            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_1817">I welcome the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the first report of the Ombudsman for Children, which was published yesterday. As someone who campaigned with former Deputy Austin Currie for an Ombudsman for Children, the publication of her first report is an important event and I congratulate Emily Logan and her staff on their work in establishing the office. The first year was difficult because there was no office or support but Ms Logan has now established a presence in this area. In future we will look forward to reports that will have a significant impact on children's rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">We must look at the limitations and exclusions in her role that she has raised, particularly the limitations that apply to children in certain places of detention, the Garda Síochána, the administration of asylum, immigration, naturalisation and citizenship law, provision for the exercise of ministerial veto on investigation and the Defence Forces. Central to the office's concern is that these limitations will remove from its investigatory remit some of the most vulnerable children and young people in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">The Ombudsman for Children Act provides that the Ombudsman for Children should promote the rights and welfare of children. The ombudsman considers it an obligation to promote the rights of all children equally. To exclude any group or class of children from the reach of the Ombudsman for Children's investigatory powers by virtue of immigration status or detention in place not covered by the Act is to go against the primary objective of the Ombudsman for Children Act — the establishment of an ombudsman to promote the rights and welfare of children.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The exclusion of certain groups of children from the investigatory remit goes against the letter and spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, which states that children's rights institutions should proactively reach out to all groups of children, in particular the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, such as children in care or detention, refugee or migrant children and other groups. Institutions should have the right of access in conditions of privacy to children in all forms of alternative care or other places.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">In its present form, the Ombudsman for Children falls short of the level of protection offered to children in other countries. This is demonstrated by comparison with the situation in Northern Ireland and in Scotland. The Commission for Children and Young People in Northern Ireland contains no specific exclusions on asylum, immigration, naturalisation or citizenship nor on the administration of prisons or other places of detention or of the custody of children. In Scotland the Commission for Children and Young People provides that the commissioner may investigate any service provider for young people or children in regard to the extent the service provider has regard to the rights, interests and views of children and young people in making decisions that affect them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">Under the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments are committed to providing parity of protection to the rights of all people on the island. The State has fallen short of the level of protection offered to children in Northern Ireland. The Office of the Ombudsman for Children will seek to resolve this situation and will ask the Minister to look at amendments to the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. I put the need to amend the Act to the Minister to deal with the Ombudsman for Children's concerns.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_1823">I will take the adjournment on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to this House an update on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1824">The Ombudsman for Children recently issued her first annual report. The Ombudsman for Children was appointed in December 2003 and the office was formally established in April 2004 with a staffing complement of nine. The report covers the period from April 2004 to April 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1825">The role of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children is twofold: to promote the rights and welfare of children and to investigate complaints.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">On the investigation of complaints, the office has a wide remit that includes public bodies, schools and voluntary hospitals. This remit exceeds that of the Office of the Ombudsman, which has sought a similar wide-ranging remit for several years. During the period under review, 177 complaints were received which, for an office in its infancy, must be seen as substantial. The majority of complaints — 51% — related to education, 16% related to health and just over one quarter concerned child protection, social welfare entitlements, civil proceedings, asylum and immigration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">Actions excluded from the remit of the Ombudsman for Children are broadly similar to those of the Office of the Ombudsman. In the annual report the Ombudsman for Children addresses a number of areas in which her powers of investigation are limited. These include children in certain places of detention, the Garda Síochána, administration of the law relating to naturalisation, immigration, citizenship and asylum, the Defence Forces and provision for a ministerial veto in investigations. These limitations are in place as a result of independent bodies having investigation powers, such as the visiting committees for prisons and places of detention and the plans for a Defence Forces ombudsman.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">The ministerial veto also exists in the Act establishing the Office of the Ombudsman and has never been used. The provision is in place to protect both the Minister and the Ombudsman for Children. It ensures that the Minister is accountable to the Oireachtas by avoiding any interference in the role of the Minister. It also protects the Ombudsman for Children as such a request must be in writing and it would be expected that the Ombudsman for Children would include this in any report to the Oireachtas, thus ensuring transparency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1829">As can be seen from the report, the establishment of the Office of the Ombudsman for Children has been very successful. The Ombudsman for Children adds a central plank to promoting children's rights and welfare, along with investigating complaints relating to issues affecting children. It is a major step forward in implementing the national children's strategy, particularly the first goal, which is concerned with giving children a voice.</p>
            <p eId="para_1830">I am pleased to report that the National Children's Office has made excellent progress in ensuring the development of structures to give children a voice and recently published national guidelines with the NGO sector on participation by children and young people.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_732">
            <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
            <p eId="para_1831">I wish to raise the need for protection under the social welfare scheme of workers, particularly migrant workers, such as those affected by the abandonment of a public contract for the refurbishment of Eyre Square in Galway for Galway City Council and earlier the workers who are at risk following the collapse of a firm in Portumna; the increasing vulnerability of migrant workers affected by sudden closures in the construction industry, often on public contracts, without notice; breaches of statutory regulations and general absence of protection; the need for a hardship fund to address their immediate needs and such statutory changes as will meet their basic rights. In the service industry foreign workers are being exploited, particularly in terms of accommodation. They are charged for anything they consume on the employers' premises, even for glasses of water. Will the Minister of State inform the House what is the situation with regard to the number of hours foreign workers work each week? Who is on the inspectorate? How many reports has it carried out and have any of them been published?</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">Migrant workers are among the most vulnerable in society. Events this week bear this out. The group of workers laid off as a result of the actions undertaken by Kingston Construction Limited are now in a most invidious position. These workers were employed by a company engaged by Galway City Council. It has now moved to secure the site, it having been abandoned by the company. However, it is beyond comprehension that public money could be spent in this fashion. The city council engaged a company that did not comply with a registered agreement as it relates to pension rights as well as rates of pay. It is incumbent on State bodies to ensure that tenders for work which are accepted are compliant with the relevant registered agreement. A proper system of checks and balances must be implemented to ensure workers are protected. In the event of the kind of incidents that occurred in Galway city and county recently, it is worth noting that many workers, particularly migrant workers such as those affected by the abandonment of a public contract, are increasingly vulnerable. Such workers affected by sudden closures without notice in the construction industry are suffering breaches of statutory regulations and a general absence of protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">When what happened in Galway arises, what immediate provisions are there for such workers, especially non-Irish workers, made redundant in this manner? What recourse do these people have? What arrangements are in place for those workers from within the EU, those from outside the EU and those from the new member states of the EU but who are in a minority in their state and do not enjoy full citizenship rights? There have been reports of people from some Baltic states not receiving the full benefits and protection of EU membership. Beyond these questions, there is a clear and urgent need for a hardship fund to address the immediate needs of workers, such as those in Galway who lost their jobs. There is now a pressing requirement for statutory changes that will meet their basic rights. Where accommodation has been booked and organised by the putative employers, in the event of the contract being broken, as in this case, in what position do such employees find themselves? Is it possible for them to apply for rent allowance?</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">The Government must act to protect the least powerful in society. Migrant workers are some of those with the least clout in Ireland. This has been seen as a result of Kingston Construction Limited's action and the previous company to which I referred. I call on the Minister of State to answer the questions I have raised and to indicate such actions he proposes to take in this regard.</p>

            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_1835">I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the day when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, published the Employment Permits Bill 2005. The Bill contains a variety of provisions designed to deal with concerns expressed about the protections available to immigrant workers from outside the European Union employed in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1836">Protections set out for workers under the provisions of all employment rights legislation are equally applicable to all workers, whether a person be Irish or a foreign national. For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book applies to workers posted to work in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1837">The employment rights information unit in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is active in supplying information on employment rights to employees. Last year, 150,000 inquiries were dealt with by this unit. Officials have given several talks on employment rights to a range of migrant worker groups. Information on employment rights is available in leaflet form from the Department and is also available on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_1838">In matters of investigation and enforcement the labour inspectorate of the Department makes no distinction between Irish and migrant workers whether they are from inside or outside the European Union as regards the provision of information and enforcement activity. With regard to the labour inspectorate, it is appropriate that since January of this year steps have been taken which mean the complement of Inspectors will have almost doubled from 17 officers to 31 once current recruitment activities are completed. I expect this to happen soon.</p>
            <p eId="para_1839">Apart from the increases in resources there is further significant activity on the employment rights front. Arising out of Sustaining Progress, work is under way to address issues identified in the report of the review group on the employment rights bodies and in the discussion document which focused on the mandate and resourcing of the labour inspectorate. A restatement or consolidation of employment rights legislation forms part of this agenda. This work will lead to the establishment of better streamlined procedures for complaint resolution for employees together with more effective investigation and enforcement to deal with the detection and, where appropriate, the prosecution of breaches found. All workers, including migrant workers, will benefit from these improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1840">These are the positive initiatives that are under way to improve the legislative environment in the context of employment rights and to address breaches of statutory regulations. While I understand this is not the situation in the case in question, there is provision for the protection of workers' entitlements where their employer has gone into liquidation or receivership. The insolvency payments scheme, which is administered by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, enables employees to claim, either through the liquidator or receiver, arrears of pay, holiday pay, pay <i>in lieu</i> of statutory notice and various other pay related entitlements that may be owed to them by their employer. The scheme operates under the Protection of Employees (Employers’ Insolvency) Act 1984, and payments are made from the social insurance fund. Where a payment has been made to an employee under the scheme, the Minister for Enterprise and Employment becomes a creditor against the employer in place of the employee.</p>

            <p eId="para_1845">In the case of a non-EEA national who becomes unemployed but who has been granted permission to remain in the State until a particular date by a Garda registration officer on foot of a work permit, he or she is considered to be legally resident in the State up to the expiry date on the visa, even if he or she has lost his or her employment prior to that date. Subject to satisfying all the statutory conditions for entitlement to payment, a non-EEA national who is legally resident in the State under these circumstances may receive payment of unemployment benefit or assistance up to but not beyond the expiry date on the visa. The supplementary welfare allowance scheme is the safety net within the overall social welfare system in that, subject to qualifying conditions, it provides assistance to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs and those of their dependants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1846">The Employment Permits Bill clearly sets out in legislation the procedures relating to the application, grant and refusal of work permits. It allows for the introduction of a green card type system for highly skilled migrant workers, and for the means to establish the number of employment permits in total and by sector and to identify the skills and employment categories in respect of which employment permits may be granted. It will grant the work permit to the employee rather than the employer. However, for reasons of traceability and the enforcement of employees' rights, the practice of the employer applying for the permit will continue. The employment permit will contain a statement of the rights and entitlements of the migrant worker, including that the employee may change employment through the application for another work permit by a new employer. This will provide migrant workers with greater freedom and flexibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_1847">The Bill prohibits employers from deducting recruitment expenses from remuneration and from retaining workers' personal documents. It introduces significant penalties for breaches of the legislation, comprising fines to a maximum of €50,000 or terms of imprisonment not exceeding five years. These provisions give additional protections to migrant workers beyond those already in existing employment rights legislation.</p>

          <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_739">
            <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
            <p eId="para_1848">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt dom an cheist thábhachtach seo a ardú anocht. Over the last month I have received deputations from representatives of ten small and medium-sized indigenous companies operating in the construction sector. They alerted me to a particular scam that is widespread and straightforward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1849">A construction company, in this case Glenman Corporation of County Galway, won a Government contract to build council housing in Fortunestown, south County Dublin and in Ballymun, Dublin city. It hired sub-contractors to do most of its work. When the work was completed and the sub-contractors presented invoices, in one case for €374,000 and €254,000 in another, some contrived fault was found in the documentation or the work. They were told they would not be paid. When the subcontractors threatened legal proceedings, they were told it would take three years to get to court and by then they would be bankrupt. Instead, they were made an offer of approximately half of what they were owed to take or leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_1850">It is a clever scam because it uses the laws drafted by this House in good faith against the very people for whom laws are drafted to protect — the most vulnerable. We all know, sometimes from bitter experience, that the law favours the rich and that justice delayed is justice denied. A small contractor will have little choice but to risk going into further debt if he or she decides to take on a larger contractor. The scam also works because we have no effective prompt payments legislation. I remind the House that payment delayed is also payment denied. However, the legislation only governs public bodies and does not cover the private business sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1851">Yesterday, before I raised this matter in the House while some hauliers protested outside the gates of Leinster House, I was only aware of ten companies which faced this difficulty. Today, following coverage in the national newspapers, several more have come forward to state that they also face financial ruin at the hands of Glenman Corporation. A plant hire company is owed €180,000, a site security company is owed €10,000 and a haulage company is owed €206,000. This is Government money not reaching people who work on Government projects. I spoke to one man who owes €400,000 to the people he hired to carry out this work. His apartment has been ransacked — we suspect by the creditors — his wife and children have been obliged to move out of the family home and he has not slept in his family home for four weeks because he fears for his life.</p>
            <p eId="para_1852">Another women who recently started a cleaning firm has been obliged to move out of Dublin to Wicklow. Her two vans have been repossessed and she is living in fear of her life, not because she has done anything wrong, but because she has been let down by our courts and our legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1853">This story will grow bigger as time passes and more people come forward. I believe the scandal is bigger than the Gama one with which we are familiar. I appeal to the House to recognise that the long-term prosperity of this country depends to an enormous extent on small to medium-sized indigenous companies. As a country, we will come to ruin if we do not legally and effectively protect sole traders and small and medium-sized companies. This does not mean grants, State loans or other funding, nor does it mean tax breaks. Legally, small companies are entitled to protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1854">I appeal to this House to reform the prompt payment legislation to include all business transactions, to reform legal structures to make it affordable and accessible to all sectors of society and to make it quick and effective. Most of all however, I appeal that we examine the way in which we award Government contracts so that unscrupulous companies no longer have the power effectively to drive small companies to ruin.</p>

          <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_740" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Mr. Killeen</from>
            <p eId="para_1855">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta as an t-ábhar tábhachtach seo a chur os ár gcomhair anocht. I understand that the company in question has contracts with Ballymun Regeneration Limited, South Dublin County Council and Dublin City Council for the construction of a number of local authority housing schemes. The schemes for Ballymun Regeneration Limited involved are Sillogue, phase 3B, where 58 units are due for completion in December 2005 at a budget cost of €8.8 million, and Poppintree, phase 5B, where 90 units are due for completion at the end of the year at a cost of €15.1 million. The scheme for South Dublin County Council involved is Fortunestown with 112 units and a community facility at a cost of €20.3 million, and the involved scheme for Dublin City Council is Poplar Row, phase 2, with 69 new units and 56 units refurbished at a cost of €17.177 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">I am advised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that neither they nor the local authorities concerned had any prior knowledge or difficulties with the payment of suppliers or sub-contractors by the company referred to. Having checked the matter with the local authorities, they have indicated that all claims owed to the company concerned are fully up to date. In the light of recent reports, Ballymun Regeneration Limited has sought to contact the company to ascertain the extent to which suppliers and sub-contractors working on the regeneration project are owed money, the amount involved, if any, and its proposals to address the matter. While the issue of payment of suppliers or sub-contractors is a matter for the companies involved in the first instance, the local authorities will maintain a watching brief to see if and how this matter is resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">The Deputy has also referred to the general issue of prompt payment of bills by public and private sector organisations and I am happy to clarify the legal position in that respect. In general, this area is governed by the provisions of the European Communities (Late Payment in Commercial Transactions) Regulations 2002, which came into force as SI 388 of 2002. These regulations, which gave effect to a European Union directive on late payment in commercial transactions, came into effect in Ireland on 7 August 2002 and apply to commercial transactions in both the public and private sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1858">The regulations provide essentially that penalty interest will become payable if payments for transactions between undertakings are not met within 30 days, unless otherwise specified in a contract or agreement. A payment is regarded as late when 30 days have elapsed unless an alternative payment period is specified in an agreed contract. In the case of an agreed contract, payment is regarded as late if the payment period exceeds the date or end of the period for payment specified in the contract. Where the contract does not specify a payment period, a default payment period of 30 days will apply. This 30-day payment period begins on the date of receipt by the purchaser of an invoice for payment or the date of receipt of the goods or services where the date of receipt of the invoice is uncertain or the purchaser receives the invoice before the delivery of the goods or services in question. In cases where the parties have agreed a procedure for acceptance or verification of the goods or services, the 30-day payment period starts after this process has been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1859">The interest rate specified in the regulations for late payment is the European Central Bank, ECB, rate plus seven percentage points. However parties to a contract may, if they wish, agree an alternative interest rate. Compensation may be claimed for the recovery costs of the debt, if such costs arise, and the basis on which this may be done is also laid down in the regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1861">Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an gCeann Comhairle as ucht cead a thabhairt domsa an t-ábhar seo a thabhairt roimh an Dáil. Since 2001, the Village Project has served the Finglas and Ballymun area by providing assessment services. It was set up under the auspices of the probation and welfare service of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The detrimental effects which the proposed change to this service will have on young people in my constituency must be addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1862">As the Minister of State is aware, the Village Project was established in 2001 by the probation and welfare service. It was a pilot project to provide assessments for children between the ages of 12 and 16 years from the Finglas and Ballymun areas who were referred by the courts. It was set up as a response to the identified need for a community-based assessment service that provided an alternative to the residential centres in existence. The project was originally a co-operative venture between the Department of Education and Science and the probation and welfare service and was funded under the children at risk fund until April 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1863">Since its inception, the project has been extremely successful. A total of 84 young people have undergone assessment up to May 2005. To date, 82 young people have completed their assessments and of this number, a total of 79 have returned to either mainstream schools, alternative educational settings or are in employment. The financial efficacy of the project is apparent when one considers that in 2002, it cost up to €250,000 to detain a young person in a residential placement while it cost €320,000 to assess 20 young people in the Village Project centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_1864">In April 2004 there was a change in policy and practice. Funding and responsibility for the project were transferred wholly to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and placed under the auspices of the probation and welfare service. Although the service had availed of the services of the project since 2001, it adopted this new responsibility with a view to the project fulfilling its role under the Children Act 2001. The probation and welfare service has the responsibility of establishing and developing day centres under the Act with a view to conducting assessments with the community of children aged between 16 and 17 who are on remand. It indicated its desire for the Village Project specifically to fulfil this role in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1865">Before I continue, I wish to provide an outline of the referrals to the project. A total of 19 young people attended the Village Project as a consequence of criminal justice matters and five of the 19 are in detention schools or institutions for young offenders. The remainder continue to be under the supervision of the probation and welfare service and most of them maintain some level of contact with the Village Project. All the young people who attended the project because of criminal justice matters are male.</p>
            <p eId="para_1866">In addition, between 2004 and 2005, five mini-assessments have been conducted on behalf of the probation and welfare service. These consisted of a psycho-educational assessment as well as or instead of an offending risk assessment and were conducted with young people from outside the Dublin 9 and Dublin 11 areas or for whom a full assessment was not required. Ongoing contact with the majority of probation and welfare referrals has been prevalent with many of these young people visiting the project on a weekly basis. Additionally, contact has been maintained with these young people who are in detention via telephone contact and-or visits to either detention schools or young offenders institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1867">Although the probation and welfare service had availed of the services of the project since 2001, it recently adopted the new responsibility under the Children Act. The probation and welfare service has the responsibility of developing and establishing day centres under the Act with a view to conducting assessments of children aged between 16 and 17 years. I am aware that up to 11 of those centres are proposed countrywide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1868">The implications of the change in direction will have a detrimental effect on the current services provided by the centre. It is now apparent that for the project to continue while simultaneously meeting the funding obligations of its exclusive funding source, that is, the probation and welfare service, it must change its core objectives and, consequently, the type of service it provides.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">Given these new circumstances, the board of the Village Project has had to make the difficult decision no longer to accept new referrals for assessment from the courts from Monday, 20 June. Rather, the project must now focus on the development of its role as a day centre and deliver services purely to the clients of the probation and welfare service. This will mean that young people from 12 to 16 years of age will no longer be able to avail of the service. Educational welfare officers, schools and projects will have nowhere to refer children for comprehensive assessments. The positive changes brought about by this project will not continue to develop and further detention of this younger age group could be the result.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">I request the Minister to review the situation and ensure the Village Project can continue to meet the needs of the community in which it operates. As I stated, many 12 to 16 year olds and their families have benefited greatly from the service and it would be a travesty if changes to funding sources dictated that this successful scheme was not allowed to continue into the future. I recognise the need of 16 and 17 year olds will be addressed with these changes but this should not be to the detriment of services for younger people.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">There is much concern among education practitioners, in particular, in the area. In the course of correspondence from the chairperson of the project to the chief executive officer of the National Education Welfare Board, it was indicated that the likelihood of alternative assessment arrangements being available in the short term was unlikely. It was suggested, therefore, that the board would engage in consultations with the probation and welfare service to see how a modification of the decision could be made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1873">The probation and welfare service operates under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It has approximately 430 staff and an annual budget of approximately €45 million. It provides assessments on offenders to the courts and is responsible for the proposal and implementation of community sanctions. It also provides a probation service to prisons. The service funds and works in association with 75 voluntary bodies or projects in the provision of relevant services. The objective of the service is to reduce reoffending and protect the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1874">The Village Project was established in 2001 as a pilot project to provide assessments for children between the ages of 12 and 16 years referred by the courts from the Finglas and Ballymun areas. The project was a co-operative venture between the Department of Education and Science and the probation and welfare service. Initially, it was funded under the children at risk fund in the Department of Education and Science. Following a request from the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform commenced funding the project on 1 January 2004. Since 1 January 2004, 21 males and 12 females have been assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1875">The probation and welfare service has the responsibility of establishing and developing day centres under the Children Act 2001 with a view to conducting assessments of juveniles who are on remand within the community and it has indicated its desire for the project to fulfil this role. It may also provide an assessment service to referrals from other relevant State and community-based services when resources allow.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">The Village Project's board of directors has been considering the implications of this change of direction for a number of months and now accepts that for the viability of the project and to meet funding obligations, it must change its core objectives and, consequently, the type of service it provides. To meet the needs of the probation and welfare service client group and to replicate the requirements of the day centre order as outlined in the Children Act 2001, the Village Project will require some considerable modification. The project is now focusing on the development of its role as a day centre and delivering services to the clients of the probation and welfare service.</p>

            <p eId="para_1939">Responsibility for the issuing of contracts of employment to community development project, CDP, staff is a matter for the management committee of each project. My Department has no legal responsibility for the employment of CDP staff. It should also be noted that two thirds of the funding provided to CDPs comes from sources other than my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">CDPs have traditionally been funded on the basis of a three-year renewable contract. In line with the expiration of the National Development Plan 2000-2006, the majority of projects are on contract up to the end of December 2006. The remaining projects are involved in a contract renewal process, which will result in the offer of contracts to the end of 2006, subject to evidence of satisfactory progress over the course of the previous contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">Beyond 2006, I anticipate that community development projects will continue to receive support within the framework of three-year renewable contracts. Such arrangements are supportive to the provision of contracts to CDP staff.</p>

        the position regarding the work of Comhairle na Tuaithe; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1943">In February 2004, I established Comhairle na Tuaithe to address issues relating to waymarked ways and access. This decision followed consideration by the rural-agri-tourism advisory group of a report presented by the consultation group on access to waymarked ways. The establishment of a countryside council was the key recommendation of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1944">Comhairle na Tuaithe has the following aims: to ensure that all appropriate means are used to resolve conflicts that arise regarding access issues and responsible enjoyment of the countryside; to ensure that all those with an interest and concern in the sustainable development and proper management of the recreational amenities of the countryside are fully consulted on their future management; to develop and update, as necessary, a national countryside recreation strategy; to raise awareness of the benefits to and responsibilities of recreational use of the countryside and to carry out research and training on related issues; to ensure that adequate funding is made available to allow the organisation to achieve these aims and to examine the benefits and management of increased leisure use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1945">The Comhairle comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and State bodies with an interest in the countryside. It has approached its work in the spirit of co-operation and through working groups, which progress components of these aims. To achieve its work programme, Comhairle na Tuaithe has established working groups to address specific required outputs. These groups are addressing: issues surrounding access to the countryside; the development of a national countryside recreation strategy; the development of a countryside code.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">Comhairle na Tuaithe met on numerous occasions since its establishment and, in addition, each of the working groups met separately to progress key aspects of Comhairle's work. Their progress has been fed back to Comhairle na Tuaithe round table meetings on 4 October and 5 November 2004 and on 7 February, 7 March and 19 May 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">Late last year my Department, in association with Comhairle na Tuaithe, ran a national conference to promote and develop Comhairle's work. The main purpose of the event was to provide an opportunity for all stakeholders attending to share ideas on sustainable development and proper management of recreational amenities in the countryside. The feedback received that day is a valuable contribution towards the development of a national countryside recreation strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">Comhairle na Tuaithe has identified and reviewed a set of access parameters in the countryside. These could serve as a basis for conflict prevention and integrate a variety of needs and responsibilities. The Comhairle has also considered the key features necessary for countryside code development, with a focus on the potential application of the internationally recognised Leave No Trace initiative. I understand that Comhairle na Tuaithe is completing its initial consideration of these matters and will meet again in early July. I look forward to receiving its report subsequently.</p>

            <p eId="para_1952">I introduced the CLÁR programme in October 2001 to address depopulation, as well as the decline in and lack of services in rural areas. Areas in 18 counties, with a population of 362,000, have been selected under the programme, including areas I announced in January 2003 in light of the 2002 population census data. This honoured the commitment to review in An Agreed Programme for Government. Areas included are those that suffered the greatest population decline from 1926 to 2002 with an average population loss of 50% and with an aggregate population now of over 4,000. The exception is the Cooley Peninsula, which was included on the basis of the serious difficulties caused there by foot and mouth disease.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">There are no plans at this time for any further review of the boundary of CLÁR areas. I can also confirm that no other significant areas fulfil the population criteria for inclusion in CLÁR and I have examined this issue thoroughly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1955">The amount of the budgetary allocation of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs that was returned to the Exchequer at the end of 2004 was €0.852 million, that is, 0.28% of the gross allocation of €309.629 million. Taking extra appropriations-in-aid receipts into account, the total amount returned to the Exchequer was €3.842 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_1956">This total is made up of the following: extra appropriations-in-aid receipts of €2.99 million — target figure €19.998 million; amount received €22.988 million —€9.787 million of this was received in December, €4.731 million on 14 December and €5.056 million on 21 December; a saving of €0.736 million on the administrative budget of the Department, with €0.15 million of this amount being made available to my Department in 2005 under the efficiency dividend provisions of the Department's administrative budget agreement — savings on administration are not available for spending on programme budgets; a saving of €0.116 million on the programme spend of the Department, representing 0.04% of the gross programme budget of €292.052 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_1963">I do not accept the implications in the Deputies' questions about either a delay on my part in bringing forward draft legislation to regulate the charities sector or resultant difficulties for the sector. Far from there having been a delay, it is only following the establishment of my Department in June 2002, and the setting up of a dedicated charities regulation unit in February 2003, that moves began to be taken towards regulation of the charities sector. The legislation under preparation in my Department will ensure that charities are regulated for the first time since the foundation of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">As regards the public consultation, it is not in accordance with the facts to say that the process was completed a year ago. As I have said previously in the House, the public consultation has been undertaken in two stages. The first took place in 2004, on the basis of a consultation paper, approved by the Government at end-2003, which set out the core legislative proposals. The second took place in 2005, on the basis of a consultation paper prepared by the Law Reform Commission, which set out proposals for the specific aspect of trustee law reform. That second public consultation concluded in April last and the outcome will be the subject of a report from the Law Reform Commission, containing recommendations for consideration by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">Preparation of the draft legislation remains a priority and work is proceeding accordingly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_1970">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 28, 29 and 46 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">As I have indicated in response to previous similar questions in this House, no formal costings have been done in regard to the full implementation of the Official Languages Act 2003 on the basis that such an exercise would not be practicable in advance of consideration on a case by case basis by each public body of what, if any, specific additional costs might arise for it. It is clear that there will be some cost issues involved, particularly at start-up, but in the normal course these should in the main be met from within existing administrative allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">The Act is being implemented on a planned and pragmatic basis. Clearly, some costs will arise in connection with such matters as training and translation services. However, the position for individual public bodies, or indeed on an overall basis, cannot be established until individual schemes have been agreed in accordance with the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">Circumstances will vary greatly from public body to public body in regard to demand for delivery of services through Irish. Indeed, some public bodies will be better placed than others in regard to having the resources to meet this demand, given that they already operate, to varying degrees, a policy of bilingualism. It is, however, a matter for each public body in the first instance to ensure that resources are assigned to comply with the provisions of this legislation in the same way as resources are assigned to ensure compliance with obligations imposed by other legislation and by the requirements to provide quality customer service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">The question of providing funding for specific administrative costs for individual public bodies — regardless of whether these relate to the Official Languages Act or any other service delivery or policy obligation arising — falls to be assessed against formal business cases or proposals submitted as part of the normal annual estimate and budget cycle. Given the position of Irish as the first constitutional language, the objective is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies — including provision of information about services and activities through the Irish language — is seen as a normal requirement to meet minimum standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">It is my intention to keep the First Schedule to the Official Languages Act 2003 up to date by making regulations from time to time to delete references to public bodies that have ceased to exist and to include new public bodies, as appropriate. While my Department is currently working on a draft of such regulations, I am not in a position to say when they might be ready to be presented to the Houses of the Oireachtas for approval in accordance with section 4(3) of the Act. No other expansion of the remit of the Act is under consideration at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1979">The proposed content of the future Charities Regulation Bill has already been the subject of an inclusive, public consultative process, undertaken in two stages over the period 2004-05. At end-2003, the Government approved the core legislative proposals for regulating the charities sector. Those proposals were set out in a consultation paper, entitled Establishing a Modern Statutory Framework for Charities, which was the reference document for the first stage of the consultative process in 2004. Furthermore, the specialist aspect of the draft legislation concerning trustee law reform was the subject of proposals from the Law Reform Commission. These proposals were set out in a further consultation paper, which was the reference document for the second stage of the consultative process in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">The broad, overall public endorsement of the legislative proposals has served to confirm the direction to be taken with preparation of the draft Charities Regulation Bill. I remain committed to the inclusive, public consultation process that I have adopted to date.

            <p eId="para_1995">While the actual amount of funding must await agreement on the EU budget, I welcome the stipulation that at least 10% of the money Ireland receives under the European agriculture fund for rural development will now be spent on the provision of services and-or support in the rural economy beyond the farm gate. A minimum funding level of 5% will be dedicated to mainstreaming the Leader methodology, which is almost double the present level of funding. Overall, this will mean a considerable increase in support for rural development programmes implemented by my Department. The agreement also provides for basic services for the economy and rural population and a new provision which will cover cultural and leisure activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">Overall, this new approach to rural development is likely to enable development of a fuller range of programmes and projects to be supported, leading to the creation of new enterprises and employment opportunities and helping to achieve the Government's objective of balanced regional development and sustainable and vibrant rural communities. Work will now commence on a national rural development plan which will include preparation of a joint national rural development strategy and a detailed national rural development programme. The process will include working closely with stakeholders.</p>

A number of public sector organisations have had questions and concerns about how the legislation impacts on them and these presentations have proved a useful way of explaining the facts and allaying undue fears. The offer from my Department to meet with public bodies stands.</p>
            <p eId="para_2014">Regulations under section 9(1) of the Act — which will cover matters such as advertising — are currently being prepared and I cannot give a precise date at this time for their coming into effect.

The approach being taken is a pragmatic and phased one but one which is also consistent with the unanimous will of the Oireachtas that the Irish language should be used by public bodies for official purposes such as advertising.</p>

            <p eId="para_2018">I have made regulations to prescribe the large scale, definitive maps of the State prepared and published by Ordnance Survey Ireland, OSI, for the purposes of section 33 of the Official Languages Act. The effect of these regulations is that only the placename as declared in the Placenames (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) Order 2004 may be used on these maps. I am assured by OSI that tourist maps published by it show both the Irish language placename and the English language version. In addition, two of the main private companies in the map publishing business have indicated to my Department that they will ensure that new tourists maps and other literature to be published by them will also show both language versions henceforth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">I have no current plans to make further regulations of this type. However, I expect that an effect of the Gaeltacht placenames order is that public bodies will move over time to use of the Irish language placename for official purposes. One of the key pressures on the Irish language in Gaeltacht areas arises from the lack of practical recognition of the language in services to customers from many public bodies. The Irish language requires positive efforts to protect its future, particularly in terms of recognition by the public sector of the rights of its customers to use Irish in official dealings with it. This is one small such step, designed to reinforce the status of Irish as the spoken community language in Gaeltacht areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_2021">I regard the achievement of enhanced status for the Irish language in Europe as a significant one for the Irish language. As I have already said publicly, this decision now presents a challenge to the Irish speaking community to use the new status that has been achieved for Irish. It also presents a challenge to the Irish language organisations and educational institutions to ensure that there are enough highly qualified people to meet the requirements of the new status.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">The provision of real opportunities for citizens to use Irish in official dealings with public bodies here at home is important to the future development of the language. It cannot and should not be dismissed as merely concentrating on legislative status. The future of Irish depends on its speakers being able to live their lives to the full through the language. Being able to use Irish in official dealings with the State is of critical importance in that regard. The perceived status of the language is not just a question of the legislative position but also relates to the practical recognition afforded in delivery of services and in their communications across public bodies to the language and to its speakers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">If we wish, as the Deputy's question suggests he does, to encourage people to use Irish and to give people opportunities to speak Irish, that cannot be done in a way that is marginal or tokenistic, or separated from the mainstream of public life and public service delivery.</p>

            <p eId="para_2032">The report of the steering group on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy was published in early June. The report was the culmination of the mid-term review, a comprehensive review process which was launched last year and included an extensive public consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2033">The review was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department, and made up of the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. The steering group was also assisted by external consultants. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at this mid-point stage and, in this regard, the group concentrated on identifying adjustments to the existing strategy and highlighting priorities for the remaining period up to 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2034">The steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the strategy are fundamentally sound. The review found that there are encouraging signs of progress since 2001 when the strategy was first launched, which suggests that the current approach to tackling the drugs problem is proving to be effective. At the same time, however, the report highlights the need to re-focus priorities and accelerate the roll out of some of the strategy's actions and, in this context, a number of new actions and amendments have been identified. These changes will, I believe, strengthen the strategy and enable it to better deliver its aims in the next two to three years. In overall terms, ten of the strategy's existing actions are being replaced, a further seven of the existing actions are being amended and there are eight new actions which aim to address issues such as family support and rehabilitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2035">With regard to rehabilitation, this issue was identified by the steering group, and through the consultation process, as an area which needed to be developed. The steering group recommended that rehabilitation become the fifth pillar of the strategy and I strongly support this recommendation. To further this action, a working group is being set up to develop a policy for the provision of integrated rehabilitation services. This group will be chaired by my Department and will consist of representatives from all relevant Departments and agencies and the community and voluntary sectors. The group is scheduled to report by the end of the year on the appropriate policy and actions to be implemented and I look forward to the outcome of its deliberations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2037">The European Council endorsed the EU Drug Strategy 2005-2012 in December of last year. This strategy sets out the framework, objectives and priorities for two consecutive action plans, the first of which is the EU Action Plan on Drugs 2005 to 2008. This action plan has not yet been adopted and is scheduled to be discussed at the next meeting of EU Justice and Home Affairs Ministers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">The ultimate aim of the first action plan will be to significantly reduce drug use amongst Europe's population. It will also seek to reduce the harm to society and the damage to health caused by the use of and trade in illicit drugs. In addition, it will provide a framework for a balanced approach to reducing both the supply of and demand for illicit drugs. While the action plan will be directed primarily at European institutions and bodies, it will also provide a framework for action at member state level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">The issue of concurrence between the EU strategy and the national drugs strategy was examined as part of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, which was published in early June. The steering group which oversaw the review found that the multi-disciplinary, balanced approach of the national drugs strategy and its aims and objectives are consistent with the EU strategy. In addition, the proposed actions of the new EU drugs action plan are broadly consistent with those in the current strategy and in the recommendations contained in the mid-term review. Accordingly, I am confident that the complementarities between national and EU approaches will be maintained into the future.</p>

These options are available to all, irrespective of whether a person is originally from this country or not.

            <p eId="para_2043">Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts moneys are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the dormant accounts Acts. The board engaged Area Development Management Ltd., ADM, to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the allocation of €60 million from the dormant accounts fund. To date, the board has approved 482 projects for funding which will involve the allocation of approximately €56.2 million from the fund. A breakdown of these approved allocations by county is provided in the table. Over the coming weeks further allocations will be made by the board up to a total figure of €60 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2044">The Government decided in December 2003 to bring forward legislative changes in arrangements for dormant accounts funding. Arising from this decision, the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill was published on 24 June 2004 and became law on 25 May 2005. The Act provides for key changes in decision making on disbursements from the fund and for a reconstituted board.</p>

            <p eId="para_2133">My Department understands from the Department of Social and Family Affairs that a sum of €500,000 has been set aside in that Department's administrative budget in 2005 to meet costs directly associated with the delivery of services to the public through the Irish language in accordance with the Official Languages Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">I am not in a position to comment in detail on the estimate until I have seen a draft scheme, which I await from the Department concerned. However, the administrative budget voted by this House to the Department concerned is €306.195 million in 2005, which includes a €29 million increase over 2004. The estimate provided to my Department amounts to about one sixth of 1% of the administrative budget figure, which seems good value for money for the cost of providing its services to the portion of the population who wish to do their business with the Department in Irish.</p>
            <p eId="para_2135">In light of the foregoing, I regard the Department of Social and Family Affairs allocation of €500,000 to meets costs directly associated with the Official Languages Act as appropriate and reasonable.</p>

Among these indices was the youth suicide rate and the report showed that Ireland had the second highest rate of suicide for persons under the age of 25 years. It also reported that the rate of increase in the youth suicide rate over the past 20 years had been highest in Ireland. However, the statistics presented in the report must be interpreted with some degree of perspective. This report is based on data for 1998, the year in which there were 514 deaths by suicide in Ireland. The average annual number of suicide deaths for the five years since then is 471.</p>

This strategy, involving the project management unit, Health Service Executive, in partnership with the national suicide review group and supported by the Department of Health and Children will be action based from the outset and will build on existing policy. All measures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by suicide will be considered in the context of the preparation of this strategy, which is due to be published in September this year.</p>

In respect of medical card holders aged 70 years and over who are resident in a private nursing home, approved by the Health Service Executive, for any continuous period of five weeks, the GP is paid a capitation rate of €717.48 per annum per card holder.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">Under the terms of the GMS, GP contract allowances are also payable to GMS doctors in respect of leave — sick, maternity, paternity, annual, study, locum, palliative care, special items of service, out of hours payments, medical indemnity, rural practice, rostering and training practices. Payments are also made in respect of superannuation. GMS GPs also receive once off registration payments in respect of their non-EU national patients. Under the terms of the recent Labour Relations Commission recommendation, GPs holding GMS contracts providing services to GP visit card holders would receive a once off payment of €35 for each of the first 200,000 patients admitted under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">GMS GPs may also apply for allowances in respect of the employment of practice nurses, secretaries and managers. These allowances are based on their patient panel composition and the experience and conditions of employment of the staff involved. The maximum grant in respect of a practice nurse is currently €31,262.43 and for a practice secretary up to a maximum of €19,894.27.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">Doctors who participate in the indicative drugs target savings scheme have also been able to access savings made under the scheme to fund HSE approved practice development projects. Between January 1993, the introduction of the scheme, and 31 August 2004, in excess of €90 million has been paid nationally under this scheme to participating doctors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2450">Carers provide an invaluable role in supporting family members in the community and it is important to recognise their contribution to society. The role of carers in society has to some extent not been fully recognised in the past but this situation is changing with a number of initiatives being introduced to address their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">The Department of Health and Children provided in excess of €1 million in funding in 2005 to a number of groups supporting carers such as Care Alliance, Caring for Carers and the Carers Association. The Department of Social and Family Affairs has also implemented a range of measures since 1999 to assist carers, including increases in the carer's allowance, the introduction of an annual payment of €1,000 towards the cost of respite care and the extension of schemes such as the free electricity allowance, free telephone rental and free TV licence to those on carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">The Carer's Leave Act 2001 allows employees in Ireland to leave their employment temporarily for a minimum period of 13 weeks up to a maximum period of 65 weeks to provide full-time care and attention. Carers' leave from employment is unpaid but the Carer's Leave Act ensures that those who propose to avail of carer's leave will have their jobs kept open for them for the duration of the leave.</p>

            <p eId="para_2469">I, and my colleague, the Minister for Finance, signed the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 on 14 June last, and these regulations reinstate charges for inpatient services. Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, <i>inter alia,</i> for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In this regard, charging for patients in long-term care cannot commence until the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed, which means that the earliest date on which charges can be levied is 14 July 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">These regulations provide for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. Section 51 of the Health Act 1970 defines inpatient services as meaning "institutional services provided for persons while maintained in a hospital, convalescent home or home for persons suffering from physical or mental disability or in accommodation ancillary thereto".</p>
            <p eId="para_2471">The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied. Class 1 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser. Class 2 refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90 or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.</p>
            <p eId="para_2472">These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. However, the Health Service Executive has power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of "undue hardship". Under the regulations, only the HSE has the power to levy a charge. It is a matter for the HSE, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on charges.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_2474">The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 allows for the payment of a subvention towards the cost of nursing home care based on medical and means assessments. The process used in determining a person's eligibility for subvention is set out in the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">As the Deputy will be aware, the placing of a person in a private nursing home is a private matter between the person or his or her representatives and the nursing home proprietor, as are the fees charged by a nursing home. The subvention scheme was introduced to assist with the cost of private nursing home care and it was never intended that a subvention payment would meet the full costs of private nursing home care.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">The Government is very conscious of the changing demographic profile of our population, with more people living longer and more fulfilling lives and the consequential increasing demand for services, both community based and residential. The Mercer report on the future financing of long-term care in Ireland, which was commissioned by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, examined issues surrounding the financing of long-term care. Following the publication of this report, a working group chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and comprising senior officials from the Departments of Finance, Health and Children and Social and Family Affairs has been established.</p>
            <p eId="para_2477">The group is examining service issues in regard to home care and residential care and funding mechanisms to support initiatives that may be proposed in regard to those services. The group will report in the near future to both the Tánaiste and Minister for Social and Family Affairs and it is likely that the Government will seek the views of stakeholders later this year on any proposals put forward by the group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2478">It will be appreciated that since the value of persons' pensions is unknown, it is not possible to cost the proposal. Under the Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations 1993 the Health Service Executive in assessing the means of an applicant for subvention shall disregard income equivalent to one fifth of the weekly rate of the old age non-contributory pension.</p>

            <p eId="para_2527">The Government is strongly committed to maintaining community rating in the Irish health insurance market. Provision for the operation of risk equalisation is essential to the policy of maintaining a community rated health insurance market. The Health Insurance Act 2001 provides that risk equalisation should be introduced where to do so is in the best overall interests of the health insurance consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">The Deputy will be aware that I decided on balance recently not to trigger risk equalisation payments in the health insurance market at this point in time. The matter now rests until the Health Insurance Authority's next report for the period January to June 2005, due to be received by me towards the end of October. This is subject to developments in court proceedings currently in train against recourse to risk equalisation in the health insurance market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">The correspondence to which the Deputy refers is a letter from the managing director of BUPA Ireland, which I understand was part of a mailshot to its customers, inviting them to protest to my office against the introduction of risk equalisation transfers.

            <p eId="para_2553">The Government has agreed the key elements of a scheme for the repayment of long stay charges. All those who were illegally charged for publicly funded long-term residential care and are alive and the estates of all those who were charged and died in the six years prior to 9 December 2004 will have the charges repaid in full. The scheme will not provide for repayments to the estates of those who died more than six years ago. The repayments will include both the actual charge paid and an amount to take account of inflation, using the CPI, since the time the person involved was charged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2554">Legislation will be brought before the Oireachtas in the autumn to underpin the scheme. One of the objectives of the legislation will be to put in place procedures which will protect vulnerable people from exploitation given that significant repayments in some cases will be paid to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2555">In the case of those who were charged and are still alive, the repayments will be exempt from tax and will not be taken into account in assessing means for health and social welfare benefits. The normal tax and means assessment arrangements will apply to those who benefit from repayments to estates.</p>
            <p eId="para_2556">An outside company with experience in handling mass claims will be engaged to design and manage the scheme within the parameters of the key principles approved by Government. The Health Services Executive is finalising an advertisement in the <i>EU  Journal </i>to obtain expressions of interest from companies that would design and manage the repayments scheme. The company selected will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the co-operation is forthcoming on records held by the health agencies. It is anticipated that a company will be selected over the summer and will begin work in early autumn on the design of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2557">An oversight committee has been appointed to monitor the implementation of the repayment scheme. The committee will be chaired by Dr. Bernard Walsh, a geriatrician in St. James's Hospital and its task will be to ensure that proper governance is applied by the HSE and the company to the scheme. The scheme will be designed and managed with the aim of ensuring that those who are eligible for repayments receive them as soon as possible and with the minimum possible imposition in terms of bureaucracy. Priority will be given to those who are still alive. Many of those eligible for repayments have already been identified under the <i>ex gratia </i>payments process. The scheme will include a transparent and thorough appeals process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2558">The legislation will include appropriate safeguards to prevent exploitation of those who receive repayments and are not in a position to manage their own financial affairs. The scheme will include a provision to allow those eligible for a repayment to waive their right to a repayment and have the money assigned to fund one-off service improvements in elderly, mental health and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2559">It is estimated that about 20,000 people who are still alive and a further 40,000 to 50,000 estates will benefit. It is estimated that the scheme will cost approximately €1 billion. The decision to limit payments to the estates of those who died in the past six years reflects the reference in the Supreme Court judgment to the statute of limitations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">The national helpline set up by the Health Services Executive to allow people to register if they believe they are due a repayment will continue to operate but there is no need for anyone who has already registered using this facility to make contact with the HSE again to register for the scheme. Any person who considers that they or a family member may be eligible for repayment may register their interest in advance with the Health Service Executive, by writing to the National Refund Scheme, HSE Midland Area, Arden Road, Tullamore, Co Offaly; or email to <i>refundscheme@mailq.hse.ie</i>; or by calling the helpline 1800 777737 during office hours.</p>

            <p eId="para_2610">The report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report, makes important proposals for reducing the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs, in line with the European working time directive and highlights the need to implement changes in medical staffing to ensure safety and quality of patient care. The Hanly report makes no reference to Mayo General Hospital. Instead, it made specific recommendations for reorganising hospitals in two regions — the east coast and the mid-west — and set out a series of principles for the future organisation of hospital services nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2611">It should be noted that the report recommended investment in hospitals at regional level to provide more services for patients and emphasised that a full range of acute hospital services should be available within each region, so that patients should not have to travel outside the region other than for specialised supra-regional or national level services. The report also recommended a significant increase in the total number of consultants in each region, working in a consultant provided, team based system, so that patients can receive faster access to senior clinical decision making. This will help to reduce waiting lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_2612">I consider that the national hospitals' office is best placed to build on the recommendations of the report in this area. Its priority will be to ensure that patients, wherever they live, have equitable and rapid access to high quality hospital care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2616">The medical criteria for this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. There are six different types of disablement listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg, such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly, or almost wholly without the use of one leg; persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2617">An individual who qualifies under the medical criteria, as set out above, is issued with a primary medical certificate. Possession of a primary medical certificate qualifies the holder for remission or repayment of: vehicle registration tax, VRT; a repayment of value added tax, VAT, on the purchase of the vehicle; and a repayment of VAT on the cost of adaptation of the vehicle. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2618">An interdepartmental review group was established to review the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concessions scheme. The group examined all aspects of the scheme including the qualifying medical criteria. The report was published on my Department's website in July 2004 and copies have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. As agreed by Government in June 2004, I will consider the report on an ongoing basis in the overall budgetary context having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2623">Economic model simulations suggest that, holding other factors constant, each sustained $10 per barrel rise in the price of oil reduces growth in the Irish economy by about 0.5 percentage points in a full year, relative to baseline. It should be noted, however, that because oil has not in the past risen to a level as high as $70 per barrel, it is difficult to accurately simulate such a scenario.</p>
            <p eId="para_2624">The dependency of the economy on oil has declined over the last number of years, for example, imports of oil amounted to 1.5% of GDP last year; in the late 1970s, the equivalent figure was around 6.5% of GDP. This lower oil dependency has been due to a number of factors such as the greater relative importance of services in the economy, which are less energy intensive, the growth in natural gas and other energy sources and more efficient use of energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2625">As a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, Ireland is required to maintain oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports in the previous year. At 1 May 2005, Ireland held 2,304,000 tonnes of oil, which is equivalent to 102 days of net imports using the IEA methodology and this is 12 days above the obligation of 90 days.</p>

            <p eId="para_2722">The main reason for the increase in the value of write off over the period 1988 to 1992 was due to a review of tax arrears on record which commenced after the 1988 amnesty. This review which was ongoing over the years 1988 to 1992 led not only to more effective collection of taxes but also, inevitably, to the increase in the amount of taxes deemed irrecoverable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">It should be noted that the amount written off may overstate the actual liability as many of the cases included estimated amounts. Following an examination of tax write off arrangements in place prior to 1997, Revenue received general approval from the Comptroller and Auditor General for the criteria to be used in new arrangements for the write off of tax debt. These procedures are subject to audit on an annual basis and the results are published in the annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>

As the Deputy may be aware, there was a small excise increase in Finance Act 2005 on non-auto LPG in order to comply with the EU energy tax directive. While under the directive certain LPG usage could have been exempted, this was not seen as feasible. It would have given rise to potential difficulties, including an increase in the potential for abuse, particularly as there is no system for fiscal marking of LPG comparable to that used for marked gas oil and marked kerosene. However, I have agreed to keep this matter under review.</p>

        if his attention has been drawn to the fact that many first time buyers who depend on parents to contribute to the cost of purchase are being ruled liable to stamp duty; and if arrangements will be made whereby a certificate confirming that the parents will take no beneficial interest from the home will suffice to obtain the intended stamp duty exemption.

            <p eId="para_3206">A stamp duty exemption for first time buyers of second hand houses under €317,500 was brought in by budget 2005. Previously it had applied only to houses up to €190,500, so the significant increase in the threshold made this exemption relevant to a much broader range of purchasers. Reduced rates of duty were also made available for purchases up to €635,000. The relief from stamp duty is intended to benefit only genuine first time buyers. It is, of course, essential that the stamp duty advantage intended for first time buyers should not be diluted by allowing persons who are not first time buyers circumvent the rules, by borrowing in tandem with another person who is a first time buyer. Revenue has always accepted that a person would not have been precluded from obtaining first time buyer relief where a parent provides funds by means of an unconditional gift towards the purchase of a house or where a parent acts as financial guarantor for purchase moneys which are borrowed by his or her son or daughter in connection with the purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">In a statement issued on Friday, 24 June, the Revenue Commissioners have offered reassurance to first time buyers in situations involving parents of first time buyers acting as co-mortgagors. The Revenue Commissioners are now prepared to accept that a child, who is a first time buyer, will not be precluded from claiming first time buyer relief where a parent acts as a co-mortgagor in the following circumstances: the transfer of the house is taken in the name of the child; it is the intention of both the child and the parent that the parent is not to take a beneficial interest in the house; the parent has been joined into the mortgage solely at the request of the lending institution for the purpose of providing additional security for the moneys being advanced for the purchase; it is not intended that the parent will be contributing to the repayment of the mortgage in the normal course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3208">Where the four conditions set out above are satisfied, Revenue will treat the parent as effectively acting in the role of guarantor for the loan. In these circumstances, the certificate envisaged by the Deputy would not be required for a first time buyer to obtain the stamp duty exemption. I am also advised that the Revenue Commissioners do not propose to seek a clawback of stamp duty where transfers have taken place before last Friday, 24 June, which comply with the conditions outlined above.</p>

            <p eId="para_3382">Shannon Foynes Port Company is established and operates under the Harbours Act 1996. The Act provides that the principal objectives of the company include the management, control, operation and development of its harbour. Moneypoint jetty is owned and operated by ESB and handles mainly coal shipments for the electricity generating station at Moneypoint. The Department does not keep records of movements within individual ports. I have asked Shannon Foynes Port Company, within whose jurisdiction the facility lies, to forward the relevant information to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3383">In January this year, I launched the Government's ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3384">As an initial step, the Department has sought information from the commercial ports which handle unit load cargo on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond and whether the ports see these as being funded from their own resources or in partnership with the private sector. In its response to this request, Shannon Foynes Port Company has provided information to the Department concerning its proposal for the development of a new container transhipment terminal on the lower reaches of the Shannon Estuary. The timeframe for the proposed development and the preparation of a detailed business plan are matters for Shannon Foynes Port Company in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3385">As indicated in the ports policy statement, it is intended to prioritise a range of projects catering for unitised traffic at our commercial ports from an overall economic national and regional perspective, as opposed to the perceived requirements of individual ports. To that end, the Department will procure expert and independent assistance from consultants to refine the criteria to be used for project evaluation, to draw up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals and to subsequently evaluate and rank the projects submitted as a basis for the Department's recommendation to Government. An invitation to tender for this consultancy is expected to be issued shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3386">The Department has no funds in its budget for the development of additional marine leisure facilities in the estuary.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_3394">Section 6 of the Maritime Safety Bill 2004 as passed by Dáil Éireann on 21 June 2005, provides that by-laws may be made regulating or controlling the operation of craft or specified craft by local authorities in waters in their functional areas, harbour authorities and Waterways Ireland in waters under their control or management, in respect of, amongst other matters, the prohibition in specified waters or at specified times of such craft. Craft is defined in the Bill as personal watercraft, often referred to as jet skis, and recreational craft when operated by a mechanical means of propulsion.</p>
            <p eId="para_3395">Section 6 also sets out the basis for any such prohibition and these are: in the interests of the safety of persons using the waters generally or at certain times; to prevent nuisance to or injury to persons or damage to watercraft or other property on the waters; and to protect a natural heritage area or a monument or wreck protected under the National Monuments Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3396">It is essential that the by-law making authorities under the Bill have the power under section 6 to prohibit in circumstances that warrant such action. However, in many cases the use of such craft can, with appropriate restrictions, be accommodated and I would encourage the authorities to use the power under section 6, which I introduced as a Dáil Committee Stage amendment, to restrict the operation of this type of craft in such circumstances rather than prohibit. In this way competing water users can be accommodated to the benefit of those users and the marine tourism industry.</p>

            <p eId="para_3405">A national monitoring and control programme for sea lice at marine finfish farms is operated on behalf of the Department by the Marine Institute, in accordance with the Protocol for Sea Lice Monitoring and Control published by the Department of Marine and Natural Resources in 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_3406">The programme involves the carrying out of 14 inspections a year at each site containing fish. One inspection is carried out in the period from December to January, two inspections per month are undertaken in the period from March to May and one inspection per month is carried out during the rest of the year. The key purpose of these inspections is to establish whether the lice levels at a site are in excess of the strict trigger levels that are applied in this country. If the appropriate trigger level is exceeded, the operator of the site is required to apply an appropriate treatment with a view to effecting a reduction in the lice levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3407">A study of sea lice levels on wild salmon intercepted at sea, several miles from the coast, on their return migration, was carried out in 2003 by the Marine Institute in conjunction with the department of sciences at the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology. It showed that these fish had an average infestation in the region of ten lice per fish. No evidence has been found of increased mortality due to sea lice in outward migrating salmon smolts. While no studies are available on this subject, the Marine Institute is conducting a multi-year study, the results of which will be published in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_3413">I propose to take Questions Nos. 217 and 221 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3414">Wild salmon stocks are under threat from a variety of adverse environmental and other pressures which impact on marine survival as well as in our rivers and estuaries. As Minister of State with responsibility for the marine, I am fully aware that these pressures, along with excessive exploitation of salmon stocks, pose a significant threat to the long-term sustainability of this valuable natural resource.</p>
            <p eId="para_3415">With this in mind, the Government has accepted the scientific advice that continues to maintain that reductions in the overall fishing effort are required to sustain and rebuild salmon stocks nationwide. For this reason, current Government policy has been designed to bring spawning escapement up to the level of the scientifically advised conservation limits and to fully align the wild salmon catch on the scientific advice so that we can have increased confidence that a sustainable management regime is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3416">Since 2002, the Government has implemented a strategy to ensure, through progressive reductions in the commercial catch, that the conservation limits specified by the standing scientific committee of the National Salmon Commission are being reached. This policy of promoting the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling has delivered significant overall catch reductions aimed at achieving the objective of restoration of salmon stocks. A quality and value strategy is also in place within the commercial salmon fishery aimed at improving how fish are handled, post catching, to ensure that the maximum price per fish is obtained. This approach maintains or increases the overall income derived from the fishery even when the total catch is reduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3417">In these circumstances, I have no plans to introduce proposals to purchase commercial drift net salmon fishing licences. The Government has consistently ruled out buyout as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks. Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buyout of commercial salmon drift net licences or why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_3418">As I have previously and consistently indicated to the House, I am prepared to keep the matter under review. In this regard, I would be open to any relevant proposals presented to me whereby stakeholders benefiting from any reduction in commercial catch would engage in the first instance with licence holders and indicate a willingness to address any compensation issues that might arise. In the meantime, the Government believes that the current strategy of developing a sustainable commercial and recreational salmon fishery through aligning catches on the scientific advice holds out the strong prospect of a recovery of stocks and of a long-term sustainable fishery for both sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_3469">The primary responsibility for the development of the post office network rests with An Post. The automation of the network was completed in 1997 and it has only been in exceptional circumstances — such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location which transacts significant volumes of welfare business — that further offices have been automated since then.</p>
            <p eId="para_3470">The automated network accounts for more than 95% of An Post's counter business. This means that the 1,000 automated offices transact 95% of counter business while 475 non-automated offices undertake 5% of business. Nevertheless, An Post is now moving to undertake a pilot project, which would see ten manual post offices automated, to gauge the effect on business. Furthermore, An Post is undertaking a fundamental reappraisal of the post office network. The objective of this exercise is to build on existing strengths in terms of nationwide network, strong brand recognition and high footfall, and to devise a suite of products and services to meet current and future needs of post office customers. This strategy will provide the road map for future service delivery throughout the network. In a separate initiative, the company is working with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on a project to automate nine island post offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_3471">At this point, An Post has no plans to provide Internet access to the public through the rural post office network. However, with the rollout of e-government services, the automated element of the post office network is ideally placed to capitalise on opportunities arising in this space, especially in the area of e-payments. A core objective for An Post continues to be the retention of access to post office services in as many locations as possible, in the manner which best meets customer needs, whether services are provided via post offices, postal agencies or the PostPoint network.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3473">The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever. Competition can be expected to increase into the future, from the privately owned express sector, from the large European public operators now looking for international business and from electronic communications technologies such as e-mail and text messaging. The trend of dropping mail volumes internationally is also impacting on the Irish postal sector. This does not bode well for the future of a volume based business.</p>
            <p eId="para_3474">Already the parcels business in Ireland is liberalised, with major international players operating in the Irish market. Furthermore, the European Commission's stated intention is to complete the internal market for postal services in 2009 which, if achieved, would open up the letter post area to full competition. The Commission is undertaking a number of studies on the impact of competition on the universal service requirement, which is enshrined in EU and Irish law. The results of these studies will contribute to determining the direction of the postal market into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_3475">With this in mind, An Post will continue to have a key national role, both in delivery of mail and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. To remain competitive, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers' needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3476">Agreement has been reached that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. In addition, I established a working group in January 2005 to examine the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This working group reported earlier this year and found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits, including the delivery of improvements in efficiencies and quality in the postal sector. It could also stimulate mail volume growth, assist utilities and emergency services, address the problem of non-unique addressing and facilitate competition by making it easier for new postal operators to enter the market. These improvements collectively will boost the country's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_3477">Following from the recommendations of the working group report, consideration of the feasibility, design and implementation of a practicable postcode project proposal will be advanced, including establishing the cost of implementing such a postcode and how that cost should be met. In accordance with the recommendation of the working group, that project managers be appointed to lead the postcode project, I have asked the Commission for Communications Regulation to appoint the project managers. I will appoint a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments together with public and private sector organisations, to assist the project managers with their work and to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail a model that is the most efficient, effective and most publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005. I expect the new postcode system to be implemented by 1 January 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_914">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3481">I have asked the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, to appoint project managers to support the postcode project. As a next step I will appoint a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments together with public and private sector organisations, to assist the project managers with their work. It is hoped to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail the most efficient, effective and most publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005. In its deliberations, the project board will examine all of the options for a postcode system. This may include an examination of An Post's GeoDirectory.</p>
            <p eId="para_3482">Whilst the GeoDirectory has already been developed and adopted by some organisations and goes some way towards solving the problem of identifying individual addresses in townlands, it has certain characteristics that impact upon its suitability for use as a public postcode system and it is not consistent with the generally accepted definition of a postcode as a "unique, universal identifier that unambiguously identifies the addressee's locality and assists in the transmission and sorting of mail items."</p>
            <p eId="para_3483">An Post has also advised that the GeoDirectory product is not a publicly available postcode system. It is a commercial, proprietary, address database that is linked to geographical co-ordinates to provide a unique identifier for buildings and has been developed by An Post and Ordnance Survey Ireland. The cost of the GeoDirectory product supplied by An Post is expensive for most businesses and comprises a once-off fee of €57,000 plus an annual licensing fee of 14% of the initial cost. These high costs reflect that keeping the GeoDirectory database updated is a continual and labour intensive exercise and that geo codes are not automatically assigned and require manual intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_3484">While a postcode can be used with automated mail process systems, it must also be capable of being used with manual systems. The GeoDirectory product is a building identifier and the purpose of a postcode system is to make it easier to process and deliver mail. The GeoDirectory's design means that it is only when combined with An Post sorting technology that it can be employed as a technical postcode. However, because approximately 40% of Irish addresses are not "unique", the An Post sorting technology, when deployed, cannot always match the address written on the envelope with the list of delivery points. If a postcode system were in place a much greater proportion of letters could be automatically sorted, and when human intervention is necessary the time needed would be shorter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3485">Other potential drawbacks to the use of the GeoDirectory as a postcode system, as identified by ComReg, include that there may also be data protection and privacy issues as the database requires an occupier's name to be recorded on the database in rural areas. It is also a sequential technical code that is not intuitive or easy to recall and this could impact upon the public adoption rates of any new postcode system based on the GeoDirectory.</p>

This group produced its report earlier this month.</p>
            <p eId="para_3488">Following from the report's recommendations, I have asked the Commission for Communications Regulation to appoint project managers through a competitive process to support the postcode project. As part of their work the project managers will consult with various interest and expert groups with a view to designing a range of postcode proposals best suited for Ireland. As a next step I will appoint a national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments together with public and private sector organisations, to assist the project managers with their work. It is hoped to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail the most efficient, effective and most publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_3505">The Government views with great concern the recent actions by the Zimbabwean Government, which have resulted in an estimated 275,000 people being left homeless, as a result of Operation Restore Order, aimed at clearing away the businesses of informal street traders and unregistered homes built by the urban poor. Ireland and its EU partners have joined many others in the international community in condemning the totally unjustified actions of the Zimbabwean Government which have only succeeded in worsening the humanitarian situation in a country already facing serious food shortages this year and currently experiencing unemployment levels of between 70% and 80%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3506">The serious humanitarian consequences arising from Operation Restore Order has once again highlighted the failed policies of President Mugabe's Government. It is important that international pressure continues to be exerted on the Zimbabwean authorities to cease this campaign as soon as possible, to assist those who have been left homeless or in want as a result and to begin implementing democratic reforms to move away from the climate of repression and intimidation, which has characterised Zimbabwe in recent years. In this regard, I very much welcome the decision by the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to appoint Ms Anna Kajumulo Tibaijuka, the executive director of UN Habitat, as his special envoy to assess the humanitarian consequences of the forcible eviction policies currently being pursued. Ms Kajumulo Tibaijuka is currently in Zimbabwe and will submit a full report on the situation to the Secretary General following her visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">The Irish ambassador to South Africa, who is also accredited to Zimbabwe, visited Harare earlier this month in order to assess the humanitarian consequences of Operation Restore Order and has already submitted a full report to me on his visit. The ambassador will visit Zimbabwe again in the coming weeks and will make clear to the Zimbabwean authorities both our condemnation of Operation Restore Order and grave concerns at its humanitarian consequences. The ambassador and embassy are also in regular contact with Irish missionaries and NGOs operating in Zimbabwe who have been providing assistance to some of those worst affected by the consequences of Operation Restore Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_3508">The Government decided last week to provide an additional €1 million to the World Food Programme to support emergency feeding programmes for those most directly at threat from the current humanitarian crisis in Zimbabwe. This additional funding will also be used to support emergency feeding programmes in Malawi. The Government has made available almost €7 million in emergency and recovery assistance to assist the people of Zimbabwe over the period 2002-2004, including €2.46 million last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3509">The European Union issued a declaration on 7 June condemning the actions undertaken by the Zimbabwean Government within the framework of Operation Restore Order and calling for its immediate end. A joint statement was also issued following the EU-US summit in Washington DC on 20 June expressing grave concern at the current situation and calling on the Zimbabwean Government to reverse its anti-democratic policies. It is clear that pressure also needs to be exerted on Zimbabwe's neighbours in the Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, to use their influence with President Mugabe's Government to stop Operation Restore Order and address the humanitarian consequences. EU ambassadors are being directed to make such representations in SADC capitals. The EU's concerns were also raised at a senior officials meeting with SADC, which took place in Johannesburg on 20 June. I hope that AU leaders will address the human rights and humanitarian crisis resulting from Operation Restore Order at their forthcoming summit meeting in Sirte, Libya on 4 and 5 July.</p>

            <p eId="para_3540">The FÁS-VEC return to education programme was put in place to address the literacy needs of participants on the community employment programme. It has been running for a number of years and is delivered on a regional basis by the VECs. There have been no cutbacks in the FÁS budget for literacy training over 2004. There has been an increase in expenditure on literacy to date this year when compared to last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3541">While the course has been successful in achieving the overall objectives of providing literacy support, the organisational arrangements and delivery has varied from region to region. In order to bring some consistency to the programme, the representative body of the VECs, the IVEA, and FÁS had a series of meetings to review the programme. FÁS has undertaken extensive consultation with regional staff on the matter and, together with the IVEA, brought forward proposals for a restructured programme. These proposals have now been agreed and have been circulated by FÁS to regional staff for implementation. Likewise, the IVEA agreed the programme on behalf of the VECs in consultation with them. The revised structure will ensure a more effective delivery system, improved quality assurance, and will cover the following headings: referral, partnership in delivery, consistency in provision and regional coverage, progression for the learner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3542">The new agreement stresses the importance of providing adequate supports to the individual learner and makes provision for additional tuition to be provided based on the learner's needs which will be supported by VECs and FÁS. In addition, both the VECs and FÁS are seeking ways in which the VECs can provide other supports to FÁS and to work more closely with FÁS staff and CE sponsors in developing their awareness and skills in promoting and supporting literacy with CE participants.</p>

            <p eId="para_3551">IDA Ireland's strategy for County Wexford, for the medium to long term, is to concentrate resources on the NSS hub and county town of Wexford as the location with the greatest potential to develop as a first class location for inward investment from overseas. Other towns in the county, including Enniscorthy, are expected to benefit from the greater dynamism that the NSS gateway and hub locations of Waterford, Wexford and Kilkenny can bring to the wider south-east region.

            <p eId="para_3556">IDA Ireland is the national agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment, FDI, to Ireland and its regions, while Shannon Development has responsibility for Irish industry in the Shannon region and the promotion of the Shannon free zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3557">IDA Ireland and Shannon Development are both committed to the achievement of balanced regional development. Both organisations recognise the need to provide high value employment opportunities in Clare that provide sustainable long-term jobs. The attractiveness of Clare for inward investment has to be considered in a regional context, and particularly by reference to its location on the Limerick-Shannon-Galway corridor. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the linked gateway of Limerick-Shannon and hub locations of Ennis and Tralee-Killarney. The primary needs for new investment projects can be summarised as follows: a high quality urban environment with a critical mass in population; world class access infrastructure, for example, road access to key cities and ports and international airports; telecommunications infrastructure with multiple carriers and competitive pricing with business support services; third level educational infrastructure including universities and technical institutes that are located on or close to high quality business and technology parks; and a range of affordable state of the art property solutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3558">Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the mid-west region, including County Clare, lies with Shannon Development, and IDA Ireland works closely with it in the promotion and marketing of these tailored property solutions. Shannon Development has also appointed a full-time marketing and promotion executive to promote the availability of vacant premises. Vacant space and sites are advertised locally and in appropriate periodicals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3559">The Industry Ennis group, which includes Shannon Development, IDA Ireland, Ennis Town Council, FÁS, the Clare County Enterprise Board, Ennis Chamber of Commerce and Clare Chamber of Industries, has been working to attract new industry projects to the area. As part of a planned programme, the group has established the Clare consul programme to promote the county as a location for industry, services and tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3560">Miltown Malbay has also been selected as a pilot location for the e-towns programme, launched by Shannon Development in 2004. The aim of this initiative is to help disperse economic activity and job creation to smaller population centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_3561">Shannon Development is also working with the west Clare industry and employment working group, which includes Kilrush Town Council, ESB Moneypoint, FÁS, Kilrush Chamber of Commerce and Clare County Enterprise Board, to promote west Clare as a location for industry and tourism.</p>

            <p eId="para_3563">The core recommendation in the report of the Consumer Strategy Group, which was published on 18 May 2005, is that a new national consumer agency be established. This recommendation has been accepted in principle by the Government. The establishment of the new agency will require primary legislation and my Department has already commenced preparatory work on this matter. In order to maintain the momentum of the CSG's report, earlier this month I appointed a board to the new agency to act in an interim capacity until the agency is established on a statutory footing. I am satisfied that the membership of the interim board is sufficiently representative, balanced and experienced to carry out its important work preparing for the advent of the fully fledged national consumer agency so as to ensure that the agency can hit the ground running once it is formally established by statute. Notwithstanding that the Consumers' Association of Ireland may not be formally represented on the interim board, my Department fully acknowledges and supports the valuable work carried out by the association. For the past number of years, my Department has allocated funding to the association to assist it in carrying out its work. In addition, I fully agree with the Consumer Strategy Group that the interim board and indeed the agency should work closely with State and non-State agencies such as the Consumers' Association of Ireland.</p>

Additional works are also being undertaken external to the site on the main approach road.</p>
            <p eId="para_3567">An advance technology building of 16,000 sq. ft. with 100% expansion capability is currently under construction on the park. Construction is expected to be completed in the next few months. This building is being financed and developed by a local development group under the business expansion scheme to an agreed IDA Ireland design. IDA Ireland is already actively marketing both the park and the advance technology building through its network of overseas offices and will be in a stronger position to market the park when the construction works are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3568">IDA Ireland will focus on the growth sectors of international services, health care and pharmaceuticals. In addition, the information and communications sector is likely to have potential for the county in the medium to long term. IDA Ireland will continue to work with existing clients in the county to encourage further expansion and a move to higher value activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3569">The emerging Tipperary Institute can play an important part in attracting new investment to the county by increasing the quantity and quality of students in the business and science related areas.</p>

Among the particular initiatives is farm safety week, which was conducted in April, with a range of activities organised by the farm safety partnership, an advisory committee to the Health and Safety Authority. Also among the initiatives was a programme of 400 inspections which the authority carried out nationwide during that week focusing on the four key themes of farm safety week, namely: safety for the elderly on farms; completion of farm safety self assessment document; tractor maintenance; and machine guarding, particularly power take-off, PTO, shafts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3707">In addition to the inspection campaign, a wide range of other activities has been undertaken by the authority, including: a national radio campaign over a two-week period; a safety advertisement aired in 21 livestock marts nationwide via Farm TV over a three-month period; the distribution of farm self-assessment documents; the distribution of 90,000 farm safety brochures in the <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>; and a text message alert to farmers during the week.</p>

            <p eId="para_3851">There are currently three different weekly rates of child dependant allowances payable to social welfare recipients, namely, €16.80, €19.30 and €21.60. To standardise the three main rates of allowances at the highest rate of €21.60 would mean that approximately 243,000 full-rate payments and 93,000 half-rate payments would be increased at a cost of approximately of €59 million annually.</p>
            <p eId="para_3852">The policy direction followed by successive Governments has been to concentrate resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme rather than child dependant allowances because the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3853">Child benefit is neutral <i>vis-à-vis</i> the employment status of the parents and consequently does not contribute to such potential poverty traps. The Government’s commitment in this regard is reflected in the substantial resources invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office, including the increases announced in budget 2005, which came into effect from April this year. These increases will bring the monthly rate of child benefit to €141.60 in respect of each of the first two children and €177.30 for third and subsequent children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3854">In the partnership agreement Sustaining Progress, the importance of child income support arrangements, including child dependant allowances, is recognised with a commitment to examine the effectiveness of current arrangements in ending child poverty. The question of further rationalisation of child dependant allowance will be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context and in the context of priorities generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3859">At my request, the Pensions Board is at present conducting a review of our overall pensions strategy. The review encompasses an examination of the main strategic recommendations contained in the national pensions policy initiative including those relating to the adequacy of income in retirement, coverage targets, levels of social welfare pensions, sustainability of State pensions, including public sector pensions and the tax support for private and occupational pensions. The review is also examining the question of alternative ways of addressing adequacy and coverage issues.</p>

The board will be pleased to accept and consider submissions on the review and possible ways forward. In this regard, in March it invited all interested parties to put forward their views. While a formal consultation process is not proposed at this stage, I stress that there is a representative on the Pensions Board from the Irish Senior Citizens Parliament, and groups representing older people can, if they wish, make their views known directly to the board or through their representative.</p>

            <p eId="para_3865">The most recent figures released by the Central Statistics Office on occupational and private pensions coverage relate to the first quarter of 2004. These show that 52.4% of the workforce had a private or occupational pension, including 6.3% with just a private pension. Coverage for the key target group for the national pensions policy initiative, those who are 30 years of age and over, stands at 59.1%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3866">Comparison with other EU countries is difficult because the structure of pensions systems, the relative importance attaching to different elements of the system, mainly social security and occupational, and their contribution to the incomes of retired people can vary greatly from country to country. A group of countries with near comprehensive coverage, greater than 90% of the workforce, includes Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. As outlined above, the overall coverage rate for Ireland is 52.4% and similar rates are found in countries such as Germany, Belgium and Poland. In the United Kingdom, it is estimated that 43% of the workforce are covered by an occupational or private scheme. Countries such as Italy and Portugal have very low rates of coverage, that is, less than 10%.</p>

            <p eId="para_3917">Where a person is convicted by a court of the commission of the offence of parking illegally in a disabled person's parking bay, he or she is liable to a fine not exceeding €800 for a first offence. The maximum fine for a second or subsequent offence is €1,500 and in the case of a third or subsequent offence committed within a 12-month period €1,500 and-or a prison sentence of up to three months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3918">Those levels of maximum fines were established in the Road Traffic Act 2002 and represent very significant increases over the maximum fines that could be applied to that offence under previous legislation, which were €190, £150, in respect of a first offence and €440, £350, in respect of a second or subsequent offence. This offence currently comes within the scope of the on the spot fines system and, in association with the majority of other parking offences, it attracts an on-the-spot fine of €19.</p>
            <p eId="para_3919">The Road Traffic Act 2002 provides for the replacement of the on the spot fine system with the new fixed charge system. That system currently applies to the offences of exceeding a speed limit and non-compliance with seat belt regulations. Regulations to provide for the roll-out of that system to a significant number of additional traffic and parking offences are currently being prepared by my Department in consultation with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda Síochána. This extension of the operation of the fixed charge system will include its application to the offence of illegally parking in disabled person's parking bays. The level of the charge for that offence will be pitched at a level significantly higher than that which will apply to other parking offences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3920">The operation of the fixed charge system is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda. I understand that it is expected that the new system will be available later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3959">EU Directive 2003/20, which requires that seatbelts must be used where they are fitted, must be transposed into national law by 9 May 2006. Last month's approval by the European Parliament of proposals to extend the requirement for safety belts to be fitted to all seats in all new vehicles, except for buses used on stage stop routes, opens the way for the proposals to be adopted as directives by the Council of Ministers. Assuming the proposals are adopted as directives this year, new buses, including school buses, being registered from a date in 2007 will require to be fitted with safety belts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3960">The outcome of the current investigations being held into the recent school bus tragedy will be carefully examined by myself and my colleague the Minster for Education and Science, as regards safety issues affecting school buses in particular.</p>

         asked the

        his views on the issues raised in a letter from a person (details supplied); if he will indicate the reason NCT certificates do not last two years from the date of the last test rather than a specified date relating to the car’s age regardless of when tests were carried out; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the current rules can lead to two tests for vehicles within a very short space of time and is seen as over-bureaucratic; if he or his Department have raised this issue at EU level and the outcome of same; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3962">In accordance with Directive 96/96/EC, a passenger car becomes liable for the national car test when it is four years old, that is on its fourth anniversary of first registration, and is liable for a further test every two years thereafter. In accordance with that schedule, where a car is tested other than at the specified time, the test certificate is valid from the date of the actual test until the next date on which the test is due.</p>
            <p eId="para_3963">However, in the case of a car presented for test on a day that is less than three months before the next test due, the test certificate will be valid until the second next test due date, that is, for a period up to the next test due date together with the full two years until the following test due date. I have no plans to ask the European Commission to consider the development of proposals to amend Directive 96/96/EC in respect of the timing of vehicle tests.</p>

My Department is currently awaiting the outcome of a review being carried out by Dublin Bus on how best to maximise the utilisation of its existing resources, in light of the significant investment made in bus and rail services and ongoing demographic changes. I understand from Dublin Bus that this review will be completed by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3966">In addition, discussions are currently taking place with the key stakeholders on the modernisation of the public transport regulatory framework. It remains my intention to provide a modern and robust basis for the expansion of the bus market. Both public and private companies will have a role to play in meeting the expanding demand for bus services. I remain hopeful that these discussions will reach an effective conclusion in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4231">I have comprehensively addressed the issues raised in the Deputy's question in this House on a number of occasions. In order to assist him, however, I will again explain my position.</p>
            <p eId="para_4232">Funding of anti-poverty networks arises from the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity and was originally administered by the Combat Poverty Agency on a three-year contract basis. This function transferred to my Department from that agency in late 2003. My Department sought work plans for 2004 from each of the ten national anti-poverty networks funded under the White Paper and, pending review, agreed to extend funding for 2004 on a one-year contract basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4233">As I stated in the Adjournment Debate on this issue on 26 January, my Department was established by Government in June 2002 with a mandate to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities throughout the country as they pursue their own development. In establishing my Department, it is clear that the Government was placing a focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat. In such instances, the provision of support to enable communities to identify and address problems in their own areas is seen as the best way forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_4234">Those communities may be in rural or inner city settings, grappling with difficulties caused by a range of factors, including declining populations, unemployment, language issues, social disadvantage or drug misuse. While most such communities, or groups of communities, can be defined in terms of geographic location, others will be defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue, such as unemployment, disability, lone parenting and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_4235">My Department's commitment, in the context of the national anti-poverty networks, is to focus on concentrating available resources on support for communities experiencing disadvantage, exclusion and isolation. In line with this commitment, I decided to continue funding for nine anti-poverty networks to the tune of €1.35 million for 2005. This represents a 5% increase over 2004 for the networks concerned. As I have previously indicated, however, in the context of the focusing of my Department's resources on disadvantaged communities, I believe that continued funding of the Community Workers Co-operative could not be justified.</p>
            <p eId="para_4236">The co-operative differs from the other groups funded under the national anti-poverty networks in that they deal, in the main, with specific target groups. The anti-poverty networks that will continue to receive funding have a specific focus on matters such as Travellers, unemployment, refugees and rural disadvantage. In my opinion, the Community Workers Co-operative is the voice of community workers rather than of disadvantaged communities and overlaps with the functions of other networks. As such, it fails to meet a number of the key criteria suggested by the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity. These include a membership base which ensures that the voice of disadvantaged marginalised groups will find expression in relevant national fora and the requirement that individual networks should be genuinely representative and avoid unnecessary overlaps <i>vis-à-vis</i> each other.</p>
            <p eId="para_4237">The work of the Community Workers Co-operative does not focus on, or represent the voice of, any identifiable disadvantaged group. Rather, much of its work would appear to parallel measures separately funded by my Department. There is already a well-developed structure in existence providing supports to the sector. For example, my Department will spend €2.3 million in 2005 on six regional support agencies in support of community support projects. In addition, my Department funds 38 partnership companies at a cost of €45.7 million, 185 community development projects, costing €20.1 million, and 32 community partnerships. Under the White Paper on a Framework for Supporting Voluntary Activity, 66 networks and federations, including the national anti-poverty networks, are supported to the tune of €4.2 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_4238">Since the decision was communicated on 17 December 2004, my Department has facilitated the Community Workers Co-operative by holding a series of separate meetings. These included meetings with senior officials of the Department on 11 January 2005, with me, as the responsible Minister of State, on 19 January 2005 and with the Secretary General and Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, on 9 March 2005. I am fully satisfied that the co-operative has been afforded the opportunity to exhaustively appeal the decision at ministerial and senior administrative level.</p>

In addition, in support of development projects on Sherkin Island, my Department is currently examining options to have the needs of Sherkin Island met through one of the existing agencies operating in the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_4245">Waterways Ireland has informed me that there has historically been no requirement to introduce a formal catch and release fishing policy on the canals because of a tradition among anglers to release coarse fish alive. Waterways Ireland supports this tradition and has erected signage along the canals to that effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_4246">Inspections relating to the matters referred to by the Deputy are a matter for the Central Fisheries Board, CFB. However, Waterways Ireland understands that the CFB has received a number of reports of netting and night-lining on the Grand Canal in recent times and, in that context, has carried out two inspections along the Grand Canal in the past fortnight.</p>

            <p eId="para_4265">Decisions on the disbursement of funds from dormant accounts monies are currently a matter for the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board, an independent body established under the Dormant Accounts Acts. Disbursements from the fund are designed to assist three broad categories of persons, namely, those who are socially or economically disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. Allocations made by the board must be in accordance with its disbursement plan which was approved by me in September 2003. Under the plan, the bulk of dormant accounts funding is initially being targeted at those areas designated as most disadvantaged, that is RAPID, CLÁR and drugs task force areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_4266">The board engaged Area Development Management Limited to administer this initial round of funding on its behalf, which involves the disbursement of up to €60 million from the fund. The board has, to date, approved 482 projects for funding totalling approximately €56.2 million, from the initial allocation of €60 million. In the region of €17 million of this approved amount is in respect of proposals within drugs task force areas, of which €2.3 million is specifically for projects to provide assistance in the fight against drugs.</p>

            <p eId="para_4270">No application for the CLÁR group water top-up scheme has been rendered ineligible because of ancillary costs. The situation is that my Department will only give a grant based on the contract price plus 25% maximum extra for ancillary costs. It is a matter for the group whether it can pay the difference between the grant and the actual cost of ancillary works if these are more than 25% of the contract price.</p>
            <p eId="para_4271">Under the CLÁR programme, a top-up, not exceeding €8,382 per house, is provided for group water schemes in CLÁR areas where the cost per house exceeds €7,618 and where the local authority recommends that this is the most efficient way of providing water to these houses.</p>
            <p eId="para_4272">As part of the criteria for approval of CLÁR funding, ancillary costs over the tender price, for example, for road restoration, must be kept to a minimum and must take into account the specification for temporary restoration works to be carried out by the contractor. Only costs in respect of actual damage done should be charged to the group and shall be less than 25% of the contractor's tender price. The aim is to ensure that the CLÁR funding is properly targeted at the provision of water.</p>
            <p eId="para_4273">I understand that the national rural water monitoring committee has asked for a review of the road restoration costs associated with group water schemes. I am awaiting the results of this review.</p>

            <p eId="para_4284">As laid down in Annex A of Council Directive 64/432/EEC, as amended, the officially tuberculosis-free status of a herd is suspended when an inconclusive reactor animal is disclosed in the herd and remains suspended while the herd contains such animals of unresolved status. The directive provides a derogation which allows animals from such herds to be traded on the domestic market provided they had no confirmed reactor animals for at least three years and provided that no animals from the holding are allowed to enter into intra-Community trade until the status of any inconclusive reactors has been resolved. The directive also requires that if the presence of disease is subsequently confirmed, all animals leaving the holding since the time of the last clear herd test must be traced and tested.</p>
            <p eId="para_4285">The status of the inconclusive reactor(s) can be resolved by a further test after 42 days or by post mortem and laboratory examination. If this test is clear, the officially tuberculosis-free status can be restored and animals from the herd would again be eligible for intra-Community trade provided the other conditions for export are fulfilled. All member states are obliged to comply with the provisions of EU legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4286">There is considerable research data to indicate that herds which have experienced an outbreak of confirmed TB in the past are more likely to exhibit infection again in the succeeding number of years. This supports the advisability of the policy laid down in the directive.</p>

Both applicants were contacted and, as the person named did not have entitlement to the land, a penalty of between 3% and 20% was assigned to him and the matter was resolved in favour of the other applicant. The 2004 area aid application for the person named was fully processed with a found forage area of 13.21 hectares and an adjusted forage area, after penalty, of 9.03 hectares.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">The person named submitted two applications, in respect of a total of 26 animals, under the 2004 special beef premium scheme.

            <p eId="para_4300">Following computer validation, ten of the animals included on the first application were found to be non-CMMS compliant in that they were not recorded, as required under the terms and conditions of the scheme, as being in the herd of the person named on the date of application. The person named was advised in writing of these findings and also of the appropriate regulatory penalty, namely, that the animals would not be paid premium and, due to the integrated of the bovine schemes, a reduction penalty would apply across all the bovine schemes, including the slaughter premium scheme. The person named was advised of the right of appeal. To date, however, no such appeal has been received.</p>
            <p eId="para_4301">With regard to the extensification premium, the position is that, under EU regulations, the premium is only payable on animals that have already qualified for special beef premium and/or suckler cow premium on the holding in question.

            <p eId="para_4309">The person named submitted an application in respect of three animals under the 2004 special beef premium scheme on 5 October 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_4310">Following computer validation, it was found that the three animals in question had been sold prior to the end of the regulatory two-month retention period. Under the terms and conditions of the 2004 special beef premium scheme, it was appropriate that these animals be rejected, that is, they would not be paid premium and a reduction penalty would apply to the premium payments due in respect of the other bovine applications lodged by the person named. In correspondence, the person named acknowledged that special beef premium could not be paid on the animals but argued that the proposed penalty should not be applied. However, following consideration of the case my Department agreed that the proposed penalty, applicable to the other applications, would not apply because medical evidence was supplied which confirmed that the person named was ill at the time of the sale of the animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4311">In the written reply to an earlier question by the Deputy on this case, it was inadvertently indicated that payment would issue in respect of those animals which were not kept for the retention period. However, as the animals were not retained for the entire two-month regulatory retention period, payment cannot issue. The discretion in a case such as this extends only to the regulatory penalty provided for. In this case, it was accepted, on the basis of the evidence provided by the person named, that no penalty should be applied on the other animals claimed.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_985">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4313">In my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 535 of 28 June, I outlined my general views on the points raised by the Competition Authority in its recent letter to my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4314">With regard to the specific points raised in the letter from the Competition Authority, I fully accept the need to promote competition in all sectors of the economy. In this regard, my Department proposed certain amendments some time ago as part of a reform of the existing national arrangements and, in particular, to improve the existing rules relating veterinary medicines. These included in particular measures to require veterinarians to issue prescriptions and also to provide for a wider availability at retail level of prescription only medicines, thus stimulating competition and lowering costs. I intend to include these proposals in the legislation referred to above.</p>
            <p eId="para_4315">As regards the points made in the letter relating to the transposition of the EU directive and, in particular, the provisions of the EU directive governing the prescription of veterinary medicines, I should point out that the prescription only rule for all veterinary medicines for food producing animals was introduced by the EU and not the Department of Agriculture and Food. My Department opposed this proposal in the discussions at EU level and succeeded in securing an exemption mechanism in the directive which provides for certain categories of medicines to be exempted on the basis of criteria to be adopted at EU level. Pending decisions on the criteria, existing regimes can remain in place until January 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_4316">My Department has made the case to the Commission for many of the existing range of off-prescription medicines to be granted an exemption and it would be premature to at this stage to consider an extension of the range of prescribers until this issue is resolved. If successful, this would mean that farmers could continue to purchase the relevant products from existing outlets. In the event of some or all of these products failing to qualify for an exemption, the decision on whether interests other than veterinarians should be permitted to supply prescribed veterinary medicines will be taken in consultation with the relevant authorities such as the Department of Health and Children, the Irish Medicines Board and the FSAI. My Department will, of course, follow Government policy on competition and will endeavour to ensure effective competition having regard to animal and human health considerations and the requirements of the EU directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_4317">With regard to the comments in the letter about its proposals "strengthening the close relationship which veterinarians and farmers typically enjoy", I would not characterise our approach in this way. What has been proposed is a reformulation of how prescribing rules would operate by removing some of the rigidities in the 1996 regulations so that farmers will not be burdened with the expense of repeated visits by their veterinary practitioners. As regards the profit earning potential of vets as sellers of medicines, stated Department policy is to achieve a broadening of the range of retail supply outlets and we have proposed that the licensed merchant category should for the first time be enabled to sell prescription only medicines, with certain exceptions, on foot of a veterinary prescription.</p>
            <p eId="para_4318">Having regard to the overall thrust of my Department's proposals, which is to make the prescribing regime more workable and to broaden the range of sales outlets, I find it difficult to see how our proposals will, as suggested in the letter, lead to "reduced choice and increased costs" for farmers and others. With regard to the distinction drawn in the letter between preventative and therapeutic products, we have to keep in mind that, from a public health perspective, the distinction is somewhat meaningless because both carry risks if not properly used.</p>
            <p eId="para_4319">My Department is aware of the proposals from the UK veterinary medicines directorate and will, of course, monitor developments there. I should point out, however, that the proposed UK model is not being followed in other member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_4320">With regard to prescriptions, my Department has already indicated its intention to require veterinary practitioners to issue written prescriptions and to show the cost of medicines separately from the cost of professional services. This will enable clients to better judge the value for money they are getting from various suppliers and to shop around for best value.</p>
            <p eId="para_4321">On the question of the particular product to be prescribed, my Department's approach is that the lowest cost product should be indicated consistent with the needs of the particular animal. Under the licensing regime implemented by the IMB, each medicine is allocated a VPA, veterinary product authorisation, and we would not have a difficulty with prescriptions being issued on this basis. However, there would be concerns about prescribing only an active ingredient, particularly in a situation where non-veterinarian pharmacists are permitted to fill such prescriptions. There could be serious issues relating to public health and responsibility if the wrong choice of product, which either did not adequately treat the animal or indeed damaged or killed the animal, were to be supplied.</p>
            <p eId="para_4322">In conclusion, I should point out that the main objective of the EU directive is to protect human and animal health. In transposing the directive, my intention will be to provide for the highest standards of public and animal health protection in this complex area in a way which is workable and which meets relevant EU requirements and underpins our export-orientated agriculture and food industries.</p>

        if, in view of the changeover to the single payment system, there will be any change in the number for personnel employed at inspector level in DLOs; the percentage of farmers which can expect spot inspections; if farmers will be given time to rectify any problems they may have, especially in view of the fact that no grant aid is available for those with under 20 livestock units; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4324">It is not envisaged that, in the short term, there will be any significant change in the number of personnel employed at inspector level in DLOs as the change will demand the introduction of a new inspection system, with more integrated inspections. The regulations require that 5% of all applicants must to be inspected in respect of the eligibility of the land declaration under the single payments scheme. Furthermore, it is necessary to check at least 1% of applicants under most of the cross-compliance measures, with the exception of cattle identification and registration, where at least 5% of producers must be inspected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4325">In order to minimise the level of disruption to farming, it has been decided to integrate inspections to the maximum extent possible. On this basis my Department estimates that, in all, fewer than 10,000 farmers will be visited. This represents more than a 50% reduction in the number of inspections when compared to the old coupled regime. The number of personnel required to deliver the inspection programme will be kept under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_4326">My Department has engaged in detailed discussions with the farming organisations in the context of a new charter of rights which, <i>inter alia</i>, addresses the arrangements for or from inspections and these discussions are now coming to fruition.</p>

            <p eId="para_4328">The attached table sets out the number of herds under restriction on a county by county basis for bovine tuberculosis and bovine brucellosis for the period requested. The figures show a considerable improvement in the national situation for both of these diseases since the beginning of 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_4329">The substantial improvement in the disease situation is due to a number of factors, including improved co-operation from all interested parties. I am confident that this progress can be maintained into the future with the continued operation of the existing measures and the ongoing co-operation of farmers and all involved in the livestock industry. It will be necessary, however, in the medium term to continue with the existing comprehensive control and eradication measures, which have brought about positive results in recent years in terms of reduced incidence of the disease. The position regarding an all-island disease programme is that the relevant authorities meet on an ongoing basis to discuss matters of mutual concern, including animal health issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_4495">The parliamentary question refers to the decision of the High Court on 6 March 2002 and the Supreme Court decision of 16 July 2003, and while the name of the case was not included in the parliamentary question it would appear that the question refers to the decision in Vincent Browne <i>v</i>. the Attorney General.

            <p eId="para_4496">The parameters of the decision in the Browne case were considered by the Supreme Court in the subsequent case of Thomas Kennedy <i>v</i>. the Attorney General and the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The Supreme Court, in its decision in that case of 31 May 2005, clarified the limits of its earlier decision in the Browne case and decided that EU policy can only be implemented by regulations made under an Act of the Oireachtas where the Act specifically allows for the implementation of EU policy by regulations. The Attorney General will shortly be advising the Government on action to be taken to address the issues raised in these cases.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_990">
            <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4498">I have not received a copy of the video in question, which my Department requested from the journalist concerned on 17 June. As soon as it has been furnished, it will be viewed and immediate consideration will be given to what action if any might be taken in relation to its content.</p>
            <p eId="para_4499">As I explained in my reply to Question No. 162 on 23 June, this event occurred during July 2002, almost three years ago, and involved the slaughter on-farm by the herd owner of some 4,000 pigs over a five-day period. The slaughter occurred following the discovery by Department veterinary inspectors of quantities of Carbadox on the farm, an admission by the herd owner that he had spread the substance on the floors of pig pens and the prohibition by the Department of the movement of any animals from this herd, except under specific licence from the Department, in the period preceding slaughter in order to protect public health. Carbadox is a carcinogen, cancer-causing substance, which is banned by the EU and deemed to be unsafe at any level. Prosecutions have since been issued against the herd owner, alleging a range of offences relating to the use of this feed additive and other matters, including the illegal movement of pigs from the farm. The herd owner has issued proceedings against the Department under two headings.</p>
            <p eId="para_4500">While there was no question of permitting the pigs to be slaughtered for human consumption, the Department wrote to the herd owner's solicitors on 7 May 2002 explicitly stating its willingness to allow him to pursue the option of his making arrangements, acceptable to the Department, with a dedicated plant for their slaughter. However, he elected not to pursue this option.</p>
            <p eId="para_4501">Instead, he sought permission to slaughter the pigs himself on his farm on welfare grounds. He had discussed this approach with Department veterinary inspectors and they are satisfied that he understood fully what would be involved and that he displayed both the competence and confidence to undertake the task.</p>
            <p eId="para_4502">During the five-day period, two veterinary inspectors, including an animal welfare expert, from the Department visited the farm on numerous occasions in order to assess the ongoing slaughter operation. At no stage during the slaughter process did the herd owner express concerns or disquiet on animal welfare grounds in respect of the slaughter method or seek to suspend operations on grounds of professed animal welfare concerns. A non-veterinary official of the Department, whose primary function was ensuring proper disposal of the carcases — that is, to ensure they did not enter the human food chain — was present on the farm during the five-day period in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_4503">The circumstances in this case were highly unusual. On-farm slaughter of animals in any number is an exception rather than a rule and occurs only in extreme circumstances — for example, the foot and mouth disease outbreak in Cooley — where it is not possible to move the animals to a dedicated slaughter plant or where there are compelling reasons, such as fear of disease spread, for not attempting to so do. In this particular case, the herd owner had decided to slaughter his animals on-farm and the Department considered at the time that it could not legally have forced him to have the operation conducted in a slaughter plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4504">The approach which the Department generally employs in circumstances in which it proves necessary to have numbers of animals slaughtered — for example, cattle where BSE is detected — is to have slaughter carried out at a dedicated slaughter plant.</p>

            <p eId="para_4506">Work is ongoing on the processing of applications lodged under the 2004 special beef premium scheme, with a view to establishing definitively the extent of the quota overshoot at an early date. This involves computer processing and, where errors or inconsistencies are highlighted in such validation, those cases require individual attention. Given the volumes of applications involved, it will, therefore, take further time to establish the definitive level of quota overshoot because ineligible animals and animals applied on in excess of each applicant's stocking density limit of 1.8 livestock units per hectare will have to be excluded from the overshoot calculation. All farmers with query and rejected animals will have to be written to by my Department and given an opportunity to submit observations before a final decision in their cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_4507">It is not possible, therefore, at this stage to put a value on residual payments due under the 2004 special beef premium scheme in advance of the definitive position being established regarding the extent to which the national quota has been exceeded.</p>

            <p eId="para_4509">The herd owner applied for four animals under the special beef premium scheme on 4 November 2004. On 8 December 2004, he received a letter with his cards, informing him that there was no record of these animals on the CMMS database. On 15 April 2005 a letter issued to the herd owner stating that the animals in question were being rejected because they were not updated to the CMMS database at the time of application. On 16 June 2005, another letter issued to the named person confirming that the animals had been rejected.</p>
            <p eId="para_4510">Paragraph 11 of the terms and conditions of the 2004 special beef premium states "when completing each application the producer must ensure he or she is claiming premium on eligible animals only, by checking that when lodging the application form, each animal submitted for premium, is correctly recorded on the CMMS database". My Department is not aware of the special circumstances of the applicant mentioned by the Deputy. If the herd owner submits details of the particular circumstances in question my Department will, of course, review this case.</p>

While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to six per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. In interpreting these figures, account has also to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_4579">I propose to take Questions Nos. 345 and 361 to 363, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4580">As envisaged in the programme for Government, the introduction of mandatory drug testing will play an important role in supporting future policy on drug supply and demand reduction in prisons. Prisoners accommodated in the open centres at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House and in the designated drug free areas of the training unit in the Mountjoy complex, St. Patrick's Institution and Wheatfield Prison are already required to undergo frequent drug tests to confirm their drug-free status. Mandatory drug testing will, however, operate across the entire prison system.</p>
            <p eId="para_4581">Provision for mandatory drug testing, and the penalties that may be imposed arising from a positive test, are set out in the draft new prison rules, which were published on my Department's website on 22 June. The new rules will come into force in November of this year and will operate in conjunction with a new drugs policy for the Irish Prison Service. The policy will facilitate consistent regulation and operational structure in pursuing both supply and demand reduction and will involve the implementation of further stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons. At the same time, it will lead to continued investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population and meet prisoners' treatment needs. Developing and improving the therapeutic resources available to meet the needs of drug misusers within the prison system is an ongoing process. The introduction of mandatory drug testing will result in additional costs. The precise level of the costs involved will be dependent on a number of factors and are currently being determined.</p>
            <p eId="para_4582">Drug testing has been employed in many jurisdictions, such as the UK, the US, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, that have prison systems and drug problems comparable to those pertaining in this country. The experience of these countries, and any lessons learnt, will inform the development of practice in our prisons.</p>
            <p eId="para_4583">The Irish Prison Service is committed under the national drugs strategy 2001 to 2008 to commission and carry out an independent evaluation of the overall effectiveness of the prison service's strategies in relation to drugs. This review, which will be initiated in 2007, will cover all aspects of drug services in prisons including research on the levels and routes of supply of drugs in prisons. The introduction of mandatory drug testing will play an important role in determining, for the purposes of the evaluation, the patterns, levels and types of drug use in prisons.</p>

            <p eId="para_4640">I assure the Deputy that all Garda accommodation is continually under review to ensure that it meets the operational requirements of the Garda Síochána. Where it does not, then the required refurbishment or construction works are completed by the Office of Public Works — which has responsibility for the vast majority of Garda properties — with all due urgency and in accordance with overall priorities within the Garda building programme and the availability of financial and other resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_4641">In that regard, significant funding is provided each year by the Office of Public Works for the Garda capital building programme, with an estimated €10 million allocated in 2005 alone. As indicated in my previous reply, the board has indicated that it plans to spend of the order of €112 million before the end of 2007 on a wide range of Garda projects including, for example, major works in Ballymun, Ballyshannon, Claremorris  and Ballina. This figure does not include additional funding to provide new accommodation requirements for the Garda college in Templemore arising from the increased number of recruits to bring the strength of the force up to 14,000 and various other Garda building projects. There is also a separate provision of more than €7 million in the Garda Vote in 2005 to meet ongoing maintenance of Garda stations such as painting and minor repairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4642">A survey of the Garda property portfolio was carried out on behalf of the Office of Public Works to determine and list the properties considered to be economically maintainable and those considered to be uneconomic to repair. Following that survey, the Office of Public Works last year ran a pilot equity exchange programme of eight Garda stations in Counties Limerick and Tipperary, following consultation with my Department and the Garda authorities. The programme was developed to test the feasibility of exchanging clusters of small Garda stations which cannot be viably maintained in return for new modern station facilities. It was intended to extend this programme to other small Garda stations such as Ballyvary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4643">I understand from the Office of Public Works, however, that the level of interest expressed was not adequate to meet the requirements of the programme and that the Commissioners of Public Works are now considering alternative approaches. Until the Office of Public Works has concluded its deliberations, I am not in a position to indicate when Ballyvary station will be addressed. In the meantime, the Commissioners of Public Works will undertake any essential maintenance works necessary to stations.</p>

            <p eId="para_4647">Likely costs of a contracted out service are dependent on the outcome of the competitive tendering process involved and the Deputy will appreciate that the publication of estimated costs and savings by me would compromise this process.

            <p eId="para_4648">The Deputy will appreciate that the rationale for the introduction of contracted out prisoner escort services may differ between jurisdictions.

In such exceptional cases, the report will be published but with the relevant parts deleted. If there is any such deletions rule 127(9) requires a statement to be attached to the report stating that such deletions have been made so it will be a matter of public knowledge.

While caution should be exercised in interpreting levels of crime between quarters, I am pleased to note that during my term of office as Minister, the quarterly crime rate has decreased from 6.7 per 1,000 population to 6 per 1,000 over the longer period of 11 quarters for which figures are available. This trend is reflected throughout most Garda districts in the country. In interpreting these figures, account has also to be taken of the introduction of the new PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999, which led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. The Deputy will also wish to be aware that, taking into account the significant increase in our population since 1995, the headline crime rate has fallen from 29 per 1,000 population in 1995 to 25 per 1,000 population in 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_5137">As regards Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_5138">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of all Garda stations including those referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Clearly, of course, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies particular areas with significant drugs problems and large numbers of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_5151">I have approved 13 grants to date this year in County Westmeath, totalling almost €2.7 million, under the equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06. It is anticipated that this funding will lead to the creation of 143 new child care places and will support a further 231 existing places.</p>
            <p eId="para_5152">This funding includes €1,778,150 in capital grant assistance to four community-based not for profit groups, €825,900 in staffing grant assistance to five community-based not for profit projects, which will support the projects in question to the end of 2007 and €55,081 in capital grant assistance to two private sector child care projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_5153">This commitment supplements previous commitments of more than €5.5 million in capital funding and more than €2.5 million in staffing grant assistance previously allocated to County Westmeath. It is expected that more than 1,224 new child care places, including the places referred to previously, will be created thanks to EOCP investment in County Westmeath.</p>
            <p eId="para_5154">The Deputy may be aware that, following a detailed review of the existing staffing grants under the EOCP, I recently extended the terms of the grants to the end of December 2007, to groups which have received staffing grants for a period of three or more years and continue to deliver a child care service in accordance with their pre-agreed targets. To benefit from such funding, the groups must continue to pay particular attention to the support of disadvantaged families and the implementation of a fee structure tailored to the differing economic circumstances of the client group and which ensures that child care places subsidised by the EOCP are targeted towards those most in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_5155">The Westmeath county child care committee received an allocation of €199,250 to deliver its annual action plan in 2005, while it receives an additional allocation of €20,000 to provide support services for child minders. In addition, child care services in County Westmeath may also benefit from support given to the national voluntary child care organisations to enhance quality awareness.</p>

            <p eId="para_5159">The old AIB premises at Main Street, Blanchardstown, was acquired by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the probation and welfare service on 15 April 2002. The total cost of the purchase was €1.5 million, including VAT. The intention was to renovate and extend the premises, using one portion as a local office and the other as a probation centre. However, before proceeding with the refurbishment project, due to concerns which emerged in the matter, my Department decided to review the suitability of the location in question and examine alternative options in the Blanchardstown area. In that respect, discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Office of Public Works.</p>
            <p eId="para_5160">I am advised by the Office of Public Works that minimal works have been carried out to ensure the security of the building while it is unoccupied. As regards the future of the building, I am further advised that the Commissioners of Public Works are considering the suitability of the premises for use by other Government Departments.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_1035">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_5164">I assume the question refers to the framework tender competition conducted by my Department in January 2005, the purpose of which was to procure suitable service providers to carry out future repatriation charter flights in respect of the removal of persons who are illegally residing in the State. The competition was conducted in accordance with national and European Union procurement procedures and was widely advertised at the time, including in the Official Journal of the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_5165">The tender was not an invitation to supply specific flights at predetermined prices. Rather, it was a specification based competition, which sought to identify suitably qualified service providers based on certain competencies which my Department and the Garda national immigration bureau identified and considered essential for this type of operation. The tender was awarded on the basis of the tendering parties reaching or exceeding those specifications. In this regard, there was no deviation from the award criteria set out in the tender request.</p>
            <p eId="para_5166">The specification sought service providers with the ability to act as principal in any contract and add value to the process by bringing about risk reduction through the provision of adequate operational support, aircraft safety certification, guarantees secured against the assets of the company on replacement aircraft in case of technical or financial failure and appropriate insurance cover, including calamity insurance, etc. These are all requirements considered essential by the Department for the safe, effective and secure operation of such flights, taking account of the need to reduce the State's exposure to claims arising from identifiable risks where these can be eliminated or reduced through appropriate risk management measures and insurance cover. It is not, therefore, a question of the cheapest price but of achieving value for money by meeting these essential standards and having regard to the price offered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5167">The company appointed following a detailed examination of the tenders received is a large UK based service provider, Air Partner PLC, with considerable experience and expertise in this type of work. As flights are required, the company is contacted for quotes for suitable aircraft and support services for a specific operation on a particular date. The company normally provides a range of options and the cheapest is usually accepted having regard to the suitability of the aircraft offered and other criteria such as the cancellation-postponement terms attaching.</p>

            <p eId="para_5300">I have been further informed that local Garda management does not propose to extend the opening hours of any of the Garda stations in the Clare division. It states that the extension of the current opening hours at any of these stations would necessitate the employment of additional personnel on indoor administrative duties who may be more effectively employed on visible outdoor policing duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_5301">Local Garda management also reports that there are currently no Garda stations in County Clare which are not occupied other than by the green man. Each Garda station has been allocated Garda personnel. Each sub-district station is equipped with a green man, which is linked directly to the local district headquarters for use by the public when the member assigned to such a station is on patrol or on rostered rest days.</p>
            <p eId="para_5302">In relation to Garda resources generally, I am pleased the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_5303">The Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Clare division will be fully considered in the context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies, in particular, areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One promise I have already made is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high visibility policing and will have a real impact.</p>

I am further informed that disclosure of results of any analysis which focused on particular counties or Garda divisions could interfere with the operation of ongoing investigations. This is because for some years the results for many counties or divisions would be zero or one and disclosure would have the effect of identifying individuals, when an investigation commenced and whether the Criminal Assets Bureau is conducting investigations. The Deputy will appreciate that this would be wholly undesirable.</p>

            <p eId="para_5311">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that local drug task forces were established in 1997 on the basis of certain criteria which considered among other issues, levels of social disadvantage and Garda crime statistics. These criteria ensures that these areas received a high priority in relation to the allocation of Garda resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5312">Since the publication of the national drugs strategy in May 2001, resources in Garda stations covering local drug task force areas have been monitored. For the purpose of this process the year 2001 is used as the benchmark year. As can be seen from the table below there was an increase of 17 gardaí assigned to stations covering local drug task force areas for the period covering January 2001 to January 2002, which was the first year of the Government's national drug strategy. The most recent comparison covering May 2005 shows an additional 218 gardaí have been assigned to such stations, compared with January 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_5546">Two community policing fora have already been established in the context of the national drugs strategy. These are operating on a pilot basis under the aegis of the north inner city and Finglas-Cabra local drugs task forces. My position on this matter is that the establishment of community policing fora in general needs to be delivered in the context of an appropriate policy framework for what will be relatively new partnership structures involving the Garda, local authorities and local communities to deal with a range of issues of mutual concern. Such a framework will ensure that community policing fora are developed in an appropriate, consistent and properly planned manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_5547">Work is well under way on the development of such a policy framework. The Garda Síochána Bill 2004 represents the most significant legislative reform of Garda structures since the foundation of the State. Included in its provisions are mechanisms for enhanced co-operation between the Garda and local authorities through the establishment, on a statutory basis, of joint policing committees. It is intended that such committees will provide a forum where the Garda Síochána, local authorities and other appropriate bodies can co-operate and work together to address local policing and other issues. It is also intended that these policing committees will facilitate the establishment of local policing fora to address specific issues in local areas, including drugs issues. The further development of community policing fora in each local drug task force area will be considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_5548">On 12 May last I announced the establishment of an implementation advisory group, under the chairmanship of Senator Maurice Hayes, in a move to facilitate the timely implementation of the provisions of the Garda Síochána Bill. Its terms of reference include the development of guidelines to enable the establishment of joint policing committees and the group has been requested to report to me on progress not later than six months after the enactment of the Bill.</p>

            <p eId="para_5550">The Irish Prison Service continually monitors the effectiveness of its drug policies and already has a good knowledge of the levels and routes of supply of drugs in prison. Pending the implementation of the new drugs policy, which I intend to publish in the near future, it would be premature to undertake a wide-ranging review of all aspects of drug services in prisons. I have decided that the better course of action would be to undertake such a review when the new policy has been in place for a sufficient period of time, which will allow for meaningful evaluation of current practice and policy. It is intended that the review will be initiated in 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_5559">As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs, was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs, such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties, are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5560">The special educational needs, SEN, of the pupil in question fall within the high incidence disability categories and his needs can, therefore, be catered for from within the school's general allocation. This school's teaching allocation under the new general allocation model is 12.5 part time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs who will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5561">The school can use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one to one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. It is often best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to separate rooms because the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5572">I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 423 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5573">All vehicles operating under the school transport scheme are required to meet the statutory regulations as laid down by the Department of Transport. Where vehicles have over eight adult seats and are more than one year old, they are required to pass that Department's annual roadworthiness test. In addition, Bus Éireann vehicles are subject to a programme of scheduled servicing under specified maintenance procedures to ensure that the highest safety standards are achieved. Contractors employed by Bus Éireann are contractually obligated to keep their nominated vehicle is a safe and roadworthy condition at all times.</p>
            <p eId="para_5574">The average age of the Bus Éireann large capacity school bus, which represents about 20% of the vehicles used for school transport, is 16 years and the average age of all vehicles used for school transport is 11.5 years. An older bus — which has passed the annual roadworthiness test — does not mean an unsafe bus. No bus which is unsafe or dangerous is allowed on to the road to carry children.</p>
            <p eId="para_5575">The loading of all school buses is determined by the relevant sections of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations which are laid down by the Department of Transport. The licensed carrying capacity of all vehicles engaged in school transport is based on a ratio of three pupils for every two adult seats, in accordance with relevant legislation. The Minister of State with responsibility for school transport and I have decided to phase out the three for two seating arrangement on school buses over the next three years, starting next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_5576">Bus Éireann school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor and may be subject to ongoing medical review. All such drivers must hold current driving licences appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. The company also provides training to bring drivers up to the requisite standard, if necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5577">In addition, Bus Éireann school bus drivers must pass a driving assessment conducted by specially trained and qualified Bus Éireann inspectors. Vehicle familiarisation with different types of school buses is carried out on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5578">Bus Éireann school bus drivers have also attended a disability awareness training course specially designed to take account of the requirements of children with special needs who travel under the school transport scheme. This course is ongoing at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_5579">Contractors' school bus drivers are required to undergo a pre-employment medical examination by a nominated doctor, and may be subject to ongoing medical review by the chief medical officer of CIE. It is a condition of the contract agreement that no person shall be allowed to drive a school bus if, having been requested, they refuse to submit for medical examination or if they are certified unfit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5580">All contractors must hold current driving licences appropriate to the size of vehicles they are required to drive. Bus Éireann maintains a record of driving licences on file for all nominated contractors. Bus Éireann has facilitated contractors and their school bus drivers who drive services under the school transport scheme for children with special needs to attend the ongoing disability awareness training course organised for the company's own personnel. Contractors, as independent private bus operators, may at their own discretion provide additional training for their employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_5581">EU Directive 2003/20 requires seat belts to be used where they are fitted. This directive must be transposed into national law by 9 May 2006. Separately, proposals to extend the requirement for seat belts to be fitted in all new vehicles except for city buses used in stage stop routes have been developed at EU level. When the directive is adopted, all new school buses being registered from a future date, yet to be determined, will require to be fitted with seat belts. It is not expected that this directive will provide for any mandatory retrofitting of seat belts in existing buses.</p>
            <p eId="para_5582">The provision of seat belts on school buses, will have to be introduced on a phased basis having regard to the logistical difficulties involved in sourcing right-hand drive buses equipped with any appropriate seat belts. The issue of the type, or types, of seat belt to be fitted must be determined having regard to the differing sizes of the student passengers being carried.</p>
            <p eId="para_5583">The Department is working closely with the Department of Transport and Bus Éireann on this issue and any decisions reached will be guided by expert advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_5585">The Department does not have an application for an extension from the school to which the Deputy refers. However, a new planning model for educational infrastructure was recently introduced to ensure that in future school provision will be decided after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, trustees, parents, sponsors of prospective schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5586">The main feature of the new model, being introduced initially on a pilot basis in five specific areas, is the publication of a draft area development plan which will set out a blueprint for education infrastructure in a particular area into the future. The components of the draft area development plan are: details of existing primary and post-primary provision; examination of the demographics of the area; commentary on the data; and recommendations for the area into the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_5587">Following publication of each draft area development plan, the commission on school accommodation will conduct a public consultation process to which all interested parties can make submissions. All of these submissions will be published. The process in each case will culminate in the publication of a final area development plan against which all capital funding decisions will be made over the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_5588">The needs of the school to which the Deputy refers are being considered through the process outlined because it forms part of one of the pilot area development plans. The commission on school accommodation has completed the public consultation process for this particular plan and it hopes to be in a position to publish its final report shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_5590">Children with acknowledged special needs are generally identified through the psychological services of the health service and of the voluntary bodies prior to the enrolment of such children in primary schools. Children who manifest very special needs in school and who have not been previously assessed by a psychologist and are brought to the attention of a NEPS psychologist by the principal teacher, will normally be assessed by the psychologist within that school term.</p>
            <p eId="para_5591">NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_5592">As the end of the 2004-05 school year approaches, NEPS management is conducting a survey to ascertain how many children have been through the staged assessment process in school but who still need individual psychological assessments. As soon as the information has been collated, every effort will be made to ensure that urgent assessment needs will be met as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5593">In the case of schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them, such schools have access to educational psychological assessments through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA. Under this scheme, schools can commission assessments from a member of the panel of private practitioners approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the fees directly to the psychologists concerned. Details of this scheme, including the conditions that apply to it, are available on the Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5594">As arrangements for assessments under the SCPA scheme are made between school principals and individual private practitioners, information on the average waiting time for such psychological assessments is not available in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_5596">A major focus for the Department is the roll out of broadband Internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools. This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry, following the establishment of a three-year, €18 million joint Government-IBEC-TIF fund. The broadband connectivity is being provided via a schools national broadband network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, e-mail, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process. A broadband support service is being provided by the NCTE to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.</p>
            <p eId="para_5597">Following a competitive tender process, the Department has now finalised and signed contracts with the six companies selected for the provision of access connectivity and with the other company selected for the provision of routers. The schools national broadband network and the service desk have been established and are operational. The initial stages of the roll out of connectivity locally to schools has already commenced and the roll out is due to be completed by March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_5598">The estimated cost of the schools broadband access programme — incorporating the local connectivity at school level, the national schools broadband network and the service desk, including the initial set-up and ongoing costs over the next three years — is some €30 million. Within that context, the estimated full-year running cost of the programme is some €7 million.</p>

            <p eId="para_5637">A new general allocation scheme has been announced under which schools will be provided with resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures, to cater for children with high incidence special needs such as dyslexia and those with learning support needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5638">The local special educational needs organiser has determined that the special educational needs of the pupil in question fall within the high incidence disability categories and his needs can, therefore, be catered for from within the school's general allocation. The general allocation for the school in question is one full-time post and 2.5 part-time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5639">The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one to one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The type of response needed depends on the child.</p>

Under the 2001 Act, a local authority, for these purposes, is defined as meaning a county council, city council or town council. The majority of members of vocational education committees are drawn from membership of local authorities. A Senator could not become a member of a vocational education committee through this avenue.

            <p eId="para_5645">School facilities should be available to the community outside of school hours — whether for child care, adult education courses or as somewhere for local community groups to meet — provided this is feasible. My Department issued a circular to the trustees, boards of management and principals of primary and voluntary secondary schools in March encouraging them to make their facilities available to local community groups outside of school hours. Many schools have an excellent record of doing so and have become hives of local activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_5646">However, the State does not own the vast majority, more than 95%, of our schools. Most are owned by the religious. They are owned by their trustees and managed by their boards of management, whose right it is to decide on the use of school facilities outside of school time, subject to the terms of any existing lease on the property.</p>
            <p eId="para_5647">There is no doubt that are benefits for both the community and the school of enabling access to school facilities outside of school hours. While the advantages for the community are obvious, benefits for the school include increased willingness of local groups to provide placement for work experience or outlets for community service. Before permitting after-hours use, school authorities should be satisfied that adequate insurance is in place to cover the activities in question and that the proposed use does not interfere in any way with the delivery of education in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5648">Schools' running costs are met by my Department's scheme of capitation grants. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of schools, including heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges. The costs incurred while the premises are being used outside of school hours should be recouped by the school from the groups hiring or otherwise availing of the facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5649">Regarding funding available, in particular, to child care providers who may, by local agreement, use school facilities, the Deputy should be aware of the funding announced by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last week that child care providers may access.</p>
            <p eId="para_5650">My Department's role would be in the area of support for youth clubs when providing young people with positive social outlets. Funding is provided to youth clubs under the local youth clubs grant scheme, which is administered by the vocational education committees. The purpose of these grants is to assist youth clubs in meeting the ongoing costs of their activities such as insurance, maintenance costs, etc., and to aid special youth work initiatives, particularly those aimed at disadvantaged young people.</p>

            <p eId="para_5654">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio and in average class size in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23:9, down from 26:6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04.</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">Over 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. In allocating teaching posts, regard has been had to the commitments of the Government to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for pupils with special educational needs. The additional teaching posts created since 1997 have been deployed to address all of these priorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">A review of the allocation system of teaching support for pupils with special educational needs was recently completed. Arising from that review a new model has been introduced to replace that which was notified to schools in June 2004. The introduction of this new system will involve the provision of an estimated additional 340 permanent posts in primary schools from September next. A further 320 posts are being provided on a temporary basis to facilitate the transition to the new system and to ensure continuity of service for children who have previously been given an individual allocation until those children leave the primary school system. The new system will greatly benefit schools and the children in schools that need additional support.</p>
            <p eId="para_5657">I recently launched the new action plan — Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools — for educational inclusion. This plan will result in reduced class sizes in schools serving the most disadvantaged communities to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_5659">In recent years, many improvements have been made to enable principal teachers in primary schools to perform their administrative duties. Until the 1999-2000 school year, principals were released from teaching duties to become administrative principals where the school had a staffing of eight or more mainstream class teachers. From the commencement of the 2000-01 school year, administrative principals were appointed to ordinary schools with seven mainstream class teachers and in schools with a principal plus 11 or more teachers, including ex quota posts. Since the 2002-03 school year, administrative principals may be appointed to schools where there is a principal plus nine or more teachers, including ex quota posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_5660">Arising from the implementation of the PCW agreement, significant improvements were introduced to the management structure of primary schools through the allocation of additional posts of responsibility. It is a matter for the boards of management of schools to delegate functions to post of responsibility holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5661">My Department is engaged in the development of a computerised on-line system for the submission of claims for the payment of certain categories of teachers. This system, when implemented, is expected to further assist principal teachers in the performance of their administrative duties. In response to concerns raised relating to the administrative burden placed on schools and the effect this places on administrative principals, I have already started a process of review of the administrative burden imposed on schools arising from departmental and legislative requirements. We can collectively seek opportunities to ensure that this burden is kept to the minimum, consistent with achieving the worthwhile and essential objectives of legislation in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5662">The core purpose of the review I have set in motion is to focus sharply upon administrative processes and consequent administrative burdens which arise within the school as a result of regulations and/or departmental requirements and to consider what scope exists for alleviating these or having them performed in a more efficient and less demanding manner from the perspectives of the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">In March, my Department wrote to the various representative bodies inviting them to consider where and in what way present processes can be improved upon. My Department will work closely with all the parties involved to find meaningful solutions in respect of this important issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_5665">The new action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality Of Opportunity In Schools, which I launched recently provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme which will bring together and build upon several existing interventions for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5666">The new action plan will be introduced on a phased basis in the next school year and will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. Approximately 600 primary schools and 150 post-primary schools will be identified for participation in the school support programme arising from the identification process and these will be targeted for particular support over the next five years. The programme services will be extended to all urban-town primary schools and second level schools participating in it and not already benefiting from these services. Integration of school completion programme services into the school support programme framework will be effected over the five-year implementation timeframe.</p>

The report of the review group stated that the proposal, which involves the disposal of an existing property in Clonmel and the building of alternative facilities without incurring any Exchequer funding, has merit. My Department has recently given the Tipperary rural and business development institute approval to proceed with seeking expressions of interest from private sector property developers to determine exactly what could be provided at Ballingarrane in exchange for the institute's current property in Clonmel.</p>

            <p eId="para_5698">As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs, was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5699">This is a major improvement on the previous system, under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time-consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year, so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</p>
            <p eId="para_5700">Under the new arrangement disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources, as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. A total of 340 of these are permanent posts and 320 are temporary posts provided to ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow the school to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5701">The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under these new arrangements. In fact the reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5702">Addressing the concerns of small and rural schools was, as the Deputy will be aware, the reason I initiated a review of the original general allocation model which had been announced last year, to come into effect in the 2005 to 2006 school year. Following this review, a special improved ratio for small schools has been introduced to ensure they are given resource teaching hours on a more favourable basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5703">As of next September there will be more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to under 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs. The Government, and I as Minister for Education and Science are deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special educational needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_5730">There are currently 308 special needs assistants (SNAs), employed in 80 primary schools in County Kildare on my Department's payroll. It is not possible to say how many of these SNAs will have their contracts renewed for the new school year. The situation in relation to the retention of SNAs by schools can vary from school to school depending on the needs of the individual children and whether or not the children are due to leave school at the end of this school year. Responsibility for the recruitment and employment of SNAs rests with the relevant school authorities and it is a matter for the school authorities to inform SNAs employed by them of the situation for the 2005 to 2006 school year. My Department is currently drafting sample contracts in consultation with management and union representatives. These will be made available to the management bodies as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5731">My Department has recently issued a letter to schools who have surplus SNA staff which contained guidelines for schools in selecting staff that should be let go. The letter confirmed that the selection criteria for determining whose contract should be terminated will be on a last in, first out, LIFO, basis, subject to the contractual position pertaining in schools. This means that unless the most junior SNA in the school has a written child-specific contract that entitles her or him to remain in the school, her or his contract should be terminated on the basis that she or he is the most junior SNA in the school in terms of length of service. If however the school has operated on the basis of employing all SNAs on child specific contracts and offered such contracts to the SNAs, it is the SNA who is attached to the child who has been identified as no longer needing the services of an SNA that should be released. A copy of this letter has also been published on my Department's website <i>www.education.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_5732">My Department had been engaged in discussions with the trade union representing special needs assistants, SNAs, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on a number of issues relating to the employment of SNAs, including the matters raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5733">These discussions have now concluded. One of the proposals that has been accepted by both parties is to agree to enter into negotiations at an early date with a view to devising a suitable system for redeployment having regard to the complexities involved. It would be the objective that this process be finalised for the end of the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5734">Applications for SNA support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education which processes all applications for support from schools and communicates the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for SNAs that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5735">The Deputy will be aware that this Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from less than 300 to more than 6,000 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</p>

Organising such provision is a significant task of the National Council for Special Education.</p>
            <p eId="para_5738">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003.

            <p eId="para_5740">I understand the pupil in question has been offered an educational placement in two special schools in County Kildare but that her parents would prefer if she went to a different special school, which has not accepted her enrolment application. Enrolment decisions are the responsibility of the board of management of each school. The Department has no role in processing applications for enrolment by schools. However, section 29 of the Education Act 1998 provides parents with an appeal process where a board of management of a school or a person acting on behalf of the board refuses enrolment to a student. Where a school refuses to enrol a pupil, the school is obliged to inform parents of their right under section 29 of the Education Act 1998 to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of my Department. Where an appeal under section 29 is upheld, the Secretary General of my Department may direct a school to enrol a pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_5741">The local special educational needs organiser, SENO, can help parents to secure an appropriate placement for their child. Contact details of the relevant SENO are available on my Department's website. The National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, is a further statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01 8738700.</p>

However, the Deputy will be aware that my Department has made a number of interventions in the areas concerned in recent years to ensure that there are adequate pupil places to meet demand. Specifically, the management authority of St. Patrick's post primary school, County Kildare VEC, is currently progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupils. An extension project is under construction at St. Mary's College which will increase capacity at that school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Meanscoil Iognaid Ris and further accommodation needs at the school are currently in planning. In Kilcock an extension project at Scoil Dara was recently completed which has increased capacity to 875 pupils. In addition, the following extension projects have been authorised to progress to tender and construction in the coming months — Newbridge College, Maynooth post-primary and St. Farnan's, Prosperous.</p>
            <p eId="para_5746">All of these initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_5749">I propose to take Questions Nos. 453 and 454 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5750">As the Deputy is aware, a new scheme for allocating resource teachers to schools to cater for the needs of children with high incidence special needs and learning support needs was announced last month. The reason for the new scheme is simple. Children with special needs such as dyslexia or mild learning difficulties are found in almost every school. It makes sense then that every school should have a number of resource teaching hours based on the number of pupils in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5751">This is a major improvement on the previous system under which children with high incidence special needs required a psychological assessment before they were given resource teaching hours by the Department. This was a time consuming process that often led to delays in children getting the support they needed. Resource teachers will now be in place in the school from the start of the school year so that children who need their assistance can get it straight away.</p>
            <p eId="para_5752">Under the new arrangement disadvantaged schools, boys schools and mixed schools get extra resources as research shows that pupils in these schools are more likely to have learning difficulties. Under the new model a new ratio has been introduced for small schools with a lower appointment ratio for the first full post for each type of small school.</p>
            <p eId="para_5753">As differing pupil-teacher ratios apply to boys' schools, mixed schools and girls' schools for the purposes of the general allocation system, a small school in the case of boys' schools is defined as a school with fewer than 135 pupils, in the case of a mixed schools as a school with fewer than 145 pupils and in the case of a girls' school as a school with fewer than 195 pupils. Small boys' schools will now qualify for their first post at 100 pupils. Small mixed schools will qualify for their first post at 105 pupils. Small girls' schools will qualify for their first post at 150 pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_5754">All allocations up to the point for the first full post will be made on a <i> pro rata</i> basis. If a small boys school has just 50 pupils, for example, it will get 0.5 of a post. The allocations between the point of the first full post and the cut off enrolment point for small schools will stay at one post, that is, a small boys school with between 100 and 135 pupils will get one full post. These changes represent a substantial improvement for small schools on the original model.</p>
            <p eId="para_5755">To ensure that every school has enough resource teaching hours to meet the needs of its pupils, an extra 660 resource teaching posts are being put in place for next September. Some 340 of these are permanent posts and 320 are temporary posts being provided to ensure that children who had been given an individual allocation of resource teaching hours by my Department will keep these in situations where the general allocation to the school would not be sufficient to allow the school to provide these hours from within its general allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5756">The provision of these temporary posts will ensure that no child who has been allocated a specific number of hours with a resource teacher by my Department will lose these under these new arrangements. The reality is that the majority of schools are gaining resource teaching hours under the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5757">I stress that despite misleading claims to the contrary, the new scheme does not prevent schools from giving one-to-one time with a resource teacher to any child who needs such support. Rather, it ensures that each school has enough resources to ensure that each child gets a level of support appropriate to their individual needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5758">The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_5759">While the new scheme will not prevent schools from giving one-to-one time with the resource teacher to children that need it, it is important to note that one-to-one teaching is not the best option for every child. It is also the case that pupils with lower incidence special needs, such as autism, will continue to be catered for on an individual application basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5760">As of next September, there will be more than 5,000 teachers in our primary schools working directly with children with special needs, including those requiring learning support. This compares to fewer than 1,500 in 1998. One out of every five primary school teachers is now working specifically with children with special needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5761">It is anticipated that a review of the general allocation model will be undertaken after two years of operation. However, in regard to disadvantaged schools the position may be reviewed at an earlier stage in the context of the development of a new policy framework for educational inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5762">The Government and I, as Minister for Education and Science, are deeply committed to improving services for children with special needs. In addition to the massive increase in resource teachers in recent years, the introduction of this new general allocation scheme will ensure a faster and more flexible response for children with special needs.</p>

            <p eId="para_5764">My Department has sanctioned the following provision for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems at primary school level: eight special classes for pupils with emotional behavioural problems; six special classes for pupils with severe emotional behavioural problems; two special classes for pupils with ADHD in mainstream primary schools. All such classes operate at a pupil teacher ratio, PTR, of 8:1 with the support of a minimum of one special needs assistant. Classes for children with more severe disorders operate at a PTR of 6:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_5765">In addition, there are 12 special schools for pupils with emotional disturbance. The special educational needs of the children in question can be addressed in special dedicated schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupil. Many pupils with the conditions in question are capable of attending ordinary schools on an integrated basis with the support, where necessary, of the resource teacher and-or special needs assistant services. Where the level of the disorder is of a more serious nature, provision is made by way of special schools or special classes attached to ordinary schools. It is my intention to continue to build on these developments so as to ensure that all children, including children with emotional and behavioural problems, receive the support they require.</p>
            <p eId="para_5766">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. The NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs from 1 January 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5767">Where a pupil with special educational needs enrols in a primary or post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to the local SENO for additional teaching support and-or special needs assistant support for the pupil. I am confident the establishment of the NCSE will prove of major benefit in ensuring that all children with special educational needs receive the support they require when and where they require it.</p>

            <p eId="para_5787">My officials have been advised by the NCSE that an application has been received for individual resource teaching support and special needs assistant report for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The local SENO has sanctioned five hours special needs assistant support for the pupil in question and the school authorities have been notified accordingly. The situation will be reviewed again in September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5788">On resource teaching support, the SENO has determined that the special educational needs, SEN, of the pupil in question falls within the high incidence disability categories and her needs therefore can be catered for from within the school's general allocation. The general allocation for the school in question is 17.5 part time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs. The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school to ensure that all their needs are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5789">Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others, however, do better when taught in small groups. Often it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_5827">*Under the arrangements for the multi-annual capital programme, €50 million of the voted capital expenditure for 2004 was carried over by my Department to be spent in 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5828">Prior to 2004 funds unspent by the Department were surrendered to the Exchequer. From 2004 unspent capital moneys capped at 10% of that year's allocation were permitted to be carried forward to the following year. My Department carried forward €50 million capital moneys from 2004 to 2005 and these funds have now been spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_5829">The Deputy should note that the proportion of the budget in the Department of Education and Science that was underspent between 1997 and 2004 represented just 1.5% of the Department's cumulative budget of more than €35 billion during that time. Underspending and overspending can occur in parts of any Department's budget for several reasons. In relation to underspending in my Department's budget, looking at even just the past two years illustrates the inaccuracy of some of the remarks made in the media recently about underspending.</p>
            <p eId="para_5830">In 2003 and 2004, the majority of the underspending returned to the Department of Finance by my Department is accounted for by ESF receipts received late in the year. As the ESF receipts had not been received by late in the year, my Department prudently sought a Supplementary Estimate to cover the possibility that these might not be received before year end to avoid an overspend in the Department's accounts for the year. When the ESF receipts came through before year end in 2003 and 2004, they were then naturally passed on to the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">Some €45 million of the €95 million returned to the Department of Finance in 2004 and €37 million of the €51 million returned in 2003 was thus made up of ESF receipts received late in the year. As the Deputy will be aware, the point of the Supplementary Estimates process is to provide Oireachtas approval for whatever additional funding is required to avoid an excess, such as in a situation where expected ESF receipts might not arrive before year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">Towards year end the Department, in almost all cases, has fully spent, or will spend, the approved allocations for the year but the combination of uncertainties over some demand-led areas combined with uncertainty over when ESF receipts will arrive require that for prudential reasons a Department must have Oireachtas authority for either eventuality, and thus have a certain level of underspending.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">The fact that some expenditure is necessarily demand-led is another factor that should not be overlooked. The eventual cost of demand-led expenditure items such as pensions or the student support schemes, for example, is obviously impossible to estimate with absolute accuracy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5834">The application for capital funding from the school to which the Deputy refers was assessed against the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects which were revised last year following consultation with the education partners. Under this review all projects were assigned a band rating and the progress of individual projects is being considered in the context of the school building programme 2005-09.</p>

            <p eId="para_5838">As the Deputy is aware, my Department has issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their teaching allocation under the new general allocation model for the 2005-06 school year. The letter also includes details of any clustering arrangements that may apply. The three schools in question have been arranged in different cluster arrangements under the new model.</p>
            <p eId="para_5839">One of the objectives of the general allocation model is to maximise the extent of full-time permanent posts available to support the needs of pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs and learning support teacher requirements. Clustering facilitates the assignment of experienced teachers as well as allowing for better training of resource teachers on the basis that permanent posts will retain teachers for longer periods. This ultimately benefits the pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_5840">To this end, schools, particularly those with small enrolments, have been grouped in clusters where possible. In general, the permanent post allocation clustering arrangements cannot be altered unless in exceptional circumstances such as geographical location.</p>
            <p eId="para_5841">Part-time hours have been provided to schools in cases where it was not possible to form a cluster of general allocation hours. Schools allocated part-time permanent hours may be aware of a local school or schools with part-time permanent hours that when combined could form a full-time permanent post. It is open to any such schools wishing to form a cluster by combining these hours to contact my Department's special education section in writing with details of their proposal. It should be noted that these arrangements apply to staffing associated with the general allocation model only.</p>
            <p eId="para_5842">Where it is not possible for schools to form permanent posts under the general allocation model, such schools may, for the purposes of creating temporary full-time posts, form clusters to combine permanent part-time hours allocated under the general allocation model with hours allocated for individual children with low incidence disabilities, or transitional hours retained for children with high incidence disabilities. Again, any schools wishing to form such temporary full-time posts should contact my Department's special education section in writing with details of their proposal. This arrangement will apply for the 2005-06 school year only and is being facilitated on the understanding that, as pupils with an individual allocation of hours leave the school at the end of that school year, the full-time temporary posts will be adjusted to the appropriate reduced level of part-time hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_5843">The schools in question have submitted a proposal regarding a revision of the clustering arrangements notified to them. The proposal involves dissolving the cluster arrangements notified to them and creating a new permanent teaching post among the three schools. My officials are currently examining the proposal and will be in further contact with the school authorities as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_5844">My Department is also finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate. It is intended that this circular will issue at an early date. It is also intended that this circular will address issues that have been raised by schools with my Department since the system was notified to schools in mid-May.</p>

            <p eId="para_5846">Drug prevention education is currently one component of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme of pre-service education for all primary student teachers in each college of education. For post primary student teachers, the SPHE programme is offered as an elective on the higher diploma in education.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">While initial teacher training provides graduates with the knowledge and skills required to deliver the curriculum, my Department provides a range of opportunities and supports to teachers to enable them to keep up to date. Drug prevention is well addressed within these.</p>
            <p eId="para_5848">The primary curriculum support programme, PCSP, delivered a two-year in-service programme in 2001-02 and 2002-03 to all primary school teachers on the implementation of the new social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum for primary schools which includes the area of substance use.</p>
            <p eId="para_5849">Throughout 2003-04 and 2004-05, the support programme continued to offer dedicated support to all schools. During this two-year period the programme also provided additional support through afternoon seminars, evening programmes for school policy committees consisting of parents' representatives and designated teachers and additional school visits. In addition workshops and information evenings were provided nationally through the network of education centres. The PCSP website, <i> www.pcsp.ie</i>, provides a range of documents to support the implementation of the SPHE curriculum in schools. The PCSP regional curriculum support service will continue to provide ongoing advice and support to schools in the coming school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5850">The Walk Tall programme was established in 1996 to support schools nationally. Since 2001 this programme supports all 14 local drugs task force area schools — 325 primary schools — special schools — and runs in conjunction with the SPHE support programme. The Walk Tall programme has three full-time personnel supporting teachers to implement the programme in the context of SPHE curriculum. In addition, the programme provides evening courses for schools in the local drugs task force areas and this summer it will offer 18 courses as part of the national summer course training programme for primary school teachers. The Walk Tall materials are available to all schools nationally free of charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_5851">At post-primary level, substance use is one of the ten modules of the SPHE curriculum for junior cycle students. SPHE has been a requirement within the junior cycle programme since September 2003. The SPHE support service, established in 2000, as a partnership between the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Health and Children and the health boards continues to support schools in the implementation of the SPHE programme with 13 full-time personnel, including one with a specific brief to provide additional support to schools in local drugs task force areas on substance use. On My Own Two Feet is a class-room materials resource for substance-use education in the context of the SPHE programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5852">The SPHE support service provides an extensive range of in-service activities and supports to post-primary teachers. These include specific workshops on substance use and support for school-based substance use policy development. This programme of in-service will continue to be offered in the coming year. Further information on the SPHE curriculum, a school handbook for SPHE and the programme of inservice offered to all schools in the coming school year can be found on the SPHE website, <i>www.sphe.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_5853">All schools are required to develop a substance use policy in line with action 43 of the national drugs strategy. Monitoring of progress regarding the implementation of this action is planned by my Department.</p>

My officials have been advised by the NCSE that the local SENO has processed the application for resource teaching support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. The pupil in question has been sanctioned 3.5 individual resource teaching hours. The school authorities were notified accordingly on 22 June 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_5857">As the Deputy is aware, special needs assistants, SNAs, are assigned to schools to meet the care needs of individual children who have been assessed by a psychologist as needing this type of support. Applications for SNA support are now dealt with by the National Council for Special Education which processes all applications for support from schools and communicate the decisions directly to the schools. At this stage, the council has dealt with all new applications from schools for SNAs that will be required from the beginning of September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5858">However, in order to ensure that resources are used in the most effective manner, a review has been conducted in recent months to establish whether primary schools have the level of SNA support that they need for children in their care, whether they have resources which they no longer need or whether they need extra resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5859">The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the SNA was originally sanctioned, that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus SNA support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5860">A review of SNAs support has recently been completed in the school referred to by Deputy. The review determined that the appropriate level of SNA support in the school in question is two full-time SNA posts. This information was communicated to the school authorities on 13 June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5861">The three pupils referred to in the correspondence to the Deputy dated 2 June 2005 will each have access to full time SNA support within the classroom setting and also in the playground. My Department officials and the local SENO have discussed the matter with the school authorities since the letter issued to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5862">I am anxious to ensure that special education support services are properly targeted at the children who require them and that the substantially increased resources being made available in the special educational area have the desired effect of ensuring that all children assessed as having special needs receive the support they require.</p>
            <p eId="para_5863">The Deputy will be aware that this Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from fewer than 300 to more than 6,300 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_5865">The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year and by reference to a staffing schedule.

            <p eId="para_5866">In the current school year the staffing of the school to which the Deputy referred comprises a principal and two mainstream class teaching posts.

This is based on an enrolment of 43 pupils at 30 September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_5867">To ensure openness and transparency in the system an independent appeal board is now in place to decide on any appeals. The criteria under which an appeal can be made are set out in Department primary circular 19/02. The board of management of the school has submitted an appeal to the staffing appeal board. The appeal will be considered by the appeal board at a meeting scheduled to take place on 21 July 2005. The board of management will be notified of the outcome of the appeal as soon as possible thereafter. I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in the operation of the independent appeal board.</p>

            <p eId="para_5875">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which was established recently and which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports. A total of 71 special educational needs organisers have been recruited throughout the country and are a focal point of contact for schools and parents. My officials have been advised by the NCSE that an application was received in February 2005, for resource teaching support for the pupil referred to by the Deputy. However, the local special educational needs organiser has expressed the opinion that the pupil in question falls within the high incidence disability categories and her needs therefore can be catered for from within the school's general allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5876">The general allocation for the school in question is 20 part time hours. It is a matter for each school to determine the pupils with high incidence special education and learning support needs that will receive this support. Each school will have enough resource teaching hours to provide its pupils with a level of support appropriate to their needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_5877">The school can then use its professional judgment to decide how these hours are divided between different children in the school, to ensure that all their needs are met. Research shows that some children with special needs will respond better with one-to-one tuition. Others do better when taught in small groups. Often, it is best for resource teachers to work with children in the classroom rather than taking them away to a separate room, as the children then have to catch up work done by the rest of the class in their absence. The point is that the type of response needed depends on the child.</p>

            <p eId="para_5885">Through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, the Government has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon.</p>
            <p eId="para_5886">For example, during the years 1992 to 1999, the RPII carried out a nationwide survey of radon in domestic dwellings. The survey involved the measurement by the RPII of radon for a 12 month period in a random selection of homes in each 10 km x 10 km grid square throughout the country. In all, more than 11,000 houses were measured. The RPII's website —<i>www.rpii.ie</i>— contains a comprehensive map of the high radon areas in Ireland identified as a result of the nationwide survey as well as the report of the survey. High radon areas are areas where the RPII estimate that more than 10% of the houses in each grid square have radon concentrations levels above the national reference level of 200 becquerels per cubic metre. This reference level is the level for long term exposure to radon in a house above which the need for radon remediation works should be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_5887">The RPII, through press releases, radio and television interviews and through its own published reports on radon, has been promoting public awareness of radon and highlighting the risks associated with exposure to radon. The RPII has long been encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5888">The RPII has undertaken several other initiatives to further heighten public awareness of the radon issue. In November 2004, the RPII hosted the third national radon forum in Dublin to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. That same month, the RPII published a booklet entitled "Understanding Radon- A Householder's Guide". That guide is directed at householders who have been informed that they have radon concentration levels above the national reference level in their homes. The aim of the guide is to assist such householders in interpreting their radon measurement results and in deciding how to deal with the problem. The RPII also recently distributed an information poster on radon for display in libraries, medical centres, etc., advising people to have their homes checked for radon. The RPII has also begun a new radon awareness campaign which will involve a series of nationwide public information seminars on the dangers of radon and which will be targeted at selected high radon areas. As part of this campaign the RPII have organised road shows to further heighten awareness in relation to radon, particularly in areas with high radon levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_5889">Epidemiological studies have shown that naturally occurring radon gas concentrations add to the incidence of lung cancer. While there is evidence to suggest that long-term exposure to high levels of radon can be a contributory factor in increasing the risk of lung cancer and that the incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers, it is not possible to ascribe any one cancer death solely to radon. The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland estimates that approximately 10% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths in Ireland, equivalent to 150 to 200 deaths, are linked to radon gas exposure and that the incidence is higher among smokers than non-smokers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5890">The RPII has consistently advised on the health risks of exposure to radon gas and has actively encouraged those householders residing in high radon areas to use radon measuring kits which can be obtained for approximately €40 to establish radon levels in their homes.</p>

            <p eId="para_6032">Details of rates of travel expenses paid to local authority employees were most recently set out for local authorities in January 2004 and have effect from 1 January 2003. The mileage rates involved are outlined in the table appended below. Scale A rates are the normal rates of travel. Scale B rates, which involve a fixed annual allowance and reduced mileage rates, are payable to all engineering officers. Managers, assistant managers, directors of services, rate inspectors,or checkers, and chief fire officers, may opt for scale B. Managers, assistant managers and directors of services may also opt for a fixed annual travel allowance on foot of paragraph 6.39 of report No. 20 of the review body on higher remuneration in the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_6033">In the case of some local authorities, arrangements are in place whereby staff required to undertake frequent journeys within the local authority area in the course of their duties are paid fixed travel allowances based on regular logs of mileage actually travelled.</p>

            <p eId="para_6076">A combined capital allocation of €73 million was made available to local authorities for the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes in 2004. It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the level of funding to be provided for the disabled person's grant scheme from within this combined capital allocation. While two thirds of all expenditure on the scheme is recouped by my Department, authorities are required to fund the remaining one third from their own revenue resources with amounts provided for that purpose in their annual estimates. The sum of €41.9 million provided in my Department's Estimates for 2004 for recoupment to local authorities of two-thirds of their expenditure on individual grants was fully expended.</p>
            <p eId="para_6077">Information provided by local authorities indicate that combined expenditure by them on the schemes in 2004 was €55.4 million, consisting of €45.8 million on disabled persons grants and €9.6 million on essential repairs grants. Administration of both grant schemes, including the processing of individual applications, is a matter for the local authorities. The majority of authorities have reviewed their schemes over the past two years with a view to streamlining their operation. Introduction of systems of medical prioritisation as well as standardisation of costs and improved arrangements for the use of occupational therapists has enabled authorities to manage the schemes more efficiently and has allowed them to tackle the backlog of applications which had been allowed to build in a number of areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_6078">A combined capital allocation of €70 million is available in 2005 for payment of disabled persons and essential repairs grants. Individual allocations were notified to local authorities on 7 June 2005. I am very conscious of the importance of the disabled persons grants scheme in assisting the provision of appropriate accommodation of disabled persons in the community. It is essential that the available funding be directed to those persons in greatest need of such assistance. The requirement that local authorities make a contribution from their own resources to the financing of the scheme will be considered further within the overall context of the review of the operation of the disabled persons grant scheme which has been under way in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_6080">The Local Government Act 2001 has been designed to provide a modern legislative framework for all local authorities. Under the Act all town councils, including former town commissioners, may take action to promote the community interest; exercise a representational role, with an office of mayor and structured linkage to the county council; provide local amenities and raise a local community contribution; make local bye laws and have statutory input to the local development plan process under the planning code. Under section 185 of the 2001 Act, which sets out the provisions for the establishment of new town councils, the powers of such town councils would correspond to those of former town commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_6081">Certain town councils, other than former town commissioners, are under the relevant statutory service codes responsible for certain mainline functions in the housing, roads and sanitary services areas.

            <p eId="para_6085">I propose to take Questions Nos. 488, 493 and 494 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6086">The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has allocated significant resources to assessing and highlighting the problems associated with high levels of radon in households throughout Ireland and to increasing public awareness of the risks. During the 1990s the institute undertook a major nationwide radon survey aimed at determining the extent of the radon problem in Ireland. In total, more than 11,000 houses were measured for radon levels. Of these, about 9% had radon concentration above the national reference level, the reference level for long-term exposure to radon in a house, above which the need for remedial action should be considered, is 20Bq/m3. It has been estimated on the basis of this survey that approximately 91,000 houses, or 7% of the national housing stock, would therefore have radon concentration above the reference level. It is a matter of concern to the RPII that just over 3,000 of these households with radon concentrations above this level have been identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_6087">My Department and the institute have consistently urged householders to measure their homes for radon levels, particularly if they live in an area that is considered to have high radon concentrations. The testing is inexpensive, costing approximately €45, straightforward and non-invasive. Direct subsidies for testing equipment are not envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_6088">If the household is found to have high radon levels remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department called "Radon in Buildings — Corrective Option". The Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland has also issued guidance entitled "Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide". In addition, the website of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland —<i>www.rpii.ie</i>— has a list of companies that can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6089">To heighten public awareness of radon, the RPII has in recent times embarked on a series of nationwide public information seminars and road shows which are targeted in particular at selected high radon areas. These seminars have resulted in media coverage throughout the country and have been linked to an increase in inquiries from the public seeking information on how to get their homes tested for radon.</p>
            <p eId="para_6090">Although the provision of Exchequer grant assistance for remediation works is not envisaged, my Department, along with the assistance of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will continue to highlight the dangers of radon using all appropriate opportunities. Every effort will also be made to provide information to householders so that they can carry out monitoring and remedial work effectively and economically should it be necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_6096">Phthalates comprise a group of substances which are widely used in the plastics industry and which are of concern due to their potential endocrine-disrupting effects. The Environmental Protection Agency funded a survey in 2003 by Cork Institute of Technology on the occurrence of endocrine-disrupting substances in the Irish aquatic environment. The analysis of the results was recently concluded and the results do not reveal any intersex, that is, the simultaneous presence of male and female tissue, in any of the waterbodies surveyed. The report of this survey will be available within a few weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6097">A comprehensive screening programme began in March 2005 with the aim of establishing the relevance of more than 200 dangerous substances, including phthalates, in the context of Irish waters. The programme, which is led by Carlow County Council on behalf of all local authorities, is co-ordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency and funded by my Department. The output from the programme will be a major factor in determining whether further measures will need to be taken to protect our waters from pollution from phthalates. Regard will also be had to the results of reviews being carried out in relevant international fora.</p>

            <p eId="para_6137">It is anticipated that total social housing provision, including new local authority housing, vacancies arising in existing houses and output under other social housing measures, will meet the needs of in excess of 13,000 households in 2005. This compares with almost 8,500 households in 1998. In addition, it is anticipated that a number of households currently in private rented accommodation will transfer to the new rental accommodation scheme which is currently being introduced. These households will continue to be accommodated in the main within the private rented sector.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Roche)</from>
            <p eId="para_6879">Over the years, the Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, has committed significant resources to assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country and to increasing public awareness of radon and public health.</p>
            <p eId="para_6880">To date, the institute has carried out a survey of 1,487 homes in County Clare. Of these, 224 were found to have radon levels above the national reference level of 200 Bq/m3. The reference level for long-term exposure to radon in a house, above which the need for remedial action should be considered, is 200 Bq/m3. As part of this survey, 275 workplaces were also surveyed, and out of these there were 12 workplaces above the national reference level for workplaces, 400 Bq/m3. Some 135 schools were surveyed, and of these 23 were found to have levels above 23 Bq/m3 and 11 had radon levels above 400 Bq/m3.</p>
            <p eId="para_6881">Although a provision of Exchequer grant assistance to home owners for the provision of radon barriers or remediation is not envisaged, my Department along with the institute will continue to provide information and increase awareness of the risks associated with radon in order to enable and assist householders undertake any necessary remediation works in an effective and economical manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_6882">Upgraded building regulations, introduced in June 1997 require that all new houses, which commenced construction on or after 1 July 1998, incorporated radon protection measures. In October 2004, my Department published an updated edition of technical guidance document C (TGD-C) on part C of the building regulations, site preparation and resistance to moisture, incorporating enhanced radon prevention measures for new buildings commencing on or after 1 April 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6883">For many years now, the institute, through press releases and radio and TV interviews, and through its own published reports on radon, has promoted public awareness of radon and highlighting the risks associated with exposure to radon. The institute has long been encouraging householders, particularly those in high radon areas, to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake radon remediation works where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_6884">The institute has undertaken several other initiatives to further heighten public awareness of the radon issue. In November 2004, it hosted the third national radon forum in Dublin to raise awareness of radon as a health risk. That same month, it published a booklet entitled, Understanding Radon — A Householder's Guide. That guide is directed at householders who have been informed that they have radon concentration levels above the national reference level in their homes. The aim of the guide is to assist such householders in interpreting their radon measurement results and in deciding how to deal with the problem. The institute has also printed an information poster on radon for display in libraries, medical centres, etc., advising people to have their homes checked for radon. The institute has also begun a new radon awareness campaign, which will involve a series of nationwide public information seminars on the dangers of radon, and which will be targeted at selected high radon areas. As part of this campaign the institute has organised road shows to further heighten awareness in regard to radon, particularly in areas with high radon levels.</p>
