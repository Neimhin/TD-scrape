#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, to the meeting. In accordance with the normal procedures, I will ask him to make his presentation, following which we will separate the agenda into sessions of questions and answers on external relations, followed by general affairs.As this is the Council meeting in preparation for the European Council in Thessaloníki, I should say on behalf of the joint committee that we had a useful discussion on the latest developments in the Convention on the Future of Europe with the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the other Convention delegates and alternates last Monday. As the Minister may be aware, the joint committee has followed the Convention closely and met regularly with the Convention members before and after plenary sessions. I invite him to make his opening comments.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I am pleased to appear before the committee again to review the agenda of the next General Affairs and External Relations Council which is due to be held in Luxembourg on 16 June next and will meet, as is normal, in two sessions. The first session will review the external relations items while the second will consider general affairs issues. As members of the committee are aware, the Council will also progress preparations for the Thessaloníki European Council, which is to be held on 19-20 June.I refer to external relations agenda items. The Council will review preparations for the EU-western Balkans summit, which will be held in Thessaloníki on 21 June, the day after the European Council. I discussed the prospects for the summit with political leaders in the western Balkans during my visit to the region in May. The summit will be an important point in the development of the European Union's relations with the region. Expectations of the outcome among political leaders in the western Balkans are high. However, they are also realistic.Following a decade of conflict and division, considerable progress has been made in bringing stability to the western Balkans over the past three years. All the countries of the region are now led by democratically elected Governments and progress is being made, albeit unevenly, on political, economic and institutional reform. The European Union has played the leading role in encouraging these developments in co-operation with the elected political leaders of the region.I expect that the Thessaloníki Summit will issue a clear political message to the people of the western Balkans that their future lies in eventual integration into European structures. It will confirm that the framework for economic and political progress is provided by the stabilisation and association process and that the ultimate goal is membership of the European Union. This message of confidence in the future of the region will be matched by confirmation that the only way in which progress towards accession can be made is by the implementation of wide-ranging and challenging reforms. The summit will confirm that the countries of the western Balkans are potential candidates for EU membership and clarify the road to be followed by the elected Governments of the region in the years ahead if they are to meet the hopes and ambitions of their people. The agenda agreed at Thessaloníki will provide the framework for our relations with the region during Ireland's EU Presidency and beyond.At the Council Ministers will consider developments in the Middle East. Discussion is likely to focus on three issues: developments in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the current situation in Iraq and recent developments in Iran.On the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, we will discuss recent developments towards the implementation of the Quartet road map. There was a positive outcome from the summit in Aqaba last week when US President Bush, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and Palestinian Prime Minister, Mohammad Abbas, met to consider their next steps. All three leaders issued positive statements, which I welcomed. Israeli Prime Minister Sharon accepted the future of a Palestinian state, which would have territorial contiguity, and decided to begin the dismantlement of settlements which are illegal under Israeli law.I hope these moves represent the first steps towards a lasting settlement based on UN Security Council Resolutions 212 and 338, and the vision of two states, Israel and Palestine, affirmed in Resolution 1397. Prime Minister Abbas reiterated Palestinian rejection of terrorism and violence against all Israelis and called for an end to the violence of the 33 month old intifada. These are courageous decisions by both leaders and merit the support of all Governments and peace loving people everywhere.We must also acknowledge President Bush's personal commitment to the road map. His leadership has been vital in driving forward the peace process. We are now witnessing a long awaited opportunity for bringing an end to the decades of conflict which have afflicted Israeli and Palestinian alike. It must not be missed. I am well aware many difficult problems, ranging from borders to refugees, will have to be tackled in the months ahead. In recent days we have seen evidence of these difficulties. We regret the deaths of at least five Israelis and five Palestinians in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza on Sunday. We regret the loss of life in yesterday's attacks, but these incidents must not be allowed to reverse the positive steps that have been taken so far.Prime Minister Sharon faces stiff opposition at home and his ability to adhere to the road map is under attack by ruthless terrorists. It is also clear that Prime Minister Abbas faces a difficult time in uniting Palestinians behind the road map. I welcome his decision to press ahead with the efforts of the Palestinian Authority in engaging Hamas in talks on negotiating a ceasefire and the support the international community has shown for these efforts. I hope Hamas will reverse its decision to break off those talks. The prospect of civil war which could result from their opposition to the current peace process will not benefit anyone, either Israeli or Palestinian. The leaders of the two sides must continue to hold firm in their commitment to the road map. Ireland and our EU partners will do all they can to support them.Hard choices and tough decisions will have to be made, but if all sides are truly committed, the reward is worth the compromise, an Israel recognised within its borders and secure in its Jewish identity, having arrived at a just settlement of the refugee problem, living alongside a sovereign, independent and viable Palestinian state and its other neighbours in peace and shared prosperity.Ministers may also discuss the situation in Iraq. While it remains difficult, the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 1483 has provided a framework for moving forward and stabilising the country. The resolution provides the assurance of Iraq's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity, with every appropriate involvement on the United Nations' part, which is of the greatest importance for Iraq's future. However, we still have to guard against the twin dangers of destabilisation in the region and the worsening of the terrorist threat.A number of other issues arise in regard to Iraq, not least of which is the humanitarian situation, which is being tackled by the various agencies on the ground, including the United Nations. Despite the support of the international community, millions continue to suffer from the effects of conflict, food insecurity, water shortages and deprivation of other kinds and much work remains to be done. On 25 March the Government announced a €5 million humanitarian assistance funding package to alleviate suffering in Iraq. The European Union, including the Commission, has allocated more than €600 million in emergency humanitarian aid for the crisis in Iraq, of which it has delivered more than €250 million to date.Another issue is the fact that the US and UK forces in Iraq have not so far found evidence of weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council unanimously determined in Resolution 1441 of November 2002 that "Iraq's non-compliance with Council resolutions and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and long-range missiles" posed a threat to international peace and security. The Security Council took this view based on the fact that Iraq had refused to permit the return of the weapons inspectors since 1998. When faced with the threat of force, Iraq accepted the return of the inspectors. However, the degree of co-operation which Iraq extended to the inspectors was described by them as less than full and many questions remain unanswered. Ireland and its EU partners are doing all they can to support the efforts, both humanitarian and political, being made by all parties to alleviate the continued hardships faced by the Iraqi people and bring about the restoration of normality to a beleaguered country.I refer to Iran. Negotiations are under way between Iran and the European Union on a trade and co-operation agreement which, as is customary, will include provisions on respect for human rights. Our EU partners share our concern at the continuing unsatisfactory situation of human rights in Iran with continued use of the death penalty and torture, and institutionalised discrimination on the basis of religion and gender. However, we consider that the reformist Government of President Khatami deserves support and that Iran should be offered incentives to improve its relations with the international community. By continuing negotiations on this agreement and enshrining our concerns in such an agreement, we believe we are actively providing the support the reformists need to bring about change in Iran.Negotiations continue on parallel agreements on political dialogue and co-operation in the fight against terrorism. In these negotiations the European Union has expressed its concern, shared by the international community, about the scope and scale of Iran's nuclear programme. The International Atomic Energy Agency will report on Iran's programmes on 16 June. This will be important to the likely future direction of the European Union's engagement with Iran on the issue.Ireland has supported recent proposals that the issue of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction should be made a priority for the European Union. The Union has long been actively engaged in the disarmament and non-proliferation area, but discussions at ministerial level in recent months have provided new focus to this work. Ireland is actively engaged in the elaboration of proposals for the General Affairs and External Relations Council which should combine a statement of the European Union's basic principles in the area of weapons of mass destruction proliferation with more practical operational steps which the Union might undertake in efforts against proliferation.Under the European security and defence policy agenda item, the focus is likely to be on Operation Artemis, the European Union led temporary stabilisation force due to be deployed to Bunia in the Democratic Republic of Congo over the coming weeks. The decision to deploy an European Union led force in Bunia follows a request from the UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan, to the Union to help respond to the rapidly deteriorating security and humanitarian situation in the region.Reflecting UN Security Council Resolution 1484 adopted on 30 May, the European Union is providing a short-term interim force which will enable the reinforcement of the UN forces already in Bunia. Key tasks will include contributing to the stabilisation of the security conditions, improvement of the humanitarian situation, ensuring the protection of the internally displaced persons in the camps in Bunia and protection of the airport. As framework nation for the European Union led force, France will provide the operation and force commanders, the operational headquarters and a high proportion of the troops on the ground. A total force size of about 1,500 is envisaged.This month's Council is also likely to see some broader discussion of European security and defence policy issues. A number of key reports are being prepared by the Greek Presidency for next week's Council and thereafter for submission to the European Council in Thessaloníki. The report on ESDP summarises work completed in both the military and civilian spheres under the Greek Presidency and incorporates the mandate for future work by the incoming Italian Presidency.A conflict prevention report details specific measures taken over the past year to implement the EU programme for the prevention of violent conflicts, adopted in Gothenburg in June 2001, and points the way ahead for the incoming Italian and Irish presidencies. A third report on the contribution of the common foreign and security policy to the fight against terrorism refers to specific initiatives undertaken within the ESDP, including the ongoing process of defining possible interaction between capabilities developed under the ESDP and counter-terrorism.Developments on an EU security strategy paper, due to be submitted by the Secretary General and High Representative, Javier Solana, to the European Council in Thessaloníki, may also arise. The document will seek to identify broad objectives which should inform the European Union's conduct in international affairs, especially, although not only, in the context of transatlantic relations. The intention is to set out a holistic approach to security extending beyond the purely military perspective.Regarding EU-US relations, I look forward to the Presidency's and the Commission's report at next week's Council on preparations for the EU-US summit in Washington on 25 June. The Council will also allow for further discussion on the important issue of transatlantic relations following on from the very useful and interesting informal meeting of EU Foreign Ministers held in Rhodes last month. I am sure we all agree that the transatlantic relationship is of the most fundamental mutual importance to the European Union and the United States, both economically and politically. The EU-US summit comes at a critical time in relations between the two entities when there is a perception of a deep rift in transatlantic relations in light of the disagreements between the Union and the United States and within Europe itself over Iraq.The summit is a good opportunity to demonstrate that the United States and the European Union can overcome these disagreements. This can be done by highlighting the benefits of close co-operation between the Union and the United States and discussing ways in which we can build on successful co-operation on issues such as the western Balkans, the fight against international terrorism and Afghanistan. It is also an opportunity to focus on areas of ongoing and future co-operation such as the Middle East peace process, the reconstruction of Iraq and the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.In any discussion on transatlantic relations the economic and trade aspects are also significant. Given the magnitude of the trade and financial flows between the United States and the European Union, it is not surprising that the transatlantic relationship defines the shape of the global economy as a whole. The generally smooth flow of economic relations, including both trade and investment flows, is sometimes overlooked, but despite their newsworthiness, disputes affect less than 3% of annual EU-US trade volumes. However, issues relating to, for example, medicines, market access, genetically modified organisms, steel and foreign sales corporations will have to be solved, and the EU-US summit will give us an opportunity to discuss possible solutions. Solutions will have to be found to such questions by 2005 at the very latest if the Doha development agenda is to have a satisfactory outcome for developing countries.The main focus of discussion on the general affairs agenda is expected to be the European Convention. The Convention is due to be discussed in its own right and as part of the discussions on the draft annotated agenda of the European Council. Members of the joint committee will be aware, especially having recently met the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the other Irish members of the Convention, that work has now entered its final phase. The Convention is due to decide upon its final report at the end of this week.It is as yet unclear what the focus of the debate at the Council on the Convention will be. It is likely, nonetheless, that there will be at least some discussion of the final report as well as discussion of how the issue should be handled at the European Council which is likely to set a start date for the Intergovernmental Conference, probably in October, and a target date for its completion.The new constitutional treaty will undoubtedly be a significant improvement on existing treaties. It will set out in clear and comprehensible language what the European Union is and does and its values and objectives. It will greatly simplify decision-making in the Union, make clear that its powers are conferred by the member states, and enhance the role of national parliaments, especially in monitoring respect for the principle of subsidiarity. These are important steps forward that fulfil the mandate given to the Convention by the European Council in Laeken in December 2001.Much of the Convention's recent focus has been on institutional issues. The revised institutional proposals are a significant step forward and represent a recognition of the need to preserve the key principles of equality between member states and balance between the institutions, key principles articulated by the Government throughout the Convention process.The revised proposals on Commission membership are of particular importance. Despite considerable efforts to roll it back, the principle of guaranteed equal rotation achieved at Nice has been retained as regards the voting members of the Commission. This was a key objective. Moreover, in a step forward, all member states not represented in any given Commission will now be entitled to nominate non-voting members. I also welcome the retention of the Treaty of Nice deal on the size and composition of the European Parliament.While there will be a long-term elected President of the European Council, his or her functions should be so defined as not to cut across those of the Commission. Moreover, the principle of rotation in other formations of the Council is also set to be inscribed in the new constitutional treaty. This was something which we had argued strongly in favour of throughout the Convention process.The significant progress made in the past week has greatly increased the possibility that a broad consensus can be reached on the Convention's final report. At the same time, members of the Convention are likely to note that, while the report is a solid basis for work in the Intergovernmental Conference, they will have some concerns that they will wish to revisit. While some good work has been done, Ireland will be working to make further progress on issues such as criminal law and tax. I look forward to a preliminary examination of the Convention report with my colleagues at the Council in advance of its formal presentation to the European Council at the end of next week. I am grateful to the committee members for their attention and I am happy to take questions on any of the agenda items in the forthcoming Council meeting.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Minister. We are dealing with the agenda in two sections, external relations and general affairs. We do not have the "A" items because they are not ready. Looking back at the "A" items we did not have for the last meeting, there was an ESDP suggestion for co-operation with Russia in the field of European security and defence policy. What is that about?Regarding the Congo specifically, GOAL in particular has raised questions about the behaviour of Uganda in the region and continuing assistance to that country. Has the Minister considered these concerns? On the broader issue, there is a European Union led programme of assistance to the Congo, with France in the driving seat. Did Ireland offer to participate in that force? Was there a difficulty or was there a suggestion that Irish troops were not needed?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	3	In Resolution 1484 the United Nations authorised the deployment of an interim emergency multinational force to contribute to the security and humanitarian situation in the DRC. The decision by the European Union to lead this force with France as framework nation responds to that request for a European Union intervention by the UN Secretary General. Regarding participation by Ireland, in accordance with EU crisis management procedures, offers of contributions to a European Union led force are made through a force generation process in which the framework nation identifies the various roles in which contributions are required. The force generation conference for the Congo operation is taking place in Paris, where Ireland is represented by the Defence Forces. The prospect of Irish participation in the force, possibly by contributing special forces, was given consideration in advance by the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces, having regard to the context and risk assessment for the mission. Ireland attended the conference with a view to identifying any gaps in capabilities which might need to be filled. In the event it was clear from the conference that there was no identifiable role for Ireland. It is not, therefore, the case, as reported in today's media, that an offer was made and not taken up.In relation to the "A" list——
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Uganda question was related to the Congo.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Yes. The Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has made it clear that the assistance we give to Uganda through overseas development aid is precisely for that purpose. People often make an equation that when one contributes to overseas development aid, one contributes to a displacement of resources in that country for other, more nefarious purposes. We do not tie our aid. We give it on the basis of need, to help the poorest of the poor and the peer review which has just been conducted on our African aid programme shows it to be comparable to the best in the world. We do not intend to be deflected from our work for ordinary Ugandans regarding the aid we give. Were we to get involved in any issues in the UN report, as I said taking questions in the House some time ago, we take these matters up in the normal political bilateral relationship if problems arise with that country or any other. We do not predicate our aid programme for ordinary people who need our help on how Governments perform or otherwise. That has no bearing on whether aid is made available.I note the points made by some NGOs and do not question their sincerity, but obviously the Government must look at a range of considerations. Any political difficulties can be dealt with in the relevant bilateral political and diplomatic spheres. Issues such as development aid should not be dependent on this.Regarding aid and the ESDP, Russian participation in the Petersberg tasks and access to European Union assets like heavy-lift aircraft, we can provide the Chairman with more details and on the provisions for more regular consultations. This is a matter, as part of the EU-Russia dialogue, of seeing if there are areas of co-operation consistent with the principles of the ESDP that would enable us to work with Russia as part of whatever added value might come from those discussions.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	6	The Minister might give us a note.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Certainly.
#JimOKeeffe	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-party	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#JimOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I raise what is the most serious issue confronting the European Union in its external affairs, its relationship with the United States, and the contribution we, as a country, can make in helping to repair the rift that currently exists. It is vitally important from the point of view of both regions, and world peace, that that is done. If strategically possible, the European Union should develop an approach to the United States which should be based on two principles - friendly encouragement and sensible firmness. We should be encouraging on issues we feel the United States should be doing while trying to nudge them in a different direction on other matters. This could arise in three areas. The Minister's report refers to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and this is where encouragement for the United State could be in order. For the first time we have seen evidence on the United States side of being willing to confront Israel and to say "No" to the brutalities and illegalities Israel has been up to. The United States should be strongly encouraged to continue in that approach with a view to making progress on the road map, while always understanding and accepting Israeli security concerns.I get the impression from Europe of a carping approach to US activities in Iraq. It should be made clear in the European Union that everyone is immensely relieved we are rid of Saddam Hussein and that there is a recognition of the difficulties. Many of those difficulties existed for decades before Saddam and there should be a willingness to assist in resolving them, while at the same time trying to nudge the situation back under the auspices of the United Nations, in so far as the United Nations wants to be involved.Regarding the summit on Wednesday week between the European Union and the United States, the Minister pointed out the difficulties that exist but we have a certain amount of political credit when it comes to pushing for a better relationship. It is possible that the establishment of better structures is needed in order that no such rift occurs again - structures within the European Union and between the United States and the European Union. We have some credit, particularly from the point of view that we did not withdraw facilities despite there being no second UN resolution, an action with which I wholly agreed. That political credit should be used to push the European Union towards a realisation that it is in the interests of the Union, not just the United States, that we have a restoration of good relations with the United States and that structures are established to ensure we do not have the kind of breakdown that occurred recently. That is how I see us using our credit to best effect at EU level to achieve those objectives.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	9	There is concern in some quarters, as the Minister mentioned, that weapons of mass destruction have not yet been found in Iraq. What sources of intelligence has the Government relied on when deciding our approach at the United Nations to Iraq?My second question, which is relevant to what we are discussing, relates to the UN-EU relationship generally. There is a perception that the United Nations has been weakened as a result of the Iraqi situation. Questions are being asked about where it goes from here. I would like the Minister to let us know what our position is in regard to the future reform or development of the United Nations. Are we as committed as ever to the UN process or are there moves by the Government to progress our foreign and security policy or, indeed, our defence policy, within the European Union and independently of the United Nations? I am referring, in particular, to comments made recently by the Minister for Defence in relation to Macedonia. I would welcome the Minister's views in this regard.
#MichaelMulcahyFF	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-party	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelMulcahyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I join the Chairm an in thanking the Minister for coming. I found his statement informative and balanced.I, too, would like to focus on the issue of EU-US relations. Who will represent the European Union at the Washington Summit on 25 June? Will it be one or two senior people or will there be participation by all the Governments? Obviously, there will be a discussion in advance of the summit on what the European Union will be saying to the United States in relation to Iraq. I voted to allow US forces to use Shannon Airport, not on the basis that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq, but because I believed the world would be a safer place and the Iraqi people would be much happier and better people without the presence of Saddam Hussein as their leader. Whether weapons of mass destruction are found ultimately is not of prime importance to me. What is of prime importance to me, as I am sure it is to the Minister, is the sovereignty of the Iraqi people. I remain disappointed that the United Nations is not playing the primary role in post-war Iraq and I am a little nervous that the United States led Administration in Iraq will roll over on a year by year basis. A period of five or six years was mentioned. I would like to know what the European Union will be saying to the United States about its aspirations for post-war Iraq over the next few years.There should be a deep engagement between the European Union and the western Balkans. I welcome this discussion which is long overdue. Members of this committee will travel in September to Croatia, Slovenia and the Czech Republic, on the edges of the western Balkans. Historically, it has always been an unstable area, coming somewhere between the Ottoman Empire, western Europe, the Hapsburg Empire and so on. It would be great if over the next 20 or 30 years the European Union could bring long-term stability and peace to the region.We face the prospect of Cyprus becoming a full member of the European Union next year while still a divided nation. Will it be on the Thessaloníki agenda and is there continued pressure to get a solution prior to full membership next year?
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Minister said there was no identifiable role for Ireland in the Congo. The briefing document states the question of whether Ireland will participate in the European Union led operation remains under consideration. The Minister has said it is not the case that Ireland made an offer which was not accepted, as reported in the newspapers. Was it the case that we were making ourselves and our troops available but the decision was reached that there was not an identifiable role for Ireland? Was that the case for any other country?My second question relates to EU-US relations. According to the briefing material, it appears there remains a serious problem whereby essential services such as water and electricity have not yet been restored in Iraq. Given the resources used to invade the country in the first instance, I am somewhat surprised that this situation remains as it is. Recently there have been a number of newspaper reports, particularly from Robert Fisk and other commentators, that there are ongoing difficulties in Iraq with US and British soldiers being attacked. Has the Minister any knowledge or view on what is happening?I listened to Deputies O'Keeffe and Mulcahy and, while I may not disagree in principle with some of their comments, I do not agree completely with them. We are all relieved to be rid of Saddam Hussein but I cannot say that the end justifies the means, because that is not always the case. The United States and the United Kingdom were quite happy to support Saddam Hussein when it suited them. They were well aware that he was murdering his own people. We seem to be forgetting that the action of the United States and the United Kingdom did not have the support of the United Nations.Deputy Mulcahy is probably not on his own when he says he did not have to believe there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. If what we hear and read is accurate, many others were in that position. As far as I was concerned, that question was of prime importance because we were told the primary reason for attacking Iraq was to find the weapons of mass destruction and disarm them.Deputy Haughey asked on what evidence did the Irish Government base its decisions. Does the Minister share Deputy Mulcahy's views on how the Government reached a decision on the issue of weapons of mass destruction?
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I welcome the fact that Ireland supports the non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. I have a slight problem, not from Ireland's point of view but from the point of view of many EU countries. It is hypocritical of them to discuss the issue of non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction while they hold many such weapons. Countries within the European Union should be setting an example to the rest of the world by destroying existing weapons.In relation to the Middle East, I am concerned that the United States is setting up a mission to monitor the implementation of the road map. Surely the United Nations or, at least, the Quartet, should monitor such events. Does Ireland have a position in this regard and will we encourage other monitors who may not have such a vested interest in the region?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	13	Has the European Union made any independent assessment of casualties in Iraq? I note from the Minister's opening remarks that the Union has allocated more than €600 million in emergency humanitarian aid, of which more than €250 million has been delivered to date. Has Commissioner Patten or Mr. Solana any intention of visiting the region? This is a region where the European Union should have someone at a senior level on the ground carrying out an assessment. Is it intended that any initiative will be taken in regard to EU-US relations during Ireland's Presidency, commencing on 1 January 2004?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I will try to reply to questions in the order in which they were raised and begin with the issues raised by Deputy O'Keeffe and others regarding US relations. The relationship between the United States and the European Union is important. We had a good discussion at an informal Foreign Affairs and External Relations Council meeting when the Greek Presidency asked me to introduce the subject. We presented a considered paper which was well received.We must recognise that there is no point in Europe having a sniffy attitude to the United States. Without getting into specifics, one detects among some commentaries a rather patronising view towards the United States in Europe. That is not a way of gaining influence in the corridors of power in the United States. One must recognise that the United States sees matters in a post-11 September 2001 world. With its military power, it does not intend that it will happen again on its territory, if it can help it. Europeans have not internalised this but we should. We might then understand what is happening.I have always been of the view that if what happened in New York, Washington or Pennsylvania happened in any of the countries of the European mainland, we would make sure we regarded and internalised it with the same sense of consistency as has happened elsewhere. Europe does not serve itself well by not internalising this reality and the consequences that flow from it. That being the case, one must ensure the relationship is seen as one of mutual respect.In the economic sphere the certainty of mutually assured damage, should it not be handled properly or involve many trade disputes and so on, would militate against that aspect of the relationship being in a healthy state, which it certainly is, despite the difficulties. Much of the stereotyping one sees about trade disputes between the United States and the European Union, when it is actually analysed, accounts for just 3% of total trade and investment flows. The idea that 97% of the relationship should be ignored because the fact is highlighted that in respect of 3% of total trade there is a problem seems to be not a balanced or wise assessment or interpretation of the nature of the relationship and its importance to our mutual prosperity.On the political and security side, there is not the same sense of parity. The reality is that there is not parity, certainly not on the military side. The United States remains the sole super hyper power in the world and has a defence spending capability that far outweighs anyone else's. The European Union is a union of nation states, not a federal super state, nor will it be. We must ensure the influence and values we want to bring in our analysis of problems which affect us as a member of the European Union, whether in the Middle East or, Africa, whether on development issues or whatever, are brought in a way which will convince others of our point of view. We need to persuade and convince if there is difference of opinion. Having a sniffy, haughty, patronising attitude will not get us anywhere.A dose of realism on all sides regarding the nature of the real differences that exist, and how we can close the gaps, will be best advanced on the basis of objective argument. We have much bring to the debate. Others who listen to us have the perception that we seem to suggest that we have a monopoly on virtue and wisdom in all of these areas and they should listen to us and come into line. It is important that we come to the debate without this. We live in a diverse world where people have different security assessments and views of their own national and international security. We must work co-operatively to try and overcome differences.That sort of approach is far more likely to bring about success than otherwise. An example is the Middle East. The Quartet road map has been established under the common ownership of the United States, the European Union, the Russian Federation and the United Nations. For years there has been a tendency to view the United States as being the proxy arguers in regard to Israeli concerns and the European Union exclusively in regard to Palestinian concerns. These are misrepresentations of the positions of both. However, this stereotype was well used by those who were not interested, perhaps, in the emergence of a real common view between the United States, the European Union and others in regard to how to solve the Middle East problem.The Quartet is now a far stronger process and the common ownership of the road map is a new development and a success for common foreign and security policy. It is a notable success in terms of the process which has brought it about. One does not underestimate the great difficulties there will be in implementing it but that is not to suggest that it should not be implemented. It is a realistic assessment of where we are at, the level of difficulties we face and the collective political will that will be required to overcome those difficulties.The United States is a key player in the Middle East and the solution to the problem. It is the best persuader available in terms of the responsibilities we would like to see the Israeli Government undertake. It is not exclusively so but predominantly so. By the same token, the European Union has shown support for Abu Mazan in terms of its financial support for the Palestinian Authority. Despite the conflict, the intifada, the violence and counter violence that has been taking place, it is not often known that without the financial support of the European Union the Palestinian Authority could not exist. Apart from this, we are an important player for Israel, Palestine and the Middle East generally. Israel's second biggest trading partner is the European Union.The security relationship in the Middle East is a huge issue for the European Union which is closer to the Middle East than the United States. We are involved in the Euro-Med or Barcelona process through which we are undertaking dialogue. We have a knowledge and background. Many of us in the Union have a history of close association with the Middle East. We can be an influence for good and moderation and a compromise which is honourable and just in all the circumstances. I contend that it is a failed analysis in international relations in terms of the effectiveness of EU policy if we want to not just talk about it but to implement it and get some real results to start with the premise that the United States is opposed to our view or that we are opposed to the United States. That is both objectively untrue and, as a matter of tactics and strategy, a very fallacious departure point. We need to internalise what happened on 11 September 2001, even though many terrible events have taken place in the world before and since. We must reflect on the impact it has had on how the United States views its own national security, how it views its relationship with others and how we deal with the terrorist threat in general. We need to reflect on how we now approach age old, intractable problems. We may need to make a more determined effort which is more focused and less judgmental than the views expressed by others on these matters.This brings me to deal with comments which have been made regarding multi-lateralism. In the case of Iraq, the failure to maintain international solidarity and the failure of the Security Council to maintain a collective position on the issue weakened multi-lateralism and the United Nations. I was a vocal critic of how the matter was being handled within the Council. We were a member of the Council which unanimously adopted Resolution 1441. It is to be regretted that within three months we were suddenly in a position where in the case of a matter of huge, global importance, consensus was no longer available to us in the Council.In answer to Deputy Haughey, it has not changed our view that multi-lateralism is clearly the only way in which many global problems can be solved. Under international law, the Security Council is the forum for international legitimacy of action. What happened in the situation regarding Iraq was that there was genuine legal disagreement as to whether there was a sufficient legal basis for action, based on previous resolutions, quite apart from the necessity for a second resolution.Our position in October 2002 - in our explanation of vote - was the one consistently adhered to by the Government throughout the crisis. Regardless of the legal arguments as to whether a further resolution was required to give a legal basis for military action and in the interests of the widest possible legitimacy in the maintenance of international solidarity, there was a need for a second resolution in political terms. We pursued this policy throughout the crisis.Where does the United Nations go from here? At the United Nations General Assembly meeting last September, Kofi Annan said the United Nations needed more effective multi-lateralism. This should not be regarded as a fudge. Resolution 1441 was a "last chance" resolution. It was not an issue that could be indefinitely postponed. The Security Council had a responsibility to come forward with specific measures as to what needed to be done, the timescale of that action and what action to take if Iraq did not comply. Unfortunately, a different type of debate ensued and the United Nations was the biggest loser.We relied for our evidence on UN sources - Hans Blix. I am somewhat bemused at those who say in the aftermath of that military action: "There are no weapons of mass destruction. What was it all about?" The United Nations and Hans Blix said there was a problem. The activities of Saddam Hussein and his regime for the past 13 years confirmed there was a problem. If he had complied with the United Nations, sanctions would not have been necessary. Is it now being suggested that Saddam Hussein never possessed these weapons, that the events at Halabjah did not happen? They did. He had that capacity. Hans Blix was not satisfied that Saddam Hussein had discharged his responsibility to prove he did not have them. We supported giving more time to Hans Blix for the weapons inspection process but unfortunately that was not the view of the full Security Council.Let it not be suggested now that there was not a problem. Are we supposed to believe that if Saddam Hussein did not have any capacity, the only logical conclusion for a reason for his activities for the past 12 years was that he was prepared to use his own people's impoverishment as a means of exercising control over them, even though he never had such weapons? If that is the contention, it is probably even a greater reason he should be removed.I was never in favour of regime change. Certainly, the Iraqi people were never given any say as to whether there should be a regime change. I agree there is an issue regarding weapons of mass destruction, that the sites which have been inspected have not revealed weapons. There is a question over the method of concealment, who knew where they were, what happened to them and to what extent they were retained. The regime was in control for more than 20 years and it was not exactly in the openness, transparency and accountability business.The fact that weapons have not been found in the two months following the conflict raises some questions but it does not mean there are objective answers on the other side of the argument yet. These are ongoing issues which remain to be determined. There are some in the regime who might well be able to give us some answers and are still at large. No one is in a position at this time to draw objective conclusions regarding the matter. It is valid and legitimate to ask questions but the idea that everyone has the converse answers in his or her back pocket as justification for taking positions before the military action even took place, does not necessarily hold with the sense of consistency of those who would advocate such positions.There is an EU-US summit meeting planned to take place during Ireland's Presidency. The agenda will be determined closer to the event.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	16	There are no decisions made yet except that such a summit is envisaged in principle. The attendance will include the Presidency under Prime Minister, Mr. Simitis, Mr. Prodi, President of the Commission, Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten.Deputy Haughey asked about recent comments made by the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, regarding a meeting of Defence Ministers of the European Union that took place recently. The important point outlined by the Minister for Defence is that we want to ensure we can continue to participate in such actions consistent with our military and UN peacekeeping traditions. He is also reflecting the developments that have taken place within the United Nations on foot of implementation of the Brahimi report, which sought the modernisation and reform of UN peacekeeping operations in the aftermath of disastrous experiences in Sierra Leone and West Timor.UN endorsement and support of operations by regional organisations is not a new phenomenon but a developing one. The United Nations is making more use of regional organisations within general areas of activity in order to support and implement UN mandates. The Minister for Defence is rightly setting out for us these security policy developments. Our maintenance and adherence to the United Nations remains no less robust than it has always been. We want to make sure our domestic framework corresponds to these international developments in order that we do not exclude ourselves unnecessarily from activities and participation in future peacekeeping and peace enforcement roles, which are totally consistent with our military traditions. It would be very ironic to cut off participation in such actions if our domestic framework does not reflect international developments in a way that is consistent with our traditions. In order to make sure we do not allow gaps to appear that deprive us of being able to continue in that role, UN endorsement and support with Government and Dáil approval for participation are required on a case by case basis.No other issues were raised that I have not covered. I have covered the Middle East, weapons of mass destruction in Iraq and the EU-US summit.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Resolution 1483 gave a framework that defined where the money is to be put. It goes into a trust fund that has been set up under the UN resolution. It is very important that the European Union makes sure it knows where its money is being spent. I do not know if Mr. Patten has been there, but all his people have been there and they have encouraged countries to have a presence in Baghdad as soon as the security environment allows. Eight US soldiers have been killed in June so far and 39 have been killed since the fall of Baghdad, which shows that it is still not a fully secure environment. Clearly, sporadic attacks are still occurring since the fall of Iraq. Some 39 people have been killed in such attacks and a further 41 have been killed in accidents, which indicate that dangerous situations are still developing. We now have a UN framework.Deputy Harkin asked how we could find out more about what was going on and the level of casualties. Sergio de Mello has been appointed as the special representative of the Secretary General for Iraq. I recently met him in Geneva in his capacity as High Commissioner for Human Rights. He is an outstanding diplomat. I hope to be at the United Nations in New York at the end of this month or next month and if he is around, I would like to meet him or some of his staff to get an update on what further information we can get on how matters are developing from a UN perspective.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	We have dealt with the external relations section.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I thank the Minister for his considered reply to the first section in which he spoke about the realities of international relations. I agree with him that here in Europe we must internalise the events of 11 September 2001 in order that we can have a better understanding of how the United States reacted. How does what he said about mutual respect fit in with the statement: "If you're not with us, you're against us". He talked about a haughty attitude from certain commentators in Europe towards the United States. Those adjectives might also be ascribed to those comments. Ultimately, if we have respect, then the respect must be mutual and I am not sure that is the case.I was not quite so happy with the Minister's reply on Iraq. I agree with him that there was a problem and some of the countries that invaded Iraq contributed to the problem. Leaving that aside, Hans Blix said he was not satisfied and needed more time. The Minister said that perhaps Saddam Hussein was using people's impoverishment and that this was a stronger reason for invasion. At the time, I muttered "regime change", because that is what it seemed like to me. Ultimately, it is good that Saddam Hussein is no longer there. However, is the Minister saying that was a sufficient reason for attacking Iraq or a good reason for attacking it?

We did all we could to avoid the necessity for military action. Listening to the way this argument is conducted, betimes one would have thought Saddam Hussein was one of the great humanitarians, whose loss we should bemoan.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I think the Minister is exaggerating.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	23	No, I am not. I am not suggesting this is the Deputy's view. I have heard people rightly talk about the loss of life in military actions, which is to be greatly regretted and should be avoided if at all possible. There was systematic killing and torture of Iraq's people for years. I am not questioning the fact that many would have been just as consistent in their denigration of those actions as they would be subsequently in disagreeing with the war. We must bear all this in mind when dealing with this matter. There is a context, which is not very nice. Too often we argue these points in absolutist terms without taking into account the fact that there were real problems and issues throughout that regime, processes with which none of us would agree. I am making the point that there are alternative reasons for invasion.We had a consistent position. I am extemporising for the purpose of having a discussion, as opposed to reading from a script, which might give the impression I was not answering the question. Let me state the Government's position. We want to see this matter resolved peacefully. We want it resolved at the Security Council. We would like to see more time made available to the inspectors. We are very sorry the Security Council could not come forward with a united position on these questions. Beyond that and in the aftermath of military action, there has now been some suggestion that there was a total pretence in going in in the first place. That was not the case. There were reasons for concern, to which the United Nations had consistently adverted through 19 resolutions.Sometimes when one listens to the argument ex post facto, there is almost a suggestion that it was all a con job. The point is that Saddam had that capability. When the inspectors left in 1999, they were able to confirm the capacity he had. He could not explain what he had done with it. He was not prepared to give that level of co-operation to Hans Blix who confirmed this was the case. He had real questions to ask to which he did not get adequate answers. A delegation from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs met him previously and is aware of his position. I do not wish to be partial - I am simply setting out the full range of concern for which there was objective evidence.On the current emphatic contention that, beyond doubt, Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction, I simply ask the reason he behaved as he did, if that was the case. Is it suggested that he was prepared to impoverish millions of his country's people rather than come clean with the United Nations, avoid sanctions and get away from a situation in which some €200 million worth of oil was denied access to the international market? That contention just does not make sense, irrespective of how wrong or difficult a person he was.For the purposes of this discussion, I am simply making it clear that there are issues still to be addressed with regard to weapons of mass destruction and the searches must continue. I look forward, in accordance with Resolution 1483, to some future participation by the United Nations, with its inspectors returning to look at the situation in the interests of validation and international legitimacy. Those are the thoughts I wish to contribute to the debate at this stage, as opposed to the approach that there was no real basis for any intervention in the first instance - that is not in accordance with the facts.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I suggest we have covered this section of the brief as fully as is necessary.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I thank the Minister for his clear outline of the external relations problems in relation to Iraq. I will move on to the, perhaps, somewhat softer subject matter of the moment - the success story of the Convention and what has been achieved in the context of the final report going forward to the European Council in a few days. We have had great success on the issue of equality among the member states on subsidiarity, the rolling back on taxation and the composition and size of the European Parliament. However, having acknowledged this, is it still possible there could be some rolling back on those points at European Council level? I am concerned that consensus in one EU body could be overturned in another.I wish to ensure we retain what has been achieved - that is what the public wants and what we fought for in the Nice treaty referendum. Clarity is essential. The people need reassurance that we are reflecting their views on the next constitutional treaty. We have gone a long way towards this. Ireland, above any other European country, has made the system work, in terms of bringing the people with us on the issues involved in the second Nice treaty referendum. I wish to be in a position to reassure people on the basis that, after the European Council has finalised certain points, the matter then goes forward to the Intergovernmental Conference, where it will be formalised in the new constitutional treaty.

We are very happy with the work of the Minister; the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the members of the Convention. We had a very useful and impressive meeting last Monday. To date, there has been a major success in upholding the principle of strict equality in the Commission. With regard to the election of the President of the Commission, the proposal by the Minister of State, which was supported mainly by the smaller member states and, later, by Poland, seemed to be blithely ignored by the presidency of the Convention. I regard this as very undemocratic. Although a majority of member states signed up to an excellent proposal, it did not find its way into the final draft. Is there still a possibility of pursuing the electoral college proposal at Thessaloníki? Will the fight continue at that stage?
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I fully endorse the comments of members on the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs; the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, and the members and alternate members of the Convention. This process has demonstrated the capacity of the smaller countries to co-operate effectively and nailed the lie that they could be dominated by one or two of the larger countries. That was one of the fears at the start of the Convention - that the European Union would simply echo the wishes of France and Germany, in particular.My question to the Minister relates to the Presidency of the European Council. I agree with the Minister's comment that the functions of that office should be so defined as not to cut across those of the Commission. There is a general desire to maintain the present institutional balance as it stands. How does the Minister see this developing? What difficulties does he anticipate in that area, as between Council, the Commission and the terms of reference of the Presidency of the European Council?

What will be the Irish position on the Intergovernmental Conference - is it intended to reopen issues there? Perhaps that depends on the position of other member states. Looking ahead to the referendum, can we have an outline of the Irish position as to how the final report should be handled?
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	30	Like other speakers, I extend my congratulations to the Minister, the Minister of State and the members of the Convention. I welcome some of the recent changes which have emerged in the draft treaty. I re-echo Senator Dardis's comment that it gives the lie to the suggestion that smaller nations have no power or influence. This demonstrates that results can be secured through a networking process.I have just one question on the statement on page 10 of the document that "while good work has been done, Ireland will be working to make further progress on issues such as criminal law and tax". Will the Minister please outline those issues briefly?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I understand that, at the European Council meeting on 20 and 21 June, the Presidency intends to limit the agenda to the following items: the Convention-IGC, asylum and immigration, enlargement, western Balkans, new neighbours, follow-up of the 2003 spring European Council and external relations. Presumably, the Convention will take up most of the meeting. Are there any other issues which the Minister expects to arise? Obviously, the meeting of General Affairs and External Relations Council on 16 June will be preparatory to it.With regard to the institutions, is it clear there will be a full Commissioner for each member state, having regard to the proposal for rotation, with 15 voting members at any given time? There has been some suggestion of an attempt to unravel what members of the Praesidium and the Convention understood to have been decided. The Minister stated the Intergovernmental Conference was likely to commence in October. Is there any indication as to how long it will continue, given that much of the preliminary work has been done in the Convention? Will it finish in the Italian Presidency or is it more likely to finish during our Presidency? What will be the scale of the break between the end of the Convention and the beginning of the Intergovernmental Conference, which will start in October according to the information given to the committee by the Minister? Will the Convention ever finish? We have heard rumours that the president of the Convention wants to deal with some other items in section 3 in July. What will be the duration of the interregnum?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for their kind words on the negotiations so far. It is important that we do not designate this issue as a big country-small country issue as such an approach would not be good for the European Union. The Government has tried to work with others to preserve the Community method. The method by which we work has to be effective and recognise and respect the various member states. It has to take into account the very important balances between the institutions. While a conflict between the small guys and the big guys is often portrayed, we all know that it is a far more complex matter.We need to consider the balances between the institutions, encourage effective decision-making and recognise equality. They are the three basic planks of what we are trying to achieve. The character of the European Union - what has made it successful - needs to be retained. This involves recognising that effectiveness and efficiency in one's institutional mechanisms and decision-making methods is needed if one wishes to increase the European Union from 15 to 25, 27 or 28 member states. Gridlock is the worst thing that could happen for us, as we need a European Union that takes decisions and preserves the Community method of taking decisions. We need effective institutions in the Commission's policy initiative area, the Council's decision-making or legislative functions in co-decision with the European Parliament, the Parliament's role in reflecting the wider demos of the Union, or the national parliaments which should have a greater role in giving real flesh and bone to the principle of subsidiarity. We should make sure the powers utilised by the Union and its institutions are those conferred on them by member states.We need to move away from some of the extreme interpretations of the European Union, both on the eurosceptic and europhile wings of the argument. It is not the case that it is all good or all bad. Like every institution, there are things one would like to see done better in the Union. Using any balance sheet method, one cannot come to any conclusion other than that Ireland needs the Union and, for its stability and prosperity, must remain an integral part of it. All these issues need to be seen in that context.One comes to a conclusion during every negotiation - one makes a decision having made one's case and after asking certain questions. Are one's basic principles reflected in what is emerging as the broad consensus of the positions of the member states? That is what politics is about. If one slices down every argument and goes to the ditch on it in isolation from the other issues, one will have a pretty unsuccessful negotiation. One would certainly end up being without influence. The principles I have outlined have been informing the Government's activities at EU level.I join members of the committee in thanking the Government and parliamentary representatives at the Convention, as well as their alternates, for their work. As members are aware, it is hoped the Convention will finish up this week and a report on what has emerged will be brought forward. The report, which will be the basis for future discussions, will be sent to the Council. The proposals that have been brought forward are those of a consultative group, but the final political decisions will be taken by Governments at the Intergovernmental Conference. The Convention method has been a success. I am under no illusions - if we had commenced this process with an Intergovernmental Conference ab initio, we would have ended up with everyone holding to their positions until very late, as happened at Nice, before trying to come to efficacious compromises thereafter.The Convention has cleared up some matters. It has provided an overview in a way that an Intergovernmental Conference would not have been capable of ab initio. The Convention method has its merits for that reason. It should be borne in mind, however, that the Convention is not the Intergovernmental Conference. It cannot hand a fait accompli to 25 Governments. It can offer and bring to the table what we hope will be a coherent set of proposals which have broad consensus. The greater and more genuine the consensus, the greater the contribution that will be made to the Intergovernmental Conference process. In view of the quality of the Convention’s work, we should not, cannot or will not ignore its final product. We will not have to throw all the cards up in the air and put them back together again. The Convention’s proposals will be an important focus of the work of the Intergovernmental Conference.I will attempt to answer the broad questions asked during this discussion. The Praesidium has been meeting in plenary session today and will do so again tomorrow. We are happy enough, in broad terms, with what we have heard so far. It is obvious that we will reserve our position when we go to the Intergovernmental Conference. Having considered the Convention's work over the weekend and in the days before the Council, the Taoiseach will outline a more considered position, in broad terms, at the Council meeting ahead of the commencement of the Intergovernmental Conference in October. The Government will communicate any continuing concerns it may have.The criminal law issues are real. While we all want to work more closely together and be more effective in dealing with international crime, illegal immigration, asylum, drug smuggling and trafficking in humans, we have to ensure we respect the legal systems from which we originate. Constitutional entitlements and legal rights have built up in our jurisprudence and, obviously, have to be respected in a way that seeks to approximate rather than harmonise our laws and gives respect to the reality I have outlined. No Government will be involved in a diminution of rights, as we are keen to ensure rights are enhanced and the existing situation is improved. We have to ensure the proposals that emanate in any constitutional treaty do not transpose or sabotage the criminal procedures that provide basic protections for citizens. It will be fine if the proposals enhance these rights, if the collective position is less than what is already available and if we are allowed to retain what we already have. We can live with this. Intricate legal issues need to be closely watched.Ireland has a clear and unequivocal position on the taxation issue and I will not bore the committee by outlining it. It has remained firm and steadfast throughout the Convention process, an Intergovernmental Conference and the length of time people have wished to spend talking about it. I do not mean to be dismissive, but I am simply outlining the facts.A target accession date of 2007 has been set for Bulgaria and Romania. Objective criteria and chapters need to be negotiated and, depending on the extent to which they are met, matters may be advanced or concluded during the Irish Presidency. It is obvious that we will be as supportive as we possibly can be in that regard throughout our Presidency. The conclusion or otherwise of the process is a matter to be decided by objective assessment between the Commission and the states concerned.I will outline how the next treaty will happen. A formal decision on when it will start will be taken and a target date for completion will be set at the Thessaloníki Council. The length of time it will take depends on how broad a consensus is generally reflected in the Convention's deliberations. I cannot anticipate how countries are likely to react until we go to Thessaloníki and hear the formal positions of Prime Ministers and Heads of State. A genuine effort is being made by all involved to make this work, come forward with conclusions which will make the European Union a better, more effective and more transparent operation, give national parliaments a proper role and ensure all member states are part of the decision-making process in a way that respects their sovereignty.I do not anticipate other issues arising, beyond those raised by members.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	36	What is the Minister's position on the proposals on the Presidency of the Council and Commission?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Throughout the debate some have expressed concerns about proposals on the Presidency. What is emerging in this respect is more in the context of a chairman of the Council, rather than a presidency type office which would develop a bureaucracy in competition with the Commission. Clearly, certain concerns on this question will need to be resolved politically in the Intergovernmental Conference process. One would have to accept, however, that the traditional six month rotational Presidency is not a solution in an enlarged European Union.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-11 00:00:00	Prelude	39	We have a couple of matters to attend to. The minutes of the previous meeting have been circulated. For accuracy sake, we need to make a minor technical amendment on the voting arrangements by inserting in the text words to the effect that super-qualified and double majority voting arrangements will apply in certain circumstances. Are the minutes agreed? Agreed.I propose to note correspondence we have received from COSAC as it will be relevant to future discussions. Is that agreed? Agreed.Regarding the draft programme and general information on the meeting of the Troika scheduled for 4 July, as Ireland is about to join the Troika, I will attend this meeting, the first of the Italian Presidency.We have received notice of a workshop on enforcement of European anti-trust rules to take place in Maastricht, which relates more closely to the work of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business. I, therefore, propose to note it.
