#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 31. I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office. I call on Deputy Connolly to state the matter.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I wish to seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to raise an issue of urgent national importance, namely the closure of 115 public beds at the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, and the likely re-opening of these same beds under the national treatment purchase scheme.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I ask that Dáil Éireann be adjourned under Standing Order 31 to address the latest disclosure of meltdown in the health service, with the closure of 115 beds due to an €18 million deficit facing the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, this year and the reality that once more people will die due to Government mismanagement.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I move the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent importance, the cutbacks in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital, Dublin, which will force the closure of 115 beds this year, and as a result hundreds of patients on public waiting lists will have their operations postponed, and the warning from doctors that urgent cases are at present waiting months before undergoing surgery.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Having considered the matter fully, I do not consider it in accordance with Standing Order 31.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	5	The Order of Business today shall be as follows: No. 16, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill  2003 – Order for Report and Report and Final Stages; and No. 1, Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 [Seanad] – Second Stage (resumed).It is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders, that: (1) the Report and Final Stages of No. 16, shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. by one question which shall be put from the Chair and which shall, in relation to amendments, include only those set down or accepted by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government; and (2) the proceedings on the resumed Second Stage of No. 1 shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m., and the Order for Committee shall be taken immediately thereafter and shall be decided without debate.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 16, Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003 – Order for Report and Report and Final Stages, agreed to?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I object to the Order of Business, as we and other parties have done all week. When 115 beds in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital are due to close, we are here ramming through legislation amending the Freedom of Information Act 1997 where the Government wishes to cover up its actions.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	We will deal with that legislation in proposal No. 2.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I understand that. I am objecting to the Order of Business as it includes that proposal.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	10	At present, we are on the proposal for dealing with No. 16.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I also want to object vociferously to the fact that again the Taoiseach is not here on Thursday. Just in case the Minister for Defence does not know where the Taoiseach is, he is invited, if he so wishes, to go to the Sacred Heart Senior School, Killinarden, Tallaght, Dublin 24, for the opening of the Tallaght Youthreach, on behalf of Dublin VEC, by the Taoiseach this morning at 11 a.m. sharp.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	He is opening two pubs afterwards.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	There are 115 beds to close in the Mater Misericordiae Hospital. This is a scandalous treatment of this House and it is contemptuous. The Taoiseach should be here.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	14	You have made your point.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	They are talking about the dual mandate.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Deputy Ring, there should be only one speaker from each party.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I want Standing Orders suspended and I want a debate on the health crisis that now affects the country. Yesterday I pointed out that the letter of expenditure to health boards allowed for an increase of 2.8% whereas inflation in the health area is running at 8.8%.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	You have made your point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I pointed out that that vacuum would be filled by closed beds, closed wards and cancelled functions.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	We are dealing exclusively with the Order for Report and Report and Final Stages of the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	It is a disgrace that the Minister comes in here and puts forward this Order of Business, which includes an issue which is important, the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003, but which rams through the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	22	You will have an opportunity to discuss the proposal on the Free dom of Information (Amendment) Bill in a few minutes.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	—to cover up the Government's inadequacies and lack of accountability.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I also want to oppose the proposal for dealing with No. 16. It would appear that it is the norm now for the Government to proceed in the first year of office by way of guillotine. The Labour Party Whip, Deputy Stagg, tells me there is a half dozen guillotines coming up next week. While the Taoiseach tours the constituencies, we are expected to guillotine legislation in this House. No more will we know how Government arrived at decisions because of the way they are closing down access to information and filleting the Freedom of Information Act 1997.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	You will have an opportunity on the next proposal to make your point about the Freedom of Information Act 1997.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will use it again, Sir, but I would like to give you fair warning now.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	There was a fairly long debate about this Bill at the time of the budget. The Government is satisfied that the House has had plenty of opportunity to debate what is contained in the Bill.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 1, conclusion of Second Stage of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003, agreed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	This is not agreed and I object to it. On the basis that the Government has made an announcement of the appointment of a new Ombudsman and Information Commissioner, I proposed that the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill should be withdrawn at the end of Second Stage and that we should wait until the new commissioner has an opportunity to give her verdict and analysis on the Bill, or adopt the Labour Party suggestion of freezing the entire business for 12 months until we take into account the recommendations of Deputy Fleming's committee, which was to allow extra time for consideration and further amendments.In respect of the Sustaining Progress social partnership agreement published yesterday, chapter 1.7 states: "The Government has agreed to consult the social partners as appropriate on policy proposals."  It goes on to state, "The Government is committed to consultation with the social partners to take place in a spirit of good governance and recognising the need to involve appropriate stakeholders in the development of policy." Clearly there is an opportunity for Government to show it has no intention to cover up or hide the lead-in to decisions taken by the previous Administration five years ago. For that reason I suggest that in a spirit of openness, accountability, transparency and good governance, the Government should withdraw this Bill at the end of Second Stage and allow for reflection and further analysis. I am objecting to the Order of Business on that basis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I also oppose this. My party had ten names down to contribute to the debate. It is not possible to do that in the time provided. It shows particularly shameless determination by the Government to railroad the Bill through. If the new Information Commissioner had not been appointed prior to this measure being brought in to fillet the Freedom of Information Act, I believe she would not have accepted the post. If the Government had tried to do so when she was in office, she would have resigned the post. I would expect her to do that because in so far as it relates—
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Deputy is wrong.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It is a bit of a joke for the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, to give me a lecture on freedom of information after what I saw him do to the RAPID programme in my constituency.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	The Deputy never listens.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	We have ten Deputies who want to contribute to this debate. The effect of it is that in so far as Government decision-making goes on, there will be no access in future as contemplated in the original Act. There is no point in the Taoiseach repeating every morning that it does not damage access to information by the public. From what was said by Deputy Fiona O'Malley we know it does in one important respect. It is the government process and what the original 1997 Act has done for the character of governance and for openness in decision making that is important. That is what is being rowed back. It is back to the future for Fianna Fáil.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	It might be more appropriate to discuss the contents of the Bill during Second Stage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	36	We do not have the time.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	We will not be allowed to speak.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	38	Unfortunately I will not get an opportunity because of the guillotine. One would expect Fianna Fáil, which opposed earlier Governments in efforts to introduce a freedom of information Act, to try to snuff out this one. However, it could not do this without the collusion of the Progressive Democrats.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Hear, hear.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	From this seat while in Opposition, Deputy Harney advocated openness and transparency in decision making. That was her main plank at that time. Now the Progressive Democrats are happy to kill off the essential elements of the Act as they relate to Government decision making and it is a shame.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The Green Party will be opposing the taking of No. 1, the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. To do otherwise would be failing in our responsibility to the people who are rightly incensed and angered that the Government talks about openness and transparency but acts with the hallmark of a secret dictatorship under a cover of democracy. The Government should realise that it has among its membership people who would agree this is not the right legislation.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Deputy Sargent without interruption.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Government should listen to Deputy Fiona O'Malley when she criticised this legislation. Perhaps she might vote with the Opposition, as should other members of the Government parties on this matter. We oppose it.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	45	We will admire Deputy Fiona O'Malley if she has the courage.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	46	Only one Member from each party is entitled to make a brief comment.

It is important that the Government parties recognise the distrust that is growing among the public regarding this legislation. The advent of 21 April is what focuses people's attention on why the Government is trying to suppress the release of information pertinent to the last Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. What is the Government trying to hide by not allowing the existing legislation to stay in place?
#NoelTracey	unknown-#NoelTracey-party	unknown-#NoelTracey-dob	unknown-#NoelTracey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	48	What has been hidden is the big question.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Eleven hours have been offered for Second Stage debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	52	It will be clear that Opposition Deputies decided to take up a considerable amount of that time with filibusters and did not debate this.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	53	The Government took five and a half hours of the allocated time.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	55	What allegation?

A maritime law conference was held yesterday which pointed out the Government's serious failings in not having effected EU legislation with Bills such as the sea pollution (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, which is waiting to be enacted, the coastal zone management Bill and the mercantile marine (amendment) Bill – to overhaul commercial ship registration legislation. Given that 90% of the EU oil comes by sea—

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18274	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	96	According to the report on the social partnership agreement, the Government is contemplating price controls in certain circumstances. Did I miss something, because it appears all the price increases have come from Ministers themselves such as those relating to the ESB, VHI, the gas company, medicines and motor tax, all of which are administered by Ministers? Does the Government propose to bring legislation on price control before the House?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	97	No such legislation is promised.

However, he did not indicate whether this was the final draft or when the legislation would be published. It is important that it is published and approved by the House if it is, for example, to deal with the actions of those involved in the illegal activities in Iraq and the attack against a sovereign country.

When will the legislation be brought before the House?

Now we are told by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, that he proposes to radically alter the Bill before Committee Stage. Would it be possible to allow that Bill to proceed and to introduce a new fisheries consolidation Bill, as has been promised for next year? Given that the changes being made to the fisheries Bill are aimed at correcting the misbehaviour and bad administration in the Department by the previous Minister, Deputy Fahey—
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	165	That Bill was published in November last year and is awaiting Committee Stage.  The Deputy's detailed question should be put directly to the Minister concerned.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	170	The Minister for Defence should make a statement.

Also, what is the status of the Forestry (Amendment) Bill, the fishery harbour Bill and the charities Bill?
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	172	Work on drafting the heads of the Grangegorman development agency Bill is at an early stage.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	175	It will be published late this year, at best. The fishery harbour Bill is expected in 2004, the charities Bill in late 2004 and the forestry Bill in 2004.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	178	My understanding is that the arrangements for next week have been made. However, that is a matter for discussion among the Whips.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	179	They have discussed it. In reply to questions from Deputy Rabbitte and Deputy Kenny yesterday, the Taoiseach gave a commitment that the timing for the debate would be settled by the Whips. There is no time allocated next week for that debate. When will that debate take place?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	180	This was discussed at the meeting of the Whips. It was felt that in the event of there being a change in circumstances, it would be advisable to make provision for it. We are merely seeking confirmation of that, lest we start next week's business without clarification.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	181	The House is always willing to try and facilitate all sides on these matters.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	186	On a point of order, what we are dealing with now is the Order for Report and Final Stages of the Bill. We are not opposing the Order of the House, but the Order to take Report and Final Stages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	187	It has already been decided to proceed with it.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	188	That is the Order of the House, but we are dealing with the Bill itself – the Fifth Stage.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The Dáil has already decided that.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	191	It has been decided to take it.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Who decided it?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	193	It was decided by the Dáil this morning on the Order of Business.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	194	It was the timing that was agreed.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	195	No, only the timing was decided this morning.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	196	The exact wording was that the Bill "shall be taken today". That was the decision.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	197	However, we oppose the actual detail of the Order for Report and Final Stages, not the Order of the House that arranged the time.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	198	It is the same thing.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	199	It is not the same thing.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	200	It says it shall be taken today.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	201	On a point of information, this is quite important, although it might appear to be peripheral. What is decided in the case of the Order of Business of the day is the ordering of the legislative business across a period of time. The nature of the Order that is referred to here is internal to the legislative process on the Bill itself. It is not the same matter and, therefore, you should be very careful, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In that case what would happen is that you would have collapsed this stage which is a crucial stage in processing the legislation. You would have decided that because of a simple vote in the morning all of that would have been cast aside, but this is not so. It is explicitly stated in relation to the legislative process that it is a nominal gesture and is nodded through by the Minister or Minister of State. On this occasion, however, there are good and practical reasons why it is being opposed. You cannot deny any Member of the House the right to oppose the moving of the Order. We are entitled to say "no".
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I will read the Order which stated that "the Report and Final Stages of No. 16 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not previously concluded, be brought to a conclusion at 12.30 p.m. by one Question. . .  ".
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	203	There is no problem with that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It has already been decided to take it.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	205	That matter has been decided, but the matter of the Bill itself has not been decided. The Order for Report Stage of a particular Bill is not the same as the Order for the conduct of the House for the day.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Absolutely.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	207	It will create a very dangerous precedent if you do not rule correctly according to the Standing Order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	208	I am ruling that it shall be taken today.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	209	On what basis?
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	210	We have no objection to it being taken today.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	211	We are dealing with Item No. 16, which reads as follows: "Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003 – Order for Report, Report and Final Stages". The Order which was made by the House reads as follows: "the Report and Final Stages of No. 16 shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall, if not pre viously concluded. . . ", etc. I am objecting to the Order for Report, which is a separate and distinct matter. I would like to explain why I am objecting to taking the Order for Report, if you will permit me to do so, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I have to proceed with amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Gilmore.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	213	No. I am objecting to the taking of the Order for Report.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	214	There is nothing to object to.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	215	There is because the House has been deceived by the Government on this matter. Last November, when the Government introduced a motion to increase motor taxation, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government said it was being done to provide additional money for roads. On Committee Stage, I and other Deputies extracted from the Minister of State an admission that no extra money is being provided for roads.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The Deputy is out of order. The only question before the House is amendment No. 1. There is no other question.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	217	When is the Order for Report being taken then?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	218	It has been taken.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	219	It has not been taken. There was no question put to the House today that the Order for Report be taken.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	220	The only matter before the House is the consideration of amendment No. 1. If it is not being moved we will proceed to the next amendment.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I would advise you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, not to attempt that sort of steamrollering here. We are simply trying to get the correct procedures in place and to ensure that an incorrect ruling is not made. I would ask you to listen to what I am saying rather than listening to the Clerk of the House at this stage. While I do not wish to name the Clerk, it is unfair of him to intervene when we are discussing something directly with you.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The Chair is quite clear on this matter. The decision is that the only matter before the House is amendment No. 1.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I know well what the Chair is entitled to do but if we are trying to make a technical point to you, I think the least you should do is listen to us when we are doing that.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I have done more than listen.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	225	We understand the point you are making about the Order being made for the Business of the House today. What we are dealing with now, however, is the Order Stage of a Bill.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	232	That is not before the House.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The other night, Members from all sides took up another objection.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I know it is different but, still, the ruling of the Chair was proved right, in spite of all the arguments. I would ask Deputies to accept the ruling of the Chair and to proceed with amendment No. 1 which is the only matter before the House.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	241	In view of the importance of this matter, I would ask for a short sos so that the Whips can discuss it.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	242	There is no justification for a short sos.

You say we have decided on it already, but we did not discuss it. If we had attempted to discuss it previously we would have  been ruled out of order and told that we could not discuss it.

It states that it is proposed, notwithstanding anything in Standing Orders – which means there are no qualifications anywhere else – that the Report and Final Stages shall be taken today and the proceedings thereon shall terminate at 12.30 p.m. That is on what we called a division earlier, the taking of Report and Final Stages and the guillotine implicit in that. We are now asked to take No. 16 in its entirety. We did not write this. It was decided by Members on the other side of the House. The Government's proposal is for the taking of the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill 2003 – Order for Report, Report and Final Stages. Somebody on the other side of the House has not done the sums and has got it wrong. We are entitled to invoke the rules of this House and to challenge the taking of Report Stage of this Bill because the order for it has not been properly brought before us. It is not the Chair's fault that Members opposite screwed up. Neither is it his fault that the Government has not done its job properly, but it is our responsibility to hold it to account. It has not done its job properly today and that is why my colleague is holding it to account.

However, in circumstances where it is ordered on the Order of Business of any particular day that one or more Stages shall be taken and brought to a conclusion on that day, the need to make a separate order for the taking of each such Stage is obviated. This is the position in the case of this Bill and it is in accordance with long-standing and regular practice on such matters.

If the Chair insists on its ruling, we can proceed to the  amendments. However, we will have to vote on the Order for Report Stage. There is no doubt about that. The Chair said that is normally done at the end of the preceding Stage, but it should be done at the beginning of proceedings if an order is required for the taking of Report and Final Stages.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	288	I have explained the matter in some detail. We will move on to amendment No. 2.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	289	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 3, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:2.–In so far as additional payments are made to the Local Government Fund by virtue of this Act which, but for this Act, would not be made, such payments shall be applied to the construction, repair and maintenance of tertiary roads.".What I have to say about this amendment relates to the reason I wanted to oppose the Order for Report Stage. The Bill before us will allow the Government to increase motor taxation by 12%. This measure was first announced by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government immediately after the budget. He brought a motion to that effect before the House.When the Government announced the increase in motor taxation the Minister for the Environment and Local Government made it clear that motor taxation was being increased in order to provide additional money for the roads portion of the local government fund. He conveyed that again in the House. When I and other Deputies questioned him about that, he was at best a little evasive about when he might make an announcement on when additional money would be made available to the local authorities to enable them to maintain the roads.When we came to deal with Committee Stage of the Bill, the Minister of State, who is taking the Report Stage today, admitted that no extra money would be available for the maintenance of roads as a result of the increase in motor taxation. The Government has cut €70 million from the non-national roads budget for this year compared to the amount that was made available last year. That €70 million will be made up for by the revenue accruing from the increase in motor taxation.In other words, motorists are being asked by the Government to pay additional motor taxation. We were promised that the revenue accruing form this measure would be put into improving the roads, but that will not happen. A great deception has been perpetrated by the Government on the House and on motorists. The reason the Labour Party was seeking to challenge the Order for Report Stage is because the Government has deceived the House. It introduced a  measure stating it is for one purpose, but the Minister of State admitted on Committee Stage that is not the case. The increase in motor taxation will be used to fill the pothole in the Government's finances rather than the potholes in the roads and no extra money will be provided for the maintenance of roads.We know the state of the non-national roads. Many of them are falling apart, particularly the roads to which I specifically referred in this amendment, the tertiary roads. They are the small roads mainly in urban housing estates, many of which were built by the original developers of housing estates 20 to 40 years ago. Many of them have never been repaired or resurfaced, they are falling apart and will shortly need reconstruction.To be fair to the Minister of State, he gave an indication on Committee Stage that he will arrange for consultants to examine the state of these roads and that we might see something some time in the future, but again when he was questioned about that, it transpired that the earliest any resources will be provided for these roads will be 2005.In a nutshell, a con is being perpetrated by the Government on motorists. It is increasing motor taxation, which is one of the stealth taxes whose name the Government dare not speak and no extra money will be provided for roads. The Labour Party is opposed to that. I will put this amendment to the House for a decision because it is at the core of the issue of whether we will see an improvement in the state of the roads as a result of the increase in motor taxation.
#PadraicMcCormack	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-party	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-dob	unknown-#PadraicMcCormack-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	290	That is a crucial point and it highlights a difficulty we face since the Committee Stage of Bills began to be taken in committee rather than in the Dáil. If one checks the record, one will note that the absolute impression was given on Second Stage that the revenue accruing from the 12% increase in motor taxation would go into the roads fund. No indication was given that the roads fund would be €70 million short on last year or that an estimated €65 million or more would be raised by this road tax. The hole in terms of that €70 million shortfall is being plugged by a 12% increase in motor vehicle taxation. It is quite clear I was deceived although I took part in the Second Stage debate and I did not discover that this was the case until Committee Stage. Taking Committee Stage in the select committee on the Environment and Local Government is useful for taking pressure off the Dáil but there is very little reporting of such debates. The public was not aware of this measure and would have to assume, after the Second Stage debate, that it was acceptable. We could sell a 12% increase to motorists, however reluctantly, if they believed that increase would give them better roads on which to drive.This is a very dangerous precedent. If the Department of Finance says there will be €70 million less for roads next year, must the Minister for the Environment and Local Government find some means of raising that revenue? Those revenues should be raised by and spelt out in the budget so that everyone knows where they stand, rather than have a system whereby a shortfall is filled or made up in this manner. The worst aspect of this is that after the Second Stage debate I had the firm understanding I would probably be able to sell this to constituents by saying they would see €65 million more spent to improve roads, which would save them money in wear and tear on their cars. We now find that less will be spent on rural and tertiary roads this year than in previous years. The deceptive manner in which this has been introduced, which was only exposed on Committee Stage, is very serious.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	292	We are dealing with amendment No. 2 in the name of Deputy Gilmore.

While we have a fairly intensive capital programme for roads, one danger is the lack of maintenance and repair of the roads many people use such as estate roads and local roads. Those are not in a good state of repair and it is important to concentrate resources on those minor roads and to ensure we have adequate funds for their maintenance. There is a real danger as we concentrate on the intensive capital programme for building motorways and bypasses that we will forget about the requirements of those smaller roads. Looking ahead, I fear that we will end up with very high running costs for these newer roads, with funds having to be diverted either from the minor roads or significant increases in motor vehicle duties.I support Deputy Gilmore's amendment and I am concerned we are funding a capital programme which will require a significant increase in maintenance expenditure which may increase duties and taxation.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I am pleased to clarify this situation. First, there is no question of deception being perpetrated by the Government and there is no question of the Government trying to deceive. This was made absolutely clear when the resolution was before the House prior to Christmas and again on Second Stage. On Committee Stage some Members expressed surprise that the extra money to be raised by the motor tax increases was not for non-national roads. It was implied then and is now by some Deputies that the Government was being less than honest with the Dáil when it introduced this legislation regarding  the purpose of the extra money that could be generated by the motor tax increases.As I said then and repeat now, I am in favour of rigorous examination and lively, informed debate in the Oireachtas on all legislative proposals. In the debate on this legislation I have at all times endeavoured to discuss in an open way all the issues raised and to answer any queries but I cannot accept a misrepresentation of the facts. The suggestions that the House only learned on Committee Stage of the use of the extra motor tax income or that the Government was not open with the facts on this issue are unfounded and untrue. On Committee Stage I pointed out that it has always been stated that the extra money being generated by the motor tax would be paid into the local government fund. Furthermore, the extra revenue would be used to maintain the record 2002 level of €435 million for non-national roads. We said we were anxious to maintain those record levels.This has been the position from day one and I question the memories of some Deputies. The Minister, Deputy Cullen, said during the debate on the financial resolution regarding these taxes on 12 December 2002: "As I said on the day I announced the motor tax increases, the Deputy knows full well my objective was at least to maintain the level of funding into the future."– he was referring to Deputy Gilmore. Furthermore, in a discussion of the possibility of a decrease in non-national road spending, the Minister went on to say:I was not prepared to countenance this. With this increase in motor taxation I could at least maintain the level of the fund with small increases so the level of investment would remain the same.That is what we have done. When the issue was raised again on Second Stage Deputy Gilmore quoted from the Minister's contribution during the debate on the financial resolution which indicated that the extra tax would be used to prevent a decrease in non-national roads spending. It has always been clear, therefore, that the extra funding generated by the increases in motor tax would be paid into the local government fund, which would allow for an increase in important general purpose grants to the local authorities and to maintain non-national roads spending at the record 2002 levels. Deputies may claim to be surprised now or on Committee Stage but they knew the position at that time, that the increased motor tax would go into the local government fund and maintain the record levels of investment in our non-national roads. That is the situation.On Second Stage I said that for 2003 €434 million will be available for non-national roads. That was a factual statement. I said this compared to the slight decrease from €435 million in 2002, which was the highest ever State grant provision for non-national roads. I do not know if I could have made it any clearer than that –€434 million  would be made available for this year and that is the situation.I am not trying to score political points but €214 million was the allocation in 1997 to non-national roads and that has increased to €434 million. If we look at our statutory obligations to the local government fund and index-link it to 1999, we have contributed €204 million, which is in excess of our legislative obligations.Although I did not accept the amendment on Committee Stage and do not propose to accept it now, I appreciate the point made by Deputy Gilmore both then and now on the seriousness of the position with regard to tertiary roads. He noted on Committee Stage that the estimated requirement for his electoral area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown was in the region of €10 million, which I do not doubt. As I stated then, we are finalising the terms of reference for a pavement study and tenders will be sought soon. Its purpose is to ascertain the extent of the remaining deficiencies in the network and to examine each class of road, including tertiary roads. The report is due to be completed late this year or early next year.It is important to underline that the maintenance and improvement of non-national roads in the various electoral areas is a matter for the relevant local authority. We received and accepted multi-annual programmes submitted by the local authorities. If some of them wish to alter their programmes, they are at liberty to make a case for doing so to the Department.In fairness to Deputy Gilmore, he has raised the serious problems regarding tertiary roads on numerous occasions. While I appreciate there is a problem, I also have to deal with regional and county roads, for example, by conducting traffic counts on these extremely busy roads. I hope the substantial expenditure on such roads by the Department through the local authorities will result in many of them being completed or brought up to a high standard within a few years.I remind the House that 50% of the allocation goes to restoration and that a number of local authorities have reduced their own resource contribution to the non-national roads this year. I will not detail all the local authorities in question, but I have discussed the matter in the Department. Perhaps there is good reason for these reductions. In fairness to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, it has slightly increased its allocation from €5.3 million to €5.9 million, while Galway County Council has increased its allocation from €4.6 million to €5 million. Overall, however, local authorities have reduced roads funding.Perhaps if we considered linking the Department's allocation to councils' own resource allocations, such reductions would cease. I do not wish to pre-empt what will happen this year, but I am anxious that this matter be brought to the attention of the county managers of the local authorities in question. It is important to note  that the Department's contribution supplements those of the local authorities.I was not prepared to accept the amendment on Committee Stage for sound reasons. It seeks to give absolute priority to local, yet important roads which account for 23% of the non-national road network in county council areas. It is important to underline that the maintenance and improvement of the non-national roads in the county council areas is a matter for the respective local authorities. They allocate resources which are supplemented by State grants. The initial selection and prioritisation of projects or works to be carried out under the various non-national road grant categories is a matter for individual local authorities.This restoration programme has been in place since 1995 and aims to restore by the end of 2005 regional and local roads which were deficient in 1996. We are also finalising the terms of a further pavement condition study to be carried out this year and this will be taken into consideration in later years. I realise this provides little solace to the people Deputy Gilmore represents. I oppose the amendment.

The explanatory memorandum states:The Fund is ringfenced exclusively for local authority purposes and is distributed to local authorities as discretionary grants in respect of day-to-day spending requirements and also as grants in respect of expenditure on non-national roads.The clear impression given was that the money generated by the measure would be allocated in addition to current funding. Even if half of it were allocated in this way, the Minister and other Members, such as Deputies Gilmore, Cuffe and myself, would find it easier to sell the proposal to our constituents. However, not one penny of the increase will be used as additional roads funding.The Minister acknowledged that funding for roads has been cut by several million compared to 2002, even before inflation is taken into account. The bottom line is that less work will be done on the county and tertiary roads. This is a false economy because when road surfaces wear away, the nature of our climate with its significant rainfall levels – the weather will not always be like the past few weeks – will result in the foundations being washed away. The cost in the long run for either the current Minister or one of his successors will be higher.It is estimated this new additional tax on motorists, which will mainly affect people in rural areas where cars are essential items and are required to get to work every day, will raise €65 million per annum. If at least half of that sum was spent on county and tertiary roads, the proposal  would be much easier to sell. As matters stand, we have no option but to oppose the provision.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	296	There are two aspects to this issue, the first of which is the question of funding or lack of it for the tertiary roads. The Minister of State acknowledged on Committee Stage and again today that I have made a case on behalf of the country's roads. He followed this up by saying a pavement study will be undertaken, the results of which will not be available until late 2004 at the earliest. Even if action is taken on foot of the study, the earliest we will see results will be 2005, which is a long time to wait in terms of improvements to some of the roads in question.Meanwhile, the Government is increasing motor taxation. This is the nub of the question. The announcement to increase motor taxation came in the wake of the budget. The Minister for Finance came in here on budget day and told us there would be no tax increases. We now know that at every twist and turn the Government increased charges and taxes on everything – VAT, college registration fees, VHI charges, gas and electricity charges, television licences – and, in this instance, motor taxation.Considerable public controversy arose following the announcement of the increase in motor taxation and it was the subject of the radio phone-in programmes for some period of time. The message coming from Government all through that period was that it was increasing motor taxation but there would be more money for roads.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	298	As Deputy McCormack said, to be fair, many motorists, regardless of how displeased they were about having to pay additional motor tax, responded to that argument by saying that if they have to pay a little more in motor tax to see improvements in roads, they can live with that.The Minister is right. At no stage did either he or the Minister for the Environment and Local Government explicitly tell the House that there would be additional allocations on top of the normal allocation for non-national roads, although he was given many opportunities to state that. However, we cannot operate on the basis of crossword puzzles. The Minister appears to be inviting us to read the clues he gives us, which are buried in the text of his Second Stage speech, to understand what he meant. It is now clear what he meant. In the Estimates process €70 million was cut from the budget for non-national roads but that cut was not announced by Government. The people were not told by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government that the Minister for Finance had taken €70 million from him for non-national roads. When he announced the increase in motor taxation, he did not tell either the House or the public that the purpose of the increase was not to provide extra money for roads but to back-fill the cut in the roads  budget which was effected some time during the Estimates process. That is the deception. The Government has deceived both this House and motorists. The motorists who pay their increased rate of motor taxation today will not see an additional ounce of road surfacing provided.This may be a small point but the Minister did not succeed in maintaining the 2002 level of funding for roads. The 2003 level of funding for non-national roads is reduced on the 2002 figure. The 2002 allocation was approximately €438 million while the allocation for 2003 was €433 million. If one factors in inflation and that the Minister has earmarked part of the 2003 allocation for his high profile road signs initiative, there is significantly less money for roads in 2003, even without taking account of the cut of €70 million which the increase in motor taxation is designed to cover.I intend to press the amendment because I want Members of this House to show where they stand on motor taxation. Members of this House  who vote with the Government on this issue are voting to increase the motor taxation rate without providing an additional service to motorists. That is an issue on which the House must decide.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate. The number of speakers offering in the House shows the interest that has been generated by the amendments put forward by the Minister for Finance.The Freedom of Information Act 1997, which came into force in 1998, has made a valuable contribution to the working of the State and public administration. Since the early 1990s there have been great improvements in the deliberative process of this House with the establishment of legislative committees, both select and joint committees. Prior to the establishment of those committees, a person had an opportunity to contribute on a Bill only on Second Stage, Committee Stage and Report Stage. The establishment of the committees gave Members of the Oireachtas, both of Dáil and Seanad Éireann, the opportunity to engage with officials from Departments and with Ministers in committee on the subjects of the day. It has led to increased and better partici pation by Members of the Oireachtas in our administrative system in general.Over the past number of years Deputy McCreevy, as Minister for Finance, has provided additional resources for the working of this House, particularly for the individual Members of the Oireachtas. It is not many years since each Deputy had to share a secretary, and before that three to four Deputies had to share a secretary. The Minister brought in some very valuable improvements, both with allowances and additional personnel and resources for the Houses in general and for the political parties represented in this House. This has enabled the parties to do a better job in their work in public representation, both in advancing their own political platforms and in representing the needs of their constituents. I am very appreciative of those additional resources the Minister has given to the Oireachtas in general and to individual Members.There is a need for further improvement in this regard. One of the big drawbacks for Deputies and Senators, as representatives of the people, is the inadequate support they have for their own particular needs. Any of us who has a secretary based in his or her constituency knows that after spending three or four days here during the week we return to find nothing but calls missed and calls to be returned. It can be very frustrating. I sympathise particularly with Front Bench spokespersons of Opposition parties, who bear a particularly heavy workload. They should have proper research and secretarial assistance to enable them to examine more thoroughly the different legislative issues that come before them.We should consider the extra resources that have been given to many voluntary organisations. Many people who are working in these or in the many groups that have been established over the past few years have much better personal resources available to them than do individual Members of this House. I know of people in community groups who have a personal assistant as well as other support staff. I see that Deputy Burton is nodding in agreement – I am sure that many of those groups working in the community sector have much better resources available to them than Deputy Burton has as spokesperson for her party in the important area of finance.Examining the very welcome growth that has occurred in non-governmental organisations throughout the country, we can see that these organisations are much better resourced than some of the Members of this House. Ministers rightly have a fine complement of staff and their own personal offices, and such staff are obviously needed. Departments can also provide necessary back-up for their Ministers. The Houses of the Oireachtas, however, should also be better resourced. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, is the one Minister for Finance who has addressed that issue, but I would like to see him provide additional resources.The importance of the Freedom of Information Act is evident. It is proposed to extend the number of bodies covered by the Act from 67 State bodies in 1998 to about 370 today. The Government is right to propose to extend coverage to other appropriate State and semi-State bodies by 2005. There has been a welcome improvement in the area of public administration and there is a more open culture in the Government and in our system of administration than there was in the past. The Office of the Revenue Commissioners holds clinics in different towns throughout the regions. Sometimes people might rather not see the Revenue Commissioners coming to an area, but we all know that many people have gone to those clinics, met the inspector of taxes and the support staff and, instead of having to seek professional assistance, received help from the officials of the office in dealing with their concerns about certain tax matters.In the area of agriculture a whole new range of schemes has been established, particularly since the early 1990s. The Department of Agriculture and Food holds open days and evenings, and officials participate in public meetings organised by farming organisations. Fifteen or 20 years ago, this would not have been heard of. It is a welcome development and should be improved upon.In the early years of the State, certainly in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, there was a 50-year rule in relation to the release of Cabinet papers. This timeframe has been dramatically reduced in recent years, which is right. I do not know where people came up with the idea of having Cabinet papers available after five years. That is much too short a duration. If Government is to be effective, its debates must be vigorous. No Minister should be constrained in what he or she says in Cabinet or in the arguments he or she uses based on beliefs or the viewpoint of a particular Department. Healthy debate at Cabinet level is essential if proper decisions are to be reached.In many instances, the release of Cabinet papers after five years could create difficulties for people who are still serving at high level in government. I am sure that Ministers often have to set aside their constituency interests to support decisions at Government level that may have a negative effect on their areas. It would not serve Government, public administration or the role of the public representative well if the detail of such instances was available after five years. It could compromise a person's work at local level as a representative of his or her constituents.We have a very good public service, which has served Governments of all political hues and has never been compromised. Great credit is due to the public service in general for its work on behalf of the people. Regardless of what political party or parties form the Government of the day, public servants carry on their work with due diligence and attention. They work as they see fit, giving honest service to the people. Often we do not give due regard to the work of the many public servants who go beyond the call of duty to  serve their Departments and the wider interests of the public. The Ceann Comhairle and I, representing Border counties over the years of the Troubles, had much contact with officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to difficulties along the Border. I found the officials in both Departments to be extremely competent and committed to helping the people in those areas who were facing difficulties in going about their business on a daily basis. I record again my appreciation for the civil servants in both Departments who did so much good work over the years when the political climate on this island, especially in Ulster, was not as favourable as it is today.I mentioned earlier the need for better resources in the Houses of the Oireachtas. We need this if we are to decipher and give the necessary examination to legislation and policy statements from Departments. The Opposition needs proper resources and Government backbenchers should have better resources available to enable them to conduct proper research, to prepare for debates and to prepare policy statements. I welcome the Minister's strong reiteration that there will be no limitations on a person's seeking personal information. It is very important that records of a person held in any Department, semi-State body or hospital should be readily available to him or her.If fees are introduced, we should ensure that students, people on low incomes or no wages and pensioners are exempt in all reasonable circumstances from incurring such charges. I noted recently that one person had made 466 requests under the FOI legislation in 1998. I do not know who could genuinely have so many interests that they would need to make that number of requests. We should ensure that the legislation is adequate to ensure that vexatious requests are not made.Many people in the House and outside it have mentioned that the FOI legislation will be restrictive after this Bill has gone through the House. I understand the Canadian Legislature applies a blanket restriction for 20 years over a wide range of records under the general heading of "Cabinet confidentiality". We often think of the Scandinavians in their various systems of governance having very liberal regimes. However, in Sweden detailed memoranda are never brought to government. That surely precludes much examination of the records of government or the discussions that took place at government.In introducing this legislation, the Minister is striking the right balance. He is ensuring that the legislation will be extended to cover other State and semi-State bodies. If governance and government is to mean anything, we must ensure that the deliberative process within Cabinet is open and that participants at Government meetings are assured that the different arguments they bring on behalf of their Departments or the arguments  they put forward personally will, rightly, not be available to the public for a number of years. Five years in politics is a very short period and it is appropriate to change that section.We have seen some journalists do some very good work by using the Freedom of Information Act to carry out research and to follow different policy trails. We have also seen issues being addressed that are not major issues. There have been newspaper headlines about booking a meeting or a flight on a credit card. Such expenditure was not incurred for the personal benefit of the individual office holder, but as part of their work as Ministers. In this House we would be the first people to criticise Ministers if they were not moving around and going to different parts of the country to listen to different groups and constituents and to see at first hand the different issues of the day whether in coastal or rural communities, or in urban areas that have suffered economic decline over the years.I am glad to have had the opportunity to speak in this debate and to voice my support for the general workings of the Bill. The relatively minor amendments proposed to the original Act will improve the legislation and will not be as prohibitive as many people would lead us to believe.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I wish to share my time with Deputies, Healy, Morgan and Eamon Ryan.I listened to the contribution of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, to the debate on Tuesday and I would like to comment on a number of points he made while introducing and defending the Bill. He told us that all organisations have a right to decide how to organise their business and he said the Government is no different. I disagree; the Government is different. Obviously the Minister believes that when people elect a Government, that Government has a divine right to conduct its business as it sees fit. However people deserve, expect and are entitled to more. Perhaps at one time it was enough to say:  "That is my decision, like it or lump it".However, that no longer applies. The people have a right to know how decisions are arrived at and the advice given to Government, because those decisions affect their lives.Have we forgotten why the Freedom of Information Act was introduced in the first place? Have we forgotten the tribunals, the cover-up, and the attempt by many to suppress information for personal and political benefit? The legislation the Government is attempting to neuter, to destroy and to render ineffective was a genuine effort to make the process of Government more open and accountable. It was an effort to restore confidence in the political system and to make the Government and the Civil Service accountable to the people.However this Bill bangs the door in the face of the people, locks it and throws away the key. Just as the Minister did in his speech, it says in the plainest possible terms to the public, the Government will conduct the business of government as  it sees fit behind locked doors. Has the Minister forgotten that the business of government is not just his business but everybody's business?The Minister told us that if Ministers know that their opinions could soon become public knowledge, they might decide they should only make their views known around the Cabinet table and, furthermore, might decide it was unwise to express their real opinion. If the public is not entitled to know what Ministers really think, nothing has any meaning. Has it come to the point that the Government is afraid to speak the truth, that it considers it unwise that the public should be aware of the real situation and that all information should be packaged and manipulated?I should not be surprised at this. I recently posed a question to all Ministers to find out how much money was spent on public relations, press and media advertising. In those Departments about which I received answers, I discovered that in excess of €10 million is spent every year on public relations, press and media advertising. The Government employs more than 80 people in media monitoring and spin-doctoring. The only information to which they want the public to have access is information controlled and managed by Government, but paid for by the taxpayer. That is surely a neat trick.I have grave concern at the proposed definition of "Government" in the Bill. The Information Commissioner, who was not consulted on the changes – one can clearly see why given his recent report – stated:The proposed extension of that definition would admit to the interpretation of the expression "Government" as meaning a committee of officials not one of whom is a member of the Government and indeed some or none of whom may be civil servants of the State.We will not have to put the Irish version of the word Government into the dictionary. In Ireland, Government can now mean un-elected, unaccountable, unknown persons and, unbelievably, we cannot know their real opinion either. This amendment would protect them from any public scrutiny or accountability.The provision of information to citizens is the hallmark of a system that values democratic accountability over administrative convenience. It is the mark of a Government that values sincerity above spin, that employs health care workers rather than media monitors and that recognises that information is power and that power rightly belongs to the people.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. The fundamental principle of freedom of information legislation is to ensure that the public has a right to know how it is being governed. From that standpoint, the current legislation, which has been in place since 1997, has been particularly successful. It has  ensured there is openness and accountability about decisions and deliberations of Government and about the deliberations of civil servants, and it has ensured that individual citizens have had access to personal information held by Departments and various other agencies, including local authorities and health boards. It has been good for democracy and the country. It has also helped balance the propaganda machine the Government has had in place over the past five years, and the propaganda machines of Governments prior to this. As Deputy Harkin said, there are numerous employees of Ministers and Departments. There are also numerous spin-doctors, including a communications unit, to spin the current Government position. The Freedom of Information Act has helped to provide a counter balance to this.One would have thought the successful existing legislation would have continued to operate. Unfortunately, we have seen a disgraceful attempt by the Government to dismantle and undermine the current Act. It is a bad day for the country and for democracy. It is an attempt to keep the public in the dark and promotes a culture of secrecy. The Government has gone about this in a secretive manner. It established a secretive, one-sided, committee of senior civil servants who see the argument only from their own perspective. They put forward recommendations that limit the Act and have given the Government the green light to introduce further amendments that they had not contemplated. There was no demand for this change from Members, the Information Commissioner or user groups. The only demand for this legislation came from a Government that wants to promote a culture of secrecy and keep the public in the dark.The Progressive Democrats are supporting this legislation. This party was elected to Government to act as a watchdog for Fianna Fáil. During the election, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law reform was up poles in Dublin 4 telling us the Progressive Democrats would ensure Fianna Fáil would not get away with anything in the future. The Progressive Democrats have obviously been contaminated by Fianna Fáil and are now more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil itself. We saw the Fianna Fáil Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and his assistant, the Progressive Democrat Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, going to the Cheltenham races while a Bill sponsored by them was introduced in the Seanad. While I have no difficulty with the Deputies going to Cheltenham or any other racetrack, it was an insult to the Seanad and the Oireachtas to have done this.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	306	I oppose this Bill. I have had some limited experience of using the Freedom of Information Act. My only real experience of dealing with the Act came in my early days as a councillor. I found an asset belonging to a local authority had been leased to a private developer in what seemed to be peculiar, suspicious and  unwarranted circumstances. I became highly excited by this, thought tribunals were on the way and considered telephoning Frank McDonald to raise the issue. I grew even more suspicious when I spoke to engineers and local authority officials and they echoed my worries. As a new and highly excited councillor, I thought I had discovered all that was wrong with the world and wanted to take it on. I applied for information on the contract through the Freedom of Information Act. A large parcel of documents arrived a few weeks later. Much to my disappointment, what I had thought to be a den of vipers was a den of incompetence. The decision, which to my mind was wrong, had been made on a proper basis.This example shows how the wide use and interpretation of the Freedom of Information Act protects the State in as many incidences as it exposes it. It protects civil servants from the allegations and opinions that might otherwise get out of hand. In restricting the Act, the Government is making an incredible mistake that attacks the heart of our democratic structures. Has the Government been so long in power that it has become removed from what it is like to be in Opposition or outside the position of power? It is increasingly seen as arrogant, detached and autocratic. It is sad for our democracy and I hope the Government will cast the net as widely as possible when making amendments on Committee Stage.In my experience, openness in Government has only positive benefits. I have experience in the transport campaigning area. I was a passionate campaigner in an NGO and argued for certain developments. I was fortunate that the Dublin Transportation Initiative, the NGO in which I was involved, had a sense of openness and encouraged access to information. While this benefited me in allowing me to make more coherent arguments, it benefited the entire process, including those I argued against, as it allowed a clear and frank discussion on points of real concern. Had that openness not existed, the debate would have been far inferior.In my experience of dealing with the Civil Service, I have found its members to be excellent, independent, well motivated, hard working and intelligent. Due to the nature of the work, the service tends to be conservative, as it should be when it is spending public money. This conservatism is aimed in the wrong direction in this case. I would argue the Freedom of Information Act has benefited the Civil Service.The Government received a report from five civil servants that suggested limited changes to the Act. While I would not agree with these limited changes, the Government disgracefully ran in a range of other changes to the Act. The manner in which this legislation has been introduced and debated speaks volumes of the style of democracy the Government wants to see in this country with which I disagree.It was noticeable before the general election that a prominent member of the Progressive  Democrats referred to Ceaucescu-like State infrastructural projects. If it were not for the Freedom of Information Act, we would not have had the full details of what a bloated and incorrect scheme is the stadium project. If Ceaucescu were to come to power in this State, his first action would be the removal of the Freedom of Information Act. Ministers that said one thing before the election are now doing the opposite.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	307	Let me begin by reminding those Deputies on the Government benches that opposition to the disclosure of information of public interest could be seen as a trademark of a corrupt government. Like my party colleagues who have already spoken on this Bill, I would like to again record Sinn Féin's opposition to the Bill as it will undermine the openness and accountability of Government and public institutions.Freedom of information places a necessary check on government and public institutions, preventing and exposing abuses of power. Those who seek to amend the Freedom of Information Act would have us return to the Ireland of the 1950s, a secretive society where child abuse and corruption were hidden from the public eye. Freedom of information legislation acts as a guarantor of democracy.Like many of the interest groups that have commented on this matter over the past few weeks, I was outraged that the Government failed to engage in real consultation in its review of the Act. The Information Commissioner was not consulted nor were the Government's own FOI advisory groups and many other interested groups such as the NUJ, Opposition parties and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties. Though some of these groups were given the opportunity to present their views to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, I doubt that their concerns will be taken on board by the Government parties.With the exception of the Government parties and the senior civil servants involved in the high level group, there has been widespread opposition and anger at the changes proposed by the Government. No doubt those Fianna Fáil Deputies who were vocal in their criticism of the Freedom of Information Bill in the House in 1997 for not going far enough will not break ranks to stop these retrogressive changes being rammed through.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Section 19 provides that papers of committees of officials will be defined as Government papers which could be exempted from release. This is to be given effect by substituting for the definition of "Government", currently contained in section 19(6), what the Information Commissioner has described as "a much more far-reaching and constitutionally unrecognisable definition."  This will include within the definition of "Government" a committee of unelected  officials. In other words, there will be formal recognition and implicit approval of this committee of unelected officials. Notwithstanding Deputy Eamon Ryan's comments on the Civil Service, the people are entitled to elect the Government on a regular basis as opposed to having it appointed in this unelected form.The Bill contains a provision allowing Secretaries General of Departments to issue certificates that a document is under the deliberative process. This certificate, on which there is no time limit, prevents the release of relevant records from public bodies. This gives greater power to Secretaries General than to Ministers because a Minister can declare a record exempt only if he or she is convinced that the record concerned is of sufficient sensitivity or seriousness to justify doing so. This new provision is open to abuse and could give Secretaries General the power to prevent the public accessing information which they do not want to release. That cannot be right.The exemption for letters between Ministers relating to matters before Cabinet will no doubt save the Government from embarrassments such as that which arose from the publication of letters between the Ministers for Health and Children and Finance late last year. The introduction of fees for information requests is designed to deter individual citizens from making requests and will have the greatest effect on the less well off and those who can ill afford such charges. The legislation creates three new classes of records that will be banned from release.I call on Government Members, many of whom have alluded in their contributions to opposition to the legislation, to have the courage to vote against it because it is not worthy of support.

It is important there is confidence and trust in government in a democracy and freedom of information plays a significant role in building such confidence.The Government's record on freedom of information shows that the number of bodies covered by it has been extended from 67 in 1998 to 370 today. The Government has also pledged that bodies that are still not covered will come under the remit of the Act by 2005.

The new appointee to the position of Information Commissioner is an independent-minded journalist.

That could have been called the parliamentary register of interests Act and it would have been perceived differently.Freedom of information is an abstract concept. No freedoms are absolute however and the Government has an obligation to ensure that. The Government has a duty to govern and, where possible, we should be governed in a manner that pays due regard to the concepts of accountability and transparency. The proposed changes to the Act are measured, exceedingly sensible and will ensure the Government can perform its primary duty. The passage of the legislation is in the public interest but, while it may not be in the interest of the media, that should not be a prime motivating factor in framing the laws of the land. The media have a vested interest in the legislation as the lovely stories and headlines will disappear. The Government is accountable to the people and not to editors, commentators and journalists. They should get off the bandwagon because their argument is not making its mark with ordinary people.Government is all about collective authority and responsibility and that is a constitutional imperative for Cabinet members. It is reasonable and sensible for a Government to enact changes that seek to comply with that imperative. If the Government is to be effective, there needs to be full, frank and free exchanges of views among its members at Cabinet. There have been differences of opinion in every Cabinet since the foundation of the State but when a decision has been reached, the Cabinet has united behind it. The tradition of frankness has been part and parcel of Cabinet exchanges and it would not be right to reveal such exchanges. Who wants to read and  hear about divided Cabinets and Government splits in the middle of negotiations? That would be detrimental to authoritative Government and the effectiveness of the Government would be absolutely undermined to whip up public controversy.The Bill is far-sighted in many ways and if the current legislation prevails, Ministers could become reluctant to express a view where records are kept. However, by extending the period for retention of Cabinet records from five to ten years, it may be ensured that a greater documentary record will be available and it will not be possible to pick tabs out of files from time to time. Future generations will thank us for the Bill because we will have ensured freedom of information will not mean a shortage of information. The road we were going down and the system was such that, when we looked back at Cabinet records, there would be a lapse of information.

I am conscious that it has received considerable airing in the Seanad and in the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, chaired by Deputy Fleming, last week. The original Freedom of Information Act became operational about five years ago, in 1998 and I acknowledge it has made a valuable contribution to democracy in Ireland. It has added a real level of transparency to the operation of Government following a period of much alleged wrong-doing which is now the subject of a number of tribunals. In this manner, the Act has helped to restore a level of confidence to politics in Ireland. The Act, when it was introduced in 1998, applied to just 67 State bodies and today applies to more than 370 bodies. During the past five years, the Act has been used effectively by many to disclose a range of issues which have been of significant public interest. I am confident that many of these issues may never have seen the light of day without the benefit of this Act. Apart from specific issues which the Act brought to life, it brought a culture change. Every Department and public body conducts its business in a different way because it is conscious of the FOI Act. We can get the information we seek from local authorities and others without having to go through the FOI procedure. Information is much more forthcoming.However, after five years of operation of the Act, it is appropriate that the Act be reviewed. I have listened to a number of speakers from the Opposition parties, who have referred to the contributions of speakers from the Government side of the House when the original Act was brought before the House. They have tried to ridicule those original contributions and have tried to show inconsistencies between the original contributions and those which are currently being made. The contributions being made now have  the benefit of the knowledge and experience of five years of operation of the Act. When looking at the amendments to the Act, it is important to do so in a balanced way. The amendments must try to ensure that the Government can operate and govern in an effective manner. However, it is crucially important that the amendment pays due regard to the concept of accountability and transparency. It is of equal importance that the general public has confidence that the Freedom of Information Act remains effective.On the controversial matter of consultation, users of the Freedom of Information Act such as academics, journalists and other frequent users claim that they were not directly consulted about the proposed changes in the Bill. Some of these users have contacted me directly – particularly a number of freelance jounalists – to make these points. The response from the Department of Finance in relation to this specific query was that the Bill was drafted on foot of the Government's consideration of the high level group report, which considered inter alia the report of the Information Commissioner on compliance by public bodies, the Civil Service users network report and the views of the FOI central policy unit of the Department of Finance, which monitors the issues and difficulties arising in the operation of the Act as part of its remit.The views of those with an interest in FOI and frequent users are channelled to the unit on an going basis, including through different conferences hosted and attended by the unit. In drafting the legislation, the Department of Finance also considered the amendments suggested by the Information Commissioner. Therefore, the draft legislation has been informed by the full range of experience and views of the operation of the Act over the past five years. While this is the route and process chosen by the Department of Finance in the preparation of this Bill, I would have preferred to have seen a more direct type of public consultation. I say that not in the knowledge or understanding that I believe the amendment Bill to be flawed, but because it would have commanded greater public confidence. The Minister and the Department chose a different route and it is their prerogative to do so but the amendments they propose do not damage the original Act. Nonetheless, public confidence and perception of the Act may have been different if a different public consultation process had been engaged in. However, that was not to be.The principal changes now being proposed are designed to allow Government to effectively discharge its duties. It is the responsibility of Government to take collective decisions on behalf of all the people. The Government should not be discouraged from engaging in full, honest and frank discussion of all options open when addressing any particular issue. Ministers must feel free to express their views and engage in full discussion. Most people now accept that extending the restriction on access to Government records from five to ten years is appropri ate. Most people realise that, if there is to be full and frank discussion within Government to bring a concept from inception to delivery, the ten year limit is reasonable and strikes the right balance between transparency and the effective functioning of Government. This is not out of line with time limits which we see applied to FOI in a number of other countries, about which we have heard today.
#JohnCreganFF	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-party	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCreganFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I thank Deputies for sharing time. I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill. We had come to a stage where the Freedom of Information Act was hindering the freedom of expression and we had to recognise and deal with that which is why this Bill is before us. The Government has been totally committed to the FOI Act since its inception in 1998, which is proved by that fact that, at that stage just 67 State bodies were subject to FOI requests, and now that has jumped to 370 such bodies.Even after these modest amendments to the Act, Ireland will continue to have one of the most liberal freedom of information regimes in the world. Canada has a 20 year retention rule for Cabinet documents and protection is also provided for ministerial communications in the UK. Protection will be applied, not just to Cabinet discussions, but to non-Cabinet communications between Ministers. This is a natural extension of the doctrine of collective responsibility. The Secretaries General and the Government will ensure that this protection is provided to records which genuinely fall within these categories. Accordingly, the decision to retain information will not be driven by party political motivation.All Departments undertake deliberative processes and the Secretaries General to Departments will decide when the Department's deliberative processes on a given issue are concluded and that the relevant information can be released. The changes in the Bill to ensure that different Departments consult formally before deciding when a process is concluded is another change which is to be welcomed as consistent with the objectives set out by the Government. More certainty is needed as to when a deliberative process has finished and the proposed changes provide for that certitude.Fees have been mentioned by many speakers. Up-front fees for existing provisions provide no real reflection of the cost of administering FOI. Every request for information has a cost in terms of time and money. The process of search and retrieval, the subsequent determination – with due regard to the public interest – of what is relevant and what is exempt does not come cheap. Requests for third party information, in particular, can be especially consuming of resources, requiring, as they do, contact with the third party, a consultative process, submissions arising and an appeals process. While the original FOI Act recognised the necessity for a fee, the practice has been that no charges have been imposed. This is an imbalance and a provision to  enable the Minister for Finance to reverse this is to be welcomed. It must be emphasised that there will be no fee for requesting personal information.The suggestion that the Government is acting out of self-interest is also negated by the provision that exempts the policy making processes of the Opposition parties, where they require State assistance, from the Freedom of Information Act. On briefing notes for answers to parliamentary questions, it is absurd to claim that every piece of background information provided to a Minister should be revealed. The answer itself fulfils the duty of accountability. Ministers might not wish to avail of background information and it might not be relevant.Government needs to be effective and trusted but if it fails in the former, it cannot succeed in the latter. No objective opinion could legitimately regard these changes as being secretive or sinister. Certainly, nobody can accuse the Minister for Finance, who introduced this Bill, of being secretive. No measure that is designed to render the workings of Government more efficient can be regarded as regressive. Presumably, the opponents in the Dáil of this Bill aspire to govern some day. If so, they should realise that collective responsibility is an integral part of government. Indeed, it is a constitutional obligation. To reject this Bill is to reject the notion of collective responsibility. If they do so, they cannot with any credibility offer themselves as an alternative Government.It has been alleged by Opposition Deputies that this Bill is being guillotined. There has been plenty of time to discuss it. However, yesterday and last night I spent much of my time in the House to provide a quorum. This morning, too, I spent a lot of time walking through the lobbies to vote. That is democracy. However, many more speakers could have contributed to this debate if these events had not taken place.

Last week was the ideal opportunity, for those who sought it, to bury bad news. Even so, it is surprising how little attention has been paid to an agreed statement issued by the Revenue Commissioners and a former Member of this House. As war began in Iraq, we learned that a settlement had been reached between the Revenue Commissioners and that former Member for €5 million in unpaid taxes, interest and charges. I refer to former Deputy Charles Haughey. The settlement concerned only relates to those payments to Mr. Haughey revealed by the Moriarty  tribunal. They do not include a previous payment which arose from the McCracken tribunal.Of course, Mr. Haughey is not just a former Member of the House. He held high office over four decades and was elected Taoiseach on four occasions. He led the Fianna Fáil Party for 12 years and was the personification of that party for a generation. If the Minister for Finance were in the House, he would not need to be reminded of this because, to his credit, he is one of those who ultimately came to oppose Mr. Haughey's leadership of Fianna Fáil. We cannot say that of everyone in the present Government.What the McCracken and Moriarty tribunals and the tax settlement this week have revealed is an appalling pattern of government by insider dealing among a so-called golden circle. However, even before we came to know the full details of Mr. Haughey's bizarre lifestyle, we knew that all was not well in Irish public life. The beef tribunal provided plenty of evidence for those who cared to look. That is the reason this House agreed to three legislative measures aimed at restoring trust in public life in this country. The package of reform had three pillars, the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Electoral Acts and the Freedom of Information Act. In substance, each of these measures was a necessary part of the process of reform.It is ironic that in a week when the corruption of the past has been so amply demonstrated, Fianna Fáil should be in the process of dismantling the apparatus of open and accountable government. It is ironic, too, that it should be so amply assisted by the people who made their reputations in opposing Mr. Haughey, the Minister and his friends in the Progressive Democrats. How ready they are to forget. What has really happened in this coalition of the willing between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is that they have made the cynical calculation that the Freedom of Information Act does not preoccupy the ordinary voter.We now know that Mr. Haughey's aristocratic lifestyle was built on untaxed donations from his friends. However, there is more to aristocracy than living in a mansion. There was also the arrogance of unaccountable power and the contempt with which the Irish people were treated. Mr. Haughey did not believe that the rules applied to him or that he should be held accountable for his exercise of power.That aristocracy has given way to another. This is an arrogant Government which does not believe it should be held accountable to the people. Such is its arrogance that neither the Minister for Finance nor the Minister of State could tear themselves away from Cheltenham to attend to their duties in the Oireachtas when the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill was being discussed in both Houses. Such is the Government's unwillingness to be held accountable that, in this Bill, it is systematically gutting the Freedom of Information Act. It is opening up  a wide range of loopholes which it can use to prevent the release of information to the public.We know that the current Government is more than a little uneasy about its connections to the Fianna Fáil Party of the 1980s. The indecent haste with which this Bill is being pushed through the House is undoubtedly related to what might emerge in Cabinet papers were the five year rule to remain in place. In April and May of 1998, the Cabinet was discussing the manner in which revelations about former Deputy Burke should be investigated. We know this is a subject about which the Taoiseach is sensitive. He gave a commitment to former Deputy Burke, who was then a Minister, that under no circumstances would he cause a tribunal of inquiry to be established. When events unfolded that made such a tribunal inevitable, former Deputy Burke resigned. In a fit of pique he resigned both his seat in Cabinet and his seat in the House. The Taoiseach does not want that to be opened up again.This is a SAD Government – smug, arrogant and dishonest. The smugness and arrogance is clear to see and the dishonesty of Fianna Fáil's election campaign is now well established. However, the Progressive Democrats are also guilty. Whatever about looking up every tree in north Dublin, the Progressive Democrats were prepared to climb up every lamp post in south Dublin to proclaim: "Single Party Government? No Thanks."  They promised to rein in Fianna Fáil and to prevent a return to the old days and ways of Fianna Fáil Government. That they would acquiesce in this legislation is a total betrayal of the promises they made to the electorate.Standing in this morning for the absent Taoiseach, who continues his tour of the constituencies, the Minister, Deputy Michael Smith, boasted of winning the general election. However, the Government does not have a mandate for this Bill. The Freedom of Information Act is legislation of a fundamental kind, which conferred new civil and political rights on Irish citizens. The Government was elected only ten months ago and neither of the coalition parties mentioned change to the Freedom of Information Act in their respective manifestos and they cannot come to the House and claim they have a mandate to undermine it. They are now seeking to remove those important civil and political rights from the Irish people, with no democratic mandate to do so. They are abusing their majority in the House to ram through this legislation, with no mandate from the people, no consultation with interested bodies and no intention of engaging in meaningful debate.This is a fundamentally undemocratic exercise. It will result in a significant diminution of our democracy. It will limit the capacity of citizens, including the parliamentary Opposition, to hold the Government to account. That is why Labour has made strenuous efforts this week to obstruct passage of this Bill. We cannot treat this as normal legislation introduced in the normal way. The  Government has gone beyond the boundaries of democratic practice and we cannot acquiesce in that. By conducting a campaign of parliamentary opposition to this Bill, the Labour Party is making it clear that we find the Government's approach unacceptable. We even went so far as to offer the Government a way out. Had the Government accepted our Bill, or were they yet to accept the principle behind it, they would have been able to protect Cabinet papers for another year, while engaging in a meaningful consultation exercise, but they chose not to do so.We were also prepared to engage in a meaningful debate about how to balance the right of citizens to information with other important considerations, including administrative efficiency. The suggestion by Government Deputies that the Act was rushed through, or badly drawn, is a nonsense. The Irish Freedom of Information Act is in fact widely regarded as an example of international best practice in this area. So, we could be confident that a thoughtful and meaningful review, as provided for in the Act itself, would only have resulted in modest adjustments. Instead, we have had no such consultation and a wholesale filleting of the original Act.The Government's intention is clear: it wants to neuter the Freedom of Information Act, purely and simply. It is clear from the evidence provided to the committee by members of the high level group that this is a political initiative. It has been introduced for base political motives and the cloak of bureaucratic respectability, which the Government has attempted to throw over it, has been shown up for what it is.The Taoiseach claimed repeatedly that the changes being contemplated are minor ones, yet previous speakers from my party, and other Opposition parties, have amply demonstrated the falsehood of that claim. No matter how often the Taoiseach repeats it, it will still be false. The detailed provisions of the Act have been exposed in this House, and exposed also by the report of the outgoing Information Commissioner for what they are: a series of loopholes designed to provide ways to hide information from the public. In giving evidence to the Committee on Finance and the Public Service, Mr. Murphy made perfectly clear that the functioning of good government was in no way impeded by the operation or performance of the Act over the past five years.I do not intend to go over that ground again in detail, but I want to pick up on one or two points in the Bill. One of those is the proposed up-front fee for making freedom of information requests, which was brushed off by colleagues on the Government benches as a minor matter. It is not a minor matter. It is abundantly clear that the fee is primarily intended to discourage requests being made in the first instance; that is the point of it. Moreover, it will also alter the practice of providing information outside the Act. There will now be an incentive to tell the citizen to submit a formal request and pay the fee, rather than simply  releasing information which should be in the public domain anyway. The term "freedom of information" will be a hollow one. The Act should, perhaps, be renamed "the information we want you to have, at a price, Act".Recently, the House has seen examples of one Department providing information in reply to a parliamentary question, while another Department refuses to do so. The instinct, still, is to protect and regard information as secret, even if it is of a factual character that ought to be in the public domain.The Minister for Finance has claimed it is necessary that the costs of processing freedom of information requests should be recouped from the requesters. I suppose we should not be surprised that the Minister should take this approach; after all, he has been busy in recent months increasing every charge for Government services that he can think of. The Minister does not seem to possess any concept of the public realm or the common good. He knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. He seems to think Government is some kind of private business, which must re-coup its costs directly from those who use its services. That is not a view I share, but it is even more misguided in respect of freedom of information. Freedom of information is not a service, it is a civil and political right. It is a democratic instrument through which citizens exercise their right to hold the Government to account. Charging an up-front fee for freedom of information requests is like charging an up-front fee to vote in a general election.While the original Act contained a provision for reasonable costs to be recouped for photocopying and staff time, these provisions have been applied unevenly across Departments. Rather than standardising upwards by introducing up-front charges, we should examine ways of ensuring that costs for citizens are keep to a minimum.To suggest that a Government which will spend €38 billion this year, and which employs 30,000 civil servants, cannot manage to cope with the demands of the Freedom of Information Act, is simply not credible. In fact, once training is provided and public sector organisations set up the necessary procedures, the implementation of FOI does not impose a substantial ongoing burden on the public service. I requires a shift in culture and attitudes, but that shift is necessary, anyway, if the public service is to succeed in modernising and reforming itself. The Freedom of Information Act is a catalyst for reform, not an impediment to efficiency. It is striking that the Government has not yet produced any real evidence to the contrary.I also wish to refer to section 4 which amends section 6 of the Principal Act by substituting the word "contain" for the words "relate to". The Government has no option but to amend this provision on Committee Stage. It is simply unconscionable that the Government could persist with this amendment. In doing so, it will materially  diminish the ability of victims of child abuse to access records of direct relevance to them.

Is it not a prime example, however, of what is wrong with the entire Bill? The Government may not have foreseen how its changes would impact on the victims of child abuse, but what else has it not foreseen? In what other circumstances will we find this Bill altering the balance of power between the State and citizens who have been grievously wronged? The whole point of freedom of information is that it empowers ordinary citizens to hold the institutions of Government to account, both in terms of matters which relate to them personally and matters which affect the whole community.I suppose we should be grateful for one thing about this Bill: at least we have been spared the farce of a Fianna Fáil backbench rebellion on this one, which is something we have seen on virtually every other measure that has come before the House.

Such appearances are usually followed by a meeting with the Minister from which backbenchers emerge mollified and reassured by that Minister who has not altered his position one iota. However, as soon as the backbenchers are brought away somewhere for a lecture by the Minister for Finance on the real meaning of what is behind it, the inherent, sagacious profundity of Government is recognised.Fianna Fáil desires to be both Government and Opposition but we have seen no such exercise on this Bill, so we can infer that Fianna Fáil Deputies do not think these changes in the Freedom of Information Act have impinged on the public consciousness. If some of the Deputies who have been running around pretending to rebel on a number of measures felt the average voter was engaged, they would also put pressure on the Minister for Finance to change his mind about this disgraceful measure. The fact that Fianna Fáil Deputies do not recognise the importance of this measure and that, even at this late stage, they have not asked the Minister to back off, does no  credit to them. They have marked the Government's card and they will deliver their judgment in due course. Just as the public has marked the Government down for its dishonesty at the last election, so they are marking them down now for their arrogance and unwillingness to be held to account.The Minister for Finance has made it clear how smug he feels about winning the general election. He seems to think it gives him a licence to do whatever he wishes with reference to no one. The Minister may not care about the next general election, but his backbenchers do not appear so confident. He has done them more harm with this Bill than they yet know.This Bill has been a bad day's work. It has been conceived by an arrogant and dishonest Government whose members are seeking to hide their actions and mistakes from public scrutiny. It is being rammed through the House in a flagrant abuse of the Government's majority. There has been no consultation with interested parties because the Government has no interest in other people's views. Its motivations are base, entirely political and have no basis in administrative or constitutional concerns. It has put eminent public servants up-front to take the flack. It published an agreement on partnership, but as the NUJ pointed out this morning, there is very little evidence of partnership in this measure. The Government is putting through its measure. It sent a Minister into the Seanad who had not even read the Bill and cared less, and not an iota of an amendment was accepted. Is that any way to treat this House merely because it has a majority? To think that the Progressive Democrats are the engine that facilitates Fianna Fáil returning to the old secret ways is especially reprehensible. I wonder what the former Deputy O'Malley thinks about the conduct of his party now.The Government has no mandate for this Bill, which will effectively dismantle fundamental legislation that confers important civil and political rights on the people. They are rights which the people believe they should have. Whether a citizen ever chooses to exercise his or her democratic rights in respect of freedom of information is not the point. Often it is enough that the right is there. The people have given neither of the Government parties a mandate to extinguish those rights. I have no doubt that they will exact a heavy price from those parties whose arrogant presumption it has been to do so.

Everybody would accept that the Freedom of Information Act has been beneficial to the public, the Opposition and Government and to ensuring openness, transparency and accountability in our political system. The Act was not designed to address some of the problems highlighted in the previous contribution. It has transformed the way we do business in this House and  in Government and, more importantly, how the public can get a service from the public service which in the past was secretive, unanswerable and unaccountable. If nothing else, the Freedom of Information Act has at least addressed that issue. There is now accountability in a plethora of public agencies ranging from county councils to health boards right through to the Civil Service. The Act has been of great benefit to people in general.The major users of the Freedom of Information Act are journalists and it has been beneficial to them in carrying our their function of trying to relay to the people what is happening in Government and in the public service. Some exciting stories have emerged in recent years as a result of the Act.When this original legislation was passed it was intended that it would be reviewed at some stage and one has been carried out. People have said that there was no consultation on this Bill, but the fact that we have debated it in the Seanad, in committee and are doing so in the Dáil is what consultation and debating an issue is all about. We meet here as parliamentarians to debate issues. This House is the most important forum for any form of debate and to suggest otherwise diminishes the role we have in this Parliament.The issue of fees for FOI requests is one which the Opposition would like to target, but it does not seem to understand that often spurious requests have been submitted to freedom of information officers in Departments.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	335	There have been very few, only a handful.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	336	In some cases costs of several thousands of euro have been incurred by the Civil Service in processing freedom of information requests which were known to be almost spurious in that there was no targeted request but one which required a trawl through a Department to find out some information or story. That has happened in the past and has cost a great deal of money. The Minister stated that he will examine the fees he will charge and will provide a nominal charge for people who do not have the means to pay the set fee. That is a positive step, which will be appreciated by people who wish to avail of the service but do not have the means to pay the set fee.The rainbow Government when drafting the original legislation must have acknowledged even at that stage that it would not be returned to Government by the fact that it inserted a five year provision. Most commentators would suggest that a ten year limit is a reasonable timeframe for the release of Cabinet documents. The fact that this Government was returned to power after a five year term means that there could be sensitive documentation on issues discussed by Ministers who hold the same portfolio that they held in the previous Government which were due to come before Cabinet prior to a collective  decision being made. The Cabinet is enshrined in the Constitution and collective responsibility is an important plank of Cabinet. We must protect the confidentiality of Cabinet decisions. Memoranda brought to Government may be discussed and referred to a sub-committee. Discussion on these issues surely deserve the respect of having been made in confidence until such time as a decision is made

The previous Government which was in office for five years was returned and, given that it has a large majority, it could run to full term. It is suggested the records of Ministers who have brought memoranda to Cabinet and expressed individual opinions prior to a collective decision being made on an issue should be released. That would undermine the principle of Cabinet responsibility. If we are to have effective Government, Ministers should be free to express their opinions on a variety of issues, not only those that arise in their Departments before decisions are made at Cabinet level. If such documents are released into the public domain, that will not encourage free thinking, debate or individual contributions because they could be misconstrued later where comments were made at the backdrop of a different time. I welcome the ten year provision in this regard.The ten year timeframe is not excessive. A 20 year timeframe applies in Canada and the timeframe in many other countries is more extensive than the ten year timeframe suggested in the Bill. We must address that issue, on which many people have widely commented. For example, does my party want to know what is discussed at the Labour Party Parliamentary Party?

The Front Bench of the Labour Party and Fine Gael have an entitlement to discuss their views in confidence. The same should apply to Government. Its members need to be able to discuss issues, reflect on views, comment on issues, come to a decision and stand by it collectively, and later those records will be released. The five year timeframe suggested is too short.We have come a long way in a short time regarding the accountability of Government. We have had problems in the past, with tribunals being set up to investigate issues, and that has ingrained in the public consciousness the need for open, honest and transparent Government. The Freedom of Information Act is one part of that and the Ethics in Public Office Act is another. The fact that we now have a more targeted view  of what Government is about has endeared itself to the Irish people. I am sure those watching this debate will raise questions about freedom of information. Debate is what the House is all about and it is disingenuous of people to say there has not been wide consultation. The fact is that a high-powered group was set up to review the legislation because it was creating inefficiencies in Government.

Some comments about the incoming Information Commissioner have been very unfair, such as the suggestion she would resign if this Act were passed during her term. It is very unfortunate that we are trying to undermine the new Information Commissioner, who is soon to be appointed and it is regrettable that one of the Opposition party leaders suggested this and undermined her independence. We decide policy and pass legislation and I am confident the new Information Commissioner will act in an impartial and independent manner, as is expected of those appointed to that position. I wish her the best of luck.Regarding sub-committees and officials, Opposition Members who have been in Government know how the system works. A Minister receives a memorandum from another Department for observations and the Minister's officials comment on it; a Cabinet sub-committee may then be set up to examine proposals coming forward from various Ministers. To have any free thinking or credibility the integrity of that process has to be protected so that Ministers can express opinions with confidence. If all those discussions were available to the public, nothing would happen in Government; the Opposition would be highlighting issues day in day out because one Minister said something to another. Ministers do not make decisions. The Cabinet makes collective decisions.Many individuals have benefited from being able to access personal information and that option, whereby an individual can apply for information, has brought a new approach from the public service. For example, once a person had to put in a request for examination information under the freedom of information legislation but now that is made available. That shows the Act is not just of benefit to the individual but, because the public service has acknowledged the Act is in place, it is becoming more proactive in giving out information without having to receive an application.

If we could have used the time allocated for the debate in a constructive manner then more Deputies could have expressed their opinions. I know there are parliamentary tactics used from time to time but calling quorums and manual votes is unfair to Members who want to discuss an important BillThere are swings and roundabouts in politics and at some point colleagues opposite will be in Government; then the test will be whether they change the Act. When they look at how Government works, the proposed changes here, such as the extension of time limits on the release of Cabinet documents and the exemption of ministerial notes from publication, will allow them to express their views in confidence, yet openly and honestly among themselves. It is not a question of whether a party is in Government singly or in coalition; it is a matter of individuals making comments privately and those comments being amalgamated into a collective view. That is what Government is about. Anyone entrusted with ensuring that policies are enacted and that there is proper debate would support these provisions. They would not be worth their salt if they did not, as it would show if they were in Government they would be unwilling to make decisions in the first place.I support the general thrust of these provisions. Regarding the fees, the Minister will ensure that there is a nominal charge for those who may not have the means to pay higher fees. The Minister is anxious that there is some form of charge in order that the service is appreciated and is not abused. A request was once made for the diaries of all Ministers and departmental officials. That would cost the taxpayer thousands of euro.

We had the tripe of "Single Party Government-No Thanks" before the last election but it is evident there is no longer a coalition in Government. We have single party Government and the Progressive Democrats have now become more Fianna Fáil than Fianna Fáil themselves. Wags in Fianna Fáil said in the mid-1980s that the Progressive Democrats would be amalgamated back into Fianna Fáil and that prediction has come home to roost.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Before turning to the provisions of the Bill, I will address the criticism levelled by my constituency colleague, Senator Leyden, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, at the Information Commissioner for comments he made about the Bill. Sadly, neither the Minister nor the Senator read the principal Act which states clearly in section 39, not only that the commissioner may comment on amending legislation, but that he has a responsibility to do so. To be publicly criticised in this Chamber and the Upper House for performing one's duty is hypocritical.The comments of the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, his vocal colleague from Limerick, Deputy O'Dea, and other members of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party, are also hypocritical in light of the statements they made on the original legislation.The amendment in section 4 to section 6 of the principal Act is a crucial element of the legislation which epitomises the Government's objective in introducing it. The section rewrites the rules governing access to personal information. Currently, one can access records which directly relate to oneself. Once the Bill has been passed, one will only be able to access records which contain information about oneself.I focus on this issue because for the past five years I have been trying in the House to obtain information from the Department of Health and Children and various health boards about the case of children who received three-in-one vaccine in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The amendment will mean parents of brain damaged children who are trying to obtain vaccination records will not be able to access the relevant information, namely, the batch and lot numbers of the vaccines. Although they are directly relevant, the files in question do not contain personal infor mation about the individuals affected and will not, therefore, be open to the parents, who will not be able to repeat the historic case taken by Mrs. Margaret Best.On a related matter, Deputy Kelleher, in discussing the types of requests made under the Freedom of Information Act, referred to an application to access all ministerial diaries. I wish to give the other side of that argument. As I stated, for the past six years I have regularly tabled parliamentary questions seeking access to information on behalf of the parents of people with mental handicap who firmly believe their children were brain damaged by a vaccine administered on behalf of the State by the various health boards. In fairness to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, having realised on taking office that I was persecuting the Department, he arranged a meeting to discuss the matter and some work has been done since behind the scenes.Given that I could be considered a rogue requester for persistently trying to track down and access information, the parents in question could be given the same tag when they try to access records through the Department of Health and Children and various health boards. The Members on the Government have not considered this possibility during the debate.The One in Four group, which represents victims of child abuse, has made precisely the same case, pointing out that its members will not have access to relevant records. The same can be said of those affected by the vaccine trials carried out in the mid-1970s. Despite the fact that records may not specifically mention the individuals involved in the trials, they may contain relevant information on the substances with which the children were vaccinated, yet they will not be released under the Freedom of Information Act if the amendment is accepted.The Government is trying to brush the truth under the carpet and hide information which would allow parents to get to the bottom of what happened to their sons and daughters 20 or 30 years ago. I ask Government Deputies to consider this before voting on the Bill later. How will they explain their vote to parents who may approach them seeking records which have been denied because of the changes made in the Bill?
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	354	People throughout the country are asking questions. What does the Government have to hide? What is lurking in the Department of the Taoiseach that is so damaging it must be kept from the people? What does the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform know that we should not know? Why is the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, so nervous?This Government has been in office for six long, wasted years. It inherited a boom which it squandered. It inherited a job market that created 1,000 jobs per week and reversed it. It inherited a culture of openness, transparency and accountability which it is now about to replace with a  culture of secrecy, contempt and silence. The Bill seeks to roll back the immense progress we have made in establishing a citizens' democracy. It is a smash and grab raid on the rights of the electorate to transparent decisions and accountability from its public representatives. For this reason, the Members opposite should be ashamed of themselves.There is so much wrong with the Bill, it is hard to know where to start. There is no single area in which the Government has been particularly brazen. Not content with denying citizens their rights to full disclosure, the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties are proposing to charge them for obtaining the minimal amount of information they are allowed to access.It gives me no great pleasure to inform the House that this shameful, hypocritical and offensive legislation will impose a €20 fee on the ordinary taxpayer just to process a freedom of information application. The Government will argue that this has been done to speed up the process, cut out nuisance requests and help process information to the public. This is not the case. There are two reasons the Government is charging people to exercise their democratic right. First, it needs to raise money because it is broke and the financial position of the country is deteriorating. The fee cannot be described as anything other than a new tax. Second, it wants to prevent freedom of information requests being made. Let us be clear, the Members opposite do not want freedom of information. The introduction of a €20 charge and a potential cost of hundreds of euro if further requests become necessary is designed to put people off making requests in the first place.Let us not forgot that the Freedom of Information Act gave us the accidental release of the Department of Finance's three year strategy of cuts and more cuts. According to documents released to The Irish Times under the Act, the European Investment Bank president, Mr. Philippe Maystadt, warned the Minster for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, on July 2000 of the potential damage to the bank arising from the nomination of Hugh O'Flaherty. The Minister responded by rejecting the idea that the nomination procedures should be changed and called instead for a quick decision in favour of Mr. O'Flaherty's nomination. I remember the controversy well because I was canvassing the people of south Tipperary in a by-election at the time and their reaction to it and the frustration felt.

I appeal  directly to the Minister and the Taoiseach to consider the cost of the Bill in terms of the loss of trust in this House and the Government, the loss of respect for politics, the cost in terms of informed analysis of decision making and the relevance of this House as a Chamber that actively engages with the people.This Bill will not be of benefit to anybody. It will not benefit the electorate, who will be cast into darkness. It will not benefit the media. It will not benefit a councillor, Deputy or Senator, all of whom will be excluded. I urge this House to reject the Bill.
#OlwynEnrightFG	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-party	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-dob	unknown-#OlwynEnrightFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I welcome the opportunity to voice my opposition to the Bill. It is restrictive and particularly cowardly legislation and it again highlights the hypocrisy of many of those on the benches opposite.This Government appears to operate on the principle that it knows best, we do not know what is best for us and we should be grateful to the Government. The words "openness" and "transparency" appear somewhat glib now. People have tired of the phrases but that is because we still have to talk about openness and transparency, which have not been achieved in politics or society. The Freedom of Information Act, in its current construction prior to this Bill being brought forward, was the best possible vehicle to achieve openness and transparency.Government and public bodies exist to serve the people and they are supposed to account to the people for the way they do that. People are entitled to know what is being done in their name and the reason for it. They are entitled to know not just the decisions but the deliberations behind such decisions, even the pros and cons, so that people can understand the reasons they were made. Any arguments to the contrary are arguments against democracy.We are not trying to find out today the reason a Minister took a decision yesterday but about decisions taken five years ago. Deputy Kelleher need not worry about it being a day-to-day issue; it is an issue that will arise in five years. I do not see the danger behind that. There is adequate provision to safeguard against particularly sensitive information, such as issues surrounding Northern Ireland. We have heard a great deal from Ministers about their ability to take hard decisions. Now is the time for them to show us the deliberations behind the so-called hard decisions they are prepared to take.The issue of collective Cabinet responsibility is being used to try to justify this decision. Speaking on the issue during the debate on the Labour Party's motion on 11 March, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated, "While one remains inside, one remains a team player and supports the majority view no matter how convinced one is that the view is not the view one would have preferred to have taken on the day."  He then said that if one vigorously puts one's view and it gets into the public domain, it under mines the ethic of Government and fundamentally weakens the processes by which the Executive arm of the State is required to function. On that occasion the Minister, Deputy McDowell, was speaking about the Cabinet but such comments from a member of the Progressive Democrats are laughable.On this issue a Progressive Democrats Member, Deputy Fiona O'Malley, strongly expressed views against the Bill. She left everyone in no doubt where she stood on the issue. That is what she thought she was doing but we will know where she stands on it at 3.30 p.m. Indeed, the leader of the Progressive Democrats, the Tánaiste, has hardly shown great example to her backbenchers on issues of loyalty and collective responsibility. Who can blame them for thinking sometimes that they are in Opposition with the example they are being shown? We had a perfect example of that last autumn on the issue of the reintroduction of third level fees. Speaking on radio in Cork pre-Nice and in the middle of the kite-flying exercise by the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the Tánaiste took a directly opposite view on third level views to that of her Cabinet colleague. Is that collective Cabinet responsibility?Is it to be the case that the Government can tell us what it thinks at a particular time through the method of the media if it suits it and if it does not suit it, it is protected under this Bill as ministerial communication? The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, speaking on this issue not as a junior Minister in Government but in a personal capacity, wants to make the Bill more elegant in terms of the designation of Cabinet documents. I know what the word "elegant" means but I am not sure of its meaning in this context. People do not want an elegant Bill. They want a Bill that provides openness, honesty and transparency.A particularly serious aspect of the Bill is the effect sections of the public fear it will have on them. Mr. Colm O'Gorman, the director of One in Four, clearly stated that the proposed restrictions would silence and suppress the voices of abuse victims. He said it was crucial for victims to uncover what might be the only supporting evidence about the abuse they suffered while in the care of State institutions. He went so far as to say that the restrictions on personal records, exempting all but records containing personal information, will place severe limits on the ability of abuse victims to complete the healing process.How do the new restrictions proposed by the Government fit in with the Taoiseach's apology to these people in 1999? It makes a nonsense of that apology and it is something that he personally will have to address. These people have spent years overcoming secrecy, lies, ignorance and every other obstacle that could have been placed in their way. They had begun to believe and to hope that there may be a beginning to them getting to the truth and some form of redress for the horrific abuse they suffered. The vast majority of them will say that the truth is more important and  that redress is a secondary issue. Mr. O'Gorman said that these files are so often the only evidence, the only validation that exists of such brutal and hidden crimes, yet the Government intends to close that door to them.This issue raises yet another question, that is, individual Departments' attitude to the Freedom of Information Act as it currently exists. Last February, two different newspapers sought papers from the Department of Finance and the Department of Education and Science on the background to the compensation negotiations between the religious orders and the Government. Interestingly, the Department of Education and Science refused but the Department of Finance obliged. Surely both Departments, operating under the same Act and being asked the same question about the same issue, should have given the same answer. I do not understand the logic behind that and it is something that needs to be addressed.The reason the Department of Finance was happy to oblige was because it wanted to display its Minister's stance on the issue. At one time the Minister took a hard-line stance and said that he believed the package offered was quite inadequate and effectively left the State to bear virtually the full cost of the redress scheme. Why can we not know the response of the Department of Education and Science to this issue? Why did the Minister for Finance change his attitude on the issue? We will not get the answers to those questions if this Bill is passed because it will be restricted for another ten years. That is one of the reasons I believe the Bill is being brought before the House.If the Members opposite want to remove cynicism from politics, which has largely been contributed to by their own party, ably assisted by what I call the new eight-member wing of Fianna Fáil, because the Progressive Democrats is not an independent party in any shape or form, they should accept the proposal put forward by the Labour Party or Deputy Kenny's proposal to at least allow the new Information Commissioner, who I wish well in her job, time to examine the proposals and offer a view on them. If there is nothing to hide, there is no need for it. They are not being asked, as Deputy Kelleher thought, to stand up and account for their actions now but to account for them in five years' time. Why do they not have the courage of their convictions and let their opinions and the reasons behind them be known?
#JohnEllis	unknown-#JohnEllis-party	unknown-#JohnEllis-dob	unknown-#JohnEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	358	We all have our own opinions on information and how it is used and abused on some occasions. With regard to the amendment of the Freedom of Information Act, if Government is to perform anywhere it needs confidentiality. That is the key word as far as this Bill is concerned. In many cases people have to take decisions at Government which they might prefer not to take but are forced into accepting Cabinet responsibility. When people talk about  preventing access to information, they should remember that five years is a very short period for Cabinet confidentiality; it is only the lifetime of the last Dáil. Decisions were taken when I came into the Dáil 25 years ago that, in the interests of the public, should never see the light of day. Ten years is a reasonable period  other countries stipulate 20 or 30 years. The British publish their records every 30 years and many of those who took decisions 30 years ago are still involved in politics. They should be confident that they can take tough decisions in the knowledge that they will not be exposed in the near future. Cabinet confidentiality is the hallmark of Government.If every document in every Department was available under FOI we would all discover things we would prefer not to. There have also been abuses of the FOI, as the Minister outlined. One person submitted more than 100 requests to one organisation in a short period of time.Freedom of information should operate differently, it should run to the person concerned. Anyone who makes a request for details anywhere in State records should have access to his or her entire file. In many cases a person who applies for a file from a Department will only see a sanitised version that does not show who took the decisions that affected his or her life and that is wrong. If an official makes an entry about an individual in a file, that person should have a right of access to that file. In the legal world documents must be provided if they are available, but under the Freedom of Information Act it is not necessary to provide access to the same extent.There is a need for Cabinet confidentiality. Memos from one Minister to another will contain the views of the Department officials as well as of the Minister. To say the same reply should be received from two Departments on one item involving both is illogical because there will be differences of opinion. No two people will agree the same approach to any subject.We need to ensure there is no time wasting because this has been a feature of some FOI requests that were totally off the wall. There are people who make requests of Members of the Oireachtas about information that is already in the public domain but they want a headline for a day or two. This is an attack on democracy because people could become disenchanted with the information that comes out under the Freedom of Information Act.Freedom of information benefits journalists and politicians who could not get the information by other means and it is only fair that is the case. It is unfair, however, that personal information should be made available by means of a leak system where a vague request is submitted that leads to documents being released with names removed while those involved are readily identifiable. That is not in the best interests of freedom of information.In previous debates on FOI, I have said that no matter what way we structure a Bill it will not be acceptable to everyone. Most citizens do not want their representations made public but if I make a representation the contents of a letter from a member of the public can find its way into the public domain. It is now unacceptable for a politician to make a case to a local authority about the granting of planning permission. That is now seen as a submission and there is a charge for it. In some cases people are unable to make their own case and need a politician to represent them before planning officials. People are afraid to put information beneficial to their cases on file because they do not want it made public. I made representations on a person's behalf and afterwards another member of the public asked me why I had done it. The confidentiality of that representation should not have been compromised by someone else reading the file. That is unacceptable and it damages the benefits that flow from freedom of information.Everyone worries about the charges but they are not unacceptable. They cover only a fraction of the cost of a freedom of information request. The average FOI application costs in excess of €400 and there have been cases that have cost up to €20,000. I would understand if the information was of benefit to the individual concerned or in the public interest but in many cases it is of no benefit and is even damaging to some people.The mandatory protection of Government records is vital. Government can only run on a confidential basis and if people can submit FOI requests on forthcoming decisions, it will prevent the democratic process from working and will not be in the interests of citizens or the State. Some might believe it in their own interests to do so, but that is a selfish, personal approach in many cases. Reference was made to communications between Ministers and I consider it imperative that they should remain confidential. In fact, matters are approaching a stage where Ministers and civil servants are almost afraid to put their recommendations on a file, in case it may be dragged out and used at a later stage. We must accept that concern as part of the existing problem. By protecting this aspect of democracy and Government, we are doing the country some service. It is equally necessary to protect reports of working committees and matters of that nature. I do not consider it right that everybody should be in a position to see the working papers of committees or working groups. However, once such work is completed and decisions are taken, it might be in the interest of the public, in some cases, to have the relevant working papers released that might show the reasons certain decisions were taken and certain positions adopted.I referred earlier to the extension of the five year period to ten years in relation to Cabinet records. I reiterate my view that ten years may be too short. The provision for Secretaries General to determine whether a matter is pending or still  in the consultative process is perfectly in order. Essentially, a Secretary General is a full time civil servant, with no axe to grind, who is in the best position to look at how the ordinary citizen is treated. The independence of such officials has been respected by Governments down through the years and, in the light of investigations from time to time, has been found to be beyond reproach by anybody. I have a slight worry that the provision might be used somewhat too often but I have confidence in Secretaries General of Departments, who will have that power.The preparation of Government documents should remain confidential until after decisions are taken and people must accept that. One cannot have government by the media, irrespective of what parties are in power. Government cannot operate on a basis whereby every item of Government business is liable to be in the public domain prior to decisions being taken. I believe that view is widely shared, especially by politicians. Any party in Government would need the protection which is envisaged in the current Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill. It is required for the protection of the workings of Government, which are not as simple as many might believe. Although Ministers may be of the opinion that there will still be too much access to Cabinet proceedings, this Bill probably finds a middle ground in terms of what should be done. In that respect, I believe it will facilitate the needs of most people, including Government, the public and the media. The process which has been followed, especially the work of the high level group established by the Government, has clearly come down in favour of a ten year rule. I believe that is beyond question at this stage. The process has demonstrated the Government's reasonable approach in the matter, in terms of protecting the interests of all concerned, including individuals and the State.I referred earlier to the time limits on the release of records in other countries. In Canada, there is a blanket restriction for 20 years and in the UK it is 30 years for most Cabinet documents. The position in Sweden has been cited, where there are no Government memos but decisions are taken by Ministers on a basis which has already been predetermined in advance of meetings. To my mind, that is not a great way to do business. Documents relating to decisions should be presented to other Government Ministers. The collective responsibility of Government must be protected at all times.The cost of applications under the legislation remains to be determined. A reasonable charge is necessary to prevent nuisance applications, but it should not become prohibitive. There may be certain categories who should be entitled to information of a personal nature free of charge, such as those on welfare benefits or people of very poor means. That should be considered and it would help to allay some concerns in relation to the cost aspect of applications.A freedom of information Act which does not allow any person full access to every document on  personal files relating to themselves needs further consideration. I am aware of cases in which people have suffered very severe financial damage as a result of decisions taken by individuals who were unable to find any fault with their applications but still found means and mechanisms to put them through torture with regard to certain entitlements from the State. All of us are aware of cases where people had to take the legal route. In that regard, the State is actually the main loser, in nine cases out of ten, as a result of matters going into the legal process when they should have been resolved otherwise. The State has not been a major winner when defending suits from the private sector.I firmly believe that every document signed by a civil servant in relation to an individual should be available to that individual. That is not currently the situation  it is somewhat selective. I know people who have sought files and have not been given full information, certain items being withheld with regard to personal decisions taken by individuals within Departments. We cannot stand over that practice and it may need further attention at a later stage. Any official who takes a decision which materially affects somebody's livelihood should be able to stand over that decision and verify it fully. From a personal intervention on behalf of a constituent, I am aware of a file being "sanitised" so that the full information required was not made available, thereby protecting an individual who had taken a decision for personal reasons, based on something which had happened two generations earlier, to destroy my constituent's livelihood. That should not be allowed to happen in future.I support the Bill which I believe will do a great deal to make the process of government much more secure. However, I have a few reservations with regard to the treatment of some applications in the past and their possible future treatment.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Taoiseach said yesterday, in relation to this Bill, that we were wasting time. We have wasted a full week of the Dáil's business debating an amendment Bill which should not even be here. The health crisis is getting worse and insurance costs are spiralling, and we have spent a week on a Bill which should not even be here. It is an insult to the House and is adding to how irrelevant we are getting.It took many years for the Act to get here in the first place. It was a good day for the country when, in 1997, the Government seemed to embrace the information age and our right to it. Everyone, apart from those who were lazy and had something to hide, welcomed the legislation which people all over the western world looked at in envy. It was then, and still remains, a beacon of modern and open government – not for long.For the first time, the people of this country had the right to information held on them by State agencies on a personal or professional basis. It informed us how local or central government made decisions. It went a bit of the way to remove the air of secrecy that went hand in hand with all State institutions. Let us never forget that secrecy is the enemy of trust.The fact that the Act was so long in coming was amazing, considering our history – the hundreds of years of repression and secrecy that went with British rule. It was, and still is, pure arrogance to think that the 1997 Freedom of Information Act, which was introduced as a result of people power by the mothers and fathers, the grandmothers and grandfathers of our present electorate, could be replaced by a Bill which allows the present Government to carry on its business behind closed doors. It is as if we, the people, were some sort of nuisance, a bunch of mushrooms that needed to be kept in the dark and fed a load of manure.This coalition Government has lost the plot to even consider tampering with this Act, which is a basic human right that was hard fought for. The sheer arrogance of this Government, which, by amending this Act, will take away the right to information of the electorate, is beyond belief. It is as clear as day that it is catering for its own selfish needs, the need to bury evidence to safe itself embarrassment and uproar from the citizens of this country who would, once and for all, uncover the evidence that proves this coalition Government is incompetent and irresponsible.Does the Minister expect us to believe that this Government will work better as a result of this Bill? I know I am young, but I stopped believing in fairytales a long time ago. There have been too many years of smokey back rooms where brown envelopes bought information. I am worried that this Government could bring us back to those bad old days, which brought us to where we are today, with tribunal after tribunal, inquiry after inquiry. While it is great to see so much information coming from these inquiries, the fact is that if the 1997 Act had been in place since the foundation of the State, we would not have needed all those costly tribunals in the first place or needed to be here taking up more Dáil time.Of what is the Government afraid? What skeletons has it put in its cupboards? People on the streets are asking if it is buying time to extend our prison capacity before this information is let into the public domain. If it has nothing to hide, what is this about? No wonder they feel it is to keep people out of prison.Freedom of information is a basic right. It is as much a right as the air we breathe. The 1997 Act is our Act, the people's Act, and should be part of the Constitution, just to stop any Government from tampering with it. Natural justice and democracy are what we are talking about  the right we all have to know how we are governed and how our money is spent.The coalition's track record in Government and its mismanagement of the Celtic tiger has left the country wondering what devious information it is hiding and how far it will go to hide it. If it cannot carry on the business of Government or if it is not happy to do it with the Act in its present state, then it has no right to be in Government. Of what is it afraid? What has it to hide? I would relish the opportunity to continue, but I want to give way to my colleague.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill. My speaking expresses, in particular, the arrogance of the Government in not allowing us to debate this Bill properly. I am getting two minutes, having prepared and studied the Bill over the past two and a half hours. I studied it carefully and read all the debates, and I am now getting two minutes. There are colleagues behind me, in my party and in other parties, who will not even get the opportunity of debating the Bill. Often we are criticised for not participating in debate, but when we offer to do so and want to do so on an issue of great public concern, we are shut off.The Bill, not to mention the guillotine used twice in the Seanad and again today, reveals the Government's arrogance, as does the fact that there was no consultation about this Bill with the Information Commissioner. We heard the row that took place around that with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.There was no consultation with the National Union of Journalists which has a particular interest in this area. The Government of consultation did not consult the journalists in an issue of vital importance to them. It did not consult with the politicians, who supported this five years ago, and did not consult with the public. There was no consultation whatsoever.The Government is ignoring the call by the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for more time and significant amendments. Surely a committee of both Houses, which had a strong view and requested more time and significant amendments, should be listened to? It is not being listened to.I see you have given me the nod to conclude, a Cheann Comhairle. The treatment of the Information Commissioner is a disgrace. The denial of the right of Members of the Oireachtas to put views on the record of the Dáil on this issue is a disgrace. I am forced by the Minister and the Government to finish before putting all my views on the record.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. I welcome the opportunity afforded by the debate on this Bill to set the record straight about the Government's position on freedom of information.Despite the dramatic pronouncements of some Deputies, the Government's position is quite  reasonable and quite straightforward. This is not a draconian rolling back of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. Rather, it is a sensible and balanced package of measures being brought forward on the basis of five years of experience of operating the Act.Its core objective is to strike the correct balance between openness, transparency and accountability in Government, on the one hand, and the effective functioning of the Government process on the other hand. This derives from the core premise of the Bill which is the principle that it is in the public interest that the institution of Cabinet works well and effectively.As I stated in my opening remarks, the FOI Act has had a major positive impact on delivering better government in Ireland. It has improved the quality of public debate and has opened up access by the public to information held about them. It has also played an important part in public service reform in Ireland and has helped to inculcate a more open attitude across the public service to the release of information which previously would not have been readily available.I assure the House that there is no question of moving away from what has been achieved since the introduction of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. This is not the purpose of the legislation we have presented to the Oireachtas. The Government's Bill is a carefully balanced package of proposals which preserve the basic objective of freedom of information, while ensuring that Government can continue to conduct its business in an effective manner in accordance with the public interest.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	365	The need to provide protection for Government records was recognised in framing the 1997 Act and such protection is a general feature of FOI regimes internationally, where limits of between ten and 30 years apply. The question of the appropriate period of protection was considered by the high level group which concluded that, "As experience is gained in the operation of the Freedom of Information Act, it is evident that a five year moratorium on the release of Cabinet records is too short."  In increasing the period of protection for Government records to ten years, the Government's Bill is ensuring that the Cabinet system of collective responsibility can function effectively without being undermined by premature disclosure of sensitive information.With ten years, Ireland will still have an FOI regime which is liberal by international standards. The objective of the provisions dealing with interministerial communications on matters relating to Government business and working groups operating in direct support of Government is the same  to ensure that the Government process is protected where matters are delegated for resolution between Ministers or for more detailed consideration by working groups of officials.I turn now to some of the issues raised by Deputies during the course of this debate. Many Deputies raised the question of access to personal information. As I have explained in both this House and the Seanad, following a High Court case in relation to this issue there is a considerable lack of clarity and consistency.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The Government's sole intention in bringing forward this measure is to achieve greater clarity and to bring consistency to the issue. Arising from the outcome of the High Court judgment, decision makers are frequently confronted with a difficult and confusing situation that needs to be resolved. Having explained both in this House and in the Seanad the reason behind the change, I want to reassure Deputies that there is no change in the definition of personal information in the Act and there is no intention to restrict the individual's right to access to personal information. If, however, Deputies have any suggestions which would have the effect of achieving the required clarity and consistency in this area, I would welcome them on Committee Stage.In his contribution to the debate, Deputy Richard Bruton asked whether it is the case that there is to be no right of appeal over the question of policing collective responsibility. I would like to point out to the Deputy and to the House that all the provisions contained in section 12 of this Bill aimed at protecting the workings of Government are subject to independent oversight by the Information Commissioner. Deputy Boyle stated that the Bill before the House did not contain any provisions that improved rights of access for individuals. This is simply not the case. The Bill improves access rights in the following areas: by allowing a right of appeal to the Supreme Court—

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	369	—by providing the Information Commissioner with discretion to accept late applications for review from individuals; and by introducing via an amendment, as indicated, the right of the parents of a minor or a disabled person to have personal information amended where the information is incorrect, incomplete or misleading and the right to information about reasons for decisions affecting their child.Deputy Kenny and others expressed concerns about the provision for certification of the deliberative process. The question of whether a deliberative process has ended or not can be difficult. The Government has decided that more certainty is needed in this area so that records relating to ongoing deliberations of Depart ments are not released into the public domain prematurely in such a way as to undermine the process of government. Under the provisions of the Bill, the Secretary General of a Department will decide whether a deliberative process is still in progress. Where he or she decides that the deliberative process is still ongoing, the Secretary General will issue a certificate and the relevant records will not be released. At the end of the deliberative process, the Secretary General will revoke the certificate and the records will be released. This provision applies only to Government Departments, which comprise only 15 public bodies out of a total of 370 covered by the FOI Act.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	370	That is not true.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	371	In issuing certificates, Secretaries General will need to be fully satisfied that a deliberative process is clearly ongoing. Secretaries General are responsible people in charge of complex organisations and we can rely on them to discharge this function responsibly.I do not accept the point made by Deputy McManus that the certification process by a Secretary General of a Department will undermine the powers of the Minister. The Public Service Management Act 1997 gave significant new powers to a Secretary General, which would previously have been those of the Minister. This is an extension of that principle. The framework for modern government recognises that Secretaries General have a distinctive role in their own right. One could argue that this may give rise to clashes between a Minister and a Secretary General; however, the same could be said of the Public Service Management Act.Deputy Howlin seemed to imply that the Government would not be extending FOI to areas already covered. As I said in my opening speech to the Seanad, the Government has made significant extensions to the remit of the original Act, firstly by extending it to local authorities and health boards, then to voluntary hospitals and subsequently to numerous other State agencies, bodies and institutions, including those in the enterprise, broadcasting and third level education sectors. By extending FOI throughout the public service, this Government has ensured that it has become a permanent and valuable feature of public administration in this country. The Government has committed itself to a continuing programme of extensions, with the aim that by the end of 2005 all bodies, organisations and groups appropriate for inclusion will be covered.Deputies Crowe, Cuffe and McManus criticised the introduction of up-front fees. I have already set out the Government's position on this in some detail. FOI does not come free: the average cost of processing an FOI request in my Department is of the order of €425. It is only right that there should be some recognition of this cost and I remind the Deputies that the up-front fee will not  apply to personal information. As I have already indicated, the fee will be modest, and I am prepared to consider providing for a reduced level of fee in cases of hardship.A number of Deputies raised concerns about the protection of records of working groups supporting the Government. This measure provides for exemption of records of a committee of officials set up specifically to assist deliberations on matters before the Cabinet where the committee is mandated to report directly to the Cabinet. In order to ensure that such protection is only afforded to records which genuinely fall within the categorisations mentioned, the Bill provides that the Secretary General to the Government must certify that the committee concerned meets the relevant requirements. This is a reasonable and prudent measure aimed at ensuring that reports of such committees provide the Government with comprehensive advice, expressed in totally frank and candid terms, on the complexities of the issues under consideration.

#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	373	A number of Deputies have also raised the issue of protection for briefing papers for parliamentary questions. Ministers have direct accountability to the Oireachtas and its various committees. In order to be briefed fully before appearing in either House, Ministers require the full range of views and opinions from officials and advisers on the various complex issues involved, expressed in a totally candid and frank manner. It is clearly not in the public interest for Ministers to be in receipt of anything less than frank advice. The same argument applies in the case of briefing material for parliamentary questions. Accordingly, the Act provides for a prudent protection for such records.Contrary to what has been suggested in this House, it is an undeniable fact that the measures in the Bill do not radically alter the purpose or intent of the original legislation. Certain provisions relating to very specific and sensitive areas of Government activity are being reformed to protect and improve the process of government and a number of other technical amendments are being made. There is no other agenda. The Act retains its primary purpose of enabling members of the public to access information to the greatest extent possible, consistent with the public interest and the right to privacy. In conducting reviews, the Information Commissioner will continue to be legally bound to treat a refusal of a request for information as unjustified. I look forward to further debate on Committee Stage.

I know the Minister will save about €10 million on the scheme but it is yet another cutback in addition to the cutbacks we have already seen in the FÁS back to work scheme. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, was in the Minister's Department at one time and he introduced the "dirty dozen" cuts. This Minister has now brought in 11 "dirty" cuts and has nearly reached a dozen. In recent months, her Department has been making one cutback after another but it is wrong to do that to people. Is it fair for a Department to break a contract that someone has entered into? The affected people will have to go to social welfare offices in mid-summer when they will be asked to produce three or four letters. When they bring them in they will be told that they are still not looking for work, so they will have to obtain money from their community welfare officer. Such people are already trying to better themselves through education and they are trying to get off social welfare. If they obtain the necessary education they will not be reliant on the social welfare system. The system is wrong and the Minister should change it immediately. We should go back to the old arrangement whereby such people were paid during the summer months. The new plan represents a further cutback by the Minister's Department, which is mean and unfair. The Government should revert to the previous payment system.

Perhaps his mathematics are not as good as those of other Members, however, when one considers the increase of €530 million in this year's budget package, as well as an increase in recent years of €1.2 billion in one of the largest departmental budgets.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	392	This is a cutback.

It is important to say that because there has been some misinformation. People on postgraduate programmes who are in the scheme will remain in the postgraduate programme. Economic constraints have meant that I have had to re-evaluate some of the priorities in the Department. As I said in my reply, I have revised  and reviewed the back to education allowance scheme. The scheme is not means tested once one is in it. A person's eligibility criteria are based on unemployment, lone parent and many other allowances. Those who were studying were also getting the allowance every week and, in the main, people were also working.In order that people will not be economically disadvantaged, if they are not in a position to find work in the summer they will revert back to their existing payment, which was their eligibility criterion in the first place. As there will be very few changes in circumstances, I would assume that over a two to three-year period, people will revert to what they will be eligible for.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	396	There is a groundswell of anger directed against this cutback, which is perceived as an insidious attack on vulnerable people. Was the rationale of the back to education allowance scheme not to assist people who had worked for 26 weeks or more to get a foothold in the labour force by improving their skills and qualifications? For many people this represented an opportunity to rupture a cycle of unemployment they might have been in for a long period and get back to work. Why has the Minister changed a winning formula? Why has the application of the scheme been curtailed? It is just another exercise in implementing another cutback by stealth – an attack on vulnerable people. It is particularly insidious, given that many people's plans have been torpedoed in mid-stream due to the curtailment of payments during holiday periods and the fact that there are no allowances to cover postgraduate courses.The Minister may empathise with someone in the following circumstances: a married woman with two children who is studying as a second-year arts degree student at NUI, and is currently in receipt of the back to education allowance. She now wants to break out of that cycle by studying for the H.Dip. in Education, but will she be covered for that higher diploma course? This question is of critical importance to people in such circumstances. Those are the type of technical problems that arise when the Minister takes a swipe at the back to education allowance scheme. The Minister should understand this problem. How much is being saved by this measly cut? She is saving nothing in real terms yet it is impacting adversely upon a huge number of mature college  students, including single parents on low incomes. Will such people be allowed to proceed with their education plans or will the cutbacks defeat the whole purpose of the scheme? Approximately 6,800 people qualified for the scheme this year. This mean and niggardly cut will only save a few euros, yet it represents a severe imposition and an unwarranted impediment for those who are trying to improve their lot. On their behalf, I appeal to the Minister to reverse this cutback.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The purpose of the back to education allowance scheme was to provide second-chance education. That will still remain, be it a second-level qualification, such as the leaving certificate, or a primary degree. However, the Deputy has raised another issue. Perhaps the Deputy did not hear my response. I said that I will ask my officials, which I have done, to liaise with the relevant bodies to identify specific postgraduate courses such as the H.Dip, which add significantly to a person's employability, to which the back to education allowance should continue to apply. In other words, if one wants to be a teacher, one needs a H.Dip. If there are other specific cases the Deputy wishes to raise with me, I will consider them.I am not in a position to reverse the postgraduate scheme. We have been in a position to give people a second chance to help them to progress. The idea is to give them a second level education and, hopefully, they will move into a third level primary degree and at that stage use the skills they have acquired to move into the workplace. Most people who have a primary degree are able to do that because they have certification. In the context of one or two courses which we have to evaluate in consultation with other bodies, we will do that and revert to the Deputy.

The fact that many people are getting money from community welfare officers is saving the Department money. When people bring letters into the Department they are not accepted. Department officials say there is work for these people, but that is not so. These people have to go through an appeals mechanism which in some cases have taken six to eight months or up to a year. Is this practice an excuse by the Department to save money?

I ask the Minister to specify how much money is being saved by the application of this insidious cut – it is nothing more or nothing less. It is hitting the poorest of people, those who are marginalised and on a low income who have an opportunity to participate in education. Education is important in providing people with an opportunity to lift themselves up. I appeal to the Minister to return to the Minister  for Finance with our support and secure the necessary money, be it €8 million or €10 million, to help these people.

I have garnered from debate in the Seanad and in the House that there is a perception that a primary degree is no good, which I find disturbing. I do not believe that is true because otherwise one would require a postgraduate qualification to move into the marketplace. I do not agree that is the case. Few Members of this House have postgraduate qualifications and they have done quite well. The Department has given the people concerned what they need, which is a leaving certificate to move into a third level qualification certification.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Social protection, as described in EUROSTAT reports, on "The Social Situation in Europe" covers not only the income support schemes administered by my Department, but also health care, supports with housing and other social and family services.The latest EUROSTAT figures on social protection expenditure were released in February  2003 and deal with developments up to and including 2000. It is important, therefore, to recognise that it does not take into account the substantial social protection expenditure which this Government has introduced over the past two years.In any examination of this type of data, it is important also to recognise that, although there is a reasonably close relationship between social protection expenditure and GDP per head, different expenditure levels among member states do not necessarily reflect accurately the differences in the spending priority assigned to the well-being of citizens.It is also the case that gross expenditure measures can distort the real picture, as they do not take account of social charges or taxes which may be levied on benefits. Nor do they include transfers made by means of tax concessions or allowances, as opposed to direct cash payments.It is also the case that social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP is significantly influenced by the pace of economic growth and the level of unemployment. For example, in the three-year period 1990 to 1993 EU social protection expenditure as a percentage of GDP rose on average by over 3% from 25.5% to 28.8%, as a result of the slower rate of economic growth and rising unemployment during that period. Conversely, over the five-year period 1994 to 1998 the percentage declined slightly to 27.7%, due to renewed economic growth and a decline in unemployment during that period.For Ireland in 1990, expenditure on social protection as a percentage of GDP was 18.4%. This rose to 20.2% in 1993, and then declined to 14.7% in 2000. These changes mirrored the developments just described in other EU countries, except that the level of economic growth and the decline in unemployment were much greater in Ireland than in most other EU countries. Annual rates of growth ranged from 8% to 11% in the period 1994 to 2000 and levels of unemployment declined from 14.3% to less than 4% over the same period.Other factors which have a bearing on the amount of expenditure are the extent to which the State provides supplementary pensions, child care and elderly care and the way benefits are taxed. Lower State involvement, means lower social protection expenditure.Additional informationUnder this Government there have been sustained and substantial increases in social protection expenditure. The EUROSTAT report on social protection states that the increase in real terms in expenditure on social protection in Ireland over the period 1993 to 1999 was, “well above the average.”  EUROSTAT figures show a 21.4% increase in the per capita expenditure on  social protection in the period 1995 to 2000 compared with an EU average of 8.7%, and over the longer period of 1990 to 1999 an increase of 50% in real terms compared with an EU average of 24%.There is scope for further improvements in Ireland's social protection infrastructure and we must try to maintain economic growth and competitiveness to enable us have the resources to continue making these improvements.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	410	That was a fairly robust defence of an unacceptable situation. I am not sure whether the Minister is arguing that because Ireland has had economic prosperity it needs to spend less on social protection expenditure, or that because the figures were taken in 2000 we will have caught up by now. We cannot have it both ways. Either we are a well-off country that does not need to make this type of expenditure or we have put in the money since.The Minister did not mention in her reply that Ireland has the greatest wealth disparity in the European Union. Therefore, our reasons for having a higher social protection level of expenditure are greater than other European Union countries. Even if there has been greater expenditure by Government since 2000, with which I would argue – we will know the position when the figures come out – we have not made up a 40% gap since then. I tabled this question because we have a figure which puts us in European terms in a unacceptably low position and it is a challenge for the Minister to argue with her Cabinet colleagues to make sure that we have a proportionate rate of social protection expenditure that any decent society should allow and make provision for.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I agree that there will always be scope for improvement in Ireland's social protection infrastructure. We must try to maintain economic growth and competitiveness to enable us to have the resources in the first instance to continue the improvements that have been made.We are not comparing like with like in comparing the position here with other EU countries. The level of unemployment here has been reduced considerably. The demographics are different between ourselves and our European counterparts. In particular, they would have concerns regarding their elderly and our pension service is different from that of other EU countries. Therefore, there are difficulties in comparing like with like in that regard.The Deputy could say that previously the level of expenditure might have been higher as a percentage of GDP, but people were not well off and we had to look after a greater number of people. Now we are looking after fewer people, but we have different support schemes and mechanisms in place. I am sure all Members would agree that having a job is the best route out of poverty. The  necessary network and support services are in place. We will achieve the goals set under NAPS in the next number of years and we will consider making a greater investment in social protection over the next number of years. I would like to see that happen, as would any Member of the House. We will be moving towards increased intervention over the next number of years as the economy, hopefully, will continue its growth and competitiveness in order to have the resources available to increase the level of social protection.

If we achieve 70% to 90% of the European average, would that constitute success? Is it something worth aiming for or are we just going to wait and see what happens until we perhaps find in a future study that we are at 50% of the European average?

It is our intention to achieve targets which have been set out in the NAPS strategy, which will reflect an increase in social protection and a different percentage when we come to investment. However, there is no way I will nail my colours to the mast in giving Deputies opposite the actual favourable percentage we see social protection forming as part of our GDP. There has been a huge improvement in the last few years, rates have increased and there has been targeting. Given our different demographics it is difficult to compare ourselves with the EU, particularly when we look at the elderly population and the serious concerns expressed by many EU members about demographic imbalances in particular.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	414	Dental benefit is provided to insured workers through a panel of dentists who enter into agreements with my Department to provide treatments under the scheme on a contract basis and at fees specified in the agreements. Under these arrangements, and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patients either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates.From the beginning of August 2002 my Department ceased to accept claims from dentists who were imposing increased patient charges in breach of these arrangements. Patients were advised at that stage to check that their dentist was continuing to operate within his contract with the Department and, in cases where this was not  so, they were advised to use my Departments LOCALL service to get details of dentists adhering to the agreed fees for treatments.Patients were also advised that the Department would not be in a position to refund any costs arising from treatment provided to them as private patients. The LOCALL service was operated to ensure that patients could secure treatment from dentists still operating the scheme.Patients had the choice of using an alternative dentist where their own was in dispute, or deferring treatment where possible pending a settlement, or being treated by dentists who had ceased to operate the scheme. There is no provision for payments under the dental benefit scheme in respect of patients who chose to take treatment from dentists operating outside the boundaries of the dental treatment benefit scheme. The fee which is payable to dentists by patients is the net amount taking account of the Department contribution which is to be subsequently recouped by the dentist. In the course of the dispute, some dentists charged fees which were considerably in excess of the agreed levels. This was in clear breach of their contract and there could be no question of the Department's contribution being paid to dentists who acted in that way. The position in this regard was made clear at the outset, as was the fact that the Department could not make refunds directly to patients in these circumstances.Patients who received treatment from dentists who were not participating in the scheme did so outside the scope of arrangements for the provision of dental benefit and are not entitled to compensation under the scheme.

Has the Minister received legal advice on this issue? These people paid their PRSI and obeyed the law of the land. The Minister is the insurance broker but when they claimed their insurance she did not pay it. Has she received legal advice on this?I put down a parliamentary question on this, asking the Minister's Department to identify the dentists taking part in this scheme. She refused to give me that information and I have now requested it under the freedom of information legislation. Why did she not give me that information? Most people have complained to me that the dentists they had to attend were too far away from them, which is wrong. It is wrong that people will have to take legal action against the Government. They paid their dues and insurance and the Minister failed to honour her commitments. She is only the broker who collects PRSI from the people and when they wanted their money back, she did not pay them. That is wrong according to any law. Has the Minister taken legal advice as to whether people can get what is  due to them? She should compensate these people.

In press releases, interviews, letters and advice to people I have stated that there was a dispute with the Department and I was not in a position to pay dentists outside the scheme.

The school was first sanctioned by the Labour Party Minister for Education, Niamh Bhreathnach, and has fought its way over a nine year period through the morass of financial and planning obstacles to get to this advanced stage. I compliment the board of management of the school and its principal, Ms Rita Galvin, and her staff on doing such a fine job in difficult and unsuitable circumstances for the past nine years. Their dream of a new modern school with all the required teaching aids and facilities is now nearly a reality – so near and yet so far.They are still operating out of cramped and  unsuitable prefabs and may have to stay in them. The new school will have eight new classrooms, two special needs resource rooms, a library-computer room, a general purposes room, a principal's office and a staff room. This state of the art facility has already cost €3.5 million of taxpayers' money and this is why I raise the issue.This is a classic case of spoiling the ship for a ha'penny worth of tar. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, representing the Fianna Fáil wing of the Government has decided in his absolute wisdom not to provide any funding for furniture for the new school, as he informed me on 22 February 2003:The level of funding for the provision of furniture is set out in my Department's 2003 capital programme. On the basis of the budgetary allocation it was not possible to include any replacement furniture for Kildare Educate Together school, and the school must use their existing furniture in the new school.The cost of the furniture required – and I stress "required" is €140,000 or 4% of the total cost already spent. While some of the old, well-used seats and desks can be transferred from the old school's classrooms, no furniture is available for the library-computer room, the two special resource rooms, the staff room, the office or the general purposes room. No provision has been made for blackboards for the new school and none is available from the old school. It must be an entirely new concept in the provision of educational facilities that schools will no longer be provided with furniture or blackboards. That beggars belief. What next – hospitals with no beds?This is a shambles and a waste of €3.5 million of taxpayers' money which has already been spent. I demand on behalf of the board of the school that it be given clearance by the Minister to purchase the required furniture to allow the new school to come into use with no further delay.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I am glad that the Deputy has given me the opportunity of outlining to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position regarding the allocation of funding for schools building projects. The 2003 capital programme has now been published and full details in relation to individual projects are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The programme is designed to give the maximum amount of information to managers, boards of management, principals, parents and students. The criteria used for selecting projects have also been published for the first time. It is time we had transparency and a clear understanding of how projects are selected and so forth.This year's building programme amounts to €342.9 million, four times the amount allocated in 1997. The 2003 programme will deliver some 40 large-scale projects at primary and post-primary levels. In addition, more than 400 schools will benefit in some way from the capital programme and all primary schools benefit directly from the devolved grants scheme for minor works.The Department of Education and Science has grant aided the provision of the new school building for North Kildare Educate Together which is now nearing completion. The Department has also recently advised the school that it can apply for a once off start-up grant of €6,500 for the special class for children with autism.Based on the budgetary allocation, a sum of €1.2 million was allocated towards the cost of providing furniture in primary schools in 2003. The Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that it is not possible, at this stage, to provide grant aid towards the cost of replacing the furniture at the school.

I cannot understand the reason the shortfall was not identified prior to the allocations being made. As the House will be aware, the budgetary year is now the calendar year and allocations have already been made. Deputy Stagg is evidently not asking that funds be held back on other projects.Members will agree there must be a better way of doing business than investing €3.5 million in a project and finding one has not sufficient funds to complete the project as one would wish. The Deputy indicated some of the furniture could be reused and there were certain special areas – I understand the computer and library facilities – for which no furniture will be available to be reused. I hope the school will be able to maximise the use of available furniture in the other areas, including offices, to which the Deputy referred.The school may use funds allocated by the Department of Education and Science under the terms of the grant scheme for minor works. If it has not yet made an application under the scheme, I suggest it does so without delay. I assure the Deputy I will speak to my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to seek creative ways to ensure the purchase of additional furniture can be provided using such funds, provided they are not required for more urgent and immediate works in the school. I hope this will not be the case given that the school is newly built.I ask the Deputy to work with the school to see  if we can use these funds to supplement the €6,500 to which I referred. I will speak to the Minister to see if there are other innovative ways to assist the school. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter on the Adjournment and giving me the opportunity to outline the current position.

Specifically, the Department of Education and Science, under the guise of a review, has not paid the minor works grant to primary schools. Already, many parents, teachers and pupils are reeling from the news that hundreds of primary schools throughout the country will remain in their rundown, dilapidated state for many years to come. I understand nearly 400 schools are listed as being at the architectural planning stage, which gives some idea as to the extent of the backlog in the primary schools building programme.In addition to this already unacceptable situation, the Department has initiated a review which it has used as a means of withholding the minor works grant. The grant amounts to €3,800 per school, plus a payment of €12.70 for every pupil. I understand it is proposed that the Department will pay only the pupil element of the grant in May this year and will hold back on the €3,800 to every school.Such a decision would affect all schools, but smaller schools would be worst hit. A school of 100 pupils would see a reduction in grant aid from €5,070 to just €1,270, in other words, a cutback of €3,800, a significant amount of money for a small school. The income of a large school with 500 pupils would decline to €6,350 from €10,150. Loss of income is substantial in both cases, but smaller schools, often in rural areas, will be hardest hit.This money is paid to schools for the ongoing repair and upkeep of buildings which include painting, replacing windows or doors and the maintenance of playgrounds. If this money is not paid, health and safety issues which cannot be dealt with by many schools may well arise. The issue is serious and cannot be ignored by the Minister. Failure to undertake minor repairs creates a false economy as they quickly become major repairs if not attended to promptly.The Minister is aware that many schools are waiting anxiously for this money. Some schools are operating in the red, paying interest to banks and waiting for the money to arrive just to balance their books. Other schools cannot plan for any repair work, no matter how urgent. If, for example, a school was to be painted in July, it  would need to book a painter or decorator now. If many repairs are to be carried out during the summer, contractors would have to be notified and booked by now. Schools cannot do this and are, therefore, unable to plan.The current position is untenable in 2003. The withholding of moneys schools are expecting and for which they have budgeted, is unacceptable. It does not matter which word one uses – cutbacks or adjustments – the end result is the same. The payment of the grant is in serious doubt. This kind of penny-pinching is undermining the capacity of schools to function effectively. I ask the Minister to immediately inform the boards of management of primary schools that the minor works grant will be paid immediately so that schools, instead of expending considerable energy trying to balance the books, can get on with their real business, namely, educating our young people.

The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, sends his apologies. He would like to have come to the House but is, unfortunately, tied up on other business. I am glad the Deputy has given me the opportunity to outline to the House the Department of Education and Science's current position on the grant scheme for minor works. The position was set out clearly in the 2003 schools building programme, published in January and available on the Department's website.The programme shows that €18.1 million has been provided for the payment of the full grant under the minor works scheme. I recognise and appreciate the Deputy's comments on the number of schools that warrant sanction under the scheme. Unfortunately, successive Governments have failed to invest sufficient moneys in the system. The current Minister has, for the first time, secured and ring-fenced money so we will see a genuine start to efforts to deal with some of the necessary works.The programme also identifies that there are two parts to the grant, €12.5 million for payment of the standard grant of €3,809 to each school and €5.6 million for payment of the per capita element which works out at €12.70 per pupil.The published programme also made clear that an expenditure review of the scheme, involving inspections of up to 300 schools, would be undertaken in the early part of the year. The purpose of the review is to ensure that the best use is being made of these funds by schools and to adjust the scheme in line with any recommendations that may arise from the review. The review is about ensuring best practice and making the scheme as effective as possible.The published programme states that the review is in the context of maintaining overall expenditure on the scheme at the same levels as  in previous years. Arrangements for this review are being finalised and it is intended to complete it before the end of the current school year. I thank the Deputy again for giving me the opportunity to provide some clarity on this issue.

In the last two replies from the Minister he stated clearly that his Department is currently in discussions with Department of Finance representatives regarding a proposal from local authorities in the north-east to construct further fibre optic networks in a number of locations in the north-east, including County Louth. That is fair enough, but my question specifically referred to the towns being discussed for broadband in County Louth; the proposed order in which they will receive broadband; the proposal as regards the timescale for Drogheda and Dundalk; and if he would make a statement on the matter. The Minister did not answer the question in written form and I hope he will answer it here today.The proposal before the Department of Finance is that the towns of Cavan, Monaghan and Dundalk will be completed with broadband first because they are included in the Government's national spatial strategy. The town of Drogheda, which is the largest town in the north-east, will not be included and has been lumped in with the two fine towns of Carrickmacross and Kingscourt, which have a population of 1,000 or 2,000 at the very most.Will the Minister deliver broadband to the largest town in the north-east along with the other towns of Dundalk, Cavan and Monaghan? What will be the timescale for that delivery? I understand the proposal before the Department of Finance is that we would be at least a year behind the other towns, which will place us at a serious competitive disadvantage, particularly in terms of attracting industry and jobs. It does not make sense that the Minister would leave Drogheda until last when it is the biggest town.

I am taking this matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who apologises for his absence due to an EU Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels today. The Minister, Deputy Ahern, would have a particular constituency interest also. I am aware he has delivered a great deal for the constituency and I have no doubt that in the area of broadband he will deliver also.The Deputy is well aware of the Minister's publicly stated support for broadband to the north-east as per his answer to a parliamentary question on Tuesday, 25 March 2003 in which he stated that the question of assisting the roll-out of additional broadband infrastructure to the north-east is under consideration by his Department on foot of the joint application by the local authorities in Cavan, Monaghan and Louth.To answer Deputy O'Dowd's question on the specific town compared to other areas, part of that might also apply in relation to the application process. That is something Deputy O'Dowd might like to examine. Notwithstanding this application, DSL Broadband is currently widely available in Drogheda and Dundalk. Eircom upgraded its exchange in Drogheda as a matter of urgency in 2003 and is now in a position to offer DSL Broadband services on approximately 17,000 lines in the town.

The Department is exploring the potential of wireless based technologies to promote the deployment of broadband access in Ireland, particularly in remote areas. Pilot projects utilising wireless LAN technologies in diverse user communities, to assess their suitability as a platform for the delivery of advanced broadband services in the regions included, are currently under way. Five projects have been recommended for funding of €260,510, including the Digiweb project. It is intended that the projects will run from January to October 2003. I understand Digiweb is currently carrying out trials in Louth, and specifically in Drogheda, to implement this wireless broadband project.I should mention that in our liberalised tele communications market it is first a matter for the private sector operators to invest in the appropriate infrastructure and services. The role of Government is to address priority areas where the private sector alone will not deliver the necessary infrastructure within the timescale necessary to critical national development objectives. By providing seed capital the Government has pump-primed investment in parts of the market where it would not have happened otherwise.To accelerate the delivery of faster and cheaper communications services throughout the country by the private sector, the Minister's Department has run a number of programmes of targeted intervention in recent years. In 1999, under the National Development Plan 1994-1999 and INTERREG II, €26.5 million was made available to support the roll-out of broadband to the regions. A total of 13 projects which rolled-out broadband infrastructure nation-wide to a value of approximately €70 million were supported and are now completed.One of the projects funded under this measure was undertaken by Esat. The project involved the roll-out of fibre optic cable in many urban areas, including Dundalk. The 4,500 metre Dundalk ring services Dundalk Regional Technical College, the Finnabair industrial estate and the Coes Road industrial estate.Under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, an indicative amount of €200 million was allocated under the two regional communications and e-commerce measures. Funding under these measures is intended to leverage and accelerate investment in competitive advanced information and communications infrastructure and services. This will enhance the potential for the development of electronic commerce facilities and enable the electronic provision of public services, including education services, virtual libraries, welfare and health services.A first call for proposals was run in 2000 and on foot of submissions received, nine contracts were signed at the beginning of 2001 which will result in additional investment in the regions in broadband infrastructure and increased availability of broadband services for business and residential users. Projects funded under this call include the construction of a new national fibre backbone by ESB Telecom, which will serve both Drogheda and Dundalk, and accelerating Esat BT's roll-out of DSL in 40 locations, including Drogheda.The broadband programme announced in March 2002 will result in the construction of open access metropolitan area fibre optic networks in upwards of 19 towns throughout the country. By reducing the cost of access to fibre rings, these networks will facilitate the provision by the private sector of "always on", low cost and high speed Internet access to consumers, educational establishments, industry and business. It is expected that these projects will be completed progressively over the next two years at a cost in the region of €65 million. The networks will offer  open access at affordable prices to all service providers wishing to enter the broadband market. I hope that gives the Deputy some additional information.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	443	We are witnessing the serious and growing damage being done by Government cutbacks to our hospital services. Yesterday, the Mater hospital announced the closure of 115 beds. Today it has emerged that this hospital will be forced to reduce patient admissions by 3,200 this year. The level of planned activity in St. Vincent's Hospital will be reduced by 20% this year. University College Hospital in Galway will be forced to reduce activity by 7,500 fewer treatments this year. St. James's Hospital is already facing a shortfall of €20 million. Beaumont Hospital is threatening to reduce treatment for cancer and dialysis patients.Patient care is now suffering an unprecedented assault from the Government. The year 2003 will see reduced hospital activity while demand is growing for hospital services. Waiting lists are not being reduced and even seriously ill cancer patients are being forced to wait up to four months for treatment.This crisis can be traced directly back to the abject failure by the Minister for Health and Children to focus investment where it is needed most. While he tries to hide behind the health boards and blame them for the crisis, he holds ultimate responsibility for the chaotic situation that has been allowed to develop. Health boards are bloated by an ever-growing number of administrators. As recently as today, the Southern Health Board is justifying a new management post while at the same time cutbacks are being made in hospital services in that region. Hospital ward closures, nurses laid off and operating facilities left idle are the hallmarks of this Minister's stewardship.There is a new anomaly introduced into the health service. The Minister is funding private hospitals in Ireland and Britain under the treatment purchase fund for patients who are generally less in need but who have been waiting a long time, while more serious but shorter-term patients are left waiting because of cutbacks in public hospitals. Now the closed wards will be used for less urgent cases under this fund.What he intends to do about the mess he has  created is impossible to fathom so I welcome this opportunity to ask. The Minister for Health and Children is so swamped by reports and recommendations from review groups, committees and working groups that he is suffering a paralysis which extends to an inability to tell this House and this Deputy how many such reports and groups have come into existence since Fianna Fáil took office in 1997 and how much they have cost the long-suffering taxpayer. At the beginning of February I sought this information by way of a parliamentary question in the name of Deputy Costello but I did not get it. I sought it again by way of another parliamentary question and to this day I am still waiting. This is in direct contravention of the rules of this House and I demand that the Minister hand over this information immediately.He also promised that the major reports on reforms in the health service would be published in February and then in March. When will these reports be published? They have been extensively leaked but those of us who depend on the health service have a right to know what the Government is going to do to face up to the challenge of meeting our needs on the basis of equality, excellence and value for money.

This level of expenditure represents an increase of almost 9% on the figure for 2002. This level of funding is significant and it is recognised that the authority and the health boards have had to take some difficult decisions in the current year on their service provision and priorities. Nevertheless, it must be recognised that even in the prevailing economic climate the health services have once again received the highest increase in funding across all Departments, a clear indication of this Government's commitment.The Eastern Regional Health Authority has a total of €1.154 billion available to purchase acute hospital services in 2003. This figure includes additional funding of €9.45 million to support the consolidation of acute hospital services agreed and funded in recent years. This is the basis upon which the authority developed and agreed its own 2003 service plan with the Department. Members of Deputy McManus's party agreed the service plan with the Department.Additional funding will be allocated among the service providers to assist in meeting increased costs and to fund service developments initiated in 2002. Further funding of €4.5 million has been provided to meet the cost in 2003 of developing the new national lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital and funding has also been  provided to meet the costs associated with the recruitment of additional consultants.The authority accepts that 2003 will be a difficult year for the acute hospitals sector, as increases in funding over last year will be limited.

There is a tremendous commitment on the part of the Government to improve the provision and delivery of hospital services. I met geriatricians today and I am now aware that a decision was taken by the Mater without consulting my Department or the area health board. There is a need for a clearer blueprint so service providers and statutory authorities know exactly what is being provided and can work within the agreed framework. People broke frameworks last year and are now being asked to operate with the parameters that have been agreed for 2003. That is the prevailing position.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The new social partnership agreement – Sustaining Progress – devotes a full chapter to its objective of delivering a fair and inclusive society.As regards poverty and social inclusion, Sustaining Progress emphasises the need to focus on the achievement of the range of targets set out in the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy in light of changed circumstances, and to ensure real and significant progress in relation to implementation.In that context the programme explicitly reaffirms the Government's commitment to the achievement of the income adequacy targets set out in the revised NAPS relating to the lowest social welfare rates and to the completion by 2005 of the programme of multi-annual increases in child benefit.It also sets out a range of key initiatives which will be undertaken to monitor and support the delivery of the programmes and actions designed to provide for an inclusive society. These focus largely on the provision of better data and information, effective proofing and evidence-based policy making, and the development of tools for monitoring and evaluation.Moreover, Sustaining Progress specifically identifies ten key policy areas where special initiatives will be developed in conjunction with the social partners. Nearly all of these policy areas are closely related to issues of social inclusion, and include housing and accommodation, migration and interculturalism, long-term unemployment and vulnerable workers, tackling educational disadvantage, issues of caring, and ending child poverty.The programme, as its name indicates, is about sustaining the considerable progress we have made in recent years towards creating a free and inclusive society. Social development must be economically sustainable, if continued progress is to be maintained in these current uncertain times, in which an open economy such as Ireland is particularly vulnerable. Sustaining Progress achieves this objective and ensures that even in difficulties steady progress towards a fair and inclusive society can be made.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	458	The supplementary welfare allowance scheme which is administered by the health boards provides, inter alia, for the payment of a weekly or monthly supplement in respect of rent to any person in the State whose means are insufficient to meet their needs.The maximum level of rent, which a person may incur in order to be eligible to receive rent supplement, is determined by each health board in respect of its functional area and is set by reference to local considerations.Data provided by the Central Statistics Office show that rent levels have been stable for some time. In fact, rents have been falling since last April and are now lower than they were one year ago.I am concerned to ensure that increases in maximum rent levels should be set by the health boards in response to rises in market rent levels. However, it appears that these increases may actually have been driving up rents. In the circumstances, I decided to maintain the maximum rent levels set by the health boards at their current levels until the end of December 2003. Regulations giving effect to this were introduced on 22 November 2002.I am satisfied that, rather than having an adverse impact on social welfare recipients in the private rented sector this change will improve their position in acquiring accommodation. Setting maximum rent limits higher than are justified by the open market distorts the rental market and leads to a general rise in rent levels that disadvantages people on low incomes.If an individual is unable to secure accommodation at or below the applicable maximum rent level it is open to the health board to provide a payment above the maximum level as an exceptional measure for a limited period. This measure is designed to provide the person concerned with an opportunity to secure alternative accommodation at the applicable rent level. My Department is not aware of any case where the change in relation to the maximum rent levels has resulted in individuals being made homeless.The effects of the change are being monitored on an on-going basis by my Department. In this regard the health boards are required to notify my Department of instances where supplements are put in payment in cases where exceptional circumstances are involved. Since the new regulations were introduced 28 such cases have been notified to my Department.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	459	While many improvements have been made in recent years in the services and supports available from my Department for people with disabilities, it is recognised that further progress needs to be made in this area. The development and enhancement of the social welfare services available for this group is an ongoing process.As part of this process, a number of developments are planned this year which are aimed at further improving the position of people with disabilities. For instance, arrangements are being made for the take over by my Department of the spending allowances paid by or on behalf of the health boards to people in full-time residential care who are currently disqualified for disability allowance. This measure represents another step in the process of ensuring that all people with disabilities in residential settings have a legal right to income support.In addition, the report of the Expenditure Review Group on Illness and Disability Income Maintenance Payments will be published in the coming months. This review is being undertaken as part of an ongoing series of systematic examinations of the Department's various expenditure programmes. The purpose of the illness and disability study is to take a general overview of all of the income maintenance schemes in this area. The review is examining the roles and effectiveness of the range of income maintenance payments provided by the Department and the health boards and will take close account of the recommendations of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities.Other developments and initiatives include:– continued and enhanced activity through the Department's employment support services at a local and regional level in progressing people with disabilities on social welfare payments into education, training and employment, as appropriate; a special Disability Information Awareness Week is being organised by Comhairle and will take place on the week beginning 8 September to mark European Year of People with Disabilities;– the development of Comhairle's role in relation to the promotion and provision of information and other services for people with disabilities;– the production by Comhairle of an Assistive Technology Information Database in partnership with relevant organisations;

There are currently 20,400 people in receipt of the allowance at a cost of €160 million last year.

Grants are available for research, evaluation and public awareness projects. The scheme has been administered until now by the Combat Poverty Agency, under the aegis of my Department.As the Deputy will be aware, functions of my Department relating to the community and voluntary sector were transferred to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs last year.That Department was established with a view to producing a more co-ordinated and coherent engagement by the State with local communities and voluntary groups.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The electricity allowance, which forms part of the household benefits package, is a non-statutory scheme. The allowance covers normal residential standing charges and up to 1800 free units of electricity each year. Recipients in rural areas receive a credit of up to €268.44 plus VAT per annum and recipients in urban areas receive a credit of up to €241.74 plus VAT per annum.When my Department was notified by the ESB of proposed increases in electricity charges in October 2001 it became apparent that a small number of electricity allowance recipients who operated a business from their home were receiving an additional amount in excess of the normal standing charge.For customers in rural areas operating a business from their home the additional business related ESB charge is €7.84 plus VAT per two monthly billing period. For customers in urban areas the additional business related ESB charge is €11.30 plus VAT per two monthly billing period.In the light of this information, my Department requested the ESB to amend their customer records system to credit the correct standing charge to these people. This was completed in December 2002 and my Department issued a mailshot to the 2,313 customers identified as being affected by this adjustment. The mailshot advised customers of the situation and asked that they contact the ESB where they no longer had a residential business account so that the designation on their account could be changed from business to residential. According to the ESB, approximately 900 of these customers have had their electricity account type changed to residential.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Prior to 1998, child benefit was payable at the normal rate for each child in the case of twins. However, a grant of €635 (£500) was payable at birth and further grants of €635 were payable when the twins reached the ages of four and 12.Child benefit was paid at double the normal rate where three or more children were born together. However, no birth grants were payable in the case of triplets.In 1998, two key additional measures were introduced, designed to improve the overall package of benefits available to parents of multiple births. First, the €635 grants, which previously were confined to families with twins, were extended to include families with multiple births of three or more children. Second, the rate of child benefit payable in respect of twins was increased to 150% of the normal child benefit rate.Very substantial investments have been made in the child benefit scheme in recent years. Following the historic increase in child benefit rates of payment since 2001, including the increases announced in Budget 2003 which come into effect next month, Government investment in the scheme will have risen to some €1.556 billion.In the proposed partnership agreement, Sustaining Progress, the Government is committed to completing the final phase of the child benefit multi-annual increases by 2005. This will bring additional investment in child benefit since 2001 to €1.27 billion, and total expenditure on this scheme to €1.9 billion.These improvements which will benefit all families with children, represent, in my view, the most effective use of the available resources.Any further changes in the scheme would have to be considered in the light of overall priorities and the budgetary situation.

It is estimated that some 380 schools, with more than 60,000 pupils, benefited from the urban scheme while 105 schools and voluntary organisations received funding which benefited more than 11,000 children under other school meals projects.The report of an interdepartmental working group which was set up in 1999 to review the scheme group has been completed and it recommends a number of changes which will focus the scheme on areas of greatest disadvantage. This will include targeting secondary schools with the highest concentration of pupils at risk of early school leaving and their primary feeder schools.The working group felt that, in view of the scale of implementation, new arrangements should be introduced on a phased basis. They recommended that, initially, the most disadvantaged schools should be targeted. Work is under way to identify these schools. It is also proposed to identify children at risk who are not in specific target schools as well as children with special needs.I announced recently an increase of €2 million in funding for free school meals projects which will enable me to expand the current programme. Funding is currently being provided for new school meals projects as they come on stream.

Under these arrangements, and with limited exceptions, treatments are provided to the patients either free of charge or at a reduced fee and the Department pays the balance of the cost directly to the dentist at the agreed rates. Patients seeking benefit attend a participating dentist who accepts the claim, indicates the treatment required and on completion of treatment submits the claim to my Department for payment of the Department's share of the cost.The total expenditure for dental benefit from 1998 to 2002 was as follows:

The scheme was never intended for self employed people.The question of extending the scheme to cover self-employed persons has since been considered, having regard to a number of factors including: the arrangements already in place to provide income support to self-employed people on low incomes, such as through unemployment assistance; the provision of support to low income farmers who are self employed; the practical difficulties associated with extending the scheme to the self-employed; and, the cost of introducing such a measure in the context of the need to prioritise the use of the limited resources available for the development of the wider social welfare system.

In the period since the Act came into force on 21 April 1998, until the end of the year 2002, a total of 2,711 FOI requests were received. That figure consists of 2,376 requests in relation to personal records and 335 for non-personal records.Of the requests received, a total of 2,324 (86%) have been granted in whole or in part.Since the Act came into operation, my Department has been represented on two interdepartmental groups set up to facilitate the effective implementation and operation of the Act. The groups facilitate the sharing of views, both on the general operation of the Act and on specific issues which arise from time to time. My Department has played a full part, over the years, in the workings of both groups and in the consideration of issues which have arisen on a regular basis.Issues arising are conveyed on an ongoing basis to the central policy unit of the Department of Finance which was involved in the bringing forward of the current proposals for review of the Act.

Later this year, it is intended to extend the ban to include Bray, Kilkenny, Sligo and Tralee.A fuel allowance payment of €9.00 per week is paid to eligible households while an additional €3.90 per week is paid in smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to €12.90 per week. These payments are made for the duration of the fuel season which lasts for 29 weeks. The current fuel season will end on 18 April.The fuel allowances represent a contribution towards a person's normal heating and lighting expenses. In addition many households also qualify for electricity and gas allowances.The fuel allowance scheme has been improved in recent budgets. The means test has been eased and the duration of payment increased from 26 weeks to 29 weeks.The significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have also improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. Primary payment rates are payable for the full 52 weeks of the year and increases in these rates benefit a wider range of recipients.The question of further increases in the rates of fuel allowance would be a matter for consideration in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 33 together.The telephone allowance which is part of the household benefits package, is generally available to people living in the State aged 66 years or over who are in receipt of a social welfare type payment or who satisfy a means test. It is also available to carers and people with disabilities under the age of 66 who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments. Since May 2001 the allowance is available to all persons aged 70 or over regardless of income or household composition.Some 280,000 people receive the telephone allowance, at an estimated aggregate cost of over €78 million in 2003. The allowance covers the cost of line and instrument rental in full and a contribution towards call charges. It is worth up to €281.10 per annum, including VAT, to each qualified person. Once awarded, the allowance is credited to the qualified person's two-monthly Eircom telephone bill.The primary objective of the telephone allowance when it was introduced originally in 1977 was to ensure that older people could summon help in an emergency. Since then the focus of the scheme has changed to seeking to encourage social contact and prevent social exclusion.It is with these objectives in mind that I have now provided for an extension of the allowance to include certain residents in nursing homes. Under the arrangements introduced earlier this month, the allowance may be paid in respect of residents who are aged 70 years and over, have their own telephone line in the nursing home, and receive a telephone bill in their own name at the nursing home.The new arrangements apply to all applications received after 1 January 2003 and, where entitlement exists, the allowance will be paid from the date of receipt of the application.This latest improvement puts nursing home residents aged 70 years and over on an equal footing with people aged 70 years and over living in their own homes and availing of the telephone allowance regardless of income or household composition. I am also conscious of the social benefit that these changes will bring by enabling those residents who are entitled to the allowance to remain in contact with family and friends.It is estimated that up to 5,500 people could benefit from this measure at an estimated additional cost of €1.55 million in 2003.While residents of nursing homes may have access to their own private telephone line, it is unlikely that individual residents in a nursing home would have access to their personal electricity or natural gas supply. Also, in the case of the television licence, one licence covers any number of television sets in individual rooms within a nursing home.

Statistics relating to European Union unemployment are issued by Eurostat using the International Labour Organisation measure of unemployment. The most recent unemployment figures available from Eurostat were the seasonally-adjusted series published on 4 March 2003.In these the unemployment figure in the case of Ireland rose by 0.3%, from 4.2% to 4.5%, in the period January 2002 to January 2003. This rise is lower than the rises in all but two of the EU countries for which comparative figures are available.The average unemployment rate in the EU is 7.9% while the average unemployment rate for the eurozone countries is 8.6%. In the case of both of these measures the rise in the relevant period was 0.5%.Under the national employment action plan certain persons on the live register are referred to FÁS for offers of jobs or training and education. The referral threshold has recently been reduced from nine to six months for those aged over 25 years of age.

The allowance was introduced at a time when long-term unemployment stood at 8.9%. In its early years the scheme proved very effective in helping people who had been long-term unemployed to return to the labour force.The transformation in labour market conditions since the mid-90s has reduced the need for a back to work scheme. This is illustrated by the drop in numbers availing of the scheme in recent years.In 2001, 12,425 people participated in the scheme. By 2002, that number had fallen to 9,931, representing a 20% drop in the overall take up rate over the period.At present there are 23,297 participants in the scheme compared to 39,343 in October 2000 when the scheme reached its peak.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	474	I propose to take Questions Nos. 25, 34 and 51 together.The Government's commitment to maintaining progress in relation to child poverty is reflected in the revised National Anti-Poverty Strategy – Building an Inclusive Society.A clear objective of the revised NAPS, in line with the National Children Strategy, is to eliminate child poverty and to move to a situation of greater equality for all children in terms of access to appropriate education, health and housing, thus breaking the cycle of disadvantage and exclusion experienced by certain children in society. Specifically, the revised NAPS established a target of reducing the number of children who are consistently poor below 2% by 2007 and, if possible, eliminating consistent poverty for children altogether.The most recent data supplied by the Economic and Social Research Institute indicate that we are continuing to make significant inroads on reducing the level of child poverty in Ireland. Consistent poverty for children has fallen from some 17% in 1997 to 12% in 1998 and further to 8% in 2000.Child poverty is almost invariably related to the broader socio-economic circumstances of the family. The main reason for the decline of child poverty since 1997 has been the corresponding decline in unemployment. The aim of this Government is to ensure that unemployment remains low and continues to fall, particularly long-term unemployment. In fact, it is a target of the NAPS that long-term unemployment is eliminated as soon as circumstances permit.Children of lone parents are particularly vulnerable to poverty and social exclusion. The number of lone parents has increased to four times the 1990 figure. The one parent family scheme has been modified by means of earnings disregard to remove obstacles to lone parents taking up employment. Child care services are also being developed to facilitate lone parents in this regard.It is also important to recognise the difficulties of parents in employment on low income. With this in view, family income supplement is available from my Department. For example, a family with a single earner and three children working 40 hours a week at the minimum wage (€6.35 per hour) would be entitled to a family income supplement of €106 per week.

The two main employment schemes are community employment, which is a part-time option, and job initiative which is a full-time option.The payments made under these schemes normally replace any weekly social welfare payment a participant had been receiving. Recipients of the one parent family payment, however, are eligible for an earnings disregard when they take up employment, which means that they retain entitlement to a payment under the FÁS schemes up to a specified earnings limit. This is designed to assist in offsetting the child care and other expenses, which a lone parent may face in taking up employment or training opportunities, and thus to encourage them to consider employment as an alternative to long-term welfare dependency. As already explained, there are no similar disregards applicable in other means-tested schemes.

Where required, a second opinion is provided by medical assessors employed by my Department for the guidance of the Department's deciding officers who ultimately determine entitlement.Currently, there are 19 medical assessors, as well as the chief medical adviser and the deputy chief medical adviser. They are recruited via the Civil Service Commission and a condition of their appointment is that they must have at least six years experience in general medical practice. They are fully qualified and experienced medical practitioners who have full registration in accordance with Medical Council criteria. Prior to qualification as doctors, each undergoes psychiatric training to the appropriate level.Among the medical assessor cadre are individual doctors with post-graduate and higher qualifications in various fields of occupational medicine, including psychology and psychotherapy.Ongoing medical education is provided by national and international experts in the evaluation of disability, including distinguished psychiatrists. There are also regular meetings and seminars under the direction of the chief medical adviser where a range of medical issues and developments in the occupational medicine field are discussed.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	477	Since 1994, successive Governments have held the rate of child dependant allowances constant while concentrating resources for child income support on the child benefit scheme. It is important to recognise that over that period, the combined CB/CDA payment has increased by more than double the rate of inflation.Child benefit is neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the child's parents and does not contribute to poverty traps, whereas the loss of child dependant allowances by social welfare recipients on taking up employment can act as a disincentive to availing of work opportunities. As a universal payment, which is not taxable and is not assessed as means for other secondary benefits, child benefit is in fact more effective than child dependant allowances as a child income support mechanism when account is taken of these incentive issues.The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme since entering office, including an additional expenditure of €1.27 billion on child benefit when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete.We will then have moved from a position in 1994 where 70% of child income support for a family claiming social welfare payments was in the form of child dependant allowances, to a position where child dependant allowances will account for less than 33%.I should also mention that an analysis of the increased child benefit in budget 2001 showed that the greatest percentage gains had gone to households on the lowest incomes, that is, between 7% and 8%, with the most affluent groups gaining less than 2%.

The number of appeals registered in the first two months of 2003 was 737.The figures represent all appellants disallowed for failure to satisfy any of the statutory conditions relating to entitlement. An exact figure relating to the genuinely seeking work condition is not readily available but it is estimated that about 80% of the appeals relate to the conditions of not being available for or genuinely seeking employment.To be regarded as genuinely seeking work a person must show that he or she is taking reasonable steps to obtain suitable employment, including applying for and seeking information on jobs, and availing of suitable training opportunities. These requirements are set out in regulations.To ensure that they are applied consistently and uniformly detailed guidelines have been issued to the deciding officers who decide unemployment claims to whom appropriate training has been provided. My Department's decisions advisory office also provides advice on an ongoing basis.Deciding officers must have regard to the economic environment in reviewing and testing individuals' efforts to obtain employment. Employers in many sectors state that they are still finding it difficult to fill vacancies. Each case is decided in accordance with the regulations having regard to what is reasonable in that particular case.Under social welfare legislation decisions in relation to claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	481	One of the key objectives of the 2003 social welfare package was to protect or enhance the value of all rates of payment in real terms. The budget made provision for increases in the main personal rates of weekly payments ranging from 5.1% to 7.6% as well as additional increases, also ranging from 5.1% to 7.6%, in the weekly rate of qualified adult allowances. Given that the budget projected an average annual inflation rate of 4.8% in 2003 the increases in payment rates, provided for in it, ensured that the standard of living of all social welfare recipients will be maintained or improved this year.As my colleague, the Minister for Finance, indicated at budget time annual inflation rates for the early months of 2003 are expected to be above average and to decline in the later months of the year.The budget also provided the following: additional increases to those aged 66 or over, in particular those on old age pensions and widows payments; increased or maintained the real value of all qualified adult rates of payment and ensured that they did not fall as a proportion of the associated personal rate; and made significant progress in the Government's programme of increases in the level of child benefit.Between 1997 and 2002 social welfare spending rose by more than €3.5 billion, a level of increase significantly in excess of the level of inflation. An additional €833 million in social welfare spending was provided for this year. This will bring the projected level of annual spending to over €10 billion for the first time.At a time of great economic uncertainty this emphasises the Government's commitment to protecting those at highest risk. My colleagues and I are committed to safeguarding the position of all social welfare recipients. I look forward to making further progress, in the years ahead, on the achievement of our social inclusion commitments.

Due to the nature of many of these schemes it is difficult to predict the expected levels of take-up. In some cases research undertaken in the past indicated that lack of knowledge of specific entitlements may be a factor affecting the level of take-up.The provision of comprehensive information in a clear and simple manner is an essential element in the effective delivery of my Department's schemes and services. The underlying objective of our information policy is to ensure that all citizens are made aware of their entitlements under the broad range of social insurance, social assistance and other supports and are kept informed of changes and improvements as they occur.That objective is carried out through a comprehensive range of information leaflets and booklets covering each social welfare payment or scheme and are widely available. These measures include: information provision through my Department's website www.welfare.ie; direct mailshots to households outlining my Department's schemes and responsibilities; advertising of new schemes and improvements to existing schemes and services; and participation at public events, such as conferences and seminars, to promote social welfare schemes and advise people of their entitlements.Information on my Department's schemes and services is also available from the network of local social welfare offices and branch offices throughout the country. Each office has a dedicated information officer. Information is also available through the wide network of citizen's information centres which are supported by Comhairle.I am committed to promoting and encouraging the maximum possible take-up of social welfare schemes and services through the continued development of my Department's information services. I will launch an information services strategy for 2003 to 2006 very soon. It will articulate a coherent and comprehensive strategy for the future development and expansion of this service.There are arrangements in place for the payment of arrears under certain conditions where people are late in claiming payments. These arrangements have been improved substantially in recent years.My Department also adopts a proactive approach, where possible, to informing possible future beneficiaries of our schemes and services. For example, all persons receiving social welfare benefits are notified of their potential entitlement to retirement or old age contributory pension some three months before the pension becomes due at age 65 and 66 years, respectively.

Its membership comprises senior officials and advisers from the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners and my Department. The committee examines, inter alia, strategic issues concerning social welfare increases, the interaction of income tax-PRSI-levies proposals with social welfare proposals including child income support, and in particular the impact of this interaction on the labour market and income distribution.Each year my Department prepares a paper for the group on the main social welfare budget issues. Last September the paper on the 2003 social welfare budget package was presented to the group by officials from my Department who are members of the group.The paper details, inter alia, the various commitments in the programme for Government, the NAPS and the PPF relating to rates of social welfare payments. It also outlined, on an illustrative basis, the average annual level of increase which would be required in order to achieve the various commitments in equal monetary steps over the years to 2007. This is just one of a number of approaches as to how the various commitments could be achieved. The paper notes that it will be a matter for Government to determine the pace at which they will be implemented as well as how the benchmark for the lowest rate of payment will be updated in the years ahead.In relation to the issue of income adequacy, the Government's continued commitment is very clearly articulated in the text of the proposed social partnership agreement. The agreement states that it remains Government policy to meet the target for the lowest social welfare rates and appropriate child equivalence levels as set out in the revised NAPS by 2007.

These include road, rail and ferry services provided by semi-State companies such as Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann, as well as services provided by over 80 private transport operators. The vast majority of these private contractors operate in rural areas. The underlying feature of the scheme is the use of spare capacity on these transport services.I am always willing to consider applications from licensed private transport operators who may wish to participate in the free travel scheme. My Department pays transport providers to operate the free travel scheme. However, it is not in a position to provide transport services where none exist. Research has shown that those who are most marginalised by lack of access to transport in rural areas include the elderly and the mobility impaired. It has also shown that the provision of accessible, affordable and acceptable local transport can make a very important improvement in the quality of life for these people.

It is a weekly income support payment which is based on PRSI contributions paid by the carer.The maximum duration of the carer's benefit scheme is 65 weeks as it is considered that employers would experience difficulties in preserving an employee's rights for a longer period. Each care recipient may receive a total of 65 weeks care. This may be claimed as a single continuous period or in separate time periods. In the event of a person's carer's benefit expiring and the need for income support still existing, the carer may apply for carer's allowance.The question of further improvements or changes in the carer's benefit scheme could only be considered in a budgetary context.

This, when implemented, will allow customers to gain easier access to a range of public services and information about services by means of the Internet, telephone and personal contact.There are significant technical and organisational issues involved in the establishment of the public services broker. At present the agency is looking for a suitable partner to build and implement the broker and to identify the key elements to be progressed in 2003 having regard to the technical and financial considerations involved. I am confident that substantial progress on the implementation of the broker will be made before the end of this year.

Retirement is defined as not having earnings from employment of more than €38 per week or earnings from self-employment of more than €3,174 per annum.The retirement pension was introduced in 1970 and was intended to bridge the gap between retirement at 65 and the pension age for social welfare purposes, which at the time was 70 years of age. The qualifying age for old age pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years of age.There is no retirement condition associated with the old age contributory pension which is payable at 66 years of age. The payment of this pension is not affected by earnings or other income.The Government is committed, as part of the programme for Government, to removing the requirement to retire at 65 in order to receive a retirement pension. Progress in this regard will be made as soon as possible, having regard to the availability of resources and the priority attached to other elements of the Government's programme.

The additional quota would have come partly from the national reserve and partly from restructuring schemes operating within the areas concerned. Due to the level of existing demand on the national reserve from producers throughout the country in difficult quota situations, and in view of a more general debate within the sector on the operation of quota reallocation schemes, it was decided not to proceed with this particular idea in the current year.

Advance payment will issue shortly for the December 2002 application in respect of 50 animals.The person received slaughter premium and national envelope top-up on a total of 53 and 16 animals, respectively, under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme. The slaughter premium advance payment totalling €3,392 and the national envelope top-up advance payment of €292.48 issued in respect of all eligible animals.Balancing payments for all bovine schemes are due to commence in April.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The Turkish authorities have signalled their intention to modify their veterinary health certification requirements for lamb skins being imported into Turkey. The new regime is intended to apply from 1 May.The imposition of health certification rules for imports to Turkey is, subject to WTO rules, a matter for the Turkish authorities. The new model certificate from Turkey includes a number of elements which create certain difficulties for my Department from a certification perspective. These arise primarily because the standards sought by the Turkish authorities for hides exported from hide premises for leather production are equivalent to those normally sought for produce exported from slaughter houses which, unlike hide premises, are subject to full veterinary supervision and a range of infrastructural and other requirements.My Department is aware of the possible implications of the new Turkish certification requirements for exporters of lamb skins and has been actively engaged in an effort to address the matter. The issue has been raised with the Turkish authorities. Efforts are continuing to find a formula which will allow Ireland to certify these exports in a manner which satisfies Turkish concerns and those of Irish exporters.The quality and integrity of veterinary and public health certification in Ireland is of critical importance to our small open economy with its heavy reliance on agricultural exports. Other EU member states and third countries with which we trade must have absolute confidence in the certificates they receive.For this reason my Department has always taken its obligations in relation to the certification of exports of agricultural products very seriously. In circumstances where particular certification requirements pose difficulties for exporting States, the normal practice is to contact the receiving State to determine how best their concerns in relation to veterinary or public health can be addressed, within the framework of the kind of certification that the exporting country can legitimately provide.

Previously a VRT rate of 25% applied to cars with engine sizes from 1,401cc to 2,000cc and a rate of 30% applied to cars of 2,001cc and over. From 1 January the 30% rate now applies to all cars of 1,901cc and over. I have received representations regarding this matter.It is the normal practice for changes in excises including VRT to be implemented by way of a Financial Resolution on budget night with effect either from budget night or 1 January. In accordance with normal practice the VRT change announced in the budget has now been enacted into law. It is not the practice to review such changes or alter their implementation other than in the context of the lead up to the annual budget and I do not propose to depart from normal practice.I will, as always, be happy to consider any proposals regarding changes to the structure of VRT in the context of the lead up to next year's budget.

A certificate was issued on 20 March following a telephone call to the Central Revenue information office. The Office of the Paymaster General did not receive the certificate in time to prevent emergency tax being deducted from the pension payment to be paid on 27 March.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	499	As I said in reply to a similar question on 5 March, much of the controversy attending the issue of Rockall arose from unresolved fears that jurisdiction over it and similar rocks and skerries was considered to be central to ownership of the mineral rights in the adjacent seabed and to fishing rights in the surrounding seas. During the course of the Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea Ireland worked hard to establish a satisfactory legal regime applicable to islands. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was adopted at Montego Bay at the conclusion of the conference on 10 December 1982, provides at Article 121 paragraph 3 that:Rocks which cannot sustain human habitation or economic life of their own shall have no exclusive economic zone or continental shelf.Article 121(3) applies to Rockall. Ireland ratified the Convention on 21 June 1996. The United Kingdom acceded to the Convention on 25 July 1997. It is accordingly accepted by both states that Rockall cannot be used as a basis for delimiting their respective continental shelves or fisheries zones. While the United Kingdom continues to claim jurisdiction over Rockall, this claim is not accepted by Ireland. Each country remains aware of the position of the other.Agreement between Ireland and Britain on the delimitation of a great extent of the continental shelf was reached some years ago. The agreement between the Irish Government and the UK Government concerning the delimitation of areas of the continental shelf between the two countries was done at Dublin on 7 November 1988 and entered into force 11 January 1990. The two Governments decided to delimit a further small area of the continental shelf in the Irish Sea prior to the construction of a gas pipeline between Moffat in Scotland and Loughshinny. This was done by means of a Protocol supplementary to the agreement of 1988 which was signed at Dublin on 8 December 1992 and entered into force on 26 March 1993.

Allegations in relation to this teacher are also the subject of civil proceedings which are ongoing. The Deputy will appreciate that, in the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on this specific case.In 2002, my Department issued revised guidelines to all primary schools. These guidelines are based on the national guidelines, Children First, which were issued by the Department of Health and Children in September 1999, but have been specifically developed with the primary school setting in mind. The guidelines are designed to assist, give direction and guidance to all school management authorities and school personnel in dealing with allegations or suspicions of child abuse.

However, my Department is subject to budgetary constraints in 2003 and this will limit the amount of ICT capital grants which can be provided to schools this year.The Government remains fully committed to supporting schools in the promotion of ICT skills and innovative applications in teaching and learning. To this end, the National Centre for Technology in Education is currently conducting a nationwide census of all schools on behalf of my Department in order to determine progress achieved in meeting the ICT needs of schools as well as resource requirements going forward. The findings of this census, which will be available by mid-year, will inform future policy and programme priorities in this area having regard to available budgetary resources.

Under this section, the children eligible for health board dental services are pre-school and national school children in respect of defects noted at child health examinations. Child health examinations are provided by health boards to children attending a national school.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	510	As the Deputy is aware, the provision of orthodontic treatment to eligible persons is the responsibility of the health boards/authority in the first instance.In June 2002, my Department provided additional once-off funding of €5 million from the treatment purchase fund to health boards specifically for the purchase of orthodontic treatment. One of the general principles governing the scheme for orthodontics was that each health board would use its allocation to treat those cases waiting longest, in accordance with their severity of need. This funding is enabling boards to provide both additional sessions for existing staff and purchase treatment from private specialist orthodontic practitioners.My Department collects and collates orthodontic waiting list data from the health boards at the end of each quarter. The latest quarter for which my Department has received data is December 2002. The chief executive officers of the health boards have informed me that the number of cases awaiting treatment and the average waiting time for treatment at the end of this quarter is as follows:Treatment Waiting List
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-03-27 00:00:00	Prelude	511	As the Deputy is aware, the Eastern Regional Health Authority is charged with responsibility for commissioning health and personal social services on behalf of the population of the region, and also on behalf of those outside the region who are referred for specialist treatment.I met in recent weeks with the New Crumlin Hospital Group, which is composed of parents of children who regularly attend Crumlin Hospital for treatment. It was this group that commissioned the Pollock report into facilities at Crumlin.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that, on foot of an acknowledgement by all parties of the need for an overall development of the facilities at Crumlin Hospital, last year I approved the establishment of a project team to plan for the future development of the hospital. The team includes representatives from the hospital, the Eastern Regional Health Authority, and the Department of Health and Children.Many of the buildings comprised within the hospital are approximately 50 years old, and have not been upgraded in any significant way over that period. As a result, they do not now generally meet contemporary standards for paediatric hospital facilities.The first stage of the planning process involves writing a brief for the preparation of a development control plan which will set the context for future capital developments on the site. Work on the preparation of the development brief has commenced, and it is expected to be completed by the end of 2003.It is intended that a phased approach to new development and the upgrade of facilities will be taken. The plans will allow for the prioritisation of developments according to the service needs of the hospital and the ERHA. A phased approach will ensure that services continue to be provided at the hospital during the redevelopment.A number of additional major developments, funded by the Exchequer, are currently being put in place at the hospital. These include a €30 million investment in the new operating department which will provide two additional theatres, increasing the capacity of the hospital to five major theatres and two minor theatres. Included in this development are new recovery beds, a day surgery unit and a modern central sterile supplies department. This development is expected to increase the capacity of the hospital to meet the additional surgery demands at both inpatient and outpatient level.

This new coach park was built last year to reduce congestion on the road in front of the terminal building and to accommodate the increased demand for parking for tour coaches and buses. The charges levied by Aer Rianta seek to remunerate the capital cost of providing the new coach park and its ongoing operating costs.I understand that the actual charges and charging structure were agreed following consultation between Aer Rianta and the National Coach Council. The charges are not levied on the passengers in the coaches but rather on the coach drivers or operators who are accessing and using the airport coach park facility for commercial-business reasons.

The Act was brought fully into operation in May 2000.The decision to grant or refuse bail in any particular case is a matter for the courts who are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions.The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Deputy will appreciate that the Children Act is complex legislation and, due to its complexity, provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis.The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for, inter alia: The establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand. To date, in excess of 100 of these conferences have taken place country wide; the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children; court orders to parents to exercise proper control over their children; the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences.The successful implementation of other community based options, including the new family conferences provided for under sections 79 to 88 of the Act will require a very significant input from the Probation and Welfare Service. In this context, the Probation and Welfare Service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand for the intensive training of all senior probation and welfare officers as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. In addition, the service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.Additional probation and welfare officers are being recruited and my Department, in association with the Civil Service and Local Appointments Commission, is currently in the process of interviewing candidates. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited from the competition which is under way at present, family conferencing will be implemented by the end of 2003 or early 2004 and that the other community based measures provided for under the Act will be introduced on a phased basis thereafter.

These are insufficient to qualify him for standard or pre-1953 pension under Irish legislation. He has, however, been awarded a pro rata pre-1953 pension under EU regulations which enable his UK insurance contributions to be taken into account for these purposes. He has, thus, been awarded his full entitlement on the basis of his record of insurable employment in this country.Under social welfare legislation, decisions in relation to claims are made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

At the time the scheme was introduced, long-term unemployment was running at 8.9%.In the intervening years the scheme was broadened to include lone parents and people with disabilities. A review of the back to work allowance scheme was carried out by independent consultants who recommended restructuring of the scheme in the light of the tight labour market. They recommended that the scheme be refocused on the longer-term unemployed, that the nonfinancial supports be enhanced, and that the overall numbers on the scheme be reduced.The recent changes in the scheme reflect these recommendations and the major economic and labour market changes and, in particular, of the drop in unemployment levels since the introduction of the allowance in 1993.Following on from this review, the qualifying period for persons on unemployment benefit-assistance has been increased to five years with effect from 1 January 2003. Other social welfare qualifying payments are not affected by the change.It is important that my Department's employment support services retain their relevance to current employment and economic conditions and continue to focus on the most vulnerable groups. In line with this aim my Department's jobs facilitators will continue to assist the long-term unemployed and other long-term welfare dependants into self-employment and employment by providing them with assistance and information on an individual basis.I will continue to monitor the scheme but I have no immediate plans to change the existing qualifying criteria.

These increases raised the weekly income limits by €17 at each point, adding an extra €10.20 to the payments of most existing FIS recipients. The average weekly payment now stands at €60.00 per week, with a total of 12,067 families receiving a supplement under the scheme.The question of further improvements to the income thresholds is a matter for consideration in a budgetary context, having regard to available resources and Government commitments.

Payments under the scheme for the summer period have been discontinued and the scheme will no longer apply to persons undertaking post-graduate courses.
