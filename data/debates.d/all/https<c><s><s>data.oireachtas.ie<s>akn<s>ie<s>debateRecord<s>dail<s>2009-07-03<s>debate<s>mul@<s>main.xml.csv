First, I will highlight the difficulties we have here.In recent years the activities of organised crime gangs have intensified and have been marked by an increasing ruthlessness.  I have been informed by the Garda Commissioner that there is no doubt that investigations into the criminal activities of these gangs are hampered by the unwillingness of people to come forward to assist these investigations.Recent killings, including the very sad case of Mr. Roy Collins, emphasise the complete disregard of these gangs for the rule of law and their determination to intimidate whole communities.  Beyond the absolute tragedy of this murder, it confirms in the minds of the public the threat posed by these gangs and creates the climate of fear which is so conducive to criminal gangs maintaining their malign influence within their communities.  Up to this unprecedented event I resisted calls for sterner legislation, but now we cannot stand by and let our criminal justice system be undermined.The threat to witnesses is already clearly accepted.  Instances of intimidation of witnesses have been evidenced by withdrawn statements, refusals to testify or failure to recall recent events.  Does anyone really suppose that groups who would kill in retaliation for a witness giving evidence would for some reason draw the line at the intimidation of jurors?  No doubt jurors will continue to do their duty conscientiously in a wide range of cases, but this Bill recognises that special measures must be taken in the case of offences involving organised crime.The stark fact is that members of these gangs have displayed a callous disregard for human life and a brazen contempt for the community.  They have come to believe that they can take on the criminal justice system and act as a law unto themselves.  It is beyond question that criminal gangs will try to take whatever action is open to them to thwart the criminal justice system.  Clearly, there are limits on the extent of the information I can properly put into the public domain about this and I must be measured in what I say.  The Government decision to provide for a limited number of specific "organised crime" offences to be prosecuted in the Special Criminal Court was taken on the basis of the advice of the Garda Commissioner and taking into account information provided by him and others involved in the criminal justice system detailing instances of threats and intimidation.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Yes, I would expect so.The Garda Commissioner made clear that the threat is such that the use of the Special Criminal Court is justified in the case of gang members.  Court officials in Limerick have cited specific incidents where gang members have sat in the front row to intimidate juries.  The fear in the community resulted in a marked drop in jury attendance.  Trials have already been moved to Dublin.  It is unrealistic to expect that every juror in a case involving these gangs could withstand, or would even report, instances of intimidation or threat.Only earlier this week, the State solicitor for Limerick confirmed on air that he was aware of specific cases of jury intimidation and that there is reluctance among a significant part of the population to participate in jury trials of gang members.  I am sure the Members of this House who represent the areas in question will be able to confirm the level of intimidation that exists.  Deputies from all sides of the House have come to me, not only on Limerick but other areas including Dublin, about the intimidation of witnesses and jurors in their respective areas.It seems to me that the truth of this assessment is already obvious from the facts now in the public domain. I do not dispute that the decision to schedule offences so that they can be dealt with in the Special Criminal Court is a big step, but failure to take that decision would be to shirk our overriding responsibility as parliamentarians to ensure that the rule of law prevails.Moreover, we are introducing offences here which are inextricably linked to organised crime.  The impact of that fact alone on the likelihood of successfully intimidating a prospective juror cannot be ignored.Sequestering jurors, using jurors outside the community from which the defendant comes, shielding jurors from the sight of an open court or providing round the clock protection for jurors are not viable responses to the grave situation we face and will not guarantee freedom from intimidation.  These gangs have sophisticated networks capable of identifying those they perceive as thwarting their activities.However, there is a real and viable option.  The three-judge Special Criminal Court and its non-jury format is in the view of the Government, and also of the Garda Commissioner and the senior Garda management, the single most effective means of successfully prosecuting these gangs.  We have the offences, we have the investigative tools and we have the penalties.  Now we must ensure prosecution.  Let us not wait for further escalation in intimidation.  Let us, in Dáil Éireann, give a future to the ordinary decent citizens of the communities which have been brought to their knees by these criminal gangs.I heard reports suggesting that elements of this Bill might be unconstitutional.  All I can say is that the senior legal adviser to the Government does not believe that there are any grounds for that suggestion.Furthermore, I have given detailed consideration to the points raised by the Irish Human Rights Commission in close consultation with the Attorney General.  There is nothing raised by the commission that was not already considered.  On examination, some of its suggestions might actually prejudice the right to a fair trial.As well as addressing organised crime, the Bill introduces amendments to detention and search powers which will, among other matters, address problems that arise during the hearing of applications to extend the time for questioning.The Bill is in five Parts with 25 sections.  Part 1 contains standard provisions such as the Short Title and definitions sections.Part 2 concerns organised crime.  In the main, this Part amends the organised crime provisions contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  New measures are introduced and existing provisions are amended.  In particular, I highlight the following sections.Section 3 amends the existing definitions of "criminal organisation" and "structured group".  The existence of a criminal organisation is a crucial element in proving the offences provided for under this Bill.  The amended definitions are merely a simpler formulation but, none the less, an important change making it easier to charge persons with the offences in question.Section 5 creates for the first time in Irish law an offence of directing a criminal organisation.  This offence criminalises the directing or controlling of activities of a criminal organisation including the supervision of such activities or the giving of orders.  It will facilitate the pursuit of persons who direct and control these organisations although not directly or personally involved in the commission of a serious offence.  The serious nature of this activity is recognised by the equally serious penalty of up to life imprisonment.  I note in passing that in addition to providing a necessary tool to combat the threat of organised crime, it is also a requirement of our obligations as a signatory to the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.  The section provides significant detail on what "directs" means.  It also sets out the evidence to which a court may have regard in determining whether an offence has been committed.  In drafting this provision, it was considered appropriate for the purpose of consistency to replicate those provisions in section 6 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which contain the offence of directing an unlawful organisation.  The amendment to the 1998 Act is contained in section 24.Section 6 provides for the offence of participating in activity that could aid a criminal organisation's objects which, where proven, will carry a penalty of up to 15 years.  The evidential requirements of the offence are set out in the provision.  Facilitating the commission of a serious offence by a criminal organisation will not require proof that an actual offence was committed or that the accused had knowledge of a particular offence.  Again, we are going after those persons who, although not directly involved in the commission of an offence, participate with the organisation in a manner conducive to facilitating such offences.Section 7 is an important provision in that it sets out the evidential provisions as to the existence of a criminal organisation.  The offences already outlined cannot be proven unless the existence of a criminal organisation is first established.  This section addresses that point.  In particular, it allows for the evidence of a member of the Garda Síochána with appropriate experience and knowledge as to the existence of a criminal organisation.  That will not go to the guilt or otherwise of a defendant.  However, it will assist in meeting the first hurdle of a successful prosecution, namely, establishing the existence of a criminal organisation.  There appears to be some confusion as to whether this is opinion evidence or expert evidence, as it is correctly stated in the legislation.  It is not opinion evidence as to the guilt or innocence of a particular person.  It relates to the expert evidence of a garda who would know about the existence of a criminal organisation.

Another significant provision is contained in section 8 which, as I have already indicated, extends the remit of the Special Criminal Court to organised crime offences.  It is not a step taken lightly.  I have already referred to the circumstances of the murder of Mr. Roy Collins in Limerick earlier this year.  The level of intimidation against witnesses is already well known.  This Bill combined with the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill will facilitate a situation where prosecutions can be brought against members of criminal gangs based on evidence gathered by Garda surveillance.  The opportunity to undermine the criminal justice system by intimidation of "civilian" witnesses will be diminished.However, as I have said, the Garda Commissioner has also expressed strong concerns regarding jury intimidation.  Increasingly, prospective jurors are seeking reprieves from participation in trials involving criminal organisations.  Again, I would not be taking this step if I were not convinced that those threats are very real.  We have ensured that safeguards are included in the legislation.  For example, the declaration that the ordinary courts are inadequate for the pursuit of those types of offence is without prejudice to the power of the DPP to direct that a person not be sent forward for trial by the Special Criminal Court on a particular charge.We have also included a clause whereby this section will cease to operate 12 months following the passing of the Act unless continued by a resolution passed by each House of the Oireachtas.  I remind Deputies that under existing law, the DPP already has the option to send a member of a criminal gang forward for trial to the Special Criminal Court.  What we are proposing is that a limited number of organised crime offences should be tried before the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP is satisfied that, in a particular case, the ordinary courts are adequate.There is provision in section 9 for inferences to be drawn from a failure of a defendant, prior to being charged, to answer any question material to the investigation of the offence.  A number of safeguards are also built into this provision.  These include provision that interviews must be electronically recorded, the defendant must be informed of the effect of a failure to answer and must be given a reasonable opportunity to consult a solicitor before answering.  An inference drawn under this section cannot solely or mainly be relied on to convict.Section 14 introduces post-release orders that impose restrictions on certain activities.  Those orders can be applied at sentencing and will take effect on the person's release from prison.  They are similar to the post-release orders in the sexual offences legislation already passed.  The order can apply restrictions on a person's movements, actions or activities; impose conditions on a person's participation in any activity or apply restrictions relating to a person's associations.  Section 16 increases the penalty for witness or jury intimidation from ten years to 15 years.Part 3 contains two sections which amend section 7 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 and sections 7 and 8 of the Criminal Law Act 1997.  Those amendments arise out of an obligation to legislate for particular provisions of the UN Convention on Transnational Organised Crime.  Parties to that convention are required to establish jurisdiction over obstruction of justice offences in certain circumstances where the offence occurs outside the State.  These circumstances are where the offence occurs on board an Irish ship or aircraft or was committed by an Irish citizen or by a person ordinarily resident in Ireland.Section 7 of the 1939 Act contains the offence of obstruction of Government, including Judiciary, and is amended in section 18.  Section 7 of the 1997 Criminal Law Act, inter alia, creates the offence of impeding apprehension or prosecution of another person who has committed an arrestable offence.  Section 8 of that Act provides for concealing an offence.  Section 19 makes the required amendment to those provisions.I now turn to Part 4, which concerns amendments to Garda powers of detention and re-arrest.  My amendments for the most part are aimed at ensuring that those powers do not operate in a manner that prejudices the investigation of crime by, for example, the disclosure of sensitive information.  I am also aiming to avoid the unnecessary diversion of Garda personnel away from ongoing investigations.  As Deputies will be aware, the Garda has powers under a number of statutes to detain persons arrested in connection with the investigation of serious offences.  Those powers vary both in respect of duration and the types of offence at which they are targeted.  For example, section 4 of the Criminal Justice Act 1984 applies to all offences carrying a penalty of five years or more and provides for detention up to a maximum of 24 hours.Section 2 of the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 and section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 apply to a limited range of offences, which by their nature justify the possibility of longer detention periods — up to seven days in both cases.  Section 30 of the Offences against the State Act 1939 permits detention up to 72 hours.  As a rule, detention in excess of 48 hours is permitted only on the authorisation of the District Court or occasionally the Circuit Court.  The Bill aims to address concerns long expressed by the Garda about the effect on the conduct of investigations and on the use of resources resulting from court hearings on applications to extend a detention period.The experience of the Garda Síochána is that some of the issues raised in the course of such hearings go beyond the scope of the hearing and can have the effect of prejudicing further investigation.  Information that might undermine an investigation should not be disclosed to the detained person or the public.  Sections 20, 21 and 22 deal with this very real problem in a number of ways, first, by providing that the court may direct that applications be heard in camera or that certain persons or the public generally may be excluded.  I repeat “may”.  It is up to the court to decide.  This morning, I heard a Senator say something to the contrary in the Seanad.  Second, it provides that the court may in exceptional circumstances hear the evidence from a garda without anybody else being present, including the legal representatives of the parties and, third, it prohibits the publication of any matter relating to an application other than the fact that it has taken place and the decision.The purpose of the court hearings are limited to establishing whether the extension of time is necessary for the proper investigation of an offence and that the investigation is being conducted expeditiously and diligently.  I am satisfied that those amendments will not in any way hinder the court's consideration of the matter at hand.  The risk of prejudice to ongoing investigations also arises in regard to applications to court for a warrant to re-arrest a suspect for a particular offence or for a search warrant.  While such applications are not on notice to the suspect, their hearing in open court could result in the disclosure of sensitive information.  My proposals address this by providing that re-arrest applications are to be made in camera.  Section 25, which is contained in Part 5, makes a similar clarification in respect of search warrant applications.The changes I am proposing clarify that issues relating to the validity of the arrest and detention are not proper to a hearing of an application for an extension of a detention period.  This clarification will ensure that the arresting garda and other members of the force concerned with the detention of the suspect are not diverted from the investigation by a requirement to be at the court house and ready to give evidence in the event of the lawfulness of an arrest and detention being raised.The Bill also provides that, in the interests of efficiency, the garda making the application for an extension of time — who must be of at least superintendent rank — can give oral evidence on matters not within his or her direct knowledge but which are within the knowledge of another member.  This provision is subject to the court being able to require the attendance of that other garda to give oral evidence if the interests of justice require.The cumulative effect of these amendments will be to reduce greatly the risk of sensitive information relating to matters under investigation being disclosed to a suspect or his or her associates.  The amendments will also ensure a better use of Garda personnel and time.  The amendments I have outlined apply to the three statutory detention powers which provide for detention in excess of 48 hours.I also wish to highlight some amendments which apply to individual detention powers only.  The House will recall that the detention powers in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act 1996 lapse unless they are renewed by both Houses.  The most recent resolution passed was for a two-year period which will expire on 31 December 2010.  This arrangement reflects the position at the time of enactment when detention of up to seven days was considered a major departure.  However, these detention powers are now an established and essential part of the fight against drug crime and I propose to end the requirement for renewal as I indicated when they were previously renewed.  This is achieved in section 21.Section 22 extends the scope of section 50 of the Criminal Justice Act 2007 to the organised crime offences under Part 7 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 as amended by this Bill.  As already outlined, section 50 permits detention up to a maximum of seven days in respect of very serious offences including those involving the use of a firearm or explosives.I am advised by the Garda authorities that such increased detention powers are necessary in light of the nature of organised crime offences and the difficulties arising from the fact that the people involved set out to thwart the Garda investigation of these offences at every turn.  In addition, the process of gathering the information that the Garda Síochána requires in order to put to suspects in custody can take time.  It often must be done against a background of violence, intimidation and internecine feuding.  Experience in the operation of section 50 to date and of the Drug Trafficking Act during the past 13 years suggests that the longer periods of detention are used sparingly.The House should be aware that I intend to introduce a number of technical amendments on Committee Stage.

In so far as it addresses organised crime, it is also part of a wider package including the recently debated covert surveillance legislation and firearms controls in the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill.  As criminal organisations and their methods evolve, so should our response as a society.  As already stated, these measures are not being taken lightly.  There are aspects of the Bill which will be considered a departure from prior practice.  However, we must bring every available resource and legal instrument to the fight against organised crime.  We are doing that with this legislation.I am sure all Members will join me in paying tribute to Stephen Collins and members of his family for the courage and fortitude they have shown in the face of the activities of these gangs.  Nothing we do here can be expected to console them in their great loss.  However, the measures contained in the Bill are the least we owe to them and others who have suffered at the hands of gangs.  I met Mr. Collins's family recently and, as I have stated publicly on previous occasions, whatever doubts I may have had in respect of the passing of this legislation were dispelled by my hearing their testimony with regard to the intimidation they and others in the wider community in Limerick have been obliged to endure to date.  The enactment of the Bill will provide the Garda with the legislative resources necessary to pursue the gangs.  When the legislation is passed by the Oireachtas and signed into law by the President, it will be used in a resolute manner by the prosecution service.

What is happening is par for the course because it reflects what the Government has done every day this week.We are here today again to witness the Government repeating the mistakes of the past.  Railroading legislation through the Oireachtas is dangerous at the best of times.  When it comes to a Bill that requires serious scrutiny from a constitutional perspective, however, it is madness to impose a guillotine.This Bill is being presented as an emergency measure, which is the alleged reason for the frenzied manner in which it is being forced through the Oireachtas by the Government.  What has Fianna Fáil been doing since being re-elected to office over two years ago?  The Minister has held the justice portfolio for 14 months.  During that period, he has shown himself to be a lethargic legislator.  Just yesterday we passed a Bill that had been lying around for almost three years.  Next week we will likely pass the Defamation Bill, which has been gathering dust for a similarly lengthy period.To date, and despite perceptions to the contrary, the Minister's approach has been to do little and falsely accuse the Opposition of smearing the Garda or civil servants if it questions his approach.  In the dying days of this Dáil session he is attempting to, in his own words, push through six justice Bills, thereby denying the Houses the proper opportunity to scrutinise them.  The six Bills to which I refer are that before us, the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, the Defamation Bill, the Land and Conveyancing Law and Reform Bill and the Enforcement of Court Orders (Amendment) Bill.  The latter was only published last night but all Stages of it will be passed next week.Members are not being given an opportunity to scrutinise this legislation or to engage with their constitutional responsibility.  What is happening represents an abuse of power on the part of the Government.  The mechanism of the guillotine does not exist to make life convenient for the Government or to stifle debate, it is there for legitimate emergency purposes.  The Government is shamelessly abusing this mechanism on a regular basis.  More than once in recent months the House has been suspended as a result of a lack of business.  In the past number of weeks, however, ten Bills have been earmarked for the guillotine.The Minister showed further contempt for the parliamentary process in the manner in which this Bill was launched.  On the day on which it was published, he hosted a media briefing on the Bill.  Later that afternoon, officials from his Department met Opposition spokespersons to ask if they had any questions in respect of a Bill which runs to 34 pages and which they had only received hours earlier.  While I value the role of the media in the parliamentary process, it was highly inappropriate that the level of courtesy extended to it was denied to elected Members of the House.The Government has already reaped the harvest of keeping the Opposition in the dark by guillotining debate.  However, it has not learned anything from the experience.  Two years ago, the House debated what was to become the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  That legislation was rushed through the House in a manner similar to that which applies in respect of this Bill.  The Criminal Justice Act 2007 and the Criminal Justice Act 2006 were heralded as the solution to the gangland problem.  They were recognised as such by the Minister when he stated in November 2008 that the Government of which he was a member in 2006 and 2007 had brought forward an "extensive package of criminal law reform aimed at tackling gangland".  The phrase "in particular the creation of offences relating to organised crime and membership of an organised criminal gang; new procedures relating to the use of witness statements; increased penalties for offences relating to firearms; and mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking offences", was used in an amendment he moved to a Private Members' motion on 18 November 2008.In his speech on his counter motion on crime he stated: "we have recently begun to see clear evidence that the reforms are working."  That analysis was clearly wishful thinking on the part of the Minister.  This year, we have already had 17 gangland murders, compared to a CSO figure of 16 for all of 2008.  The measures in the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007 are manifestly not working.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, believes the solution to this failure is to rush this further legislation through the House.  I believe the solution lies in critical analysis, evidence-based legislation and targeted resources.  I would like the Minister to avail of the opportunity to brief the House on what kind of analysis was undertaken in respect of the Criminal Justice Acts 2006 and 2007.  What are the flaws in those Bills that now necessitate further legislation?  It is not good practice to continue rushing criminal justice legislation through Parliament in the manner in which Governments have been doing since 2006.  A thoughtful, collaborative approach assessing the problems with past legislation and the solutions this House can offer would be a far better approach.I have informed the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, many times and have assured this House that Fine Gael would support measures to tackle gangland crime.  Rather than avail of the opportunity for a bipartisan approach to gangland crime, the Minister has treated the Opposition with contempt.  He arrogantly assumes that it is simply beneath him to engage with his fellow elected representatives when new legislation is being considered.  The Minister may believe that he is only showing contempt for a person, but the reality is he is showing contempt for the thousands of citizens who elected us, the members of the Opposition, to this House.  His narrow, partisan party political approach may appear to him to be good politics, but it will not lead to good law, as history has shown us.Since the publication of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill earlier this week, the human rights and civil liberties groups have been warning ominously that this is a Bill which tramples on constitutional rights.  Particular concerns have been raised in respect of the use of non-jury trials.  While the use of the Special Criminal Court for crime of a subversive nature is a measure that Fine Gael supports, none the less, we must ensure that solid, empirical evidence makes the case for referring trials involving gangland members to this court.  Removing the jury from a trial involving an indictable offence must be a measure of last resort.  As we all know, the jury system has been a feature of common law jurisdictions for hundreds of years and a move away from this approach to criminal law must not be made without careful consideration supported by robust research findings.We are told that a non-jury court is preferable because of intimidation of jurors.  To the best of my knowledge, such intimidation remains anecdotal.  Where is the evidence that intimidation of jurors is allowing criminals to escape justice?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform recently responded to a parliamentary question which I tabled in respect of alleged juror intimidation, stating that such matters were "sensitive" and "confidential" and he would need to confer with the Garda to establish how the parliamentary question would be answered.  The Minister knows perfectly well that I was not seeking information on a list of jurors or a list of cases.  My rationale for asking the question was to ascertain whether empirical data existed showing that this was an issue.  I have no doubt that such data could be collated while preserving the confidentiality and anonymity of jurors.

#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	14	No doubt we will get the letter some time in the future when this debate has long since been consigned to history and the guillotine exercised on parliamentary debate.  The Constitution enshrines the right to trial by jury and if the Minister intends this Bill to survive a constitutional challenge, or a challenge in a supranational court, he must be able to produce evidence that non-jury trials are warranted by facts in previous gangland trials.While the provision for use of the Special Criminal Court under the Offences Against the State Act 1939 withstood constitutional challenge in the case of Kavanagh v. Governor of Mountjoy Prison and others in 2002, it must be noted that the United Nations Human Rights found that the manner in which the State had handled that matter was in violation of the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The UN committee found that the State had failed to demonstrate that the decision to try Kavanagh before the Special Criminal Court was “based on reasonable and objective grounds” and, therefore, the accused’s right to “equality before the law and to the equal protection of the law has been violated”.  It brings no honour to Ireland to be found in breach of a UN covenant to which we are a party.  Removing the jury from the equation must be a matter of last resort and we must ensure that alternatives have been explored and dismissed for valid reasons before taking this step.Yesterday's edition of The Irish Times noted that there has been no evidence that jurors are reluctant to convict gang members in this jurisdiction and, moreover, that the new Criminal Court complex which is due to open shortly has special facilities for jurors to ensure that they cannot be “got at” during the course of a trial.The Bill contains a provision mandating annual Oireachtas ratification of the Special Criminal Court under this proposed legislation.  As we are all well aware from the manner in which similar provisions in the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act are dealt with each year, this provides for nothing more than a rubber stamp.  For the two years that I have been Fine Gael's justice spokesperson, renewal of the relevant sections of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act have been rushed through the Dáil at the last minute.  The Government Chief Whip, the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, advised that it needed to be renewed immediately or the provision would lapse, as I was informed by my party Whip, Deputy Kehoe.  This year, the Government gave the House 40 minutes to debate the renewal of sections 2 to 4, inclusive, 6 to 12, inclusive, 14 and 17 of the Offences Against the State (Amendment) Act 1998.  Such a careless and flippant approach makes a mockery of what is supposed to be a constitutional safeguard.More generally speaking, reform is long overdue in respect of how our juries are constituted.  At present, a preposterous range of professionals are excluded from jury duty, ab initio, and I would like the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, to take on the issue of jury reform head on, rather than skirt around it.Similarly, new measures in respect of detention procedures in Part 4 of the Bill are likely to give rise to constitutional challenges.  It is a significant departure to allow a garda of any rank in private and without legal representation to give evidence to a judge in order to secure an extension of the detention period.  While I am not calling into question the professionalism of the Garda Síochána, the custom heretofore of limiting the right to a senior officer reflected the importance of the experience and expertise that a garda of this rank has accumulated.  In addition, the provision reflected the gravity of the measure which precluded the defendant, his or her legal representative or the prosecutor from being present while the garda was giving evidence to the judge.  I would like the Minister to confirm to the House that he is confident that altering the status quo in respect of from whom judges may hear relevant evidence is constitutionally sound.  I would like to hear the rationale for making this change, which is very significant and far-reaching, whereby a judge and a junior garda can make decisions without reference to any other person and in private.In respect of the Bill's provisions on post-release orders, concerns have been raised in respect of the vague nature of restrictions or conditions which can be imposed on a person after release.  The Minister referred to the post-release orders being similar to those that have been included in the sexual offences legislation.  However, they are not working and are not being deployed.  We have not seen the electronic tagging that he announced on numerous occasions since he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  I know of no sexual offender whose post-release order involved electronic tagging and such post-release orders have been confined to signing the register, which in some recent cases has been found to be flawed in itself.  The record in that regard is not great.I wish to hear on Committee Stage the Minister's views on the constitutionality of these measures.  Moreover, it is not sufficient to state that one is advised by the Attorney General that everything is all right or that the Attorney General has informed one that matters are constitutionally sound.  Members must debate the rationale and the precedent for this matter and must debate what is or is not best practice or is sustainable in this regard.In respect of inferences to be drawn from the right to silence, which already exists on the Statute Book and again is contained in this Bill, this is a measure that Fine Gael believes is necessary in certain types of criminal cases.  However, once again there is no point in bringing in a measure that may subsequently fall foul of the Supreme Court on constitutional grounds or of the European Court of Human Rights.  Therefore, I suggest the Minister should introduce a provision to ensure that accused persons have access to a legal adviser in order that they are fully aware that invoking their right to silence may have adverse consequences at their trial.While the role of the Oireachtas is to legislate, a much greater and further reaching responsibility lies on the Government.  Ramming legislation through the Oireachtas will be the easy part for the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, as he has both the numbers to so do and the power to use the guillotine mechanism.  Flaws in our parliamentary system give him this luxury.  It is easy to amend the criminal laws but the hard part lies in the governance of the criminal justice system.Ireland will go down an undesirable road if we adopt the approach that it is cheaper to introduce harsher laws than to provide the resources necessary to allow existing laws to be used successfully against criminals for the protection of the greater good in society.  No amount of new laws can be a substitute for a well-resourced Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, a well-resourced Garda Síochána with access to top level technology, a modern, specialist approach to evidence that would be facilitated by a DNA database or for following the recommendations of Professor Kopp in respect of the State Laboratory.After 11 years, digital radio for the Garda Síochána on a nationwide level still is lacking.  Less than half the Garda stations are equipped with e-mail and the Garda PULSE system remains cumbersome and difficult.  The State Laboratory has half the staff that an expert report recommended it needed to carry out its work in an efficient and effective manner.  The Director of Public Prosecutions has seen his budget cut in recent months by the Government, which led him to make an unprecedented statement that he will find it difficult to run his office in the manner in which he is required by law.  We still lack a structured system for identity parades with two-way glass to protect witnesses.  Although the Minister talks about jury protection, he should tell Members about witness protection.  Rather than taking a practical step in respect of two-way glass, the Minister instead tells one that the witness protection programme is a failure for societal reasons and that there is nothing to be done.  This is hardly a visionary or practical approach.I will return to the points I make frequently in respect of gangland crime.  First, to defeat the gangsters, one must cut off their financial oxygen supply.  While it is true that the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, does admirable work, it also is true that by the time the CAB intervenes, such criminals already have peddled a considerable amount of drugs and acquired considerable wealth from their criminal activity and a large amount of damage already has been done.  Where is the commitment to putting resources into curtailing criminal activity at an earlier stage?  What is the twisted rationale behind having a single X-ray container scanner to cover all of our ports?  It is well known that this scanner moves around and that its movements are monitored by criminals, who simply use a port that is scanner-free when importing drugs.  It is negligence of a scandalous degree on the Government's part to allow this situation to continue.Similarly, an inquiry into the level of customs checks at smaller and private airports reveals that checks are rare or simply non-existent and to state that it is not cost-effective to have a customs presence is to be penny wise and pound foolish.  How much do the ravages of drugs cost this State on an annual basis?  Has a comparative analysis been done in respect of the high price we pay due to the easy availability of drugs versus the cost of stemming the tide of drugs pouring into the State daily?  A single patrol boat to man the coastline is painfully inadequate.  If one speaks to someone from a coastal area, such as my colleague, Deputy P. J. Sheehan, he or she will tell one that it is widely known that drugs frequently come in along the coast at night.  While the establishment of the EU Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre-Narcotics constitutes a huge step forward, we cannot rely on the European Union to solve our problems in this regard and the absence of such an approach is a dereliction of duty by the Government.Second, I frequently have made the case for prison reform.  Our strange prison system is one in which we lock people up for failing to pay a television licence fee but allow subversive prisoners to march while in prison, to parade in a military style and to intimidate prison officers.  We allow gangsters to conduct their business by mobile telephone and allow drug addicts to avail of packages lobbed over the walls of Mountjoy Prison on a regular basis.  We pack in prisoners tightly in Dickensian conditions and then feign surprise when they come out and reoffend.  Although little is done to assist the illiterate and the mentally ill who make up a sizable proportion of the prison population, prisoners who have been incarcerated for the gravest of offences appear to enjoy a better standard of living than do other inmates.  Reform at this level also is required if we are to take on gangland crime at a root and branch level.Ireland needs a Minister who is willing to approach criminal justice in a broad ranging and cohesive fashion.  We need a recognition that reform is needed across the board from juries to prisons.  We need a Government that recognises that huge problems like organised crime cannot be solved in isolation by one Department but require co-ordination across Departments.  For example, it is essential that the Department of Finance co-operates on the matter of customs resources.However, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, likes the easy route.  He prefers to ban legally held firearms than to tackle illegal firearms.  He prefers to get rid of jury trials than to explore what other options are available.  He prefers to ram through harsh measures without time for debate, despite the real risk that such provisions will fall foul of the courts on constitutional grounds or because of the European Convention on Human Rights.  He prefers to give the Garda greater powers rather than providing it with greater resources or dealing with manpower and technology issues.  This is not the path to dealing successfully with organised gangland crime.Gangland crime is entrenched in our society and must be addressed with a multilayered, multifaceted, thoughtful and evidence-based approach that reflects best practice and not in a rushed manner that arguably is somewhat draconian.  While the Minister sounds tough, his predecessor also sounded tough in 2006.  No Minister was more tough sounding than the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, before the election in 2007 and this measure is a repetition of that stance.  Fine Gael broadly supports this Bill because it is anxious to play its part to bring an end to the spiral of gangland killing in this State.  However, it is my firm belief that legislation is no substitute for resources at the coalface and I hope the Minister and his colleagues have the common sense to agree with this view.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13358	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	15	In yesterday's edition of the Irish Examiner, the Limerick State solicitor welcomed the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill but said that it would face difficulties.  When asked whether the new law represented a good day’s work, he replied:It remains to be seen, but it is an attempt to address a very serious problem.  And I have no doubt it will be challenged, and I have no doubt there will be difficulties ahead for this legislation.  But something has ... to be done and we just can't roll over and let these people take over our city and our country.He went on to state "the contract is being rewritten by the State on its terms, and I think rightly so".I completely agree with the sentiments expressed by the State solicitor and everyone wants this matter to be dealt with.  The Labour Party differs on this legislation, not on the sentiments regarding the need to tackle organised crime, but on whether the proposal before the House presents a solution to get society out of the morass in which it finds itself.  One's natural instinct is to ensure that every innocent victim will get justice.  One's human instinct is that the only way to handle these criminals is with a short, sharp shock.  The question remains, however, of whether the proposal before us will result in a crack down on organised crime or in legal challenges to the legislation on a number of fronts.  That question is not ideological, it is practical.  Will this legislation assist in the pursuit of criminals in Limerick and west Dublin or will it be challenged by their legal representatives at every turn?  Are we making good law or law that will be challenged due to loopholes?In the Criminal Justice Act 2006, there is already a considerable body of law that should adequately deal with organised crime.  I do not understand why the Government is hell-bent on swamping us with more law, common sense must prevail.  We all want to see these criminals behind bars, and no one in this House would advocate a soft approach that would not see the blight of organised criminal activity wiped out once and for all, but we differ on how this can best be achieved.  It cannot be achieved only through increased legislation, the dogs in the street will tell the Minister that the shortage of resources for the gardaí at the coalface is the most significant impediment to progress in bringing criminals to trial.The idea that we apply more legislation without a comprehensive spend on overtime, surveillance and other enabling mechanisms that would allow gardaí to get on with the job raises serious questions about this Government's strategy to tackle gangland crime.  If common sense was used, the gardaí would have all of the necessary intelligence gathering and surveillance mechanisms at their disposal to hinder any attempt at a crime.  The fact remains that the cutting of overtime for gardaí and the likelihood that there will be a massive cull of more experienced gardaí near the end of their tenure due to the possible taxation of pension lump sums will further exacerbate the situation.  We can have all the law we want but if the experience does not exist in the Garda Síochána to break down these criminal elements, it is all for nothing.  Laws such as that proposed today will matter not one jot if the resources to match are not in place.The first thing that strikes me is that there has been very little change to the definition of a criminal organisation from the 2006 Act except to include a requirement that two of the gang can be involved with a view to act in concert in the commission of an offence.  Has anyone been convicted under section 72 of the 2006 Act that makes it an offence for a person to participate in or contribute to any activity of such an organisation?It is a distraction to introduce a new offence under section 71(a) of directing the activities of a criminal organisation if it has not been possible to prove that a person is a member of a gang.  To introduce a provision to establish the requisite intent is a gimmick.  The new section 72(6) provides that it shall be presumed, until the contrary is shown, that participation or contribution was made with the requisite state of mind if the circumstances under which the relevant act was committed involved the possession by the defendant in the presence of one or more other persons of a balaclava, boiler suit or other means of disguise.  I hope the plumbers and handymen of the country know that wearing a boiler suit is now proof of requisite criminal intent of membership of a criminal organisation.The Minister has argued this legislation is necessary to uphold the rule of law.  Instead, by introducing a system whereby instead of seeking out evidence and putting it before a jury, a garda's opinion will suffice to convict and this can be done before a court sitting without a jury.  Granted, this is not the first time the opinion of a garda has been used to replace the obligation to obtain evidence and allow a court to decide on guilt, the Offences Against the State Act 1972 provided that in prosecutions for membership of a paramilitary organisation, the evidence of a chief superintendent as to that membership could be admissible.  At least the fact that only a very senior garda could give such evidence gave an indication of the seriousness of the matter.  Now, however, a prosecution can rest on the opinion of any garda who has the appropriate expertise.  This is a meaningless criterion because it is difficult to envisage a court refusing to hear the opinion evidence of a trained member of the Garda Síochána on the basis that he or she does not know enough about gangs.The garda's opinion can be based on the fact that the individual in question has previous convictions.  Again, the Minister has already asked us to support the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill, which will allow gardaí to plant listening devices where there is a suspicion of any arrestable offence.  I have no issue with this.  The stated purpose of that legislation is to obtain evidence with which to pursue gangland crimes but now we find we are not even going to rely on such evidence and instead all we will require is the opinion of a garda.  The Minister stated that such evidence will not go to the guilt of the person in question but there must be a further clarification on that point.Section 71 onwards deals with the Special Criminal Court, the main issue here.  If the perceived problem is that witnesses are afraid to give evidence, and we distinguish between witnesses and those who are members of a jury, surely the Minister should be looking at greater support for witnesses?  Any Bill that states that "it is hereby declared that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order in relation to an offence under each of the following provisions" conveys the impression that the current legal remedies are inadequate and must be overhauled.  Are we in a de facto state of emergency?  The Minister in this legislation expressly states that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with criminal organisations.  That is a serious contention that goes to the heart of the common law system and must be further analysed.  No evidence has been presented to demonstrate why the current operation of the courts is inadequate.  The provision in section 8 amends the Offences Against the State Act 1939 to allow certain offences to be tried at the non-jury Special Criminal Court, including the offence of directing a criminal organisation, participation in or contribution to certain activities, and the commission of an offence for a criminal organisation.  We acknowledge the role of the Special Criminal Court in that context and its powers have been extended in this regard.The protection of jury members and witnesses has been suggested as the reason for extending the remit of the Special Criminal Court.  However, as recently as last month, speaking at the annual prosecutors' conference, the Director of Public Prosecutions raised an important point about the participation of the ordinary citizen in the criminal justice system through service on juries.  This, he said, "imports a degree of democratic legitimacy into the system".  This is a point that is worth bearing in mind.  One can infer from this statement that it is in question whether the reality of the DPP referring a case to the Special Criminal Court will actually play out, given the potential doubt as to whether this legislation will stand on its own two feet and withstand any legal challenge down the line.The issue of witness intimidation will not be solved simply by the use of the Special Criminal Court, as witnesses will still need to give evidence in court.  The common sense point of view is that witness protection should be dealt with by instigating measures designed to protect witnesses' identities, if necessary, in addition to Garda protection operations.  This is a more rational approach.The decision on whether to prosecute a case in the Special Criminal Court comes down to one law officer, the DPP.  The existence of total discretion on his or her part as to whether to prosecute and to prosecute in the Special Criminal Court or otherwise is a significant power and must be exercised with great caution.  Perhaps the Bill could be amended to put this power on a statutory footing.  That would be a reasonable approach.  Could we not instead enact a provision within that section along the lines of the UK practice whereby the prosecution may apply for a non-jury trial in cases in which it can show evidence of a real danger of jury tampering?  This would ensure a robust response where there is proof of jury tampering.  The question for this Legislature is whether the provision is a new departure from the norm compared to other common law jurisdictions.  At what point should we depart from a principle enshrined in our Constitution for the pursuance of a goal that can be achieved by means other than fundamentally changing the basis of a criminal trial, namely the right to trial by jury?  The Minister should think long and hard about this provision.I put it to the Minister that the provisions contained within existing legislation should be adequate to deal with the fundamental premise of this Bill; namely, the eradication of organised crime.  There is some presumption that the new provisions are based on the threat posed by criminal gangs.  It conveys an impression that the people engaged in such criminal activity possess a malevolent influence that is beyond the powers of normal court procedures to pursue.  I do not buy into this.  It presumes that we in this House — representatives of the people — no longer have the confidence to curb criminal activity within the normal legal parameters and must embark on some pretence at emergency provisions to placate certain viewpoints.We have developed a new language and rhetoric with regard to organised crime and it needs to be deconstructed.  These people are mere individuals.  They do not live in locations that are beyond the powers of surveillance.  The High Chaparral in Limerick is not a remote location.  People can be photographed and tracked and their movements can be traced.  They are not possessed of special powers and the existing judicial system and corpus of law, coupled with the provision of adequate Garda resources, should be robust enough to bring them to justice.I wonder whether terms such as "organised crime" would ever have crept into our lexicon and would need to be legislated for if the State had provided adequate funding for Garda operations such as Anvil, which allowed the development of surveillance and checkpoints and acted as a thorn in the side of criminals.  The ability of the Garda to tackle crime is severely hampered by a cut in Garda overtime from approximately €120 million last year to €80 million this year.  A total of €21 million has been set aside this year for Operation Anvil, yet the State is spending approximately €12 million on policing north Mayo.  Does the Minister not see an inherent contradiction in his own policy in this regard?I doubt if one extra gangland boss or minion will be brought to justice as a result of the measures contained within the Bill.  We do not argue against any provision that addresses the increasing levels of violence and intimidation directed at witnesses and juries, or the use of the Special Criminal Court for the hearing of particular organised crime offences, but I would like to see some proof of the fact that juries are systematically being intimidated.  Does it really happen?

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13358	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	17	It is one thing to suggest that witnesses are being intimidated, but the suggestion that juries are being systematically intimidated and that this requires a seismic shift away from trial by jury should not be entertained without further analysis.  That a country of this size, which is not densely populated, must resort to such measures suggests that the successful tackling of crime should be predicated on the application of resources and not necessarily on a fundamental change in the law.  If there is proof beyond doubt that juries are being tampered with and intimidated, there are protective instruments that can be applied which are practical and based on a common sense approach.  These are well documented.Under section 7 of the Bill, the opinion of any garda who appears to the court to possess the appropriate expertise will be admissible as evidence of the existence of a criminal organisation.  Under this section, expertise means experience, specialised knowledge or qualifications.The Irish Council for Civil Liberties drafted a paper prior to the instigation of this legislation from which I will quote.  I do not necessarily agree with all the views espoused by the various civil society organisations and I have my own view about the rule of law.  However, there are certain points of law addressed by the ICCL which should be read into the record.  It points out that the opinion of the garda can be informed by the existence of previous convictions of the accused.  The Supreme Court has considered the use of belief evidence and its compatibility with Article 38 of the Constitution and Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the right to a fair trial.While a garda may claim privilege as to his or her sources when being cross-examined about belief evidence, the Supreme Court is clear that a conviction cannot take place without supportive or corroborative evidence in recognition of the disadvantage that accrues to the defence in a trial.  Moreover, in regard to the rank of garda who is entitled to provide belief evidence, the court has stated that the relevant provisions of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 were carefully crafted to ensure belief evidence must come from an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent.  This, the Supreme Court stated, was with a view to establishing trust and credibility as far as possible.  This must be borne in mind in regard to the provisions contained within this Bill.  The UN human rights committee has referred to decisions of the Director of Public Prosecutions in assigning cases to the courts not being made public.  To confer further powers on the Director of Public Prosecutions for the hearing of particular organised crime offences in the Special Criminal Court on the basis of his or her total discretion begs the question as to whether the application of increased Garda resources might be a more reasonable solution to the problem which would negate the need for these provisions.On the matter of secret detention hearings, under Part 4 of the Bill, procedures of District Court detention hearings for the purposes of extending the detention of persons under the Offences Against the State Act are altered.  One legal opinion suggests it is contrary to the principles of fair trial that the Bill allows for the hearing to take place in private if the judge considers there may be a risk of prejudice.  In justifying this, it is claimed that members of organised criminal gangs are attending the detention hearings and deciphering the direction of the investigation from the evidence given in court.  However, this provision fundamentally alters the nature of criminal justice in this State, allowing for the judge to hear evidence from a garda of any rank, in private and without legal representation.  This includes answers to questions and a cross-examination without either the defendant, his or her legal representatives or the prosecutor present.  In essence, this means a person can be held without knowledge of the grounds on which the judge is justifying his or her continued detention.  That detention can be justified by secret information from any member of the Garda Síochána, irrespective of his or her expertise or experience.  Regardless of whether or not we are convinced of the necessity for such provisions, the reality is that any criminal lawyer worth his or her salt will most likely be able to identify any number of potential loopholes and, thus, the prospect of a legal challenge.We must also look at our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.  Even where we are seeking to make provision for heinous crimes such as murder, our obligations under the convention remain clear.  We must avoid a situation where a person detained on a murder charge ultimately walks free as a consequence of a challenge to this law under an Article 40 provision.  It does not matter whether or not we are in favour of waiving Article 40 rights in emergency situations.  My point is that we must avoid making bad law or law that will be discovered by a good criminal lawyer to have all types of loopholes.  That is how the State has typically dealt with issues relating to criminality heretofore.  Criminal lawyers have always been able to find loopholes that have allowed people to walk free in certain circumstances.  If we are to tackle this problem once and for all, we must make robust and effective law that will not be subjected to future challenge at a supranational court, as Deputy Charles Flanagan observed.We intend to propose several amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage.  Practical changes can be made that will not alter the Minister's modus operandi in seeking to tackle organised crime.  In particular, we must ensure there is protection for witnesses and that jury tampering does not take place.  I understand the courts in the United Kingdom have found that the state is obliged to take particular steps to protect certain vulnerable categories of people such as witnesses.  We are not so naive as to suggest there is an onus on the State to prevent every possibility of violence, but where individuals are exposed to threats to their lives, the State will, in certain circumstances, be obliged to provide police protection.  In order to fulfil these obligations, we must ensure effective measures are taken to thwart attempts to trace witnesses and collaborators of justice by criminal organisations.  Several procedures can be put in place to ensure juries are not tampered with and that witnesses are afforded adequate protections.  These must be brought forward as practical measures in line with the implementation of this legislation.Any procedural rules that are enacted to protect the rights of witnesses must be formulated taking into account the need to safeguard the criminal trial process.  Measures which could be made available to assist witnesses include anonymity before, during and after the criminal trial.  However, this should be an exceptional measure and should be set down in law so that procedures are available for the defence to challenge the need for anonymity.A cause of concern in the criminal justice system is the considerable delay in court proceedings in the State.  If court proceedings could be expedited in a timely fashion, this would offset the risk of any potential tampering with juries.  We should not set about fundamentally changing our common law system when we could instead tackle criminals with robust measures through adequately funded and effective policing mechanisms.  While we agree with the tenor of the Bill in terms of what it seeks to achieve, we are of the view that it requires amendment.

#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	20	In an ideal world, any Government would be reluctant to bring forward the types of extraordinary provision contained in this legislation.  This State is recognised internationally for its highly developed sense of jurisprudence and respect for human rights, as enshrined in the Constitution.  This is a reflection of our values as a people.  We have a deep respect for the right to fair trial, constitutional justice and fair procedures.  The question we must ask is whether this legislation reflects our society as it is today.Deputy Sherlock asked if these measures were needed as they would bring about a fundamental change in our legal system.  Our society has changed fundamentally and today we must address whether the provisions in this legislation adequately reflect the changed reality of our society in the first instance and if they reflect the values of our people in their desire to have a response to that changed reality.Deputy Sherlock mentioned the word "naivety" a number of times during his contribution and I will address that later in my contribution.  There is much naivety in this debate as the reality is we are dealing with some of the most ruthless and callous people ever to come into our society.  We can see it in my home city at first hand; naivety is something the people of Limerick do not expect of their legislators and they want responses which are commensurate and proportionate to the threat they face.My city has changed radically in the past ten years.  We now have highly organised criminal gangs which do not only operate in the city but which have also committed crimes in Dublin.  As these people are prepared to intimidate jurors in my city of Limerick, it would be naive to think they are not capable or willing of intimidating jurors in this or any other city in the country.I marched with 10,000 people in Limerick a few short weeks ago in response to the callous murder of Roy Collins, and I would have liked all Members of the House to have joined us in that march to see what happened at its margins.  People were on the streets with mobile telephones and cameras taking footage of the people of Limerick marching to defend their rights and city.  These were not tourists but members of criminal gangs.  That is the type of intimidation we are talking about; it is a culture which is all-pervading in society.It would be naive to think the intimidation we are trying to tackle is just the silent telephone call to a juror at 2 a.m. in the dead of night.  This is a collective intimidation of the people and potential jurors in this country.  Each year, dozens of people come into my constituency office with a witness summons and I can see the fear in their eyes and concern they have about serving on a jury in my home city.  I am almost ashamed to say this but it is the reality we must deal with none the less.  We cannot walk away from this and the question is whether our response is proportionate to that changed reality.Like all Members, we would like an infinite amount of time to discuss this legislation but the threat is real and current.  We will have four and a half hours now to discuss the legislation, four hours on Tuesday after the Order of Business and approximately three hours on the following Friday.  That will be a total of 11.5 hours.  We would all like more time but the people of Limerick when they marched said with a very clear and loud voice that they wanted answers and an immediate response.What is that response to be?  Are we to do nothing and continue with the existing system, which is the logical conclusion of the Labour Party argument?  Do we go so far as to introduce internment, which was advocated by many, including some people who marched with me, although I do not personally advocate it?  Do we, as Deputy Sherlock mentioned, add significant resources to combat the problem?  The Garda Síochána in Limerick has indicated that it has the necessary resources and they are working well.  The track record of the Garda in Limerick proves that.  Do we give the Garda and the Judiciary the tools with which to deal with these extraordinary crimes?The Government response is that we treat this threat the same as that which was posed to our country over 20 or 30 years by subversive organisations.  There is little difference in the threats if we consider the characteristics of the crimes and the gangs or organisations we are dealing with.  One could draw a direct comparison as both groups are ultimately highly organised and the leaders very rarely carry out the acts we are talking about.  Their objective is to threaten the people of the State in their individual communities and they see themselves as being above the State.We are once again in a battle between the State and organised crime so it is logical and reasonable to use the same tools against these nefarious organisations that we used successfully against organised crime in this country.  I hope all Members of this House subscribe to that simple logical argument.The question was repeatedly posed regarding the appropriateness or otherwise of the use of the Special Criminal Court.  The tenor of Deputy Sherlock's contribution echoed an organisation's statement that the lawful basis of administration of justice would be undermined by the introduction of this legislation.

I cannot agree with that as the thousands of people with whom we marched in Limerick have said that if we do not proceed along these lines, the gangs and organisations will ultimately take control.We deal with the Garda Síochána and the State solicitor in Limerick, Mr. Michael Murray, on a regular basis.  Mr. Murray stated publicly this week that he has no doubt whatever that jurors are being intimidated and the gardaí tell us jurors are intimidated even by the mere presence in court of the criminals.  It is impossible to get properly constituted juries; hundreds of potential jurors were sought in criminal cases in the past two years in Limerick but it has been very difficult to fill juries.  That speaks for itself.In the limited time available I would like to discuss briefly the other issue which has caused much discussion, the evidence of gardaí regarding the classification of an organisation as a criminal gang.  This is an important provision because in order to convict somebody of directing an organised criminal activity as part of a criminal gang, one must prove conclusively that there is a criminal gang.  From my personal knowledge of meeting with the gardaí in Limerick, I know they are the most qualified people to give this expert evidence before the court.  The fact that they are gardaí does not alter the fact that they are the most appropriate people to give this evidence as they can say this from their own experience.We must remember that in giving that expert evidence, they can be tested and it is not conclusive.  Gardaí can be cross-examined by defence counsel and ultimately it is for the three-judge Special Criminal Court to use the same standards of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  That has not and will never change.  It is the manner in which we go about this process in a very changed society that we need to address.

The freedom of our society and the protection of what former Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, called the institutions of the State should take precedent over petty politicking.Democratic societies must be vigorous in defending themselves against assault or people who regard themselves as above the law.  Since the late 1920s, this State has faced many challenges to its authority from armed groups.  The traditional jury trial system has not always been able to cope with such challenges.  The Offences Against the State Act 1939 and the establishment of the Special Criminal Court in 1972 have enabled State and society to counter ruthless armed subversion with considerable success over the long term.  A three-judge court has many merits.  The judges, who are all immensely experienced, confer and act collegially and, given that they have the full backing of the State, they are not vulnerable to intimidation.  This is not to say, however, that attempts are never made to intimidate them in court.  Most importantly, their reputation is linked to their judgments, whereas a jury verdict — right or wrong — has few consequences for the personal reputation of any of its members.  Since the 1980s, I am not aware of any allegations of a serious miscarriage of justice in the Special Criminal Court.  In many ways, it represents the Irish justice system at its best.  It is tough and efficient in protecting citizens from potential anarchy but not at the expense of innocents.  I have great respect for its judges.The rights of citizens, and especially the rights to life, bodily integrity, freedom from fear and a peaceful and law abiding society, are paramount.  Gangland warfare is as serious a threat to these rights as paramilitary violence and it is not good enough for the State to act as a helpless bystander.  There is every justification for redeploying the tried and tested mechanisms used against illegal terrorist organisations in the fight against drug related gangland warfare.  The jury system continues to play a vital role in more traditional criminal and civil court cases, although the number of exemptions from jury service now allowed raises questions about its representative character.It is not acceptable that only criminal underlings are caught and sentenced whereas gang leaders direct from a distance and derive the biggest benefits from the proceeds of crime.  A real deterrent to organised crime is required from top to bottom.  We need to demonstrate the sheer stupidity and futility of spending the best years of one's life behind bars.  No financial or lifestyle gain temporarily acquired is worth that price.  We have to restore communities' confidence that crime will not be allowed to prevail in any part of this State.  We have over the years taken many unusual initiatives to combat crime, one of the most effective of which was the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau.  If the system allows too many criminals to evade justice and flaunt their wealth, extraordinary measures have to be devised and implemented.Like most of its predecessors, this Bill has encountered libertarian reservations.  As shown in respect of Donegal, this State is not afraid where necessary to investigate real or alleged abuses of power by members of its law enforcement agencies.  Nobody today condones or tolerates physical maltreatment of suspects or so-called confessions dictated under physical duress or deprivation.  While inferences can be drawn from silence, it has to be remembered that avoiding self-incrimination may not always be the motive for silence.  People sometimes prefer to be thought guilty than admit to a personally embarrassing alibi or incriminate somebody who might do harm to them.We should have as much concern for the human rights and liberties of the citizen whose life has been adversely affected, permanently damaged or ended as for those who are accused and before a court.  Human rights and civil liberties matter, as is clearly revealed by despotic societies in which people are sometimes driven to the streets to demand change.  These rights and liberties are best protected by a rigorous and impartial law enforcement system which does not let anyone become too powerful to evade justice.  A long established judicial system will not always be adequate to deal with sophisticated gangs possessing the latest equipment.  The criminal justice system not only has to match their systems but must also be capable of breaking them up.I congratulate the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and his officials on bringing forward this Bill and strengthening the ability of the Garda and the courts to deal with the scourge of gangland crime.  What goes on in the nearby city of Limerick is a matter of concern for the people of west Tipperary.  I note the Minister's statement that the murder of Roy Collins finally converted him to the necessity of this legislation.  We all look forward to the upper tiers of criminal gangs being brought to justice.  We once had to listen to near daily reports of fresh victims of the Troubles.  Today, news bulletins report the latest victims of gangland crime.  The Bill before us can help us overcome that evil.  It is time to demoralise criminal gangs and improve the reputation and quality of life in deprived urban areas which also need positive programmes of regeneration.  I hope the Bill brings an end to the situation whereby certain notorious criminals walk around with impunity even though gardaí have clear intelligence on their activities.  Above all, I hope we can begin to deter young people from the criminal world, where they are literally deprived of their future.I look forward to the Bill's implementation and to seeing its impact.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill although, like other speakers, I am concerned that the time allowed for debate is not sufficient.  Some of us have been calling for this kind of legislation for several years.  I have been in this House for more than a few years and can recall the all-night debate that took place on the Criminal Justice Act 1984.  Like other Deputies, I raised concerns about civil liberties.  However, the advice we received at the time that civil liberties would be seriously eroded by the Act was wrong.Unfortunately, the rights of ordinary law-abiding citizens have been cast aside and trampled in the past 15 years.  This Bill should have been before the House at least ten years ago because the activities of criminal gangs are virtually unchallenged.  These gangs have intimidated witnesses, jurors and society and have frustrated gardaí and the courts.A court in the United States recently sentenced a person to 150 years in prison, which must be a sobering thought for anyone involved in criminal activities.  However, it is more likely that a person who committed similar crimes in this country would be rewarded rather than punished.  What have we done wrong?  The rights of society have been eroded while we watched from the sidelines.  People have been shot, maimed and intimidated.  Organised money laundering, racketeering and drug smuggling, which we used to associate with criminal gangs in Chicago, are now commonplace here.  I have heard stories in this regard from some of my own constituents.I am not certain whether this Bill is sufficient.  I have had this conversation with several predecessors of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  It will only work if there is a clear intent by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to ensure that the Bill's proposals are carried out to the letter.  Any avoidance of that will cause problems.Let us look at the way things have happened.  We have all had instances where people bring to our attention the fact that serious criminal activity is going on.  The media tell us regularly that people have been shot who are "known to gardaí".  We ask ourselves how such people can be known to the gardaí, yet nothing happens.  We must protect people's rights and entitlements, as well as ensuring that an accused person has a fair trial.  It is part and parcel of our society that a trial is fair, but the process must also be fair to society.  There is no use in it being fair for the accused, if society is ignored and the public's rights and entitlements are trampled upon.  If that were the case, the trial would no longer be fair.Society is under threat because it is not being protected by the laws of the land.  The institutions of the State are under daily threat from organised criminals and nobody is better at doing it than they are.  What will we do about this situation?  The Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, referred to detention.
#PeterPowerFF	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-party	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-dob	unknown-#PeterPowerFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Internment.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	36	He mentioned internment, but I do not think that is the answer.  However, I do not see anything wrong with detention while awaiting trial.  That must be considered but it will not be considered in this context except by a circuitous route.  The Minister has more knowledge of the legal system than I have, but until these people — whether they are major or minor players — are put behind bars while a case is compiled against them, society will not win because they are too powerful.  They are virtually an army now with a wide scale of influence.  They continue to intimidate the media and did so in the infamous and tragic case of Veronica Guerin.  Everybody said how awful it was, yet it happened before our eyes.  She was intimidated many times by criminal elements, but she fearlessly pressed on and wrote about them.  It took a great deal of guts to do so, but where did it get her?  Society let her down.  This House then moved to establish the Criminal Assets Bureau and improve the law in favour of society and those who were standing up to criminal elements.Even now, following all that Veronica Guerin challenged through her writing, investigative journalists are being threatened regularly.  They have written about it repeatedly.  I often wonder whether the courts are being intimidated as well.  The way criminal elements treat the legal system suggests that the courts are also under threat.Some time ago, together with the late Tony Gregory and others, I visited other European jurisdictions to ascertain the degree to which information was swapped between police forces throughout Europe.  Unfortunately, however, it only happens on a limited basis.  In the last six months the Joint Committee on European Affairs was addressed by representatives of Europol and Eurojust.  From those meetings we learned that the police authorities in some EU member states were able to get more information from the media than from their counterparts or governments in other EU countries.  There is something wrong with that situation and the criminal elements well know it.  They pursue their activities in a way which puts them above and beyond the law by virtue of the cover they get from that lack of co-operation between police forces.  I do not want to go into the benefits that would accrue to the justice system from the Lisbon treaty because that is a matter for another day.Another issue that must be tackled is the abuse of the bail laws.  I cannot understand how somebody accused of a serious criminal offence — where there is clear corroborative evidence to the effect that the person committed a crime such as murder, maiming or extortion — has the right to bail until such time as he or she is proved guilty.  This is happening on the basis of a Supreme Court decision way back in the 1960s where it was deemed that all persons were innocent until proven guilty.  In theory they are, but if they are a threat to society, including the courts, gardaí and the public, then to my mind they have no right to bail.  Their right to bail should be challenged, which will require a constitutional amendment.  Whatever it requires, it needs to be dealt with because if not, the kind of contempt we have seen for the courts and the judicial system in general will continue.I accept that everyone is entitled to a legal defence, but it is the nature of that defence that worries me from time to time.  While this is not a criticism of the legal profession, I cannot understand how somebody can go into court to defend the indefensible on the basis of the legal right to a defence.  Some of my colleagues are legal professionals and my comments do not refer to them.  I cannot understand how somebody in the course of defending someone charged with a criminal offence, can denigrate or defame a deceased victim by purely using a tissue of lies.  How can that be countenanced by the legal profession and the courts?  There have been a number of such cases in recent times.  Whether they concern organised, individual or haphazard crime, it is high time a cold, hard gaze was cast upon the abuse of that right to a defence.  That abuse is being upheld and supported by people in the legal profession who know full well that a tissue of lies is involved.  In the interests of their own credibility, it must be time for someone to say "Because I know you're telling lies, I will refuse to defend you on that basis, so find another defence".Deputy Sherlock referred to previous convictions, which is an old chestnut.  One readily understands that in a criminal trial a reference to previous convictions could well prejudice the jury.  It could create a situation where the accused person appeals to a higher court and gets off scot free on the basis that his or her right to a fair trial was prejudiced.  That is grand but there should be some measurement of the extent and degree of the previous activity of the individual concerned — which the Bill does to some extent — in order to come to some kind of fair-minded conclusion as to whether or not it was good for society that this person should be acquitted on this basis.Not so long ago, I read of a case where a person from another jurisdiction was on trial in another jurisdiction — the heart of this island in fact.  He had a string of convictions and was still serving his sentence for some of them.  The information had to be withheld from the jury during the course of the trial, and I can understand the reasons for that.  However, it was touch and go.  Fortunately, the person was convicted of that crime.  It was the most heinous crime, and not just one incidence, but several.  I am not a legal professional and I am not suggesting that the legal professionals are wrong, but there is something wrong that needs to be addressed in that area.We should be very careful that in cases where the defence uses the situation to libel the victim, including and especially the deceased victim, or where the defendant has a string of convictions which clearly would lead us to conclude that while he may not have committed a crime, it should be viewed against the background of his professional activity over the last ten years.  We should ask a serious question as to whether it would be good for society to ignore that.I have been involved in various cases over the years in this jurisdiction, and in other jurisdictions, where there was a suggestion of a miscarriage of justice, or at least evidence withheld which was to the detriment of the accused.  I am conscious that the degree to which the law satisfies the requirements of the day must be determined by the integrity of the system.  By that I mean whether the system can be corrupted, abused or twisted in any way which would create a situation whereby a person could be wrongly accused, convicted and imprisoned.  These things have happened, so it is important to ensure that while we protect society from the activities of the criminals, we also protect the system and its integrity from abuses by anybody on either side wishing to misinterpret things to suit them.  We need to have a sound system that deals with crime, not a system that abuses people's rights and entitlements.  That is where the question of balance comes in.  If that balance does not manifest itself in the course of all our laws, particularly criminal law, then we have a serious problem.Like other people in this House, I have come across cases where certain information was brought to my attention.  The Minister of State will undoubtedly say that the Deputy should consult the Garda, but that is not the job of Members of this House.  It is the job of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Minister, the Garda Síochána and the legal system.  Other Members spoke about intimidation, and there is widespread intimidation at the moment.  The Minister of State spoke about intimidation in Limerick, and many of us in this House have known about it for years. I could never understand why society managed to ignore it.  Sometimes people say that it does not happen where they live, or that it has not happened to them yet.  It was there for us all to see.  There have been cases of serious intimidation, not only of jurors or witnesses, but of gardaí as well.  It is very simple for the system to become corrupted if a criminal element gets into a position where it can use influence on the Garda.  That has happened.

I want to finish on the definition of a criminal organisation.  That will present some fun for the various legal actors on all sides in this business.  It is where the weakness exists in this Bill.  There are several instances where ordinary, previously law-abiding citizens have found themselves in a situation whereby a criminal gang had been able to dictate to them, intimidate and compromise them in order to meet the requirements of that gang.  The criminal gang is currently off screen, and the unfortunate fool who is used as the tool of the trade is the person who gets caught.

I spoke in this House not too long ago on the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009, welcoming its passage.  I recall saying that I thought it was a measure that started to tilt the law in favour of law-abiding citizens and away from the criminal.  That is something that must be warmly welcomed.  I applaud the Minister for going even further with this Bill.  There is no doubt that the many right thinking people in this country will thank him for what he is doing.Some will not be so happy with it, such as the Irish Human Rights Commission.  On page 6 of its observations on the Bill, the commission states:The IHRC queries a blanket assumption about the actual or potential level or jury intimidation in Ireland.  In addition, to address the risk of jury intimidation, there are numerous intermediate law reform measures that could be adopted, including having an anonymous jury, screening the jury from public view, protecting the jury during the trial, or locating the jury in a different place from where the trial is being held with communication by video link.Broadly speaking, the views of the IHRC are balanced in trying to set out its side of the story.  I do not have any difficulty with that.  However, it comes up short of endorsing what the Minister is doing here, but that is to be expected.  Its suggestions on what could be done about jury intimidation are naive in the extreme.  I was listening to the speech of the Minister of State, Deputy Power, and he has more first-hand knowledge of what is going on than most of us, because of what is happening in Limerick.  He referred to the day of the march in Limerick, where people were being video recorded and photographed by criminal elements when they were marching.  That is intimidation.  How can people say that people will not be intimidated if they are moved off site?  Given the resources at the disposal of these gangs, they will easily find out where those people are sequestered and the intimidation will continue.  I do not accept that argument.This morning I read a statement from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties which always seems to take a more hysterical view on what is happening.  The heading on its statement read: "The Minister's crime Bill antics abuse the Dáil."  What about the abuse perpetrated on the Collins and Geoghegan families in Limerick and on so many other families throughout the country which have been intimated by these people?  It seems to worry about the civil liberties of criminals but what about other people's civil liberties?  I do not hold any truck with that argument and I am certain the vast majority of the people hold a similar view to me.Section 5 seeks to target those in a criminal organisation who give the orders.  Some of these people may not participate directly in the commission of criminal offences.  However, we are including the words "at any level of the organisation's structure".  That means we may finally start to get at the people at the top.  Until now, we have only been catching the mules and the runners.  Everyone asks why we cannot get the people at the top organising these crimes.  Like a pyramid, people thought that if we could remove the people at the bottom, the whole structure would collapse.  Unfortunately, that has not happened.  As we removed those people, more came in to replace them.  We must change the way we do things and go after the people at the top, which is exactly what this legislation allows us to do.Section 5 also mentions imprisonment for life.  What does imprisonment for life mean in this country?  It could be for as little as eight, ten, 12 or 14 years.  We are not tough enough.  We watch quite a number of crime series from the United States on television which mirror what is happening in its justice system.  Imprisonment for life in the United States means 25, 30 or 40 years.  Deputy Durkan mentioned somebody getting a sentence of 150 years imprisonment.  That is something at which we will have to look because imprisonment for life must mean something more than it does as it is not a sufficient deterrent.It is a long time since I heard section 30 of the Offences Against the State Act 1939 quoted.  A number of years ago, we heard about it regularly when the IRA was in its heyday.  We constantly heard about cases taken under this legislation.  The public supported what Governments of different persuasions were doing at that time.  I realise there might be a difference in that there was a misplaced idealism among some people at that time which led to many innocent people suffering and being killed.  The same is happening now except it does not involve subversive organisations but criminal gangs in Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere, although they seem to be largely in those two cities.  The people supported us previously when we used the Offences Against the State Act 1939 and there is no doubt in my mind but that we will get full support from the public for using it once more.I am reminded of a court case in 1986, the People v. Quilligan.  At that time, the Supreme Court said the operation of the above mentioned Act was not necessarily confined to subversive organisations.  That was clearly set out in law a number of years ago.  It is not confined to subversive organisations and can be expanded and used in other areas.  That is the Minister’s intention and I am glad he is doing that.I read a report in the newspaper in recent days which indicated that the Garda was starting to profile some of the criminal gangs in anticipation of this law coming into force.  I do not know what the profiling entails.  Does it mean it will also look at the means of these individuals?  I am quite sure the Criminal Assets Bureau is looking at the assets of many of these people already as they have considerable wealth, but there are no visible signs of how they acquired it.As a result of this legislation, I expect we will see many people who have become wealthy through their criminal activities come before the courts.  That leads me to the point that, generally speaking, these people go to court, look for free legal aid, as they have no visible means of support, and free legal aid is granted to them which is a drain on the resources of this country.  If profiles are being carried out by the Garda and if the Criminal Assets Bureau has information, it should be used and free legal aid refused in such cases.  I very much welcome this legislation.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	44	Like other Deputies, I condemn the circumstances in which the drafting of this Bill was necessitated, namely, the savage murder of Roy Collins who was killed because he was a relative of a State witness in a murder trial against a gangland criminal.  These organised crime gangs are seeking to challenge the authority of the State in the way we police our country and that cannot be allowed.  It is natural that we, as legislators, should seek to toughen our criminal laws to provide as robust a framework as possible in which the Garda Síochána can operate to bring these thugs to justice.However, what is before this House is a Bill which will have far-reaching implications for the manner in which the State administers criminal justice and I do not believe it is one the House should lightly consider nor do I think it is one which should be rushed through the Oireachtas.  In particular, I refer to section 8 which declares that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and creates scheduled offences relating to gangland crime to be tried in front of the Special Criminal Court in non-jury trials.  Our Constitution provides for a right for criminal trial by jury save in circumstances where the ordinary courts are deemed inadequate and ineffective.My concern stems from the fact the Special Criminal Court will not necessarily solve this problem of trying gangland criminals and publicly at least a clear demonstration that the ordinary courts are inadequate for trying gangland criminals appears to be absent.  I can only presume that the situation is so drastic that the Garda Síochána has indicated that there is no other option.I also distinguish between the intimidation of witnesses, which is the spark of the legislation, and the intimidation of juries.  The Special Criminal Court is not the solution to witness intimidation as witnesses will still have to give evidence in a criminal trial.  On the issue of jury tampering or intimidation, there are a number of alternate measures which could be considered, including anonymous juries, video-link communication and restricting the jury from public view.It is interesting to note that under UK legislation, the prosecution must bring forth evidence of real and present danger of jury tampering to secure a non-jury trial.  That is stated in section 44 of the UK Criminal Justice Act 2003.  I note the temporal safeguards included in the legislation such as the requirement for the House to pass a resolution after one year to keep scheduled offences operable.  However, should a more compelling case-by-case approach in which the Director of Public Prosecutions must advocate in each case why the ordinary courts are inadequate, be stitched into the legislation?  This may be a better way of proceeding.Legislation of this significance should not be rushed through the Houses.  For legislation as profound as this to be published on a Tuesday morning and to be passed a mere seven sitting days later does not do the House any service.  One key role of a parliament——

I appreciate the urgency of the situation on the ground.  However, if we need to sit a few extra days to accommodate legislation which will have consequences as far-reaching as this, so be it.  The full implications of this legislation need to be teased out and ventilated.A more focused discussion of recidivism and the Prison Service in rehabilitation is needed.  I attended the annual general meeting of the Irish Penal Reform Trust which discussed the clear measures adopted abroad in using prison services to rehabilitate prisoners successfully.  I believe there are many who will not be rehabilitated, who will not move away from a life of crime.  Many guests of the nation, however, could benefit from education and training with the possibility of turning away from a life of crime.Recently I met a 19 year old man who had been a guest of the nation.  At the tender age of 18, he had to share a room with four adult males who smoked heroin in his presence.  Making a young man, who is still a child in many respects, share a room with four drug users will irreparably alter his future.  We should be looking at alternatives and investing more in addressing the causes of recidivism.

I was extremely surprised at Deputy Cuffe's remarks on rushing the legislation through.  It strikes me as more than disingenuous to condemn the rushed nature and guillotining of legislation when speaking from the Government benches.  We spent several months this year debating statements on a variety of issues while waiting for legislation to be brought before the House.  Fine Gael has been very clear and vocal in its criticism of how legislation has been handled in the House over the past several weeks.  I recommend Deputy Cuffe take his problems to his party Ministers and suggest they do something about it at Cabinet instead of speaking out of both sides of his mouth.  Coming into the House supporting the Government while at the same time criticising it——

#LucindaCreighton	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-party	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-dob	unknown-#LucindaCreighton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	52	Gangland crime is a major problem in society, caused by failures of government, the political system and society itself.  While we need to examine wide-ranging solutions to deal with the causes of crime and the lifestyle that brings young people into gangs, it is essential tough legislation is in place to deal with the activities of these criminals.  With their activities in the past 12 months, and particularly after the murders of Roy Collins and Shane Geoghegan, I am pleased the Government has decided to take up this issue and legislate to give the Garda and courts the powers to tackle this serious problem.In November when Fine Gael was calling for such legislation, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said in the Chamber and at press conferences there was no need for it.  I am on the record of the House specifically calling for legislation to allow the use of the Special Criminal Court to tackle gangland crime.  At the time we were scoffed at.  The Minister claimed there was no need for such legislation as he had consulted with the Garda Commissioner and everything was okay.  Clearly, it was not okay.  Unfortunately, it took more murders and almost insurrection from some of these criminal gangs for the Government to wake up and realise such legislation was necessary.Gangland crime is now on a par with the paramilitary activity we saw in the 1970s and 1980s.  Deputy Cuffe mentioned that this legislation in some way implies the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with gangland crime.  The reality is that they are inadequate.  It has been proved that traditional jury trials are inadequate on the basis that it is impossible for the Garda to secure convictions in such court cases.  The statistics highlight this.  Since 2005, there have been 102 gun murders with only four convictions.  In 2008 there were 20 gun murders and this year 15 gangland murders with no possibility of conviction in any case.  In 2008, there were 106 incidents involving grenades, pipe bombs and other explosive devices, an increase of 340% in 12 months.  It is about time we faced up to these stark facts and tackled them.Gangland crime is not only a threat to individual security but to our fundamental democracy.  It is a threat to people's basic right to enjoy peace and security on the streets and a democratic, just and safe society.  The Criminal Justice Act 2006 created the offence of gangland membership.  At the time, I welcomed the move but it was inadequate.  Often times those gang members on the front line committing murders and ferocious attacks are the fall guys, not the ones directing the criminal activity, pulling the strings and running these gangland organisations.  I welcome the Bill's measure which will establish the particular offence of directing a criminal gang.  This measure, which both I and the Fine Gael justice spokesperson, Deputy Charles Flanagan, called for last autumn, is a significant step.The Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 which was passed by the House last week will be a necessary element of the process of helping to secure convictions.  The Bill before the House is more significant because it will give additional powers to the Garda, thereby enabling the force to secure crucial convictions.I would like to speak about the section of the Bill that provides for a new offence of directing a criminal gang or organisation.  I am disappointed that life imprisonment is the maximum sentence that can be given to a person convicted under the section.  The Government should consider providing for life imprisonment to be the minimum sentence for this offence.  As we all know, mandatory minimum sentences have been ignored or very liberally interpreted by the courts in many cases.  A bar has to be set.  By providing for a maximum sentence of life imprisonment, we are not sending as powerful a message to the Judiciary as we would if we provided for life imprisonment as a minimum sentence.  I ask the Minister to consider my proposal.It is obvious that the provision that certain offences should be deemed to be scheduled offences which will be tried in the Special Criminal Court is one of the most crucial elements of the legislation.  I strongly believe this is the only way to deal with this type of criminal activity.  I do not think we can quantify the extent of the intimidation of, and interference with, juries.  While we will never fully know the extent or scale of it, we know it has been happening.  Those who serve on juries, or their families, may still be at risk from vindictive and dangerous people five or ten years later.  I welcome the decision to take certain trials out of the hands of juries and into the hands of the Special Criminal Court.  Non-jury trials offer a much greater opportunity for proper and meaningful trials to end with the securing of convictions.  It is necessary for justice to be done in this manner, particularly in the interests of the victims of criminal activity.  This measure will go some way to eliminate the risk of jury tampering which has been a significant problem during the years, especially in court cases involving gangland crime.I accept the point made by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and other bodies that alternative approaches are needed if we are to protect juries.  As Ireland is such a small country, I do not think any of the measures proposed by such organisations would go far enough to protect the identity and security of jurors.  Other associated problems such as the fact that many people are able to get out of jury service have also been raised.  The lack of broad representation on juries was not much of a problem in the past, but it has become a major problem in recent times.  The legislation before the House will ensure such problems are avoided in the future.I welcome the decision to allow Garda expert evidence to be admissible.  Anyone who deals with the Garda on a reasonably regular basis will be aware that professional criminals know what they are doing.  They know how to circumvent the law and are aware of issues such as the admissibility of evidence.  They know how to get around many of the obstacles we put in their way.  The Garda finds it almost impossible to build a book of evidence that puts the Director of Public Prosecutions in a position to go to trial and ultimately leads to convictions being secured.  It is extremely difficult.  I really welcome this measure because it is essential for us to be able to rely on the evidence of gardaí.  The members of the force who deal with these gangs all the time have the knowledge the courts are looking for.  They know exactly who the gang members are and what they are doing.  This legislation will enable the Garda to ensure gangs are brought to justice.I welcome the application of the Bail Act 1997 to these offences.  The Minister is well aware that the legislation in question which was significant and required a referendum was introduced by the rainbow Coalition Government in 1997 in the wake of the murder of Veronica Guerin.  If we are to keep gang members off the streets after they have been arrested and charged, we need to apply the 1997 Act to offences such as those under discussion.  It is obvious that it all depends on the level of anger or risk associated with the person in question.  As a result of this legislation, if there is a significant risk of interference with or intimidation of witnesses, the option of keeping certain people in detention and thereby ensuring they are not on the streets while awaiting trial can be used.  That is very welcome.I have focused on the elements of the Bill that I support.  While I am broadly in favour of the various measures contained in the legislation, as I said, we need to have a major debate on certain issues not covered in it.  When we discuss the issue of juvenile justice, for example, we should focus on the best way of encouraging people not to get involved in criminal gangs at a young age.  However, that will not happen through rushed emergency legislation of this nature.  Other issues need to be examined by the Government in the context of future legislation.  I spoke briefly about jury intimidation.  While that is a problem in trials relating to gangland criminality, it is not exclusive to such trials.  It goes on all the time, as does intimidation of witnesses.  We need to take a long and hard look at how we solve such problems.  I would like to give an example of the problems associated with intimidation.  It is worrying that just 28 convictions have resulted from the 132 cases brought against people suspected of intimidating witnesses or jurors.  If the number of proceedings being taken against people suspected of interfering with witnesses is quite small, the rate of success or conviction is minute.  We need to consider how we can assist the Garda as it tries to secure convictions successfully.I agree with the proposal to allow Garda expert evidence to be used.  We have to ensure the Garda's internal systems are robust, particularly in the light of what happened in County Donegal, as reported on by the Morris tribunal.  Although there have been systems failures in the force, matters have improved since the establishment of the Office of the Garda Ombudsman.  If we are to ensure there is no risk of the new powers we are providing for being abused or misused in any way, we have to ensure the Garda complaints system is strong and robust and that the force as a whole is as professional as possible.  We have a long way to go before the recommendations of the Morris report are implemented in full.I would like to speak about an important issue that has been raised by Deputy Flanagan in recent days.  This legislation will have a crucial role in enabling the Garda to do its business, but it is even more crucial for the force to be funded adequately.  The budget of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions has been cut by 3% in the last 12 months.  Cuts across the board are inevitable at this time, but if we are serious about dealing with criminal activity and stamping out gangland crime, we must ensure that gardaí are equipped, resourced and in a position to take on and deal with the problems they are being confronted with.  Overtime has been cut and there are fewer gardaí on the beat.  All of these things are very important, particularly in the types of disadvantaged communities where most of this activity is taking place.  There is a significant problem regarding Garda visibility and generally in terms of numbers and resources.  This is something that, perhaps, the Minister might look at again in the light of this legislation and the massive challenge facing us in terms of securing our streets and ensuring that innocent people are safe in their communities.Another point the Minister should consider is the enormous challenge facing us from the criminal activity emanating from within prisons.  Deputy Cuffe was talking about rehabilitation within prisons and so on, and I believe this is important.  Last year, however, I submitted a question about the number of mobile telephones in prisons and despite new technology and so on, more than 2,000 mobiles were seized in 12 months.  That is simply not acceptable.  It literally means that while the prosecution of criminal gangs takes place in the courts, eventually securing convictions, there is every possibility that those same criminals, whether in Mountjoy or wherever, still control these gangs and direct their activities.Deputy Durkan mentioned the issue of cross-Border crime gangs.  Obviously, there is a major problem regarding Irish gangs operating in Spain as well.  I urge the Government to reconsider Ireland's position in opting out of the justice and home affairs aspects of Lisbon, but that, perhaps, is an issue for another day.We have heard a great deal about civil liberties and I get very worried when I hear people beating a drum for the civil liberties of criminals without too much regard for those of innocent victims, particularly the family members of murdered individuals such as Roy Collins, Shane Geoghegan, Donna Cleary and others.  These are the people about whose civil liberties I am concerned.  These are the people we have to defend.  That is our role and the role of the Garda Síochána.  I do not believe we are in a position to pander to the "PC brigade" at the expense of innocent people, who are being threatened, intimidated and in some cases murdered by criminals acting with absolute impunity.
#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I wish to share time with Deputy Thomas Byrne, with the permission of the House.I, too, am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill and I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the speed in which the legislation has been drafted and for his determination to have it enacted as quickly as possible.This is one of a number of Bills dealing with our response to organised crime that have come before the House this year.  We have also had a number of Private Members' debates in recent months on the same topic.  It is a sad reflection on society that we are in a position where organised crime has become such a focus of attention for the Oireachtas.  A small number of gangs have contaminated inner city communities, particularly in Limerick and Dublin — they operate with impunity around the country — and view themselves as untouchable.  Anyone who saw the recent YouTube video uploaded by the leaders of one of the country's most prominent criminal gangs will have been shocked by the blatant bravado shown by these criminals and the fact that they obviously think they are so far above the law that they can broadcast a two fingered salute to civilised society over the Internet.  This House owes a duty to the local communities such people come from to remove them and their poisonous activities from the streets of Ireland.I support the previous speaker, Deputy Lucinda Creighton, regarding the comments made this morning by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  One sometimes wants to question what planet these people are on.  I, too, worry about the civil liberties of the victims of crime, and those of the witnesses, the jurors, the gardaí and society in general.  Those are the people we need to protect and that is what this legislation is primarily about.In researching for this debate I looked up a number of different articles and studied methods that were used in other countries.  I will refer to a couple of them during my contribution.  I recently read an interesting newspaper article about the growth of organised crime.  The author said that crime "uproots and destroys communities, deprives people of their livelihoods, takes young men away from their families and habituates them to violence".  The author was a Sudanese journalist named Muawad Mustafa Rashid.  He was writing about crime in his own country and in the developing world generally, but his words could easily be applied to the situation that has developed in some of our inner city suburbs.The criminal gangs who are terrorising parts of our cities have led us to the situation where descriptions of a criminal culture in certain parts of the developing world are now interchangeable with what is happening in parts of Ireland.  Mr. Rashid concluded his article  by stating: "crime prevention is inseparable from social development.  Violence and crime are usually the result of inequality and poverty, and they certainly breed fastest in the society characterized by extremes of inequality and social exclusion."Again, while he was discussing conditions in his own country, his words could equally apply to those areas in Ireland that have suffered most from a gang culture in recent years.  He is right that crime and poverty are linked and that social exclusion provides a breeding ground for criminality.  That is why as a society we need to take a "tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime" approach and why I believe that initiatives such as the establishment of the Limerick regeneration agencies and the ongoing work of Ballymun Regeneration Limited are just as important in defeating a criminal culture as any criminal justice legislation we debate in this House.This raises a serious question about the type of society we aspire to, and we must examine our conscience in this regard and reflect on the part played by wider society.  There is one significant difference between the criminal culture which Mr. Rashid describes in Sudan and the type of organised crime which has developed in Ireland in recent years.  In developing countries, the middle classes do not fund the activities of criminals.  Unfortunately in Ireland, the middle classes are among the main funders of these criminal gangs.  We must look deep into our hearts at all levels of society in Ireland.  They are either completely ignorant of the damage they are causing to many communities by their actions or they simply do not care because they do not have to look at this damage every day and live with its consequences.The reality is that every time a student takes an ecstasy tablet in a nightclub, a solicitor or an engineer picks up a line of cocaine on a Friday night or a doctor or nurse smokes a joint at a party, they are putting money into the pockets of these criminal gangs.  They are financing their weapons buying trips and playing their part in the desecration of inner city communities. Until such time as the middle and upper classes in this country are willing to take responsibility for their actions, until the time comes when they accept that their selfish recreational weekend drug use is the main source of income for these criminal gangs and that their drug use provided the money which paid for the weapons which killed Anthony Campbell, Brian Fitzgerald, Shane Geoghegan and Roy Collins, we will be fighting a constant battle against these gangs.  Unfortunately, the recreational drug user does not have to wake up each morning and face the damage that is being inflicted on communities such as Ballinacurra and Moyross.  He or she can feign shock and complete innocence when another innocent victim is gunned down.We should reflect on what is happening.  People are losing their lives, families are being torn apart at the loss of sons, daughters, husbands, wives, mothers and fathers.  We must look at the cost in human terms.  I strongly welcome this Bill and I hope it is passed as soon as possible.  In many ways there are not many new proposals in the Bill.  We are taking much of the legislation we have successfully used to combat terrorism and fine-tuning it in the fight against organised crime.  This initiative recognises that some of these gangs pose almost as big a threat to the well-being of the State as the various terrorist organisations did in previous decades.Terrorists and the criminals have many similar ways of operating.  Both types of organisation make themselves overlords in marginalised communities, accept no opposition or criticism from the communities they come from, indoctrinate their members at an early age and view themselves as being above the law.  It is fitting that similar laws should be used to combat similar organisations.I am very supportive of the proposals contained in this Bill which would allow many of the offences connected with organised crime to be regarded as scheduled offences and to be tried in the Special Criminal Court.  The Special Criminal Court was one of the most effective weapons this State had to protect itself against terrorists in the past and I am glad that it will be now used against the latest threat to the security of the State, organised criminal gangs.One of the criticisms I have heard of this proposal is that there is no need to bring these crimes before the Special Criminal Court because there is no evidence that these gangs have been involved in jury tampering.  It would be naive of us to think that the day will not come when these gangs will try to interfere with a jury.  We are aware of many instances.  If that day came and this legislation was not in place, opponents of this Government would be in uproar because we had not guarded against gangs interfering with juries.In 1972, when the current version of the Special Criminal Court was being introduced, the proposed legislation was strongly opposed by many of those who have now come out against the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.  The then Minister for Justice, former Deputy Des O'Malley, was asked in this House if he had any evidence that juries had been tampered with and he replied that he did not.  He still went ahead and established the Special Criminal Court and the subsequent history of this country has shown that the Government in 1972 was right to do so.  I have no doubt that time will prove the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, is taking the right path in extending the Special Criminal Court to cover offences committed by organised criminal gangs.In 2002, the then deputy commissioner of the London Metropolitan Police Service, Mr. Ian Blair, appeared before the British Parliament's select committee on home affairs.  At this meeting he was questioned about his knowledge of jury tampering.  He said that at the time, seven years ago, the Met was paying approximately £4.5 million a year to protect juries and that jury tampering was becoming an increasing problem.  One comment he made is of particular relevance to this debate.  He said that jury tampering "is usually connected with the organised criminal level because they have, not only if you like, the willingness to tamper with a jury or attempt to interfere with a juror, but also the ability to do it".We have had many examples, as I mentioned earlier, of jury tampering in this country.  Intimidation in the form of the late night telephone calls, people sitting in the front rows of courts and a general presence.  Earlier, the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power alluded to the fact that the march in Limerick was being filmed not only by video cameras but by people with mobile telephones.  It is an appalling vista.The charge of directing terrorism was introduced in Ireland in the wake of the Omagh bombing and it has been operated effectively over the past number of years.  It has succeeded in taking out the leadership, and in many ways the brains, of one of the remaining Irish terrorist organisations.  I only regret that this same charge had not been introduced 25 years earlier because it could have helped imprison a number of terrorist leaders who were happy to give the orders but who did not want to get their hands dirty or be accused of carrying out these orders.  A similar charge of directing a criminal organisation is now being introduced in this Bill.  This new charge carries a penalty of up to life imprisonment and will pose a serious threat to the untouchables who have benefited most from their criminal activities but who could not be tied to it because they got their more gullible followers to carry out their orders.This is a similar provision to the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organisations Act which was introduced in the United States in 1970.  That Act has become known in America as RICO and has effectively crippled and wiped out the Mafia in that country.  The American Mafia is only a shadow of what it once was because of RICO and if the provision of directing organised crime is used effectively in Ireland, it will leave many of our criminal gangs leaderless and rudderless.A commentator this week said the Bill "tramples upon the rule of law".  It sets out to uphold the rule of law and to protect innocent citizens whose lives are being destroyed by these criminal gangs.  If anyone is trampling on the rule of law in Ireland it is these gangs and their members.  They have shown in the past they will not listen to reason, will not abide by the standards expected in a civilised society and have no respect for the rule of law that this commentator was talking about.  These gangs will be defeated only by the strong arm of the law, and this Bill gives the Garda the extra powers needed to put many of their leading members behind bars for many years.  I urge all Members of the House to support this Bill.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I am delighted to speak on this Bill, representing as I do what has become a commuter belt constituency.  Many professionals and workers have moved to my constituency but, unfortunately, some of the boyos and girls targeted by this legislation have also moved to my constituency from Dublin.  We have a problem, a minor problem compared to some areas, with gangland criminals in our area.  While many of the robberies and murders are not targeted directly in our area, there have been shootings and the fall-off from "tiger kidnappings" and the appalling consequences that arise from them in my constituency.This Bill is very important for the whole country.  It is one regrettable feature of the commuter belt phenomenon that some criminals have also decided they would like to live outside Dublin and destroy the peace and quiet in some cases of the communities in which they have decided to live.  I will not name them, but they know who they are and where they live.I am very pleased with the extension of the Special Criminal Court.  A number of offences in the legislation will be triable only in the Special Criminal Court, including directing a criminal organisation, participation and contribution to certain activities, commission of a serious offence for a criminal organisation and commission of an offence by a body corporate.  There is much disquiet about the Special Criminal Court but I do not understand this.  It is a conservatism in human rights jurisprudence that there is worry and fear about the Special Criminal Court.The jury trial system is to a large degree, although not for everybody, constitutionally protected here.  It is a tradition from the British system and is in widespread use in Britain and America.  However the jury trial system is not in widespread use throughout the world and is not protected by the European Convention on Human Rights or the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  It is not recognised in every country and many countries have single, double or triple judge courts.  They are commonplace for ordinary offences.While the jury trial system is an important part of our tradition, it is important not to view it as some kind of sacrosanct right in every case or assume it is the best case.  In some countries there is a constitutional right to a jury trial in a civil case.  We have abolished this for the most part, except for some aspects of civil law, and the justice system seems to move along quite well on the civil side.  It is better that we do that for these really serious crimes.  We propose to protect the constitutional right to jury trial and the British common law tradition from which it derives.  However where there is a danger to the general public, jurors and the administration of justice, let us put these boys and girls in front of the Special Criminal Court with three judges from different levels of the court hierarchy.  Let those judges hear the evidence and decide on the guilt or innocence.Not everybody in the Special Criminal Court is convicted.  The reason for putting people before the Special Criminal Court is not to get more convictions but to ensure justice is administered.  Let us remember we are administering justice and trying to decide on the evidence whether somebody is guilty or innocent.  We are not trying to find somebody guilty when they are not.  That is very important to remember.  It is just a different way of making the decision.  It is a very effective way and reduces the threat to life.We cannot spend a huge amount of money protecting jurors.  The witness protection programme does not work in this country because everybody has relations in every county.  If one walks down a street in some far off part of this country one is bound to meet somebody one knows, no matter who one is.  It is almost impossible to move somebody abroad if they have no language.  While witness protection may work well in America which is so large and has one language, one accent almost, it will not work here.We can protect and guard the judges who participate in the Special Criminal Court in a more cost-efficient way than protecting a large body of jurors who would not like to be in that position.  I would not like to be on a jury deciding on the guilt or innocence of somebody who had probably murdered, or directed organisations that had murdered, many people.  While the Irish Human Rights Commission and others have expressed disquiet, and this sort of disquiet is always recognised, and there have been miscarriages of justice in this country, the rate of miscarriage of justice in the Special Criminal Court would not be high, if it exists at all.  I do not have the facts on that.  There is no need to worry.  We have chosen to protect the jury system in our Constitution but not every country chooses to do this.Aside from this issue, and this may be something for another day, it is important we send out a message in general that it is one's duty and obligation to take part in a jury when one receives a summons.  The first thing many do on receipt of a jury summons is go to their Deputy to see whether they can get out of it.  It is not wrong if people cannot serve, but we should not encourage such evasion; certainly, I would never do so.  Jury service should be seen as a duty and a privilege.  It should be open to more sections of society than it is and, indeed, to us as Teachtaí Dála.  There is no reason we should not be involved — Tony Blair was called to a jury trial at one stage.The Special Criminal Court is really important.  We are sending out a message today.  The guillotines are criticised, but by passing this legislation quickly and by recognising that we are doing so because really bad things have happened — lives have been lost — we are sending out a message that we are tackling this.  We are sending out a message to the Garda that we are giving it the armoury it needs.  We are sending out a message to the courts system that it has all it requires as well to ensure that guilt or innocence is decided in these cases.The Bill includes new provisions and amends existing provisions.  Section 7 gives gardaí of whatever rank the opportunity, if they have the appropriate expertise, to give evidence as to the existence of a criminal organisation because these organisations are difficult to know about.  An organisation, I suppose, is a group of people — three or more — coming together, but these people will not have rule books, anthems and meetings.  They will use telephones and perhaps meet in coffee shops.  They will not be reading minutes of previous meetings in line with a normal organisational structure and I suppose legislation must recognise that.The organisations with which we are dealing today are substantially and radically different from criminal organisations of times past and it is important that legislation moves forward and recognises changing circumstances, that a sort of legal conservatism does not constrict us.  We must recognise the way matters are moving in the criminal world and we as a Legislature must change the law if that is necessary — in my view it is very necessary to do that in this case.I would say to those who are wary of this legislation, those who criticised it and those who asked us to reconsider that we cannot because lives will continue to be lost unless these "boyos" and "girlos" who have committed the crimes are locked up in prison.  These gangs must be decimated and people must be allowed to get on with their daily lives.  We must get back to a situation where ordinary people can feel confident giving evidence or know that sitting on juries will not endanger their lives.  We are sending out that message today and I fully support the legislation.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	55	This Bill was published on Tuesday last.  It defies belief that we should be asked to dispatch it in the way it is now before the House.  In this rushed last-minute Bill, Members of the Oireachtas are asked to declare "that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order" in gangland offences.  Does any Member of this House honestly believe that statement to be true?  Do we believe that the Garda Síochána really believes it to be true?  Do we believe that the Judiciary believes it to be true?  Does the DPP — who already has the power, should the circumstances warrant it, to refer such cases to the Special Criminal Court, and only rarely does so — believe that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order?No Member of this House, including the Minister, has been able to produce any evidence of intimidation of juries.  On the other hand, there is evidence of intimidation of witnesses.  How does this Bill protect witnesses by sending these cases to the Special Criminal Court?  Witnesses are required to give evidence before the Special Criminal Court.  The Special Criminal Court is not merely a sentencing tribunal, which is the impression being sent out by the Minister.I come to this debate as a member of a former Government whose Minister for Finance, my colleague, Deputy Quinn, established the Criminal Assets Bureau to go after the wealth of the crime bosses.  I speak as the former Minister of State who in 1996 established the national drugs strategy designed to reduce demand for drugs.  As we will be aware, profits from drugs trafficking drive most serious crime.I speak as the Deputy who, on behalf of the Labour Party, in 2007 published the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill to help deal with the intimidation of witnesses, a Bill which was initially dismissed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform but which has now been replicated by the Government.  Labour was the first party to identify the risk of witness intimidation and the need to establish a programme for the State protection of witnesses involved in criminal investigations and prosecutions, and in 2007 I published the Witness Protection Programme (No. 2) Bill, which the Government opposed.The Labour Party supported far-reaching criminal justice Bills enacted by former Minister, Mr. Michael McDowell.  Labour knows well the misery which crime inflicts on communities, both urban and rural.  We have consistently advocated and supported strong measures to combat crime, particularly violent crime and offences against the person.The pivotal change in this Bill in seeking to refer new scheduled offences to the Special Criminal Court is fundamentally dishonest.  There is no evidence of interference with jurors or tampering with juries.  The DPP already has discretion to refer the trial of any serious offence to that court.  For example, drug related crime offences, without any subversive connection, have been sent to and tried by the Special Criminal Court.It is now proposed that gangland crime offences will automatically go to the Special Criminal Court but the DPP will have discretion in each case to decide to send it instead to an ordinary court to be decided by a jury.  I do not understand, and I challenge the Minister to tell me, how it is argued that a DPP's discretion to send particular cases to a jury court is meant to sit compatibly with a declaration by the Oireachtas that the ordinary courts are inadequate to deal with these offences.The Special Criminal Court does not operate a different system of law, does not take shortcuts, and is not a mere sentencing tribunal.  Roughly 20% of cases before the Special Criminal Court result in an acquittal or dismissal of charges. What is special about the Special Criminal Court is that it sits without a jury, and there is one justification only for a non-jury court, that is, where jury members are being intimidated.  There is no evidence that jury members are being intimidated.I have listened to this debate.  I have listened to the Minister on "Morning Ireland".  I have heard him align witnesses and jurors in the same sentence.  I have heard him evade and dodge when pursued for evidence of intimidation of jurors, which he did not provide.  He refers to witnesses and jurors in the same phrase knowing it confuses the public.  He knows many members of the public do not readily pick up the difference between witnesses and jurors.No evidence has been adduced in today's debate to indicate intimidation of jurors.  I have taken great care to check that fact with a range of practitioners and others who should know.  I am in contact with people involved at all stages in the public prosecution system, both in Dublin and throughout the country.  They include gardaí, State lawyers and defence lawyers.  However, I cannot identify from all those contacts a single case where it is argued that jury members were intimidated or at serious risk of intimidation.  Should such a case present, where there is a real danger that such intimidation may occur the DPP already has the power to refer it to the Special Criminal Court.  It is therefore cynical in the extreme to hold out this measure as a novel innovation that will somehow permit the Garda to round up gang members and refer them to the Special Criminal Court for sentencing, thereby allowing the witnesses to stay at home.That is the message the Minister has already sent out, and that is the message sent out by his agents, officials and spin doctors.  Some newspapers have suggested that as soon as the legislation is through the House the Garda is waiting to round up the usual suspects and they will be in prison before the August break.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  The Special Criminal Court is not a sentencing tribunal.  It does its business like any other court.  The only difference is that there are no jurors.  The only justification for that is if juries are being intimidated.  We do not have that evidence and the Minister has presented no such evidence.  The Bill is not about the Government, having considered all the advice available to it from the Garda Síochána and the DPP, arriving at an evidence-based decision that it could justify in court.  Nor is it about a decision that can be changed when the evidence no longer justifies it.  This Bill is about asking the Oireachtas itself, without any relevant information given to it by Government, without any committee hearings or reports, to arrive at a fundamental decision encroaching on basic constitutional rights and violating basic international human rights norms, which will be reached in a whipped party political vote after a guillotined debate next week.The reason for that is nothing to do with preserving law and order but it has everything to do with populist demagoguery.  Both the Constitution and international human rights law require us as legislators to determine in accordance with law, on a factual basis, whether the ordinary courts are adequate to enforce effectively the administration of justice and to preserve public order and peace.  If we are satisfied on the evidence that ordinary courts are inadequate, because of jury intimidation or tampering, then we have the option to set up special courts but we must first have the evidence.  The right to jury trial is not just a Constitutional right, it is enshrined in international human rights jurisprudence.  In that regard, this country must be unique in that we established a human rights commission but once it was established we did not pay a blind bit of attention to it.  We are now able to say in the appropriate international fora that we have a human rights commission.  Has it influenced one line of one Bill in this House since it was established, or one line of any Bill published by the Minister?  No it has not.

Why can we in this country not take that course if we think that in some very special instances there is such a real and present danger?  Why do we not have regular references, such as we had in the Gilligan case, to the Special Criminal Court if this fear of tampering with juries is as widespread as some speakers have said without producing a shred of evidence?I know why the Minister is smiling.  He is smiling because he is on the side of the angels.  Everybody is going to support the attempt to clamp down on gangland criminals and the Labour Party is raising points of law about departure from the usual trial by jury.  It is a political winner.  It may be.  The Minister may be right.  He may have reason to smile——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	67	——but it is a disgrace that in the dying days of this term that a Bill of this character should come to the House and be rushed through in this fashion.  It is a fundamental departure from the normal jury trial and what is enshrined in the common law for so long.The Minister did not produce any evidence in his script this morning.  He did not even seek to do so.  On detailed points in the Bill, which I hope we will have some time, albeit short, to discuss, he has given quite misleading explanations.  For example, he stated, "It allows for the evidence of a member of the Garda Síochána with appropriate experience and knowledge as to the existence of a criminal organisation".  He said that was not opinion evidence, that it was expert evidence.  That is not expert evidence.  As a lawyer the Minister knows that.I do not take great issue with evidence on the existence of a criminal gang because we all know that, unfortunately, there are too many criminal gangs and I want to see them put behind bars.  On many occasions I have set out our position in that regard.  That is why I published the Garda Síochána (Powers of Surveillance) Bill, so that we could have intelligence-led policing to put the criminals behind bars.  That is why I published the Witness Protection Programme (No. 2) Bill.  It is also the reason that when in government we introduced the Criminal Assets Bureau and the national drugs strategy.  When I and Deputy Howlin, who has just left the Chamber, first argued in this House with the then Minister, Mr. McDowell, that there ought to be a crime of directing a criminal organisation, we were told it was too amorphous, that one could not do that.  Now it is included in the Bill.  When the Minister was confronted with the true scale of these problems he resorted to the temptation to reach for the quick-fix solution.  However, this is not a problem about legal technicalities or sleepy judges.  It is not just an issue of sentencing.  It is not just that we need more or stricter laws, we need to tackle the phenomenon of this abuse in society and directly on the ground.  What we are now experiencing is, to a large extent, a consequence of decades of under-investment in neglected areas.  The idea that we can solve these problems without reaching into our pockets is an illusion.It is clear that the drugs epidemic is a worldwide crisis affecting developed and developing countries.  The drugs problem has its roots in poverty, unemployment and social disadvantage.  The interaction between organised crime and the drugs trade is a major threat to society, not only to individuals but to the pattern of life in entire communities.From my experience as Minister of State with responsibility for establishing the State's anti-drugs strategy, I am aware that action to combat crime, particularly violent and drug-related crime, requires significant financial resources, co-ordinated planning and management across agencies and services and co-operation and support from local communities.  The fight against crime includes the straightforward targets of seeking to prevent it, improving detection and arrest rates, efficient and fair processing of trials and the correct balance of deterrence, punishment and rehabilitation.  This, in turn, involves effective policing, reforms in the way the courts work, additional prison places and greater emphasis on the probation service.Effective policing does not merely relate to the number of gardaí on the beat, although that is a vital element.  Effective policing also involves smart policing, using the tactics of the 21st century to penetrate and bring down organised gangs of motivated and ruthless individuals, acquiring and using the intelligence to identify the network of local dealers and suppliers as well as the major players.Nobody should be in any doubt about the scale of the threat posed by organised crime, nor should there be any doubt about the investment required in the context of time, personnel and equipment to tackle these gangs.  However, to hold out the hope to grieving relatives and communities tortured by this menace that because we are engaging in such a fundamental departure from the normal criminal law, the members of these gangs will be rounded up and put in prison is essentially misleading.For the Minister to come before the House in the penultimate week of this session and produce a measure of this nature, without permitting Members to consider it in detail at all Stages, is the wrong way to make law.  This is not the first occasion on which that has happened.  We have continually been confronted with similar behaviour.  There have been weeks of the year when the legislative cupboard has been bare.  Now, however, we are being presented with this legislation in a last-minute rush.  We have not had the opportunity to take expert evidence, hear from groups operating at the coalface or the members of the communities affected or to explain to people that sand is being thrown in their eyes in respect of the lumping together of witnesses and jurors as if they were the same and in the context of this Bill being a panacea.  This legislation is not a panacea and I regret that we are departing from the established precepts of criminal law in this fashion and at such short notice.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	68	I am delighted to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important Bill.  There is no doubt that it is of critical importance to the constituency I represent.Much of the opposition to the Bill seems to centre on the provision which states that gangland trials will automatically be referred to the Special Criminal Court unless the DPP decides otherwise.  I will make a few preliminary points in that regard.  What is being done in the Bill does not represent a permanent change to the criminal law.  The provisions will apply for one year.  Following that period, the Minister will be obliged to produce a report on how the measure is working and a resolution must be passed to allow it to remain in operation.  The latter will give the Minister and both Houses of the Oireachtas an opportunity to judge how the legislation is working on a yearly basis.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	69	We have that already.  The Bill is a sham.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	70	I did not interrupt anyone.  The Deputy should have the decency to allow me to contribute.My second point is that despite what Deputy Rabbitte stated, this Bill does not represent a fundamental and seismic change in the criminal law.  The DPP will still possess absolute discretion to refuse to refer a case to the Special Criminal Court.  I have no doubt he will consult the Garda, the local prosecutors in areas in which crimes are committed and carry out whatever other investigations he deems necessary.  Thereafter, he will decide whether ordinary courts will be able to function properly if particular cases are tried before them.The main focus of opposition to the legislation has come from the deliberations and pronouncements of the Irish Human Rights Commission.  I have great respect for the commission and am an avid reader of its various reports.  It is something of an understatement, therefore, to say that I am bitterly disappointed by the commission's approach to the Bill.  At a media briefing on Tuesday, 30 June, solicitor Michael Farrell — who I know and for whom I have a great deal of personal regard — speaking on behalf of the commission, advanced two arguments in respect of its opposition to it.  His central argument was that the Bill "strikes at the centuries-old right to trial by jury, without any data being produced on the existence of jury-tampering."  He also stated that "It would not solve the problem of the intimidation of witnesses who are identified in the Special Criminal Court in the same way as in ordinary courts".  It is true to say that witnesses are identified in the same way in both courts.When one examines Mr. Farrell's arguments, one discovers that there is not really much to them.  His second argument in respect of witnesses is a classic example of erecting a straw man and then knocking him down.  The avowed intention behind section 8 is not to deal with the intimidation of witnesses; it is to solve the problem of jurors being intimidated or of being afraid to sit on juries.  The section relates to jurors.  We recognise that there is a widespread problem regarding the intimidation of witnesses and we do what we can in other ways to deal with that.Mr. Farrell's contention that there is a lack of data on the existence of jury tampering raises an obvious question as to the data one can produce in this regard.  If people are afraid to serve on a jury, there is no office to which they can report their fears.  The concerns of potential jurors cannot be logged and counted in the same manner as statistics are compiled in respect of murders, rapes or firearms offences.  If someone serves on a jury and the criminals get to him — there are some cases of this happening with which I am familiar — he is hardly going to advertise that fact.  It is not possible to produce figures in respect of jury tampering.  The notion that one might produce annual statistics in respect of such behaviour is risible.  I am disappointed because I suspect that, like everyone else, Mr. Farrell and his colleagues in the Irish Human Rights Commission are aware of that.If I am disappointed by what the commission has stated on this occasion, I am completely incredulous with regard to the position adopted by the Labour Party.  What I have heard from its Members during this debate and what was issued in a statement earlier in the week, constitutes one of the greatest examples of a volte face in Irish parliamentary history.  The party’s statement of Tuesday last states “There is no evidence that tampering with juries is an issue in our criminal justice system”.  This parrots, almost word for word, the conclusion of the Irish Commission on Human Rights.  In other words, the Labour Party has fallen for the commission’s conclusion hook, line and sinker.

I have already informed him that it is not possible to collect evidence on jury tampering.  I explained the position but I will do so more slowly if he so wishes.Can this be the same Labour Party whose Front Bench spokesperson — and my constituency colleague, for whom I have a personal regard — Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, during statements on the killing of Shane Geoghegan in this House on Thursday, 13 November 2008, said "I attended his funeral yesterday and the words on everybody's lips were "Please do something"  I ask the Minister to do something."?  During that debate, the Deputy also said "People want us to do whatever is necessary [legislation or action] to smash these gangs, take away their power and put them behind bars where they belong."  By April this year, Deputy O'Sullivan was lambasting the Government and me in particular for not bringing forward legislation to "make it easy to convict gangland figures".  Here is legislation that makes it easier to convict gangland figures.

He said:The public mood is to assent to measures in the present crisis that people would not otherwise tolerate . . .  There must come a tipping point where the State asserts its democratic mandate and asserts decent values [what lofty words] . . .  The people are saying that enough is enough.  It is the Government's duty to put the gangs out of business.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	95	The other fundamental difference between this and the English system is that here the Special Criminal Court has been in operation for a long time and has vast experience of dealing with criminal cases.  In England the reference would be to one judge alone.I am very familiar with the situation in Limerick and the mid-west generally and I can say this without fear of contradiction.  The unfortunate truth is that there is widespread anecdotal evidence of jury intimidation — not just witness intimidation — in Limerick.  While it is impossible by definition to produce hard statistical data on this intimidation, it is easy enough to find firm evidence of its results and implications.  Jury intimidation in Limerick is now so widespread and all pervasive, that it is now virtually taken for granted that if the State attempts to hold any gangland-type trial in Limerick, potential jurors will feel intimidated and it will not be possible to form a jury.If the Deputies opposite are looking for data and evidence, let me give them some facts to back that up.  In 2003 six men, leading members of one of the most vicious, violent and vindictive gangs in the country — unfortunately headquartered in Limerick — were put on trial for the murder of rival gangland leader, Kieran Keane.  It was decided to hold a special sitting of the Central Criminal Court in Limerick.  Up to that time, when a criminal trial took place in Limerick, the county registrar sent out five summonses on the basis that four people would turn up.  It was expected that one would be excused for illness or other absence.  In this case 729 people were called for jury service, but the State found it impossible to get 12 people to serve.  Immediately prior to this trial, four out of every five were turning up for an ordinary criminal trial.  When they were called to try leading members of a certain gang, 729 summonses went out and it was not possible to get 12 at which point the county registrar gave up.  Why did this happen if juries were not being intimidated?  Perhaps everyone was suddenly too busy.  After all in 2003 the Celtic tiger was at its height.  Activity may have been so hectic that even 12 out of the 729 summonsed could not be bothered to show up.  I suspect, however, that the truth lies elsewhere.In 2000, the number of jury trials, including ordinary criminal trials and gangland trials, coming before the Limerick Circuit Criminal Court was 67.  A jury of 12 is needed for each trial and the mathematics are quite easy; when 67 is multiplied by 12 the total number of people needed was approximately 800.  That year the court's office summonsed 1,000 people and was able to hold 67 trials, on the basis that four out of every five people called would turn up.  By 2008, the number of trials had risen by approximately 95% from 67 to 124, yet the number of people who had to be called as potential jurors had risen to almost 7,000 — a seven-fold increase since 2000.  This year I am told the number will exceed 8,000 and it will keep increasing.  Last year the number of jurors turning up for trials included a growing number of people seeking to be released from jury service for reasons of stress and anxiety.  In other words instead of four out of every five people turning up as heretofore, the State now calls five people and only one shows up — and that is diminishing.  Why is this happening?  Why have the sense of civic duty and the willingness of the people to serve on juries evaporated to such an extent in the mid-western region?  There is no evidence in any other walk of life that it has.

This morning Deputy Charles Flanagan told us that because the new Central Criminal Court complex in Parkgate Street, which is due to open in the autumn, has special provision for jurors — they have entirely separate facilities from the moment they enter the building ensuring they cannot be contacted by members of the public or criminals' associates — everything is fine.  I remind the Deputy that they need to get to the building and leave it again.  They have families, friends and loved ones.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The Deputy believes it is alright because they are safe while in the building.  People continually tell me that they are afraid to serve as jurors in any type of criminal trial in case the defendant would have any connection however tenuous with anybody involved in gangland crime.  In the years following the Kieran Keane trial more than five out of every six people called for jury service in Limerick sought to be excused.  There was a significant increase in the number of medical certificates submitted, particularly from women, stating that they were suffering from stress and anxiety.In answer to Deputy Rabbitte's point, ultimately, the Keane trial was moved to the courthouse at Cloverhill, Dublin where it was possible to empanel a jury and the culprits were convicted.  There was an eyewitness and they received a life sentence as the Deputy knows.  While the Deputy may have spoken to people, I have taken the trouble to speak to a wide variety of people in the criminal justice system particularly in the mid-west.  The opinion is now unanimous that it would be impossible to do this now, six years later, in similar circumstances.  The reason is self-evident.The reach of the gang whose members were on trial in that case has expanded enormously since 2003 and they have very strong associations with a number of criminal gangs in Dublin.  The gang suspected of carrying out the murder of the unfortunate woman, Baiba Saulite, is the same gang suspected of ordering the murder of Roy Collins, Kieran Keane, Brian Fitzgerald and Shane Geoghegan.  Baiba Saulite's murder occurred in Dublin, allegedly at the behest of a Dublin-based criminal who reportedly engaged this gang to carry it out.  I had the experience while out canvassing with one of our local election candidates, who is a solicitor here in Dublin, of being followed around everywhere I went by a Garda car because he is under full-time protection here in Dublin from that gang.Some of these victims were friends of mine.  The late Roy Collins died in the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, choking in his own blood after being shot in the back at point-blank range as a result of trivial incident that occurred five years earlier.  Shane Geoghegan, whose family is devastated, was mistaken for somebody else, was chased into waste ground and was shot dead as he pleaded for his life.  Moreover, the word on the ground is that just before the gunman pursued Shane Geoghegan, he rang the person who had issued the orders and said he was uncertain whether they had the right man because the fellow before him had a beard.  However, the response was to shoot him anyway because even if they had the wrong fellow, they could return and get the right one later.  I think of Brian Fitzgerald who did nothing except to try to keep drugs out of a nightclub in Limerick lying on the ground having been wounded in the first attempt.  A hired gunman then walked up and calmly shot him in the head, while his hysterical wife looked on from the window and as the babies slept in the back room.  These are the high profile examples and, as I noted, there are at least two dozen cases.Members should consider the case of a man called Michael McNamara who fell foul of the same gang and was lured into a trap.  As a result, he fell into the hands of the gang on a piece of waste ground beside the Southill estate in Limerick and was done to death.  One of my close friends happened to be working in the undertaking business in Limerick at the time and had the unfortunate job of taking care of the body.  He told me he almost became physically ill when he saw the state of the body.  Moreover, the medical evidence suggests it took the man eight hours to die.I mention these cases to pose a single question.  Would any jury from Mizen Head to Malin Head, whose members' identities, movements, domiciles and places of work would be known, as would be their spouses' movements and children's schools, be prepared to stand up, no matter what was the evidence, and convict the people behind the scenes in such cases who are capable of such vindictiveness, inhumanity and depravity?  I am not confident that it would.On 10 May this year, together with Deputies O'Sullivan and O'Donnell and a number of local councillors, I marched with thousands of other Limerick citizens in support of the family of Roy Collins, whom I know personally.  I am reporting the evidence of my own eyes when I solemnly state in this House of Parliament that as I marched down O'Connell Street in Limerick to the county courthouse and city hall, I personally observed a number of known individuals along the route who were taking photographs and recording video footage on their mobile telephones as the solemn march passed by.  These were people I associated with certain gangland organisations.  In other words, those behind the fear and intimidation were determined to make their presence felt, even as people gathered to reject such intimidation.  This is a metaphor for the problem that appears to have besieged our city.  The gangs are trying to intimidate people from showing publicly that they wish to bring to an end the malaise being caused by the gangs.  Such is the brazenness and bravado of these gangs that they now seriously believe they have won and that they hold the entire city and region to ransom.  As the gangs genuinely believe this, our duty as the democratically elected regional and national representatives of the people is crystal clear.  It is to send a strong, universally recognisable and unmistakable signal that they cannot, must not and will not prevail.  That is precisely what this legislation proposes and that is the reason I am proud to commend it to the House.

The Minister should not listen to the truth as it would hurt him.No data have been produced to provide any grounding for this odious emergency legislation.  The Minister who has just fled from the Chamber because he cannot listen to the truth stated this legislation would not be permanent.  Nothing on earth is permanent and no law is permanent as it can be changed.  The problem, about which the Minister is attempting to sow confusion, is that these are temporary provisions.  Temporary provisions are emergency legislation and there is no emergency in the State.  There are major problems to which I will revert, but there is no emergency.  The State has been condemned repeatedly by the United Nations for having in place emergency provisions such as the Special Criminal Court and the more recent amendments to the Offences Against the State Act.  However, this legislation gives two fingers to the United Nations.  It states we do not care what it desires or about its laws or recommendations as we intend to introduce more emergency provisions that will be more oppressive and further undermine the foundations of a justice system that can work.I will return to one of the points I was about to make to the Minister for Defence before he ran off.  I hope he went back to Limerick where he might do more to solve the problems, rather than pontificating about them.  He asked whether any jury would convict in the horrendous cases he raised and the answer is yes.  Juries throughout the country take on cases that are just as horrendous on a daily basis and thankfully they find guilty the criminal elements in our society.  I refer to those who are holding communities to ransom, whether in the Minister's constituency in Limerick, in my constituency in Dublin South Central or in Tallaght which is represented by the other Members present.Criminal gangs are operating at a level that is unprecedented and are better armed and resourced than ever before.  Members should consider the position 20 or 30 years ago when warnings emerged from communities that the State needed to do something about the drugs trade and the huge amounts of wealth and resources being gathered by certain elements in our society.  These warnings emerged nationwide, organisations were set up and the State turned on them.  I refer to Concerned Parents Against Drugs, CPAD, and the subsequent establishment in the late 1990s of another organisation, Coalition of Communities Against Drugs, COCAD.  In addition, the State finally took heed and set up the drugs task forces.  While some movement took place, drugs had taken hold by then and the amounts of money and resources that these criminal gangs already had amassed were vast.In the past ten years the response to the gangs and their criminal empires has not been as appropriate or as well resourced as it should have been.  An array of weapons has been found in every single drug shipment the Garda or the customs service thankfully have confiscated.  Our society is suffering as a consequence of its failure to provide proper resources for the Garda Síochána or Customs and Excise which has done some tremendous work to tackle the drugs trade.  Even the Naval Service has not been given the proper resources to prevent the enormous scale of the drugs trade.  The Celtic tiger appears to have fuelled the trade, the use of cocaine in particular.  Huge amounts of money were made on the back of the Celtic tiger for the criminal gangs and not enough has been done in this regard.These are the areas on which we should focus in the first instance.  Where is the Garda communications network that was demanded ten years ago which could not be interfered with or listened to by the criminal gangs?  It still is awaited and has not completed its pilot phase, even though most other European states have in place the TETRA system or a similar digital radio communications system for their police services.  Until last week where was the surveillance legislation to allow the gardaí to carry out the proper surveillance of those who were possibly intimidating witnesses or juries?  We have only passed it.  There has not been time to see if it had the desired effect of ensuring the gardaí had another way to put surveillance in place to address some of the intimidation the Minister claims cannot be quantified.  He did a good job of trying to quantify it, he spoke repetitively on that matter.It is a fact that it is more difficult to get people to sit on juries but not just because of intimidation.  In smaller areas, such as Limerick, people know each other better than they would in Dublin, where they are more anonymous.  It would, therefore, be easier to find a jury elsewhere.  That is not down to the nature of the cases, it is due to the size of the city and the potential pot of jurors.  People were also busy and concerned about their livelihood in recent years.I profoundly object to the manner in which this Bill was introduced.  This now happens every year, no matter who the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is.  The previous Minister was a serial legislator but the present Minister has matched, if not exceeded, him in the number of Bills he has produced.

There are alternatives to this and we should have tried them before introducing this Bill.Some of the alternatives were discussed when Michael McDowell was Minister.  The need for practical protection for juries and witnesses is still not in place, an issue I raised with the then Minister in committee more than four years ago.  Here we are, however, introducing new legislation while still ignoring the need for practical protection for juries and witnesses.  Even with this legislation that is not happening.We should explore the idea of making juries more anonymous or segregating them more, with trials being relocated away from trouble spots.  It is already happening in some cases so it can be done on a more regular basis.  That does not interfere with the basis of the jury system as a rule.  We should have considered it, tested it and agreed it works.  Juries in Ireland have a higher conviction rate than those in any other jurisdiction in Europe.The system works, it can convict, but we must develop a full spectrum witness protection programme and place it on a statutory footing.  I recently met people who thought they were being protected as witnesses but their lives have been shattered by the experience because they cannot continue to work after giving evidence that led to a conviction.  That disproves what the previous Minister claimed.We must also put in place arrangements to upskill and educate the relevant gardaí and officials from the DPP's office on how to use the new provisions of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act to best effect in investigations and prosecutions to achieve sound convictions.  That was the reason I supported the surveillance Bill, so that it could be used to ensure proper convictions in cases like those the Minister mentioned.  We must allow time for that legislation to take effect and for the gardaí to be properly resourced.The bans on overtime, recruitment and promotions will do nothing for the gardaí's ability to use the surveillance legislation, or even this legislation, in the future.  Morale is so low in some parts that many gardaí will leave the force because of recent restrictions.  Acceleration of civilianisation would free up more fully trained gardaí to tackle crime, that is why they join the Garda Síochána, not to stand at static checkpoints outside the Dáil.I mentioned the roll out of the secure digital radio service.  The Minister spoke about anecdotal evidence but the anecdotal evidence in Limerick is that more people tune into the Garda radio frequencies than tune into RTE Radio 1.  This has been a problem for more than ten years and it could have been addressed many years ago.  The TETRA system has been with the gardaí but roll out is not likely to happen for at least a year if not longer.There should be an increase in the numbers of criminal assets profilers to ensure proceeds of crime are confiscated from these gang figures and their families so they do not become the focus of young people's admiration because they can see the wealth they have amassed, especially in a recession.  Some people look to that wealth and see it as easy pickings.We must guarantee the future of the "dial to stop drug dealing" scheme.  Many people are afraid to give information directly to the Garda Síochána.  This mechanism ensured they would remain anonymous because it was a non-Garda phone-line.  When it was operating it produced the conviction of drug dealers, those behind much of what the legislation is supposedly targeting.   The practical steps should be taken first, ensuring the gardaí and the DPP, the Courts Service and the State forensic laboratory are properly equipped to detect, investigate and secure sound convictions.Despite having very little time to scrutinise this Bill in detail, I am satisfied my initial concerns were well founded.  It is a pity that it is being rushed through next week because on Committee Stage, we would be able to prove to the Minister the folly of the Bill.The Human Rights Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties have both agreed with the position I adopted when I heard of the full effects of the Bill.  Particularly odious sections include the introduction of non-jury trials as a default for a range of broadly and vaguely defined offences.  Section 8 contains a blanket declaration that the ordinary courts are insufficient to secure justice for the new scheduled offences.  The Government has shown no evidence that supports this contention.  There are no facts or figures, only supposition or the claims of the Minister.The Garda Commissioner has also expressed his concern on these measures.  He and his predecessors demanded a radio system, more gardaí and the other points I have made but he did not get them.  Just because the Garda Commissioner demands something does not mean he will get it.  It is a pity we did not listen to the practical steps suggested by Garda Commissioners over the years that could help them in their fight against crime.The evidence in this case points in the opposite direction.  Irish juries have demonstrated a high conviction rate.  The Minister quoted the 2003 trial for the murder of Kieran Keane.  In this instance, the public fear of the people of Limerick resulted in the trial being abandoned because the State could not select a willing local jury.The solution to that problem was not to eliminate the right to a jury trial altogether.  It was simple.  The trial was relocated and the jury ultimately convicted those accused of that crime.  Jury intimidation and witness intimidation are two different things and there is no evidence to suggest that jury intimidation is a problem requiring a response of this magnitude.  I have mentioned simple steps that can be taken, namely, segregation from public view, the use of video links and trial relocation in appropriate circumstances may well be sufficient to address many of these concerns.  Another possibility is anonymous juries.  Although the intimidation of witnesses and violence against their families and whole communities is a major problem, this Bill ignores it and does not do anything whatever for witnesses.  Those families who have been intimidated and have suffered fatal consequences, such as the Collins family, will see that this Bill will do nothing for them or any other family caught in such a situation and looking for protection.  A witness protection programme is not provided for.When it suits it, the Government likes to quote the Hederman committee, which conducted the review of the Offences against the State Acts, but the Minister is not quoting it today.  When the committee considered the constitutionality of a similar declaration contained in the Offences against the State Act which underpins the use of the Special Criminal Court — that is, non-jury trials — the committee minority report recommended that the Special Criminal Court be dispensed with altogether, but the majority of the committee concluded:The constitutional jurisdiction to try an accused in the non-jury courts rests on an assessment in that individual case that the ordinary courts are inadequate and that these constitutional requirements are not satisfied by the scheduling of certain offences by the Oireachtas itself since the very act of scheduling permits the trial of those very offences ... without any consideration of the individual merits of the case at hand and whether or not the ordinary courts are inadequate to try that particular case.The Hederman committee thus advised the Government not to go down this route.Sections 7 and 21 of the Bill greatly extend the use of and reliance on Garda opinion evidence.  The non-jury court will be relying on the word of a garda as to whether a criminal gang exists, subject to a dangerously vague and loose definition of what constitutes a gang.  There is no minimum Garda rank requirement for giving opinion evidence.  In addition, in the context of the new secret hearings, uncorroborated Garda and hearsay evidence is to be relied upon.The supposedly new offence of directing any activity of a criminal organisation and definition of criminal organisation contained in sections 3, 5 and 6 of the Bill are objectionably vague and also unnecessary.  The activities covered are already offences under criminal law, both common and primary.  Offences of conspiracy and accessory already exist.  With regard to the definition of a criminal organisation, this very week three years ago the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government rushed into being an equally impractical and almost identical definition which has never been used.As I said, my area has suffered greatly due to gangland crime.  I would love to be here welcoming a Bill that incorporated a witness protection programme and provided the additional resources required to tackle and extinguish the criminal gangs that are holding communities to ransom and operating ruthlessly.  This is not that legislation.  It is a publicity stunt which will not affect the drugs trade or the criminal gangs one iota.  What we need is proper legislation and resourcing of the Garda Síochána to tackle head-on the crime gangs, which seem to be developing and re-arming continuously while sitting on vast fortunes.  The State has not had the desired effect to date.Something needs to be done but, ultimately, this is not the way forward.  When the Bill is enacted and comes into operation it will leave us open to condemnation by the UN again and again.  As I said, this is not a temporary measure.  This can be seen from the fact that when the Offences against the State Acts are reviewed every year they are given a cursory glance by everyone in the House and go virtually unopposed, except by ourselves.  Sufficient time is not given to debate and it seems that once emergency legislation is introduced there is no desire to remove it from the Statute Book and return to a proper justice system.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I commend the Minister, Deputy Ahern, for introducing it in such a speedy fashion.  I listened to Deputy Ó Snodaigh and before that to Deputy Rabbitte.  Like the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, they share a constituency that has seen major crime activity, including gangland killings.  If they were speaking on behalf of the vast majority of law-abiding citizens they would be welcoming this legislation.  Clearly the public at large expects the laws of the land to be used to good effect in dealing with gangland crime.  The public wants to see the speedy passage of this Bill through the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It amazes me to hear the comments about guillotining the Bill, not giving proper time and so on.  For quite some time the public has demanded that the Garda be provided with the necessary powers and backup through legislation, as in the recent Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill.  We should not have a courts system which cannot put these criminals behind bars when they are clearly engaging in intimidation of witnesses and of the public.The criminal gangs show total disregard for our communities in the way in which they intimidate them.  The case of the late Roy Collins in Limerick is particular proof of that.  I commend the way in which the Collins family have spoken out against mass intimidation in their own city.  I listened to the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, outlining the numerous areas with problems.  He was not speaking only about intimidation.  At a recent march, videoing of participants was carried out openly by known criminals.  If that does not prove the case for this law, nothing can.The Bill will be warmly welcomed.  The people to whom I have spoken in recent days certainly believe its speedy passage is welcome.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, in his remarks today, said that the activities of organised crime gangs have intensified and they have shown an increased ruthlessness in how they deal with each other.  The Acting Chairman's own constituency has seen evidence of this.  These gangs have no compunction about taking the lives of members of their own and other gangs as well as, unfortunately, innocent members of the public.  If a survey were done today or tomorrow — quite often as politicians we rely on surveys to inform us of public opinion on Government actions — I have no doubt the vast majority of the public would support what the Minister is doing.  We have a duty as a Parliament to reflect those views.The backing of the Garda Commissioner, who has told us these new laws are necessary in order to deal with the criminal gangs, focuses our minds on bringing in the legislation in a timely fashion.  From what I have read in the newspapers, and from listening to other Members talking about incidents in their own constituencies, I know there has been an unwillingness on the part of jurors to come forward.  The Minister for Defence mentioned in his contribution that out of 729 potential jurors issued notices, only 12 came forward.  That stark and horrendous statistic entirely vindicates the stance the Government is taking.  It proves that intimidation of witnesses is taking place to such a degree that they feel obliged to excuse themselves from jury service.  The Minister  went on to refer to a figure of 1,000 which would reduce the percentage further.The reality is that this Bill is needed now and must be signed into law without delay.  I am firmly of the view that we as politicians cannot stand by and let the entire judicial system be undermined.  That witnesses are intimidated to the extent that they refuse to present for jury service justifies these measures.  I do not accept the views expressed by Members opposite that the legislation is being brought forward in too hasty a fashion and that it fails to take account of certain human rights issues.  The contacts I have had with members of the public indicate there is a general acceptance of the necessity for this law.  The Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, indicated this morning that he had discussed the proposals with human rights groups.  He is satisfied, as are the Garda authorities, that the Bill does not impinge on human rights.We have a duty to impose these provisions.  If there are issues to be addressed in the future, we will tackle them as they arise.  We cannot allow a situation where the State takes no action against criminals who execute people at random.  The establishment in 1996 of the Criminal Assets Bureau was welcomed by all.  However, 11 years later, gangland activity is escalating, with some gangs now being led by teenagers.  In Dublin city some weeks ago, a 19 year old with convictions under the Criminal Assets Bureau was assassinated by a member of his own gang.  These are the types of people with whom we are dealing.  Younger and younger people are joining these gangs and there is always a replacement to step in when a gang leader is assassinated.  We must have in place the legal provisions to allow the Garda to put such persons behind bars for their own good and for the benefit of society.As I said, this Bill does not represent a threat to human rights protection.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to our obligations as a member of the United Nations.  I would challenge the UN authorities to argue the case that the gangsters who are committing horrendous crimes on a daily basis should effectively be left to roam our streets and kill not only other gang members but also innocent victims.  It is our duty as parliamentarians to ensure there are laws in place to deal effectively with serious crime and the perpetrators thereof.  It is unacceptable that our Statute Book should include laws that will not stand up in court.  There is no point in introducing laws if gardaí are hindered in their approach to dealing with evidence in court.  It is ridiculous that criminals should go free, as happened in Limerick, because witnesses retract their evidence out of fear and intimidation.  If we are not prepared to deal with this situation, we will fail in our duty.

They have thwarted the criminal justice system at every opportunity.  As legislators, we have a duty to deal with this in a timely fashion.The measures introduced by the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, are both timely and necessary.  As I said, he cannot ignore the advice of the Garda Commissioners and the Garda superintendents who deal with these issues on a daily basis.  To ignore that advice would place us in dereliction of our duty and subject us to deserved criticism from the Opposition, media and public.  We must deal with realities and take all necessary action to protect citizens.  As such, I expected this Bill to have almost unanimous support from the House, as was the case some weeks ago in respect of the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009.  I am particularly disappointed this support is not forthcoming from Deputies Rabbitte and Ó Snodaigh, both of whom represent constituencies in which there is a serious problem of gangland crime, with gangsters roaming the streets.

#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	141	These people are giving two fingers to the entire judicial process, to us as public representatives and to the general public.  This is unsatisfactory and it must not be allowed to continue.The Garda Commissioner has given his professional opinion, supported by the evidence of his colleagues, that the Special Criminal Court approach is necessary.  I have no hesitation in putting that advice into practice.  We will deal with any future human rights issues as they arise.  If this Bill saves one life, it will have done a good job.  It will be more than worthwhile if it succeeds in discouraging young people from a life of crime.  Unfortunately, some young people begin as drug users before going on to become drug pushers.  The Oireachtas has a duty to ensure such persons are given every opportunity to become law-abiding citizens, receive an education, obtain employment and contribute to society rather than destroying their own lives and those of others.Deputy Finian McGrath referred some days ago to the abuse of drugs by members of the middle class.  I agree this is part of the problem.  People who take drugs tonight or tomorrow night as part of their social celebrations are lining the pockets of drug barons.Following from that are the unfortunate cases where the different gang leaders decide they want a bigger cut of the action, more money and profits and decide to take out other gang leaders.  That may be okay but unfortunately innocent bystanders quite often get caught up in the process.  As legislators, we should ensure that we deal with the problem in an effective manner.  I do not have any hesitation in saying this new Bill will help that.We already have laws dealing with offences and have given the Garda Síochána investigative tools with the new surveillance Bills.  There are also penalties but it is important to ensure prosecutions.  I speak for the vast majority of society in saying there is nothing more galling than criminals known to the communities and in many cases to public representatives walking scot free from the courts, giving two fingers to the system.  As Members of the Dáil and Seanad and legislators, it is our duty to ensure we give every assistance to ensure there are successful prosecutions when these gangsters are brought before our courts.  Talking about the UN and human rights is not an issue at this stage.

#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	143	We have previous experience of the Special Criminal Court from the 1970s and 1980s, when it was used to deal with the subversive organisations.  It dealt with them efficiently, by and large, and what may have been awkward positions for our State in the 1970s and 1980s were avoided as certain people were put behind bars.  Normal law and order was maintained and we ensured there would not be a second army in the State.Today we are discussing the use of the Special Criminal Court against ordinary criminal gangs, as distinct from the former subversives.  I am convinced this is the proper action and I do not have any doubt that the biggest threat to our society today comes from these ruthless gangs.  Unfortunately, the middle class is contributing to their wealth and prominence through the use of drugs.  I want to see this Bill pushed through both Houses at the earliest date so that the Garda Síochána will be able to successfully prosecute these people in court for the betterment of society.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation, the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill 2009.  Of course, I share my colleagues' valid concerns about the way the Bill is being rushed through and the lack of detailed analysis in the Oireachtas.  However, we must also deal with the reality of organised crime, murders, intimidation and the lack of support for communities, particularly those which are most disadvantaged.  This should be the thrust of the debate today and it is where I will begin.The right to life and the protection of our citizens should be the top priority in this legislation, and that is my bottom line.  When we hear people talking about intimidation of witnesses, I often wonder if we have considered closely the reality for many of these people.  Intimidation is not limited to Limerick and is widespread in many communities.  A number of Deputies have mentioned that it goes on in all our constituencies.  When we hear of violence, threats, fear and murder, we must respond in a strong and decisive way.Gangs, particularly those involved in organised crime, are armed to the teeth.  There is intimidation in flat complexes throughout this city and even in my own constituency.  For example, women trying to live a normal life are intimidated and threatened along with families.  We must consider the reality behind this important piece of legislation.A number of colleagues mentioned the Criminal Assets Bureau, which was a positive and constructive development.  My late colleague and former Deputy, Tony Gregory, was always pushing this agenda.  His idea was that when the assets of the drug barons were confiscated, they should go back into the communities to help the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, whether by means of health schemes, youth projects or education.  The resources of these organised criminals should go directly to the community.In considering the legislation we must look at a policy of quality policing and the role of the Garda Síochána.  There are many examples of good practice in tracking organised crime and in recent days we have seen that being used to its maximum potential as leading drug dealers were arrested throughout this city.  We must also consider the ethos of our public service, the role of the Garda Síochána and the way communities assist the Garda and feel protected in return.  The Garda Síochána also has a very important responsibility and it must win the respect and trust of its communities.  There are many areas where this is not the reality so we must consider the successful projects, like Operation Anvil.The Garda must go into the local communities and win their respect.  This debate is about the protection of people's lives but it also concerns the protection of communities.  Organised crime is destroying whole communities rather than just particular individuals or witnesses.  The game is bigger and broader and the destruction is horrific.I mentioned the word "intimidation" earlier.  When one meets intimidated families, one can see the look of fear in their eyes.  I have met many such people over the past 20 years who were intimidated by a local gang or people involved in organised crime.  It is unacceptable that citizens have to put up with this.  We have had enough guff on this issue for the past number of years, particularly in this House.  We need action on the ground, and I have already mentioned the decisive action taken over the past 48 hours.  This is what is required to win the trust and confidence of the people.I heard a number of Deputies speak about Limerick and it is right to give priority to the victims and families suffering under these organised gangs.  I would always give such people priority in the debate on the protection of their rights as against the broader community.  This is a bigger issue than Limerick, however, and there are massive problems.  In responding to organised crime, the Minister must listen to the advice of top gardaí and people directly involved in the drug squad.  Part of the final informed decision should come from listening to the communities, and I welcome the fact that the Minister has met some of the victims of these organised criminals.  There is nothing wrong with listening to those who have concerns about human rights.One hears a debate on having more witness protection but for many people, once they enter such a process, that is the end of their natural family lives.  I wonder if people speaking in this House understand that if people enter a witness protection process, it is the end of their relationship with family and friends.  There are many disadvantages.  I know many people refuse to enter such a process, so we must be more creative in defending these people, as they cannot just be banished because they are in a witness protection programme.I welcome the fact that several communities are standing up to oppose criminality.  A massive crowd took to the streets of Limerick recently to support the families.  Marches and rallies have taken place in communities throughout Dublin over the past 20 years to protest against drug gangs in Dublin's north inner city in particular.  It is important that members of the community march with their neighbours and friends.  It is not acceptable that these protests are filmed by gang members.  Why were they not arrested for this intimidation?  We need to be proactive in preventing crime as well as dealing with legislation.The primary purpose of this Bill is to introduce additional measures targeted at combating organised crime.  We cannot sit on the fence on this issue.  I welcome that the Bill targets those who direct the activities of criminal organisations and those who participate in the activities of such organisations.  We need to do more to weed out the senior figures who often use vulnerable people, including addicts, to do their dirty work.  Some of the people who do gangland hits are so strung out on cocaine that they do not even who they are shooting at.  That is the sad reality.The Bill also addresses the increasing levels of violence and intimidation directed at witnesses and other members of the public.  It is our duty as Members of the Oireachtas to protect witnesses and defend the public.  The emphasis of this debate should be on the right to life and the protection of our citizens.  The Bill provides that the Special Criminal Court can be used for hearing particular organised crime offences unless the Director of Public Prosecutions directs otherwise.  It also amends Garda detention, re-arrest and search powers.  However, we do not want another Nicky Kelly case.Section 3 amends section 70 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006.  Subsection (1) amends the definitions of "criminal organisation" and "structured group" contained in that section.  Subsection (2) defines "a person ordinarily resident in the State".  Many young and misguided people have fallen into bad situations but the experienced gardaí employed in the drugs and serious crime squads can help to remove them from the picture.  From speaking to the parents of these young people, I am aware those who want to get out can feel caught between gang leaders and gardaí.Section 5 seeks to target those in a criminal organisation who give the orders.  Some of these people may not directly participate in committing criminal offences.  By including the words "at any level of the organisation's structure" in subsection (2), it is ensured that persons directing the activities need not necessarily be one of those at the top of the organisation or that they be shown to be such.  These are important provisions.Section 6 amends the Criminal Justice Act 2006 by substituting a new section for the existing section 72 which relates to participation in organised crime.  The new section will simplify the existing offence of participation in a criminal organisation.  The members of these gangs are nasty people with an horrific history of violence.  I am particularly disturbed by the way they destroy communities.  It is not acceptable that they should have such power.  Section 6 makes a good attempt at dealing with this issue.It is a pity Deputies do not have more time to debate the Bill because, while some aspects of it are very welcome, others may give cause for concern.  Section 7 inserts a new section after section 71 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to provide for proof of the existence of a criminal organisation.  This will enhance the ability to bring prosecutions for offences of directing or participating in organised crime.  Subsections (1) and (2) allow for the admissibility of expert opinion evidence of a member of the Garda Síochána in determining the existence of a criminal organisation.  Many Deputies will be aware of the activities of criminal organisations in their respective constituencies.Section 10 amends section 73 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 to increase the penalty for the commission of an offence for a criminal organisation from ten to 15 years.  I support that provision.  In America, an individual was recently sentenced to 150 years in prison for swindling billions of dollars.  Many people say that if one commits a murder or stabs somebody in the eye or face in Ireland, one will be in prison for ten or 12 years.

We have to ensure that people have respect for the justice system.  I do not respect those who are still walking around despite ripping off the State for millions of euro.  A woman who owed €18,000 to a credit union was brought before a court.  There is not sufficient clarity or equality in this regard.  People have the right to raise these issues.When speaking about violence and fear, it is important that we do not forget the victims.  The purpose of this debate is to get justice for victims.Section 22 amends sections 50 to 52, inclusive, of the Criminal Justice Act 2007.  Section 50 provides that a person suspected of committing murder involving the use of a firearm or explosive, murder to which section 3 of the Criminal Justice Act 1990 applies, an offence under section 15 of the Firearms Act 1925 or an offence under section 15 of the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act 1997 involving the use of a firearm may be detained for up to seven days for the proper investigation of the offence, including 48 hours under Garda authority and a further 120 hours under judicial authority.  Concerns have been expressed about this section.  It is legitimate to ask questions about these detention periods. However, if people are suspected of involvement in violence or intimidation, it is not acceptable to do nothing.  The issue is to get the balance between that kind of approach and the broader one.  This morning, for example, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties had a go at the Minister and was concerned that legislation was being rushed through the Dáil.  That press conference was attended by someone for whom I have great respect — Michael Finucane, the son of the murdered solicitor Pat Finucane.  He has a great work record on human rights.  The Minister should not dismiss those people as windy, liberal lefties or pinkos.  They are people who have a genuine concern about human rights.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	148	Yes.  They have also published documents on setting out a rights-based alternative to tackling the problem of organised crime.  They have published a paper on crime and respecting the rule of law, as well as human rights-based alternatives to the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Bill.  As Deputy Rabbitte said, I have covered all the angles.  I always do my best in that respect to bring some balance to the debate.Last week, I raised the issue concerning the market for drugs, organised crime and people who are very well off in society.  A number of people referred to my comments, including Deputy Michael Kennedy.  I am sorry that Deputy is not present in the Chamber now.  I did a number of interviews as a result of that speech and I was criticised for labelling celebrities, including radio and television stars, as being involved in the drugs trade.  In reality, however, I was saying that some sections of the media and celebrities, including high-profile musicians, were involved and are part of the problem.  In the past, there have also been certain people who were associated with politics.  We must fight to ensure that the drugs market for organised crime is rapidly diminished.  It is essential to stand up for these things.With regard to section 23, subsection (1) amends section 4 of the Act by inserting a new subsection 8B.  Section 4(8) provides that any time a person detained under section 4 is absent from the station for the purpose of hospitalisation, they are to be excluded in the reckoning of the detention period.  The new subsection 8B seeks to address the situation where a detainee is assessed as unfit for questioning but does not require hospitalisation, for example where the detainee is intoxicated.  It is proposed that where a medical practitioner certifies that the detainee is unfit for questioning no questioning shall take place during the period certified. Basically, therefore, there are protections within that section.I welcome this important debate which has underlined positive elements in the legislation, although I would prefer if its provisions were broader.  At the same time, I respect the fact that the Minister is dealing with the situation.  In addition, public opinion wants to see citizens being protected.  Violence and intimidation are devastating communities and must be stopped because people are sick and tired of the situation.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	149	The Legislature must take seriously special emergency legislation such as this, but we must also ask how we got to this point.  How has society reached a stage where professional hitmen are being hired to kill people?  What is it in society that led to this?  The Bill shifts the balance against professional criminals and organised crime generally, which is welcome.  We must change the balance away from those people.  I am concerned about what is happening, however, because it seems that the more people we lock up, the more there are to replace them.  Those replacing older criminals seem to be younger, more vicious and callous than those who were there previously.A number of years ago, the former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Michael McDowell, said the legislation he was introducing would solve the problem.  He also said that the activities going on were like the last sting of a dying wasp.  We have continued to enact legislation but I doubt if it is having the desired effect.  The Bill before us is draconian in nature and grants many powers to the Garda Síochána.  All of this is important but we have been here repeatedly in recent years and the situation seems only to be getting worse.  When we lock up older criminals a younger, more vicious group takes their place.  While I agree the legislation is necessary to rebalance the scales of justice, we also need to examine urgently what it is in society that is leading to this.  Deputy Kennedy referred earlier to the use of drugs by the middle class, an area we need to start working on.I am concerned that the Government has cut back on funding drug prevention programmes.  It has been brought to my attention that funding for youth organisations has also been cut back.  We need to start attacking this at all levels.  I was speaking to some people recently in a community close to where I live.  They are working extremely hard but they said the battle must start at preschool level.  One must begin engaging with the parents of children at preschool who may grow up to be the kind of criminals we are dealing with.  Unfortunately, however, we are not doing that.  We are cutting back funding at that level so children are going onto the streets and have no activities to engage in.  As a result they become engaged in petty crime which grows into more serious crime.  In many instances, getting a conviction becomes a badge of honour rather than a deterrent or something to be ashamed of.I implore the Government to take a long, hard look at trying to stop children from getting involved in crime from a young age.  We should start at preschool level and work up from there.  We have not been doing that, however, and our youth services are totally under-resourced across the State.  In addition we are cutting back expenditure on drug prevention programmes.  For the relatively small amount of money spent on such programmes, one could save an enormous amount later in trying to track hardened criminals and imprison them for long periods.  It costs an absolute fortune but the human cost is of far greater concern.Earlier in the debate, Deputy Charles Flanagan said the gardaí need enough resources and equipment to deal with crime.  The DNA database has been promised for quite some time, while Garda radios are not up to standard.  The PULSE computer system is not the best, and I am told that the State laboratory and the DPP's budget have been cut.  Simple things such as one-way glass at identity parades might help.I live in a coastal area and in west Cork we have seen evidence of people bringing drugs ashore in the dead of night from yachts and other vessels.  More must be done to combat that activity.  I have spoken before about establishing a coastal watch to do something about that.I welcome the Bill's provisions for bringing tougher penalties to bear on someone for directing a criminal organisation.  For many years we have said we must go after the godfathers who are making a lot of money out of such criminal activity.  Anything we can do in that respect will be useful, including this emergency legislation.  I would have a concern that we are bringing forward more and more legislation all the time.  I would like to see a review of the effectiveness of the legislation that we have brought forward to date.  I would like the Minister to bring a report before the House on the effectiveness of these various Bills that we were told would work.  Have they worked?  If not, why not?We need to be hard on directing crime.  We have heard about people directing crime from inside prison by using mobile phones.  The ordinary man on the street cannot understand how they can get their phones into prison and direct their empires from inside.We always must maintain a balance between the human rights of people and the protection of communities.  We are giving very strong powers to the Garda Síochána, and rightly so.  We must clamp down on hardened criminals.  The vicious thugs must be put away.  We must, however, do what we can to prevent young men from getting involved in this activity in the first place.  Perhaps our society is very unequal, but we need to start looking at that as a matter of urgency.  No matter how much legislation we enact or how many powers we give to the Gardaí, unless we stop the flow of people into this type of activity, it will continue.

Some are suggesting this legislation is being rammed through and not being given enough time.  We had five hours to speak on this, and quite a number of Deputies have spoken.  The majority of them have been from this side of the House.  I had a discussion with the Chief Whip yesterday on the need for more time on the Bill.

He said this was a flight of fancy on my behalf and was some sort of PR spin.  I reject that completely, and it does Deputy Rabbitte no credit.  He engaged in that with his usual pomposity.

He went on to state that "the first test of any Government is the protection of its citizens."  He said, "This cannot go on, Minister.  There must be some tipping point where the State asserts its democratic mandate and asserts decent values.  I hope that the shocking murder of Shane Geoghegan would be such a tipping point, and that people are saying that enough is enough, and that it is the Government's duty to put gangs out of business."  As I did not intend to come in on this vein, I did not have time to look up what Fine Gael Deputies said after the Shane Geoghegan murder or the Roy Collins murder.

I take my job very seriously.  The reality is that this has been strongly recommended by the Garda Síochána.  There has been a convention in this House when the Garda Síochána management has given advice on serious issues affecting the security of this State, that the view expressed by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is understood by the two major political parties opposite, but that did not seem to apply to Deputy Rabbitte's comments on a lack of evidence.  I stated quite clearly that the Garda Síochána has given very strong advice to the Government.

However, one could also have listened to the testimony of the two Deputies from Limerick, Deputies O'Dea and Power, who gave very eloquent explanations of the difficulties they have experienced as representatives of the people in that particular location of this country.  In spite of the fact that Deputy Rabbitte still continues to say there is no evidence adduced on this issue, Deputies O'Dea and Power said that almost on a daily basis people come in with jury summonses and that they are having difficulties with this.  The Deputies are now trying to interrupt, which is the usual tactic.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Peter Power, outlined very dramatically the difficulties their constituents face on a day to day basis.  We should not take lightly the comments of the two Deputies from the Limerick area who spoke on Second Stage.  The Garda gave a very strong recommendation to the Government which it discussed on a number of occasions since the tragic killing of Roy Collins.This was confirmed by the State solicitor, or the prosecutor, for Limerick who said on RTE recently that these people started to intimidate witnesses and then made life uncomfortable for jurors.  He went on to state that in the recent past, he certainly had one case in which he was so concerned about the level of intimidation of the jury that he had to report to the Garda authorities and ask it then to investigate a case where a person was acquitted in circumstances where it was clear to him that the jury was afraid.  He also stated that there has been a distinct reluctance on the part of people who are called to participate in juries and that they dream up all sorts of excuses to get off the jury panel.  That is confirmation of what the Garda told us about the difficulty it has had in Limerick and in areas of Dublin over the years.  I totally reject the assertion that this is a whim of mine or any sort of spin.I have heard much play made of the fact that in Limerick in recent days, there was no requirement for an empanelled jury.  I wish to inform those who allege there is no difficulty with juries that is because none of the cases called had any gangland connections or implications.  Any time there has been a gangland-related trial in Limerick, there has been difficulty getting juries empanelled.  The Minister for Defence outlined that clearly in what he said about the jury trial of Mr. Kieran Keane which had to be moved to Cloverhill because a jury could not be empanelled.  The experience is that each time there is a gangland-related trial, the number of jurors coming forward drops dramatically but that it rises again when normal criminal trials are at issue.I wish to deal with some of the issues raised by the Irish Human Rights Commission, for which I have much time.  Deputy Rabbitte tried to state that this Government totally ignores it.  The other day I accepted a number of amendments to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill 2009 which were recommended by the Irish Human Rights Commission.  In regard to its views on organised crime, it accepts that it is a major problem in this country.  It also states that it has the potential to cause great harm in Irish society.  In considering the criminal justice system, the Irish Human Rights Commission expresses views without the benefit of the information the Government and the Garda have.The Minister for Defence referred to the difference between the English model and ours and the assertion we should follow the English model.  In the English system, where there is a trial without a jury, there is a single judge.  As the Minister for Defence said, our system is tried and trusted and the Special Criminal Court comprises three experienced judges who have much expertise in trying criminal trials, which ensures the full protection of an accused person's rights.The Irish Human Rights Commission suggested that alternative measures should be looked at.  The Government's view is that none of those methods would provide full protection to members of a jury.  The Minister for Defence gave an example where a lady was murdered in Dublin.  It is suspected that she was murdered by a gang from Limerick.  These people have tentacles all over the country and are able to get to jury members, no matter where they are in this State.The employment of these alternative methods would inevitably send a signal to the jury which is incompatible with the accused person's presumption of innocence and it would convey that the State has very strong grounds to believe the jury's safety is in jeopardy.  Judges by their very nature and training do not allow any of these matters to influence their thinking.  There is a real danger that the suggestion of alternative methods could undermine the benefit of the presumption of innocence to which the accused is entitled.  Members opposite, in particular Deputy Rabbitte, have made out that this is a huge change.  Many of the procedures and changes in this Bill are already in existing legislation and we are merely extending them to organised crime.I refer to letters from Stephen Collins, the father of Roy Collins.  He wrote to my predecessor, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on 8 February 2008.  It was a cry for help, which he subsequently got.  He was complimentary on the way in which the Garda responded to this cry for help.  He said having given evidence, they were assured they would always have the full support of the State to protect them and that they were told the State owed them a debt of gratitude for their help.  Unfortunately, subsequent to writing that letter, his son was murdered in April this year.  He wrote again to me on 18 May, shortly after his son was murdered, and I outlined to him what we were doing.  He asked me to get the proposed new laws passed as a matter of urgency.  He said himself, his family and the whole country were depending on me.  Again, I cannot add to what he said publicly in recent days.  He said his family cannot wait three months.  I believe the country cannot wait three months.  He finished his letter by saying that the only people who have to fear from this legislation are the criminals, not the ordinary citizens.  I urge those Deputies on the other side of the House to support this legislation.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I welcome the opportunity to debate the important reports published recently by the International Monetary Fund, IMF, and the OECD.  We are living in a time of unprecedented crisis in the global economy, a crisis worse than any predicted by leading economic commentators.  As a small, open economy which earns its living by trading on world markets, Ireland is uniquely exposed to this crisis.  It is no exaggeration to state that responding to this crisis is one of the greatest challenges the country has faced since independence.  Meeting that challenge is the primary focus of the Government's effort.  It requires the energy, imagination and determination of everyone in this House and the country.However, before I outline the Government's strategy, which has been broadly endorsed by the IMF, I want to respond to some of the misplaced efforts to use this opportunity to criticise the Government's economic policies in recent years.When I took up office as Taoiseach in May 2008, the experts in the IMF, OECD and ESRI were predicting economic growth of over 3% in 2009.  They are now predicting a contraction of between 8% and 10%.  In simple terms, nobody predicted what has happened globally or in Ireland.In 2007, the IMF stated that "economic performance remains very strong supported by sound economic policies". Its executive directors commended Ireland's continued impressive economic performance, characterised by one of the highest growth rates of GNP per capita among advanced countries and one of the lowest unemployment rates.  This performance has been underpinned by outward-oriented policies, prudent fiscal policy, low taxes, and labour market flexibility. They expected economic growth to remain robust over the medium term.  Nevertheless, they did warn of a possible overheating in the housing market.The IMF's latest analysis showed the housing boom was mainly caused by cheap credit due to low interest rates.  This combined with rising incomes, a fast-growing population-workforce and pent-up demand for housing to create a structural weakness in the economy now exposed by the international economic crisis.  However, our interest rates are set by the European Central Bank, not the Government.Regarding those aspects in my control when I was Minister for Finance, I moved to end the tax incentives that then existed for the property market.  In my first budget in 2005, I announced a review of tax incentive schemes.  In 2006, in line with the recommendations from Goodbody Stockbrokers, Indecon, the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners, I announced a termination date of 31 July 2008 for all existing property-related tax incentive schemes with the exception of private hospitals, registered nursing homes and child care facilities.Most importantly, despite a concerted attempt in the media and by the Opposition, I refused to get rid of stamp duty, the largest transaction tax on property in the EU.  If we had heeded those calls to remove stamp duty, the brakes would have been off entirely and we would be in far greater trouble than we are now.This goes to show none of us was right in what we thought would happen.  As the NESC said in a widely-praised report on the current crisis:In Ireland, until autumn, 2008, there were grounds for hoping that a substantial housing-market correction, which began towards the end of 2006, and strategies to renew the economy's competitiveness by focusing on knowledge and innovation, would enable the country to enter a new phase of more moderate but soundly-based growth without major dislocation.  But the global financial crisis precipitated the credit crunch which spilled over into the real economy.  Ireland is now experiencing the vulnerability of its economic openness (without which, of course, the rapid expansion and higher living standards since 1993 would not have happened).My regret is that I did not manage to predict that such a seismic shock to the world economy was going to happen.  Neither did anyone else.  If my crystal ball had been better than those of the IMF, the OECD and the ESRI, I would have done more to reduce spending so it would have been easier to deal with this international recession.  However, I stand over the decisions I made based on the best information and advice that I had.When times were good, I chose to spend on badly needed public services, against the wishes of the Opposition which wanted me to spend more.  I also ran budget surpluses and brought down the national debt.  The cumulative current budget surpluses for 2005 to 2007, inclusive, amounted to €22 billion.  The national debt as a share of national income fell from 30% in 2004 to 23% in 2007.At all times, decisions were made in good faith to reduce the debt and improve public services.  This was the political consensus at the time and was consistent with the view of many IMF directors.  When I was Minister for Finance, the 2006 and 2007 country reports commended our economic management and sound fiscal position.No one has the benefit of hindsight.  What I can do, and will do, is provide honest and strong leadership through this crisis.  The Government is implementing a coherent strategy to manage through this difficult situation, an approach broadly endorsed by the IMF.  The IMF stated the Government "has moved with resolve to counter the severe economic and financial shocks" and the IMF directors "commend the scale and speed of the authorities response so far".The first part of the Government's strategy is to return the public finances to a stable and sustainable position.  We have set out a pathway for reducing the deficit back below 3% of GDP by 2013, striking a balance between sustaining economic activity in the short term and making a credible start on the difficult adjustment required.  The IMF has supported this approach, stating "the basic approach and elements of the plan are appropriate".  In particular, the IMF shared the Government's view that fiscal stimulus measures that further exacerbate the imbalances in the public finances would prove counter-productive.The IMF acknowledged the initial reliance on increases in income taxes in the October and April budgets was appropriate and that those tax increases were "a necessary process of returning tax rates to more normal levels".  We have taken some difficult decisions on both public spending and taxation, and more difficult choices lie ahead over the next several years.  The Government shares the IMF's view that a greater focus on reductions in current spending is needed.The second part of the Government's strategy is to restore stability to the banking and financial system.  This is not about helping the banks per se, it is about helping businesses and citizens access the credit required in a modern economy.  The IMF welcomed “the important steps to stabilise the financial system” taken by the Government.  It specifically mentions the State bank guarantee scheme which they say was vital to maintaining financial stability.  That is the same guarantee the Labour Party opposes.The IMF supported the establishment of NAMA which it described as:pivotal to the orderly restructuring of the financial sector and limiting long-term damage to the economy . . . NAMA offers the prospect of extracting distressed assets from the banks, a precondition for their return to healthy functionality.The IMF agreed it can be self-financing and stated: "if well managed, the distressed assets acquired by NAMA could over time produce a recovery value to compensate for the initial fiscal outlays."  If there is a shortage as a result of getting rid of those assets over that period and the longer time horizon as suggested by NAMA, the question of a levy on the banking system to make up the difference is also envisaged.  Protecting the exposure of the taxpayer to the greatest extent possible has been a fundamental perspective we have been seeking to maintain in whatever policy responses have been formulated and devised.The IMF has the most experience in dealing with banking crises around the world.  It has real banking and economic experts and their informed view on NAMA is very much at variance with the arch positions that have been adopted by the Opposition and some commentators.The IMF rightly emphasised the importance of the prices at which the assets are purchased, a factor with which we agree.  That is why NAMA has hired experts to make recommendations on valuation methodologies.  The methodology will have to be validated by the European Commission.  The IMF has emphasised the importance of getting the legislative and operational structure for NAMA right and ensuring the agency is in place as soon as possible.  We agree with the IMF in this respect and share its sense of urgency.Preparations for the establishment of NAMA are continuing.  We have appointed experts to advise and assist departmental officials and other Government legal advisers on the drafting of the legislation and on practical preparations.  We expect to publish the legislation later this month and hope to have it debated in the Oireachtas in September.Some people seem to support the wholesale nationalisation of the State-guaranteed banks.  It has been suggested that the IMF favours nationalisation but that is not the case.  The IMF sees nationalisation as possibly necessary in certain situations.  The Government believes it is important, where possible, for the banking sector to have a market presence and to operate in line with market disciplines.  The best way to achieve this objective is to provide for a commercially focused banking system, which includes banks that have a market presence and operate within market disciplines and constraints.  The nationalisation of the entire Irish banking system is not the panacea some people suggest.  By itself, it would not address any of the problems faced by the banks.  No country is adopting a policy of wholesale bank nationalisation.  If Ireland were to take that route on its own, it could damage its international reputation with investors.  That would affect not only the funding provided to the banking sector, but also the economy more generally.The Opposition has claimed many times that no independent economist supports the Government's approach to the banks.  The IMF, which is independent and has more expertise in advising on banking problems than most commentators, supports the Government's approach.  The IMF does not even give consideration to the Fine Gael proposal of setting up a magic recovery bank and some legacy banks.  It is clear that the IMF does not regard the proposal as a viable alternative.The third aspect of the Government's strategy involves restoring competitiveness and returning to sustainable economic growth.  The Government set out its approach in Building Ireland's Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  A smart economy combines the successful elements of the enterprise economy and the innovation or ideas economy.  Such an economy also promotes a high-quality environment, improves energy security and promotes social cohesion.  The lesson to be learnt from the severe global recessions in the past is that as well as weathering the economic storm, countries need to restructure their economies to target the next wave of economic growth.  Our overall objective is to increase the productivity of our people by creating greater value in what we produce and provide as a nation.  This is the key to driving economic development and improving living standards.  Our vision is based on specific objectives.  For example, we want to attract a greater proportion of high-value, research and development intensive, foreign direct investment.  We intend to develop a critical mass of Irish and international companies that are at the forefront of innovation, create the products and services of tomorrow and provide well-paid jobs for this and future generations.  We will create the conditions in which entrepreneurs will want to come to Ireland because it provides the best environment for turning ideas into products and services for sale.Ireland will be at the leading edge of renewable energy and environmentally friendly markets.  The Government intends to enhance the environment, secure energy supplies and build the green technology sector.  It will provide for more efficient and effective public services and smarter regulation.The Government has already introduced a number of significant initiatives to move towards the vision I have outlined.  It has introduced a range of taxation provisions to encourage venture capital activity in Ireland and support investment in research and development and start-up high-tech companies.  It has introduced a new tax regime for intellectual property.  It has established a high-level group on green enterprise to identify new opportunities to create jobs and growth.  The ESB has recently announced 3,700 new jobs in this area.  We are promoting the restructuring of the higher education sector to better concentrate expertise and investment.  The recent announcement by UCD and Trinity College of an innovation alliance is a major step forward in that regard.  We are targeting a range of new opportunities for Ireland in international services including financial services, the international education sector, the maritime sector and arbitration services.  We are developing an action plan to improve trade, investment and tourism links with new and fast-developing markets, for example in Asia, the Middle East and South America.  This reflects the growing importance of such regions.  Work on these and other aspects of the smart economy is ongoing.  To take this effort further, we have established an innovation task force to support a co-ordinated approach to the development of Ireland as an innovation hub in all sectors of the economy.  The final part of our strategy involves maximising employment in the short term and helping those who lose their jobs.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I understand the impact unemployment can have on individuals and families.  Our objective is to retain as many of this country's 1.8 million jobs as possible, while ensuring those who lose their jobs have opportunities to develop new skills or qualifications which will prepare them for a return to employment.  The €100 million stabilisation fund, which we have established to support vulnerable but viable companies over the next two years, is operating well.  It will help companies to reduce costs and increase sales in recession-hit overseas markets.As well as stabilising the banking system to restore the flow of credit to the enterprise sector generally, we have taken specific steps to help small and medium sized enterprises.  The recapitalised banks have committed to increase their lending capacity to such enterprises by 10% over 2008.  European Investment Bank funding of €350 million has been made available to such enterprises.  An independent review of the wider issue of credit availability and trade finance is being finalised.  The Government has established a clearing house with representatives from the business sector to monitor trends in lending to enterprises and address any blockages that are identified.  We are seeking to maximise the number of people in employment by sustaining a high level of investment in labour intensive infrastructure.  We are actively exploring new and innovative ways of accessing private sector finance to support public private partnership projects.  We have seen average reductions of 10% and 12% in electricity and gas prices.  The costs faced by large industrial users remain out of line with international competitors.  We are working to identify and make progress with further measures to improve the situation for Irish business in this critical era.  We are introducing a new initiative to safeguard vulnerable jobs through a temporary employment subsidy scheme.  This has been developed in consultation with the social partners.  It will provide a subsidy to support jobs in exporting companies in the manufacturing and internationally traded services sectors.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	188	The scheme has been designed to minimise the risks of deadweight and displacement.  Its roll-out will be carefully monitored.  This new scheme is in addition to the significant support the State already provides to people on short-term work.  Compared to 12 months ago, an additional 50,000 workers are receiving social welfare payments in respect of short-time working.  This is the equivalent of, or in many cases greater than, the support offered in other EU member states.  The Government's focus is on delivering good outcomes through measures that work.  We are keen to allocate resources where results are proven.However, we cannot avoid the difficult adjustment that needs to take place in the labour market.  Costs have to fall.  The level of employment in certain sectors, particularly construction, was not sustainable.  This week's live register figures highlight the scale of the challenge.  The best pathway to sustained job creation and economic growth is to regain competitive advantage in the marketplace by doing whatever is necessary to retain and regain market share in an environment of depleted demand.The Government has introduced a wide range of measures to help those who have become unemployed.  Some 128,000 training and work experience activation places, funded through FÁS, have been established this year.  Provision has been made for 146,000 participants in further education programmes.  In all our policies, our priority is to create job opportunities for such people.  That will not happen unless we have stable public finances, a sound banking system and sustainable growth based on a competitive economy that is to the forefront in innovative terms.  Despite what some people claim, there is no short-cut or easy solution.  As the IMF has pointed out, the adjustment is and will continue to be difficult.The Government is working with the social partners to try to manage that adjustment.  It is willing to listen to good ideas from any source.  We will not try to fool people into believing difficult decisions can be avoided.  The global economic and financial crisis, which was not foreseen by the IMF, the OECD or any similar commentator, has hit Ireland hard.  The Government's past decisions were informed by the best forecasts and advice available at the time, given the downside risks that also existed.  They have all crystalised together, which has added to the complexity and difficulty we are encountering.  The Irish people will not thank us for wasting time and energy wishing things had turned out differently.  We owe it to them to concentrate on dealing with the world as we find it——

It welcomes the IMF's support for its broad approach.  We will continue to implement the strategy I have outlined and provide the leadership that is required to bring the country through this crisis.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I am not sure who wrote the Taoiseach's speech for him, but it bears no resemblance to the country we live in.  What is eating deeply into the Taoiseach is the fact that he sat in Merrion Street and introduced four budgets in the full knowledge of the spending trends that was being followed by the then Government and its predecessors.  We have now reached a point of crisis and it is that which is getting at the Taoiseach, as the leader of this Government.  The spending trends he followed as Minister for Finance have now reached fruition.  This is endorsed by many independent economic commentators.I wish to make a few observations on what the Taoiseach has said.  He said he refused to get rid of stamp duty when attempts were made by the media and the Opposition benches to get him to do so.  It was the Taoiseach's cohort in Government who said that stamp duty should be got rid of.  There was a serious warning at that time as regards the housing market from Fine Gael that the stamp duty regime should be changed.  The proposal for the abolition of stamp duty came not from here but from Fianna Fáil's supporters in Government.The Taoiseach makes the point that the IMF did not consider the proposal put forward by Deputy Richard Bruton in respect of legacy banks and the recovery bank to be funded by the European Central Bank and in part from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  It was not asked to comment on that and I am sure if it had, it would have given a considered opinion, not like the Taoiseach

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The action plan the Taoiseach speaks of is similar to the action plans every Minister speaks about: We are committed to full employment; we are committed to restoring health to the public finances; we are committed to building a new Central Mental Hospital; and we are committed to providing the infrastructure that our country needs.  This is the mantra and the litany that comes from Minister after Minister.  I am delighted the Taoiseach mentioned the FÁS training courses catering for 128,000 with work experience activation programmes in prospect for another 146,000.I got a letter this morning from a man who worked for 26 years in a reputable company and then applied for a FÁS course in domestic appliances which was held in Shannon last year over four or five months, to which he travelled from his house.  There were ten buckets in the warehouse where the course was being held to collect rain water.  The person giving the course did not know the outlet tube from the inlet tube in any washing machine.  There were no domestic appliances on view.  This was a course that was paid for and somebody endorsed it at a time when Members of this House through the Committee of Public Accounts were examining elements of training being done by FÁS.  I shall write to the Taoiseach about this and I hope he gives me a considered response.  It seems to have been a training course that was "phantom" in its proposal and useless in its output.The Taoiseach also talks about not fooling the people as regards difficult decisions that cannot be avoided and must be made.  I respect that, but the Taoiseach said in the Dáil the other day that for the first time the numbers signing on the live register were declining when they are at 418,000 — for the month of June an additional 21,000 people signed on and the figure is expected to increase upwards.  It is important to have trends from seasonally adjusted figures, but it is neither true nor honest to say that the rate of unemployment and the numbers signing on the live register are declining when the fact is that 1,000 people a day have signed on every day for the last six months.The recent IMF report on this country is a damning indictment of the Taoiseach's tenure as the former Minister for Finance.  The report makes it clear that the failed policies of the Government have given Ireland the worst recession in the advanced economies.  Thousands of people have lost their jobs because the Taoiseach and his Government failed to do their job.  The IMF leaves no room for doubt, and despite the Taoiseach's selective quotations, I shall give him a few more.  On page eight of its report it says that Ireland was, perhaps, the most overheated of all advanced economies.  I challenge any Member on the Government side to look at the remarks and contributions made by Deputy Bruton, in referring to budget after budget since 2003.  On page 21 the IMF argues that well before the crisis hit, the public finances had developed serious structural weaknesses.  When I asked the Department of Finance recently, under the Freedom of Information Act constrained by this Government, for the information given to the Minister for Finance from Departments, including his own, as to the projections for spend and the emphasis as regards where that might lead us, the charge requested was €6,000.The executive summary of the IMF report could not be clearer.  It states that given its imbalances Ireland was especially vulnerable to the recent global shocks.  Every country has had its share of hits in terms of the global recession, but the sump in this country has run dry because the reserves were spent and blown during a period of enormous economic expansion.  Some of this money was spent to very good effect, but a great deal of it was wasted through inefficiency, mismanagement and downright profligacy.The current Minister for Finance has certainly got the point.  No sooner was this report out, than he was out of his box, popping up on the media like a latter day Pontius Pilate to say the economy was overheated, while adding that he was not a member of the Government at the time.  I would remind the Taoiseach that the Minister for Finance does not share his view that political loyalty is a virtue.  Loyalty is not the only virtue, however.  There is a need for honesty and for people to be upfront.  It is time that the Government was honest with the Irish people and admitted that Ireland is now facing what could be called "the lost decade".  This was a term that applied to Japan in the 1990s after its economic bubble had burst.  It was a decade of stagnant growth, when the Japanese economic miracle disappeared.  It is now clear that Ireland is going down the same road Japan took in the 1990s.  The IMF forecasts that Ireland's GDP will not reach 2007 levels again until 2017.  That is what the Taoiseach's legacy is from his time as Minister for Finance, a decade of growth wiped out and tens of thousands facing long-term unemployment.Just a few days ago the Taoiseach was telling the Irish people that he had nothing to apologise for.  This Government, comprising Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and supported by Independents has no shame.  It goes back to the fundamental experience of Fianna Fáil Party principles, when the Taoiseach said on the evening of the count for the recent elections, that it was "important to put the people first sometimes" and that it was "important to put the country first sometimes".  From this party's perspective one should always put the people first and always put the country first.If the Taoiseach had done his job as Minister for Finance there now would be no need to cut spending or increase taxes in the way the Government has.  The debate here today would be about how to stimulate the economy.  Instead nothing is being done for jobs, even as the GNP falls a staggering 12% in the first quarter of this year.  If he had done his job as Minister for Finance, by properly regulating the banks and cooling the property boom he knew was happening, there would not be a banking crisis of the scale and magnitude that has occurred.  Any Deputies on this side of the House, from Fine Gael or the Labour Party, who warned about this were blown out of it by Fianna Fáil Ministers saying in effect: "You're talking down our country and our economy.  Why do you not go away and commit political suicide?"If he had done his job as Minister for Finance and listened to the IMF, the Fine Gael Party and Deputy Bruton in particular, when they warned that Ireland was losing its competitiveness, thousands of jobs could have been saved.  Instead, unemployment has now reached 11.9%, the second highest in Europe.  The Taoiseach and his Ministers did not do the job and we are now in crisis.  As they did not do the job, hundreds of thousands of people must now lose theirs.  For several months at the beginning of this crisis, both the Taoiseach and every Minister in Government denied there was any problem.  They then panicked, brought in emergency measures and went on to do a subsequent U-turn on many of them. Every step of the way this Government has only taken action when it had no choice.  Even then it did not go about it in the right fashion.The attempts by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to spin the recent Exchequer returns show that even now the Government is not being straight and upfront with the people in all of these matters.  The truth is that apart from corporation taxes, where the rules were changed, there has been no underlying improvement in the tax take.  The impact of higher tax rates has been offset by a weakening economy and public spending continues to increase.  The implications are obvious.  The Government is again on course to miss its own fiscal targets.  For 2010 the Department of Finance is currently forecasting a budget deficit of 10.75%.  However, the IMF, that independent, reputable body the Taoiseach quotes, forecasts that the deficit will be two points higher at 12.75%.  In other words, the IMF is saying that the Government will have to find approximately an additional €3 billion in savings or tax increases in its next budget if it wants to meet 2010 targets.If all of this was not bad enough, Moody's, the credit rating agency, has lowered its rating on Ireland.  It is also warning that the rating could be cut again, if the budgetary situation does not improve.  I made this point in the House a number of weeks ago; due to the lack of clarity about the discount to be applied by NAMA, banks are telling their stakeholders the discount will be of the order of 20%.  That means, by implication, that bank shares rise and the country's credit rating decreases.Moody's pointed out two chief concerns.  First, they warn that Ireland faces a "debt trap", where a shrinking economy keeps the deficit high, despite higher taxes and spending cuts.  Second, they are very worried about the impact on our economy of the banking crisis, a subject the IMF report also addresses.  The figures produced by the IMF are terrifying.  It estimates the total losses in the banking system could be a massive €35 billion for property development loans alone.  However, it also believes losses are likely to extend well beyond the property development sector.  In other words, total losses may be well over €35 billion.Fine Gael's position has been very clear — we must protect taxpayers.  Unfortunately, nobody has any clear idea how much risk the taxpayer will be taking on through NAMA.  It appears we will have heads of a Bill and the Dáil will be called back in September to deal with NAMA.  Some nine months after the banking crisis started, the Government still refuses to give anybody, including the IMF, estimates of the losses in the banking sector.  In this pre-NAMA phase there is clearly a crisis with business all over the country.  Banks are restructuring loans and reissuing them as new loans.  Banks are refusing to give credit and overdraft facilities to thousands of businesses.

If the Government does not do something about this in the pre-NAMA phase, hundreds of thousands more jobs will be lost.  It appears as if a discount of 20% being touted from bank sources will mean a massive transfer to the taxpayer for acquisition of these assets.  It gives the perception that the Government is more interested in bailing out professional bond investors who turned Irish banks into casinos than in protecting our citizens and taxpayers.  There is clearly a crisis in this pre-NAMA phase and it requires urgent and direct action and response from the Government.Far from being an endorsement of the Government, as the Taoiseach is trying to spin it, the IMF report supports key elements of Fine Gael's policy and analysis in this area.  The authors of the report have made it very clear that Ireland needs new sources of economic growth.  Fine Gael is the only party that has put forward a detailed plan to transform this economy into a new "smart green economy".  The NewERA strategy promoted by Deputies Coveney, Varadkar and Bruton will invest €11 billion in major infrastructure projects in energy, broadband and water.  I welcome the Taoiseach's response the other day that he will give me a considered analysis of our proposals.Irish pension funds which are cash-rich want to look around for investment opportunities in the country and the creation of a holding company with commercially driven companies achieving targets and objectives on time would allow for such investment.  The infrastructure provided would be an attraction in itself for further investment and the creation of up to 100,000 jobs and the protection of a further 80,000 jobs all over the country were that to be followed.  Fine Gael's NewERA proposal will make our economy one of the most competitive and green in Europe, and generate up to 100,000 jobs.The IMF report argues very clearly that spending cuts, not tax rises, are the best way to deal with the deficit.  Fine Gael has consistently argued that too much emphasis is being placed by the Government on raising taxes, rather than cutting State expenditure.  The IMF believes that, unless it is done properly, spending reductions could end up hurting the most vulnerable.  God knows, every Deputy in this House is seeing evidence of that every weekend at their clinics.  It is precisely for this reason that Fine Gael has consistently called for real reform of our public sector so those working in the public sector know they are contributing to the good and benefit of the country, and that good government can create a more efficient system where everybody can deliver the services the taxpayer deserves and seeks.  We have pointed out how that can be done through our FairCare health policy, which will help protect front line services.  The other day the Minister for Health and Children said we were spending €16 billion, but it is not delivering the service or efficiency we need.  Fine Gael has pointed out under our FairCare programme how that can happen.Any fair minded individual reading the IMF's report can come to only one conclusion: after 12 years of Fianna Fáil in office and incompetence in managing this country's economy and the people's affairs, we are, once again, the economic sick man of Europe.  Most countries are facing serious economic difficulties.  Few, if any, are facing a crisis on this scale.  The crisis we face is even more serious than the one we faced in the 1980s.If the measure is economic incompetence, nobody can match this Fianna Fáil Government's record.  It deserves to be in the Guinness book of world records.  Ireland is suffering the worst depression of any advanced economy since the Second World War.  It is, on average, four times greater than the decline of other OECD countries.  Our public finances have suffered the worst deterioration of any EU country.  The creation of NAMA means Ireland will have the biggest property company in the world, valued between €80 million and €90 million.  That is a testament to and legacy of what went on in the past ten years.As always, the taxpayers of Ireland pay the price for Fianna Fáil profligacy.  The people pay the price for incompetence, arrogance and a refusal to listen to common sense.  We live in an Ireland in 2009 where "Celtic tiger" has become an international punch line, 500,000 of its sons and daughters will be out of work by Christmas and 100,000 families face negative equity.  We live in an Ireland where we take medical cards from the elderly, close children's hospital wards and pump billions of euro into failed banks.It is impossible to escape the fact that this Government has turned economic incompetence into an art form.  In the space of five years, we have gone from "champagne Charlie" to "bankrupt Brian".  The Irish people deserve better.  So much could be done in this time of recession.  The Department of Finance appears to be suffering from complete paralysis.  There is no energy and enthusiasm in Government and no plan to deal with this.  So much could be done now.  The Government cannot tax its way out of this recession.  It is time for the Government to go, and to be replaced by a Government that has a plan and a team that will transform this country into one with services that are up to standard, which the people pay for and deserve.  It will not happen under this outfit.

Those were two very serious reports on the state of our economy.  I had hoped that we might be able to have a considered discussion in the House on their contents and how we might be able to respond to them.  I was disappointed that the Taoiseach instead of pursuing that approach has resorted to a kind of scripted version of a church gate party political speech, which was more about self-justification, an apologia for his time as Minister for Finance and some good old-fashioned thumps at the Opposition.  In the course of doing that the weapons used are always distortion and misrepresentation.  Let me take three specific items from his speech.First, there was the argument that because he did not see it coming nobody else saw it coming.  I accept that none of us saw the collapse of Lehman Brothers coming, but this party, the Labour Party, certainly saw what had been happening in the property market and in housing prices for more than a decade.  We drew attention to it repeatedly here in the House and repeatedly we introduced proposals — which the Government derided — in an attempt to address the spiral of land speculation and rising house prices which were going to be, and turned out to be, unsustainable.The second distortion related to stamp duty.  The Taoiseach said the Opposition wanted to get rid of stamp duty.  That is not so.  The Labour Party and, I know, Fine Gael wanted to reform stamp duty.  The person who announced that he wanted to get rid of stamp duty was the then Tánaiste, Mr. Michael McDowell, in September 2006.  I still meet builders who tell me that the last day they sold a unit they were building was the day before Mr. McDowell announced that there would be an abolition of stamp duty.  That and the dither for which the Government was responsible afterwards in responding to it were what contributed to the decline in confidence in the building industry.The third distortion is what the Taoiseach said about some people wanting wholesale nationalisation of the banks.  When he says "some people", I presume he means the Labour Party and the 20 eminent economists who agree with our position on the banking situation.  None of us is saying we want wholesale nationalisation of the banks.  We have been saying there should be a temporary nationalisation of the larger banks, which is an entirely different matter.We need this debate not just because of the reports, but because vital decisions will be made by Government most likely during the summer recess.  Many of those decisions may be very difficult to reverse afterwards.  We need the debate because the report of the IMF in particular calls attention to fundamental flaws in the Government's approach to the banking crisis in particular, which it is not too late to address.  The report of the IMF is not gospel.  There is much in it with which I would differ, and all of us are entitled to do so.  However, it is the work of an influential international body that brings an important external perspective and we should take it seriously.The IMF report rightly analyses Ireland as having three inter-linked economic crises.  It summarises the complexity and difficulties involved quite crisply in stating:The authorities agree that the risks remain significant.  The risks arise from the continuing interaction of slowing growth, financial sector stress, and the state of public finances, with each threatening to pull the other down.  If the distress in the financial sector is larger than currently estimated, this damaging reinforcement could accelerate.In other words, we must address the jobs crisis.  No one doubts the importance of fiscal crisis.  No one doubts either the importance of the banking crisis — of restoring the flow of credit.  However, we also need to deal with the crisis in the real economy — people losing their jobs and their businesses.  The Labour Party has repeatedly come back to this point.  If the Government thinks that higher unemployment is the cost of saving the banking system and the public finances, it is wrong.  Keeping people in work, keeping businesses going, and supporting new ventures with whatever tools are available are essential to dealing with the other two crises.  The tools are limited, but they do exist.  Labour has argued, for example, for a State investment bank that would fund infrastructure development and also provide finance to business.Of course, we must demonstrate that the public finances are on a path to sustainability, but we cannot ignore what is happening in the real economy.  The construction sector, in particular, is in dire straits.  Yet at the same time many infrastructural projects which could be carried out would yield a positive long-term return.  There is an opportunity to make these investments now when there is spare capacity in the building sector and tender prices are at an historical low.  That is why Labour has been calling for a new national development plan to be drawn up and innovative financing options to be examined.  I agree with Deputy Kenny on the potential in private pension funds for the financing of some of our infrastructural work.  Given that the construction sector is operating below its sustainable level, jobs and incomes can be saved, and valuable infrastructure put in place with a determined approach by Government.It is also vital that we provide training and work experience opportunities for the unemployed.  Labour has repeatedly made the argument that we must learn the lessons of the 1980s.  It is not economically, socially or morally credible, that this State would be passive in the face of 500,000 people on the live register.  It is simply not acceptable.  I cannot understand the inertia from the Tánaiste and her Department on this issue.  Modest proposals have been brought forward in the budget and since then on training, but they are minuscule when compared to the scale of the problem.  While active labour market programmes cost money, the cost is modest when it is realised that the person on the scheme would otherwise be in receipt of a social welfare payment.  We also know that schemes do not need to be expensive to be successful.  Labour has brought forward a range of innovative ideas that attempt to learn from the experience of the 1980s: an earn and learn scheme; a bridge the gap scheme for work experience; more places in further education; new criteria for the back to work and back to education schemes; a tax back scheme for people who want to go back to full-time study; and literacy programmes for those with reading difficulties who are among the most vulnerable when they lose their jobs.The Government's response has been piecemeal and limited.  It has agreed an "earn and learn" scheme, but with only 277 places.  It has done some work on training and education, but the scale of the response does not meet the scale of the problem.  If there are to be 500,000 people on the live register, then we should be thinking in terms of 100,000 new opportunities to gain skills and experience.  This is not a matter of giving people on the dole something to do.  This is about ensuring that we do not allow the build up of a new group of long-term unemployed.  It is about investing in a pool of people who will be more highly educated, more highly trained, better skilled and better prepared to participate in the recovery.  This is an investment that has a long-run impact on the productivity of the economy and there is an opportunity to do so now when the economy is in a downturn.Those are but two areas of policy.  There are others.  We should review supports for SMEs, to help viable businesses to survive and new businesses to start up.  Businesses today are being crippled.  They are suffering from the drop in trade as a result of the recession.  The banks will not lend them money and they also need to deal with a range of State bodies, such as Revenue, the local authorities and regulatory bodies, some of which are continuing to behave as though Ireland was still at the height of the boom rather than in recession.Labour has argued for a temporary PRSI exemption scheme for companies that create new jobs.  We have argued that local authorities should have discretion to introduce rates exemptions for new businesses.  We have also argued for changes in the law on rent reviews.  Here I had hoped the Government would adopt Labour's Bill in this area, but instead it is applying the new rules only to new leases, which is of little use to those already in leases and are hard pressed in their businesses.If we are to develop a new NDP, we should consider the capacity of each sector in our economy to create jobs.  Are we making the most of the food industry?  What about tourism?  At the height of the boom the Irish tourism sector was in danger of pricing itself out of the market.  In the past 12 months, accommodation prices have fallen by 12.4%, which is something we can now sell abroad.  We repeatedly come back to the point that the Government is ignoring the jobs crisis, which is undermining its capacity to deal with both the banking crisis and the fiscal crisis.The IMF is an intergovernmental organisation, which takes care to couch all its comments in the most diplomatic language.  The report was written so that the Government would be able to welcome its findings — such is the nature of the process.  Yet, amid the carefully constructed language, two things stand out.  The first is the estimate from the IMF that the banking crisis will cost the Exchequer some €35 billion, which is 20% of GDP.  That is a truly staggering figure to contemplate.  It is important to note that a billion has nine zeros.  It means that because Fianna Fáil were, at best, asleep at the wheel of banking regulation, every man, woman and child in Ireland is left with a bill of nearly €8,000.While the IMF's estimate is just an estimate, it also is striking that the Government has no alternative figure to advance and that it was left to the IMF to come up with a number.  This leaves one with the question as to what is the Government's figure.  Although there has been a drip-feed of bad news from the banking sector for months, an authoritative figure regarding the bad debts in the banks has not been put forward.  While no-one doubts this is difficult to do, in the absence of a credible figure from the Government others have made their own assumptions.This is a central issue.  As the IMF again points out and as I have pointed out earlier, there is a significant linkage between the banking crisis and the cost of borrowing for the Exchequer.  The Exchequer took on a huge contingent liability by taking on responsibility for the bad loans in the banks via the guarantee that no one has been able to quantify.  Therefore, it is little wonder that movements in our bond spread have been strongly associated with events in the banking system.  Put simply, the inability of the Government to sell a convincing story about Ireland abroad and to put a credible figure on the cost of the banking crisis has contributed to our higher cost of borrowing.  Somewhat belatedly, the Minister for Finance has been wooing the bond markets on a road show of financial markets.  I was sent a copy of the presentation that he has been using by a somewhat disgruntled banker who found it much less than impressive.The core concern of the IMF report is NAMA and in this regard the usages of diplomatic language have been strained to breaking point.  It is amply and manifestly clear that the IMF mission believes the present NAMA proposals represent an unwarranted risk for the Exchequer.  In IMF-speak, "price determination is a major challenge".  The report goes on to essentially endorse the approach proposed by the 20 economists and by the Labour Party, which is based on temporary nationalisation.  While the IMF of course does not rule out the NAMA idea, rather it seeks its redesign to operate alongside temporary nationalisation.  The insertion of a long paragraph taken from recent IMF documents on the role of nationalisation is a clear signal of what the organisation actually thinks.One also must have regard to the delay in setting up NAMA and in legislating for it.  This delay is the cause of further damage to the banking system and to the economy.  As NAMA will take both good and bad loans, the delay in its introduction is causing banks to restrict credit where a business has some holding of development land or property.  Meanwhile, those who owe the banks a fortune for development loans have no incentive to pay the banks in the hope they will get a better deal from NAMA.  In addition, the delay provides some individuals the opportunity to try to hide good assets.It is clear there was a greater level of agreement between the IMF and the Government on the public finances, though that is not necessarily something with which I would agree.  The IMF report makes a bald statement that fiscal adjustment should focus on expenditure cuts.  It argues that international evidence suggests that adjustments based on cuts in spending rather than on taxation have been better sustained and often have been expansionary rather than contractionary.  This line echoes comments being made by the Government in recent times.  One must be particularly careful not to simply apply blindly the result of a statistical analysis of what may have happened in other countries in other circumstances to the position of the Irish economy in the present and nor should one vest this issue with any great economic mystique.Ultimately, this comes down to fairly simple logic.  For a fiscal adjustment to succeed, it must deal with the underlying cause of the deficit.  If the cause is ever-increasing public spending, then the solution is to arrest public spending.  If, however, the cause is an excessively narrow tax base, one then must broaden the tax base.  The keys to successful adjustment are sustainability, credibility and political acceptability.  If the public finances are put onto a sustainable footing and are seen to be so, it will be seen as credible and financial markets will respond positively.  If an adjustment is to be sustained and sustainable, then it must be fair and must be seen to be fair.  If the argument is advanced that this can all be done through lower public expenditure, then that will not be credible and will not be so perceived. If the burden of adjustment is placed on the least well-off in society, then it will not be politically acceptable and will be undermined accordingly.The Labour Party has been arguing for years that Ireland's tax base is too narrow and that too many people have been able to avoid paying tax on too much of their income and this must change.  A broader tax base is needed both because it is more fair and because it is more sustainable.  The Commission on Taxation essentially was the brainchild of my colleague, Deputy Joan Burton.  I hope that report will contain a set of proposals that will contribute to the required fiscal adjustment.  We need a tax system that will support high quality public services in a sustainable manner and that is manifestly fair.Equally, there must be adjustment on the public expenditure side.  Again, the Labour Party has been arguing for years that the system of budgeting for public expenditure in Ireland is crazy.  It is little more sophisticated than adding a set percentage each year to last year's allocation.  Since 2001, Labour has been proposing better scrutiny and better prioritisation of spending and this can no longer be delayed.  The Labour Party is committed to the development of the best possible public services for the people.  It is precisely for that reason that we are committed to public sector reform.  We seek budgeting systems that achieve this goal on an ongoing and consistent basis.  Value for money in public spending is not something about which one only should be concerned when there is a budgetary crisis.  It should be hard-wired into the system of resource allocation and to achieve this we will be obliged to place a far greater onus on Departments and agencies to manage their own affairs, rather than attempting to micro-manage everything from a single office in the Department of Finance.I do not wish to see proposals for a set of random cuts from the McCarthy group but a set of proposals for doing more with less and for systematically improving productivity in the public service on an ongoing basis.  While such proposals certainly should make savings now, they should do so in a managed and sustainable manner that is based on the concept that public services often are different from private companies, which is the reason they are in the public sector in the first place.  However, I do not know whether the McCarthy report passes that test because the Government has neither published it nor committed to so doing.  What is the big secret?  Last April the Labour Party asked for the departmental submissions to the McCarthy group but was not provided to them.  There is no sign of the report and all one gets are leaks.  The report should be put into the public domain in order to ascertain its contents.One also must ask why a McCarthy group was needed in the first place.  Without being disrespectful to the people who are on the group, why is an outside group needed to tell the Government what to do?  The Opposition parties are constantly asked what would they do and are expected to have detailed answers, which is fair, and as far as possible, they give them.  However, we suffer from a disadvantage, namely, we are not in government and do not have at our disposal the managerial information that comes from being in government, which is the kind of information one only can access when one is part of the system of government.  However, Fianna Fáil has been in office for 12 years.  The Taoiseach has served in several ministries, as has the Tánaiste.  What is it that Mr. McCarthy knows about the running of the Government that the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste do not know or should not know after 12 years in office?These are difficult times and difficult decisions will be required.  However, we also must have priorities.  This is the moment when values matter and for me, cutting the basic rate of social welfare is the last place one should look for economies.  I do not accept that in a society in which the superwealthy can pay little or no tax, we must look for savings from those on less than €11,000 per year.  Moreover, if we are concerned with macroeconomic effects, then social welfare again is the last place one should look for cuts.  A person who is on the breadline spends practically all  his or her income.  While others will reduce savings, people on social welfare will have no option but to reduce spending.  The impact on the broader economy, therefore, is greatest from that type of spending reduction.Our country and our economy face grave challenges.  We can and should address them together in national solidarity.  That means the greatest contribution being made by those who can best afford to bear it.  That means all political parties being prepared to contemplate difficult options.  However, we cannot have any attempt to use the crisis to advance a right wing ideological agenda of reducing the social safety net or rolling back the State, while avoiding the responsibility to contribute on the part of those who can most afford it.An important issue that we also must address is the rate at which consolidation is achieved.  In this regard, the minutes of the debate at the IMF board are interesting, albeit not that revealing.  They state "A few Directors, while recognizing that fiscal consolidation is an imperative, cautioned that consolidation should not undermine efforts to arrest the economic downturn".  This reverts to the point I made at the outset about the interlinkages between the three crises.  I am deeply concerned that we do not attempt to correct the public finances so quickly that we end up doing more damage to the real economy with negative feedback to both the fiscal and the banking crises.  As I stated at the outset, there are three interlinked crises and unless we deal with each of them and in particular unless we do more for jobs and businesses, we risk making the other problems even harder to manage.

Much of what they contain regarding the history of the economic crisis is correct but we cannot deny that the Taoiseach, previously Minister for Finance, along with his Fianna Fáil and PD band, is responsible for the situation in which we now find ourselves.  The Greens are now equally culpable.I would like to highlight what exactly is the IMF and its economic history.  It is important to do this so the Government does not get away with using the recommendations of this disreputable body as cover for its own right wing ideological agenda.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	205	If the recommendations of this report were to be implemented, we would see the economy spiral into depression.  There is no stimulus package in place, just slash and burn policies.  It is what we have come to expect both from the IMF and, unfortunately, from this Government.Ironically, when the IMF was set up at Bretton Woods after the Second World War, it was meant to monitor free markets and to keep them from going astray.  John Maynard Keynes, an economist to whom I would subscribe, was a proponent at the time.  Very quickly, however, the IMF developed a specialty for seeing financial crises as opportunities to push a right wing, free market agenda.  It aligned itself to the ideologies of powerful countries and became advocates and tools for the likes of Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.  The IMF is a product of Milton Friedman and the Washington consensus philosophy, the same economist who is behind, in spirit at least, the current banking crisis.  The IMF's agenda entails low taxes, expenditure cuts, minimum government intervention and privatisation.  The kind of structural adjustment the IMF advocates had a devastating impact on Latin America, Africa, Russia and Asia.Argentina is one example.  Domingo Cavallo's IMF-backed plan sold off virtually all the riches of that country.  By 1994, 90% of the state's enterprises were gone and 700,000 public servants had been fired.  Eventually, half of the population had been pushed below the poverty line and it became too expensive for indigenous industries to make goods in the country.  Manufacturing was virtually wiped out.I make this point because we must consider this report in the context of who and what is the IMF.  This is not a body any government should look to for advice or from which to take criticism.  It is certainly not a body on which any government should become economically dependent, yet this Government pushes us a step further in that direction every day.Some of the basic facts set out in the report are correct.  Much of what the IMF says about what went wrong with the economy includes policy decisions it would have advocated at the time.  The property incentive taxes that were constantly increased and expanded by Government and the lack of regulation of the banking sector were both ideological positions to which the IMF subscribes.  In the same way that both of these policies failed and caused an economic crisis, the solutions offered by the IMF, and currently being pursued by the Government — expenditure cuts and economic contraction — are also destined to fail.Last October, in the first emergency budget, my party stated clearly that we could not tax and cut our way out of this situation.  We pointed out that if job losses continued to mount and jobs were not created for those unemployed, the situation would deteriorate further.  The Government did not share our view, choosing instead to engage in the sort of book balancing exercise favoured by both the IMF and the ECB.  Now we have a contracting economy.Sinn Féin has unfortunately been proved correct.  Earlier this week we saw the levels to which the economy has shrunk and they are the worst since the 1960s.  The measures this Government continues to pursue with an bord snip nua will contract the economy even further.It is also important to note what the IMF does not say about the lead-up to this crisis.  It focuses on how wages are allegedly too high, and on how that has impacted on competitiveness.  Surprise, surprise.  It does not point out, of course, that we have experienced soaring energy bills because the Government has steadily increased indirect taxes like VAT on utility bills.  It does not point out that we do not have universal broadband because the Government privatised the main communications provider and then left us at its mercy for broadband provision.  It does not point out that our infrastructure, from schools to hospitals to rail and roads, has been described as Third World because this Government chose to invest in tax breaks for private property development rather than useful assets for the State.  All of these, and more, have lead to our loss of competitiveness.The orthodox line being pushed by the IMF, IBEC and their ilk, that wages and social welfare payments must be reduced, is a cynical and strategic attempt to target the vulnerable, not just in this crisis but for years to come.It is also short sighted and economically naive.  Our economy is contracting.  Taking money out of people's pockets, so they cannot consume, while we are still heavily dependent on indirect taxes such as VAT, will contract it further.My party is not blind to the problems facing this country with regard to competitiveness or, indeed, employers with regard to wage bills when they are barely able to keep things going, let alone turn a profit.  That is why in our jobs retention and creation document, published in March, we focused on ways to help employers through this by means of a subsidised jobs retention fund.  We want to see the cost of doing business reduced and have made several proposals on how to achieve this.  Slashing wages and social welfare will not lift us out of this crisis.  Making the right choices on budget day, going after those who can afford it, investing in infrastructure and public services, helping businesses keep afloat and stimulating the economy will right this mess.There is a way out of this crisis.  Neither the IMF nor this Government can see it, they are reverting to type.  They want to strip the country of all its economic activity, of wealth from the lower and middle income families.  I urge the Minister to be careful because reducing the deficit in a time of recession has rarely worked.I will finish by putting the record straight in one regard.  In his contribution, the Taoiseach claimed that no one saw this crisis coming.  Of course no one saw it coming to this extent but if we go back to the election in 2007, all parties in this House, bar Sinn Féin, were advocating tax cuts.  They said the economy would grow by 3% or more.  At the time we were described as economic illiterates.  We did not have a crystal ball, any more than the Taoiseach did, but there was a clear sign that the property bubble, together with an over-dependence on consumption taxes, was unsustainable.  Unfortunately, again we were correct.We are advocating now that the Government listen to us.  To contract the economy to the point of depression will not help our case.  We must be creative and embark on a substantial school building programme that will stimulate the construction sector and get people back to work, helping to put confidence back into the economy.  I look forward to the Government listening to some of these suggestions but, unfortunately, I do think it will.

On page 29, bullet point 52, the IMF recommends "More targeting of the vulnerable".  That, I am afraid, is how this report and this Government's attitude to the economic crisis, can be summed up.I agree with my colleague Deputy Arthur Morgan in his statement on how we should view the IMF and, in turn, this report.  As a general rule, we should pay the IMF as little heed as possible, except in circumstances such as this where it produces a report that I fear may be used by this Government as cover for policies it is happy to pursue anyway.Broad protection is given to the Government's plans on the first page of the report, where it states that expenditure cuts must be the key element for fiscal consolidation, mentioning in particular the public wage bill and social welfare cuts.  In our view, there is room for both tax increases and savings in public expenditure.  Sinn Féin has advocated a 48% tax on income earned in excess of €100,000.  We have called for all tax reliefs to be brought to the standard rate and reviewed on their individual merits.  We have put forward savings in many areas, including in the large salaries of the highest paid individuals in the State — consultants and heads of boards — and identified savings in drugs bills.  In our pre-budget submission we clearly identified the billions of euro worth of structural deficit adjustment needed in the emergency April budget but we did it by making the right choices, not by targeting the vulnerable in our society.As my colleague Deputy Morgan has pointed out, we cannot tax or cut our way out of this crisis.  In public expenditure, for example, we are only catching up.  It may have increased in recent years, but that was from a low starting point.  We still have the third lowest public expenditure in the OECD.  I point out that the portrayal of issues such as social welfare cuts and the public wage bill by the media has been disgraceful at times and certain journalists have demeaned themselves once again in their clamour to do the Government's job for it.There is a fallacy being bandied about in this report — and by this Government and others — that must be challenged.  I have heard several people refer to how Ireland must return to the early years of this decade to get back on an even keel and to restore our competitiveness.  It is said we must go back to the place we were before we lost the run of ourselves.  However, not everyone lost the run of themselves.  Some people took out large mortgages on small homes; some saw child care costs go through the roof.  While the cost of living rocketed, some depended on the minimum wage to help them cope with all of this.  If we return people to the wages and social welfare payments of 2002, they will still have their 2007 mortgages, their 2009 child care costs, and their large utility and transport bills.  Can we not improve the country's competitiveness in a way that moves us forward?  Must we always try to compete at the basest level?When the IMF report was published, the Taoiseach stated he stood over the decisions he had made as Minister for Finance, although he did not claim to have got everything right.  As our economy collapses as a direct result of the policies pursued by the Governments led by the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, and the current Taoiseach, we finally hear an admission that they did not get everything right.  Big deal.  The Taoiseach has yet to acknowledge that the very foundation of the Government's economic policy was unsound, based as it was on a grossly inflated property market.  Like dodgy builders, the Taoiseach, in his previous role as Minister for Finance, and the former Taoiseach highlighted the flashy fittings in the showhouse while the foundations were crumbling and massive cracks were appearing in the walls.Many people pointed out what was going on, including Sinn Féin, and we totally reject the self-serving attempt by the Government to create some kind of collective national responsibility for a massive mess created, in the main, by conservative and corrupt politicians, bankers and property speculators.  The current Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has tried to distance himself from the Governments of which he was a part, but he never spoke out, never shouted stop, and never questioned the flawed economic policy that has led us into the current economic disaster, with more than half a million people expected to be on the dole by Christmas.  The Taoiseach and the Minister, as in the past, are in this together, as is each and every Fianna Fáil Deputy who followed them through the voting lobbies since 1997.  It gives me no pleasure to say to the Minister opposite, Deputy Gormley, that responsibility also now rests on the Green Party, whose members have trundled through those lobbies time after time enforcing Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats policy they rightly opposed when in Opposition.Other countries are stimulating their economies.  They are borrowing strategically with the knowledge that they will invest it wisely and create the jobs and the revenue needed to get public finances back on track and repay sovereign debt.  Much of what this State is borrowing is disappearing down a banking black hole because the Government has not established a workable solution for the financial institutions.  We are not alone in trying to fix our economic crisis by slowing down economic activity, but we are certainly in the minority.The economic decisions being taken now, which are set out in this report, bring to the surface an important issue in Irish politics: what do we want our Government to do?  How involved do we want the State to be in the economy and the general well-being of society?  Sinn Féin wants the State to be very involved.  We want public employment, we want high-quality public services and we want nationalisation where appropriate.  This Government and the IMF want minimal involvement and privatisation.  Provisions of the State such as social welfare are not seen as important by the IMF other than when they can be reduced to balance public finances.  Sinn Féin sees social welfare as being one of the methods by which one can judge a society.  How it treats its vulnerable, particularly in times of economic crisis, says everything there is to know about a state.As my colleague said, there is a way out of this economic crisis and that is through jobs, investment and education.  Cutting wages and welfare, focusing all efforts on banks and balancing the budget is what the Government has been doing to date and it has not worked.  How much further must we sink before the Minister and his colleagues in Government realise that clear and patent fact?

It is an independent appraisal of what needs to be done if we are to emerge from an economic crisis that is without precedent in this State.  The report speaks for itself and the authors have been clear and concise in their analysis of the causes of Ireland's problems and the remedies that are necessary if we are to emerge from the current crisis.  They do not need interpretation.  Speaking in the wake of the report, the IMF mission chief to Ireland, Ashoka Mody, stated, "The basic message of the [IMF] report is straightforward: the imbalances in the Irish economy were serious, the response to the ongoing global crisis has been appropriate, and yet the size of the problem is such that the road ahead is a long one."The report identifies that alongside the global economic recession, the roots of Ireland's economic problems stretch back to the turn of the century and the policies that were laid down then.  Export-led growth was abandoned for a property bubble.  Competitiveness was eroded and the economy became totally over-reliant on the construction sector.  This was exacerbated by a loose financial regulatory system combined with a cavalier approach from the Irish banks, who rushed to lend obscene amounts to developers.The question now facing us in Government and in this House is this: what are we going to do about it?  The Opposition has, to its shame, failed to engage realistically in that debate.  Opposition Members have used a cloak of unsubstantiated claims and criticisms to hide a paucity of ideas for dealing with the current crisis.  They are the living, breathing, walking examples of empty vessels making the most noise.  They shy away from telling the public that extremely difficult and sometimes unpalatable decisions must be taken in responding to this crisis.  They are not being honest with the public.  They do not tell people we cannot maintain spending at current levels and that we must fund new revenue streams.

If we meet these three objectives, the economy will recover.  Each is an enormous task in itself involving some of the most difficult decisions any Government in the State has faced.  If we do not face that challenge, if we do not make those choices, I shudder at what this country faces.Regarding the Government's efforts in these areas, the IMF has stated:The [Irish] authorities have responded in the right manner, on the two aspects that matter the most: the financial sector and fiscal consolidation.  The essential policy framework within which the authorities are operating is the right one.The IMF also stated:There are many challenges to bringing back Irish competitiveness to a level that allows for solid and sustained growth, but the potential to do so is clearly there and the authorities are moving the economy in a direction where that potential should once again become achievable.Lest there be any doubt about the IMF's views on the measures the Government is taking to resolve our economic and financial crisis, last week's IMF report states:The Irish authorities have moved with resolve to counter the severe economic and financial shocks.  That resolve will need to be maintained.The IMF's press release observes:The IMF report commended the scale and speed of the authorities' response so far, while noting that these efforts will need to be sustained over an extended period of time.As the report states, the Government has recognised the vulnerabilities of the Irish economy to the unprecedented global financial events of the past 12 months.  We have acted to contain the damage.  We have introduced initiatives to repair the financial and fiscal systems.  These measures will take time and determination to work.  We must find a pragmatic, practical and workable balance in our policy decisions in the current crisis.  Ireland must restore a functioning financial sector.  It is a critical infrastructure which ensures businesses have access to cash and credit, but these measures undoubtedly add to the fiscal burden facing the country.  It is a classic cheap shot for Members of the Opposition to claim the Government is bailing out cronies in the banks.

It is our bounden duty to put such a system back on track, painful as it may be.At the same time, we must reduce the fiscal deficit in a way that is balanced and which protects the most vulnerable.  This year we will borrow in the region of €20 billion to plug the gap between spending and revenue.  That is unsustainable.  Some 11% of tax revenues are going towards payment of the national debt.  This debt is low when compared with our European neighbours but will grow dramatically if we do not take action now.  We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes made in the 1980s when Governments of all hues buried their heads and failed to tackle budget deficits.  The story of the 1980s was this failure to take timely action, and it cost an entire generation of Irish people dearly.  We had the worst of all worlds, with huge debt, one in five unemployed and emigration not seen since the slump of the 1950s.The Government has set out a multi-annual programme of expenditure reductions and taxation measures of €4 billion next year and another €4 billion the following year.  As I said, the unpalatable truth is that restoring our public finances will be very painful.  Between now and December's budget we must decide how exactly we can reduce spending.  There must be an honest and realistic debate on this point.  We must also have a debate on where the additional revenues will be found to meet our budgetary targets.  Again, tough choices are required and a realistic and honest debate is essential.As the report highlights, tough new measures are needed in terms of regulation for the banking sector, and the report commends the Government on the actions taken to date.  The IMF executive board supports the authorities' efforts to restructure the financial sector, including the decision to establish the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  While it states that nationalisation may be required, it does not advocate this as a solution.  To clarify, the Government has never ruled out nationalisation of banks but has consistently said this is an option it would rather avoid.  The IMF report clearly contradicts the erroneous and misleading claims by the Opposition that somehow NAMA and recapitalisation represent a bailout of builders and bankers.  That is not the case and both sectors will pay dearly for these measures.

Fine Gael has proposed something that is nothing short of a magic bank.  Its proposal is straight out of a Harry Potter novel where alchemy works and one can create gold out of base metal.

In Fine Gael's magic goblin bank, one can default on bonds without any damage to the country's financial reputation.  There is only one description of Fine Gael's policy; it is a fairy tale.The third essential component of economic recovery is to restore our competitiveness.  One element of that will be the reform of the public sector.  We must make that sector, the payroll of which accounts for one fifth of Government expenditure, work better.  Several imaginative schemes currently being put in place will reduce overall numbers in the public service.  However, we must move beyond that and allow those working in the public service to contribute to the fullest of their ability.We still have one of the most educated, adaptable and skilled workforces in the developed world.  We still have strong export-orientated industries.  To restore competitiveness, a green approach is absolutely necessary.  The drive to deliver the green economy must continue.  As the world moves towards a global deal on climate change and as oil supplies begin to peak, we must become more energy efficient and find alternatives to fossil fuels.  Already green policies in energy and the environment are bearing fruit.  Half of the jobs announced in the first six months of this year were in the green technology sector.  We have established an action group on the green economy which will report in the autumn.  We are driving forward with our energy policies to replace fossil fuel with renewable energy sources and to create jobs at the same time.  We are reforming our planning system to ensure the horrifically destructive overzonings of the past do not recur.

We have established several successful schemes which will retrofit insulation to many of the buildings constructed in recent years.  The net effect of all this will be a reduction in the billions of euro being spent on imported gas and oil each year.  We will reform the offshore planning system to facilitate renewable energy projects.  We are continuing to invest in critical infrastructure such as water to ensure the facilities are in place to promote job creation and to attract investment.The Green Party did not cause the problems which brought about the current economic crisis in Ireland.  We have, however, some of the solutions that will lead us out of this recession.  Unlike the main Opposition parties we have never advocated the boom-bust policies which contributed to the problems with which we are now grappling.  We did not advocate stamp duty or mortgage interest breaks like Fine Gael and we did not call for unsustainable wage hikes like the Labour Party.  We are not like Fine Gael and Labour, who prevaricated on the expenditure cuts in the 1980s and delayed our economic recovery by up to half a decade.

Ireland's economic remedies will involve pain for the public and whichever group is in power.  Public calls for an election from the benches opposite — which take on a much different tone in private — are a cynical distraction from the important work at hand.We in the Green Party do not put sectoral interests ahead of our citizens.  While in Opposition we espoused a new way of investment in green jobs and infrastructure and reform of the banking and regulatory system in order to maintain and improve our competitiveness.  Now we are in Government and implementing them.The road to recovery is a long one but the real measures we are now taking will lead to a cleaner, greener Ireland and a recovery that will benefit every man, woman and child in this country.  This IMF report recognises that the Government is taking the necessary action to extricate Ireland from its economic difficulties.  It is an independent assessment by a reputable international body.  Let us note that assessment and accept it but we should get on with the business the Irish people elected us to do.

It is profoundly depressing to see a person of undoubted talent settle for so little in that he would come in here at a time when the country is in the deepest crisis it has ever seen and peddle Fianna Fáil soundbites, caricatures and banal political sparring.  That is all the Minister's speech amounted to.  There was not a single attempt to come up with a new idea or to show that the Greens have views of their own on public finances, job creation or the reforming of public services.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20564	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	239	I was listening and heard all the old claptrap I am used to hearing from Fianna Fáil, only now it has come from a Minister who, until quite recently, saw himself as a champion of parliamentary debate and the importance of parliamentary exchange.  He advocated the treating of one another with some respect.  That has been swept aside because he is suddenly behind the desk and, like many before him, he sees nothing but good in what the Government does.If the Minister is that blinkered, this country has a very poor future.  The Taoiseach is also blinkered and he spent his entire contribution defending the indefensible and regurgitating what we have already heard a thousand times.  These reports are serious; they are not the same old same old.  This debate is not a sparring game between the Government and the Opposition; it concerns a major crisis that could ruin the future of ourselves, our children and many generations to come.  We should treat it with more seriousness than that given to it by any member of the Government which has spoken.  I believe in parliamentary democracy and in making this House a real force for changing what needs to be changed, the way we spend public money, the way we treat people who have become unemployed and the way we set a vision for ourselves.  Instead, we have come in to hear this claptrap, which is disturbing.People outside are scared and bewildered as every working day since the start of the year they have seen 1,000 jobs lost.  The Minister should think about how many times we could fill Croke Park with the jobs lost this year alone.  It could be filled one and a half times.  The Minister is presiding over this but he still came in here to treat us to nonsense in his speech.  Our credit rating has been downgraded and we have a deficit at profoundly disturbing levels.  We should get real as it is way past the time for pretending — as the Minister and Taoiseach have done — that Ireland was following sound and sustainable policies only for this international tsunami to sweep that aside.  That is not the reality and the Government must wake up to our current problems.I did not want to go back over what the IMF has stated but, having heard the Taoiseach, it is difficult not to.  The IMF indicated that in his 2007 budget, the current Taoiseach created a structural deficit of 3% and another 3.8% on top of that in his 2008 budget.  In two budgets alone, he doubled the domestic structural problem, with which this country is now lumbered.  The people losing their jobs are doing so in no small part because of those two budgets, and the Taoiseach must face up to that.A culture has grown up behind that process and the Minister, Deputy Gormley, has quickly forgotten that, as he sinks into that same culture.  It is almost as if the Minister was always used to it.  This country destroyed our strength in our ability to compete abroad.  We were alert and nimble but a culture developed where not alone was there a refusal to contain the property bubble but there was an irresponsible attitude to public finances.  This led to the notion that when a problem came along, it was bought out rather than confronted or changed.  When public service reform was there to be grappled with and benchmarking emerged as a tool to make changes, it was flunked.We have the legacy of some appalling decisions that have profoundly damaged our public service.  Decentralisation did this and there was a hollowing of the capability of our public service as quango after quango was created that was unaccountable to this House.  That damaged or destroyed the moral fibre and quality of the public service.If we want to change the Ireland now in crisis, we must change the attitudes that created it.  The belief that decentralisation was a master political stroke and should be defended to the hilt is an example of the thinking which has destroyed this country.  We should wise up to that because if we do not understand the problems which put us in the hole we are in, we will not be able to confront those problems or work our way out of them.I sometimes despair in this House that we cannot have a serious debate on the enormous issues that confront us.  The IMF has put such matters before us.  To take the banking crisis as an example, to listen to the contributions from the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy John Gormley, one would imagine that the IMF has stated that NAMA is a wonderful idea, the Government is on the right track and it should go for it.  The IMF's report indicated anything but that.  Although it stated that dealing with toxic debt in the banks is vital if we are to deal with the problem, it raised significant caveats not even mentioned in the earlier contributions.  The Minister dwelt on a caricature of Fine Gael and Labour proposals but did not defend the Government's proposals.For example, how is the Government dealing with the IMF's contention that we should not confine this to development loans?  How is it dealing with the IMF's contention that we should not take in well-performing loans or that the taxpayer is not getting any upside benefit from the way this is unfolding?  How is it dealing with the contention that with €35 billion of losses by 2010 and our banks effectively below the water by that stage, temporary nationalisation would be a more effective way to manage the model in question?  That did not deserve a sentence in the Minister's contribution.In addressing our problems we are putting €90 billion of debt — we do not know how much will be paid for it — along with empty houses and undeveloped sites on the shoulders of taxpayers.  We are putting €4 billion into a bank that cannot and will not lend a cent.  We are pretending the IMF did not say that Ireland needs some type of administration for winding up banks.Why were these issues not addressed by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, in their contributions?  NAMA is not a joke in which Government members peddle platitudes and then think their job is done.  This is a serious business and we deserve more engagement on the IMF's analysis.We are undergoing a profound economic crisis.  We have already seen the wipeout of 20% of the value of our output.  As a community, we can choose how we respond.  We can continue our current approach so that 20% of people will lose 100% of their income and those who have to leave our shores on emigrant boats or sit on the dole will pay.  Alternatively, we can start to address the profound problems that have arisen in our political and budgeting systems, job creation and competitiveness.  These should have been the subjects of this debate.  I would have liked the Taoiseach to acknowledge that competitiveness is a huge problem.  He could have set out a plan for electricity, telecommunications and transport costs.  He could have identified sectors which the Government would vigorously promote.  He did not utter a word on these issues, however.It is difficult to believe that when the Taoiseach first took office he described the Lemass era as his lodestar.  Let us recall that Whitaker and Lemass began by acknowledging failed policies.  They had the courage to get rid of these failed policies, unlike this Government, which continues to pretend there are no problems.  Lemass and Whitaker were prepared to confront orthodoxies and powerful interests which prevented change.  However, a cosiness has since developed among powerful interests in our banking system, the commercial world and trade unions which is preventing the Government from confronting the crisis.  The exchanges between Whitaker, Lemass and other Ministers reveal vibrancy and a willingness to seek change.  Lemass had the ambition for creating full employment and he was tireless in addressing obstacles.  He was prepared to grab opportunities and to drive change.  I see no such appetite on the part of this Government.  If we want to get out of this hole, we will have to see a restoration of that political appetite.As parliamentarians, we fail in that challenge when we continue to fight the sort of sham battles we have gotten from the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Gormley.  We fail when we persist with the budget presentations that have been made year after year.  Will we have a different style of budget this year whereby proposals are brought to the House early enough to allow us to tease out the alternatives in a genuine exchange of opinions or will we revert to traditional sham debates until everything is pulled from the hat on budget day?  Will the Government again point the finger at the Opposition and ask it where it would make cuts or raise taxes?  We could sit down together to use democracy as a means of finding the best options, even if none is attractive.  Instead, the Government continues to pretend the Opposition is living in cloud cuckoo land and does not understand the need to make tough decisions.  We want grown up political engagement on how we will confront problems such as the jobs crisis.  It is not enough to present a budgetary strategy that jacks up taxes and slashes capital spending while pretending we can maintain an economy that supports employment.  Part of the reason jobs are being lost is a budget which does not offer a single idea on confronting the jobs crisis.The Opposition parties have offered solutions even if the Government may not like them.  In my party's case, we proposed the NewERA strategy for using private equity from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which the Government appears to be determined to put into failing banks, and pension funds to develop a smart electricity system, a decent broadband and telecommunications network and high quality water systems.  If we are to get out of this problem, we need to develop our infrastructure without relying on public borrowing.  However, the Government has merely scoffed at Fine Gael's idea.  If it truly wants to develop a green economy, why will it not engage with us on ensuring competitive delivery of key infrastructure?I do not hold a particular torch for ICTU or any other social partner but at least the former tabled a genuine strategy for confronting the jobs crisis.  Every working day, 1,000 jobs are lost but the Government has no idea what to do about it.  Its smart economy document contained approximately 560 vague proposals crammed together by a big bulldog clip and flung at the media a few days before Christmas.  Now we hear of a strategy committee which will not have its own dedicated budget and will be led by the same person who acts as secretary to the Cabinet, Secretary General at the Department of the Taoiseach and secretary to the social partnership.  How can one believe such a strategy can be driven by someone with four jobs?  The Taoiseach failed to set out any milestones or timelines for the so-called smart economy.  If he were serious about his strategy, he would explain to us how he plans to make people responsible for delivering it.  Whitaker and Lemass would have driven such a strategy as their Government's first priority because they would have realised the need to address the crisis.I am depressed when I look at the sectors which offer huge opportunities, including the public service and the budgeting system.  We will have to deal with the same budgetary system this year, after slash and burn from our friend, Colm McCarthy.  When will we see the change that devolves powers to managers so they are paid for using resources responsibly?  At present, we see a ridiculous budget situation in Crumlin children's hospital, which is closing wards and theatres while preserving its full complement of staff.  According to this model, the perfect hospital treats no patients.  Fianna Fáil has not put a shred of effort into reforming the budgetary system since it came to power.We have to start thinking radically.  We are facing a bill of €20 billion for welfare payments which require recipients to remain idle when we should be empowering them to develop their talents through placement opportunities in not-for-profit organisations.  We have to think outside the box about this, and a job subsidy is not the answer.  As regards the notion of coming along with a job subsidy for 1.5% of the workforce, giving them 30% of the wage bill, how will that 1.5% be selected?  Will they consist of jobs that have taken no wage cuts or work practice changes and have got into difficulties for that reason?  Will we end up with 100 people queuing to get a job subsidy that will be available to only 1.5% of them?  That is what the Minister is saying but we need genuine thinking about what will work to protect and create jobs.  The Minister should have a debate on that issue alone, with Government and Opposition ideas being tabled.  Let us have an honest debate on that.  That is the sort of parliamentary response ordinary people outside this House expect to be happening here today.  They would be profoundly depressed to come here and see what is going on.We have a very short window of opportunity to build a strategic plan to confront our multiple problems together in a way that is prudent, well thought out and commands the confidence of both sides of this House.  Unless the Government is willing to find a vehicle for that sort of exchange, we will miss a really important moment.  We will continue to slide with unemployment mounting and huge social problems that will be with us for a generation to come.  This is a vital moment and we need to start to think about the changes we need to make as a community.  It is an issue that concerns the total transformation of Government and the way in which we make decisions.  When the Minister, Deputy Gormley, returns to the House it should not be with these quips that have come off the Fianna Fáil word processor, but a genuine attempt to engage with the elected representatives here who have a mandate to try to save our people at a time of profound crisis.  That is what I would like to see the next time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss both the IMF report on Ireland and the recent OECD economic review.  The OECD report was released in advance of the annual OECD ministerial council which I attended in Paris last week.  It was important to participate in that exchange of views with ministerial colleagues from 30 developed countries and countries where we are building good economic relations such as India, Brazil, China and Russia.The global economy is experiencing its biggest contraction since the Second World War.  It is clear, both from the debate at the Ministerial Council and from the analysis done by the OECD, that almost all states are undergoing considerable economic hardships in a year where world trade could shrink by up to 16%.Our economic situation, while urgent and grave, is not unique.  As we are integrated into global trade and production networks, our recovery will be intrinsically linked to a recovery in global trading.  Although the OECD suggested that a global recovery might be "weak and fragile", the council focused its discussions on those policy areas that could accelerate recovery.  I was pleased to note that the OECD shared our emphasis on innovation and the importance of green growth for the next phase of economic growth.  There was a consensus around the three dimensions of recovery where government action is needed.  Correcting unbalanced growth and major failures in the financial system is the first of these.  Recognition of a collective approach to a cleaner and greener economy is the second, while the social and human dimension of the crisis is the third critical factor in our recovery plan.With specific reference to Ireland, the OECD states that the economic turnaround is likely to begin in 2010.  It further notes that exports will pick up as the world economy recovers and costs are declining.  While this is encouraging, we fully recognise that we need to take a number of steps to take advantage of the global recovery.  The IMF has acknowledged that we have moved "with resolve" to counter the economic and financial shocks.  We will continue to act with resolve in our pathway to recovery.I want to take this opportunity to outline the steps we have taken, and propose to take, to make our economy stronger, greener and fairer.  I will focus first on cost competitiveness, an issue that was raised by the previous speaker.  The IMF also stated in its report that Ireland needs a sustained decline in wages to restore competitiveness.  The need for cost competitiveness is now more pressing than ever.  Unfavourable exchange rates — particularly with two of our main trading partners, Britain and the United States — add further urgency to the need to lower costs.  As an adjustment through exchange rate depreciation is not an option, downward pressure on real wages and costs must be the main driver of cost competitiveness and future growth.  This is an adjustment that is needed by the economy to bring our costs into line with those of our competitors.   There is plenty of evidence that this adjustment is taking place.Our immediate policy objective is to restore competitiveness and in particular cost competitiveness.  Restoring our cost competitiveness is a key action set out in the framework for economic renewal.  We are aware that strong domestic demand in recent years led to significant increases in the cost of doing business in Ireland.  However, the economy is now undergoing a radical adjustment which is incorporating the necessary changes required to restore external competitiveness.  As part of this process there are a number of factors which can influence our cost base.First, the decline in Irish inflation reached minus 4.7% in the year to May 2009, which is the sharpest fall since 1933.  Inflation fell significantly across most goods and services groups in 2009.  Input costs for manufacturing and services industries have seen months of consecutive decline.  The OECD has predicted mild deflation in Ireland for the next two years.  This will maintain the current downward pressure on wages and prices.  While the eurozone is also experiencing deflation, estimated to be the lowest for the region since 1953, the IMF believes that Irish prices should continue to decline at a pace greater than the rest of the eurozone.  This in itself will help to restore our competitiveness.Second, the Government has stepped in to exert downward pressure on prices and costs.  Although it has been a painful adjustment, the reduction in unit labour costs delivered through public pay reform will strengthen our longer-term competitiveness.  For most exporting firms, labour costs account for more than half their input costs.  While Irish wage levels are moderate compared to other high-income economies, wage inflation in Ireland has been running at up to 50% higher than the eurozone average during the 2005-08 period.  More recently, nominal wage growth has slowed and is likely to fall this year.  The EU estimates that Irish unit labour costs will fall by 4% this year, compared with a 3% increase in the EU on average, translating into a significant improvement in competitiveness.Third, in line with the commitment in the programme for economic renewal, we will implement the recommendations of the Competition Authority and tackle excessive costs in the non-traded sectors where they can best contribute to overall competitiveness.  The IMF acknowledged the importance of Irish labour market flexibility in helping our competitiveness adjustment.  It also suggested that competition policy should be used to support the process of price and wage adjustments.Competition policy in a small open economy is relevant for all sectors of the economy but particularly the services and non-traded sector, since it is the non-traded sector that determines Ireland's cost competitiveness.  Fostering efficient and innovative enterprises through pro-competitive market structures will better enable Ireland to weather the current economic storm and enhance growth prospects in the medium to long term.The Competition Authority, as the agency responsible for enforcing competition law in Ireland, has tended to focus its efforts, especially its advocacy efforts, on the non-traded sectors of the economy.  The authority has issued a number of reports in the past few years on non-traded sectors, including the areas of banking, utilities and professional services, such as engineers, architects, the legal profession, dentists and others.  The Government has already agreed to accelerate consideration of the Competition Authority report's recommendations to see where they can best contribute to greater cost competitiveness.  We are determined to remove competitiveness bottlenecks in the economy to deliver better value and more innovation.It is my intention to submit a report to Government before the end of the year outlining the progress achieved on the implementation of these prioritised recommendations.  Across Government there is already a concerted approach to eliminate structural rigidities and competition bottlenecks that have contributed to high costs.  This week the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform acted to ban upward-only rent reviews.  The Minister for Health and Children is taking action to drive down health costs.  These are further examples of the cross-Government effort.Fourth, we are working to control costs in administered sectors of the economy, such as local authority charges, as well as easing the administrative burden that regulations can create.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I have met with the county managers about actions that local authorities can take to ease cost pressures on businesses, and we plan to meet with them again shortly.I do not disagree with Deputies opposite that energy costs represent one of the key issues to be managed.  The trend of energy prices has been downward, with a 10% drop in electricity prices for residents and small and medium enterprises from 1 May, while gas prices have reduced by an average of 12%.  These reductions will result in a further easing of cost pressures for businesses.  Recent data from Eurostat demonstrated that energy taxes in Ireland as a proportion of total taxes are the third lowest in the EU, and that we have the lowest energy taxes as a percentage of GDP.  This means the Government is already playing an important part in keeping down prices.  In recent months, the trend of energy prices has been downward.  In response to this trend, ComReg has lowered electricity prices for residential customers and small and medium enterprises by 10% from 1 May.  The energy regulator reduced gas prices by an average of 12%.  According to the latest published Eurostat comparisons, smaller SMEs are paying 1% below the average EU 27 price, and approximately 60% of the ESB's SME customers are in this category.   We are also seeing greater competition among electricity suppliers, which is helping to drive down costs for SMEs.It is my view that we must never again allow costs to drift out of line with those of our competitors.  We have learned a harsh lesson, but as a Government we have acted with resolve and will continue to take the necessary actions to restore our external competitiveness.A leaner, trimmer but stronger economy is critically dependent on active entrepreneurship with access to finance.  Ireland has one of the highest levels of entrepreneurship in the EU.  To help firms in the current downturn, the Minister for Finance and I recently established the credit supply clearing group to examine where the flow of credit to viable businesses appears to be blocked, and to develop solutions that enable adequate business credit flow.  The Minister of State with responsibility for trade and commerce, Deputy Billy Kelleher, is holding a series of regional meetings around the country to assess the factors affecting access to bank credit at local and regional level.  These meetings allow the Government to hear at first hand the views and experiences of local business representative groups, local bank representatives and State agencies on access to bank lending.  This will complement the work of the credit supply clearing group and will feed into future Government policies on the issue.The IMF rightly highlighted the increasingly difficult environment for foreign direct investment for all countries.  The recent Ernst & Young country attractiveness survey showed inward investment was largely flat in 2008.  However, the same report highlighted that Ireland experienced a significant increase, from 80 to 108, in FDI projects in 2008 and Ireland has moved from 13th to ninth place overall in terms of attractiveness for FDI.  Furthermore, Ireland grew its share of job creation from FDI into Europe from 2% in 2007 to 4% in 2008, and grew its overall share of inward European FDI from 2% in 2007 to 3% in 2008.Foreign owned companies continue to contribute significantly to employment and exports in Ireland.  Foreign owned companies employed 152,364 persons in Ireland in 2008, according to the latest Forfás employment survey.  The strength of Irish export performance is in large part due to the resilience of the multinational sector, especially in areas such as chemicals and pharmaceuticals.Despite the economic downturn, the IDA remains guardedly optimistic of Ireland's ability to continue attracting high level FDI in 2009 and beyond.  There have been 130 foreign direct investment projects won.  New investments secured are up 14% on 2007.  The number of new companies investing in Ireland for the first time is up 16% on 2007.  More than 8,800 new jobs have been created.  There has been a 22% increase in research, development and innovation projects, while approximately €2 billion in investment has been secured.  In the current economic climate, there is enormous competition in a growing number of locations for high-quality highly mobile investment.  Ireland is no longer a prime location for what might be called low cost, low skills, basic manufacturing and service activities.  We must instead continue to facilitate and encourage current and new FDI clients to move up the value chain, into higher value added, higher skills products, functions and activities, more in tune with our competitive strengths today. Continuing to lower costs in areas such as tendering and office rents has no small part to play in maintaining Ireland as an attractive location for investment.The global business community now sees Ireland as a prime location for research, development and innovation functions. Government policies such as the strategy for science, technology and innovation have played a key role in establishing this competitive advantage for Ireland.  We will continue to target high value investments in keeping with our current strategy outlined in the recent framework document, Building Ireland's Smart Economy.  The Government and the enterprise agencies are focusing on the four essential ingredients on which investors concentrate, namely, the right people and skills, a supportive environment and infrastructure, locations of critical mass and a positive and forward-looking attitude.  This is the basis for the continued development of the economy and balanced regional development.This ongoing emphasis on research and development is demonstrated by the fact that business expenditure on research and development in Ireland rose to an estimated €1.6 billion in 2008, from €1.3 billion in 2005.  This research and development has been carried out by 13,900 employees in 1,200 enterprises.  Foreign owned companies accounted for about 70% of expenditure on research and development in 2005, and a similar proportion is likely for 2008.  Already in 2009, a number of companies have announced significant investment in research and development in Ireland with the support of IDA, including Sony, Toshiba, IBM, and Alps Electric.The IDA's main focus for FDI is on securing investment from new and existing clients in the areas of high-end manufacturing, global services and research, development and innovation.  New opportunities are also emerging in areas such as clean technology, convergence and services innovation.  I have authorised the IDA to reallocate its resources to reflect these new priorities.The OECD report referred to a collapse in world trade in the last quarter of 2008 and in the first quarter of 2009.  Furthermore, it expects double-digit declines in the exports of OECD members to linger in the second quarter of 2009.  However, Ireland has out-performed this trend to a considerable extent.  I would like to outline the positive standing of our export performance and the exceptional achievement of Irish exporters in recent years.  Page four of the IMF report ranked us second only to Belgium on imports and exports as a percentage of GDP.  A strong trading performance by Ireland is obviously crucial for our economic well-being.  Key achievements in recent times can be summarised as follows.  Between 2003 and 2007, total Irish exports increased by more than 6% per annum year-on-year.  The latest preliminary merchandise trade statistics show that for April 2009, exports rose by 6% compared with the same month last year.  Total trade over the same period showed a trade surplus for the month of just over €4 billion, the highest monthly surplus in eight years and the second highest on record.  In addition, detailed data published for the period January to March 2009 show that merchandise exports for that quarter rose by 2% on the first quarter of 2008, with a strong performance in March having counteracted the declines that occurred in January and February.  With data for the first four months of 2009 now available, our merchandise exports are running at 3% higher than the corresponding period in 2008.In recent years, net exports have made a very significant contribution to GDP growth.  The contribution of net exports was 2.7% in 2008, and it was 6.09% in the first quarter of 2009.  In both cases this made a significant contribution to counteracting the other GDP elements that were negative.  This performance is against a background of the global downturn and the adverse exchange rate between the euro and both the US dollar and the pound sterling, which increases the cost of our exports to the US and Britain.It is encouraging to note that both the range of export destinations and commodities for the first quarter of 2009 show significant increases.  In particular, exports to Switzerland rose by 53%, to Belgium by 20% and to the USA by 18%.  Our performance is especially significant when compared to our EU partners.  The latest figures released by EUROSTAT demonstrate that at -1%, Ireland has the smallest rate of decline in exports in the EU for the period January to March 2009, when compared to the same period last year.  At -14%, Denmark is the next best ranked country.  European countries with similar levels of exports showed a decrease in their merchandise exports, such as -30% in Sweden, -22% in Poland and -23% in Austria.  The United Kingdom showed a drop in its exports of -24% for the same period.  In a year when it is estimated that world trade volume will decline by 16%, we can be very proud of our export performance and the contribution it has made, and will continue to make, to our future economic performance.The factors I have outlined strengthen our economy by driving down costs, facilitating entrepreneurship, encouraging research and development and inward investment and will continue to be the key dimensions of our stronger smarter economy.The second dimension in the path to recovery is the opportunity to kick-start a shift towards greener more sustainable growth.  There is huge potential for the green economy to help Ireland meet its economic and environmental challenges.  The latest estimates put the size of the global environmental goods and services market as exceeding $700 billion by 2010.  The value of this sector for Ireland is growing and estimated to be more than €2.8 billion in 2008.  The green economy provides Ireland with a tremendous opportunity to create quality jobs in a sustainable and high growth area.The human and economic cost of this recession has been foremost in all our minds as we tailor our economy and resources to new economic realities.  I am acutely aware of the response to those who have found themselves unemployed and I have reorganised the available resources to support people who are out of work.  The future skills needs of this country will be reflected in the courses and training available.There is a need to sustain people in employment and it is on that basis the Government is working with the social partners to provide a temporary subsidy scheme.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go through it all but we will certainly not support companies which are uncompetitive and unsustainable.  Enterprise Ireland is looking at the stabilisation fund and those sectors where there will be new opportunities for growth and development.  I look forward to its completion fairly soon when companies will have an opportunity to apply for it.Despite the economic difficulties, we have opportunities, particularly export ones.  We will continue to support entrepreneurship, activation measures, new skills opportunities and sustainable, fairer and greener growth.
#GeorgeLee	unknown-#GeorgeLee-party	unknown-#GeorgeLee-dob	unknown-#GeorgeLee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	241	This IMF report on the Irish economy is a shocking mid-term report for any Government to receive.  It is deeply depressing.  There is no light and absolutely no hope in regard to its prognosis.  It states we are especially vulnerable.  It speaks about festering problems and an anaemic economy.  It states large macro-economic imbalances will have to be dealt with.  It makes clear that the budget announced only two months ago is already way off course and that the deficit is heading for 12% of GDP this year rather than the 10.75% announced by the Government in the budget.  It speaks about major risks from the interaction of the collapse in economic activity, the collapse in banking and the collapse in public finances and it fears we will get into a vicious downward spiral where they will reinforce each other.  This is very depressing.The report also states we are losing out in terms of the race for foreign direct investment, which is not at all reassuring.  It states we are in for a contraction of 13.5% of economic activity, which is the biggest economic collapse any country has ever experienced in the post-war era.  How could any Government think that is anything other than a shocking report in terms of its management?  It is not a case that all countries are contracting like that; it is just that we are and that is a function of somebody's decision.It is almost like a war of sorts, an economic war in which many people do not believe the Government cares about them.  It cares particularly to fix the banks and the public finances but all on the backs of ordinary people.I have been on the front line of that war recently.  I spoke to many people when I was going around the country trying to get elected to this House.  I heard all the stories from the front.  One woman cried when I went back to thank her for her vote because she did not believe any politician would return to speak to anybody whose issue was unemployment.  Her son had been unemployed for a year and she could not understand why the unemployed had been so left out.One man told me he gets up every morning since he became unemployed and that he goes about busying himself because he wants his family to think he is okay.  He said he is not okay and he does not know what to do.  I spoke to another man who told me he has plenty of orders for his business but there is no money.  He had 15 employees which he reduced to seven and then to three.  He spoke about his future and he does not know what to do about it.I spoke to a well-paid lawyer whose bonuses and business have gone down.  He told me his mortgage is now 20 times his salary because his wife is on maternity leave.  She does not believe she will be able to go back to work because the company for which she works is in an uncertain situation.  He said that to get out of his fixed rate mortgage, he will have to pay the bank €85,000.  He does not understand why we are helping the banks and not him.There are many stories like that from the front line — real human stories which underline the economic facts and realities in this IMF report.  They are the human side of it.  People are looking for hope but this report shows none.The IMF makes it clear the Government has been fooling us.  Where that is very clear is where it speaks about a structural deficit in the public finances.  It states our structural deficit in the public finances, which is what we would be left with if the economy returned to a growth period, would be 12.5% of economic activity for 2008 and 11% for this year.  That is a massive structural deficit.  That is the key in terms of what the IMF is saying, what is wrong and who did what in this economy.  It is the Government's fault we have a structural deficit and if the economy returns to growth, we will still have that massive problem.The bubble has burst and the mask has slipped.  What has been revealed is that we have been living in a fool's paradise.  The Government speaks a lot about this smart economy but I find it impossible to see how one can have a smart economy when it is being run by a Government which is full of economic fools in terms of where they have left us.For people trying to understand the mystery of what went wrong in this economy, what the IMF report states is helpful.  When trying to unravel any mystery, one is often told to follow the money.  I read what the report stated in regard to money to try to put my finger on what went wrong.  It is quite clear.There have been two budgets in fewer than nine months.  The scale of tax increases in those budgets has been mind-blowing.  I will remind the House of some of them.  An income levy, at rates of 1%, 2% and 3%, on all income was introduced and the rates were then doubled to 2%, 4% and 6%; the income thresholds were substantially reduced and people on the minimum wage were brought into that tax net; PRSI ceilings have been substantially raised twice; the health levy was doubled to 4% and 5% and the threshold at which it applies was raised substantially; VAT was increased by 0.5% and tax on cigarettes went up by 50 cent first and then by 25 cent.  This all happened within a couple of months.  Tax on wine went up by 50 cent per bottle, petrol tax went up by 8 cent and diesel tax went up by 5 cent.  An air travel tax of €10 was introduced, motor tax was raised and there was a tax on second homes.  There were large increases in DIRT and new taxes on life assurance policies.  Capital gains tax rates were increased twice and capital acquisitions tax rates also increased.  There was a reduction in mortgage interest relief and the ceiling for pension contributions and inheritance tax thresholds were substantially reduced.There were massive changes in the timing of corporation tax and capital gains tax which faltered the most recent public finance figures because they brought forward substantial taxes. That was all done in a couple of months.  They all add up to an enormous and aggressive change in the taxation system.One might expect that by doing that, the Government is saying it has a firm hold on matters and that it might instil confidence in terms of its economic management.  However, when one looks closely, that is not what it does; it does the exact opposite.  It underlines why we should be fearful of the Government's hold on the economy.The reality is that out of all of those enormous tax changes, the Government thought it would raise a great deal of money this year.  It was going to raise €3.75 billion in 2009.  That €3.75 billion would enable it to take in taxes of €34.4 billion.  Without those tax changes, we would be sitting with a tax receipt for the Government of €30.65 billion.  The €30.65 billion underlying taxes coming to the Government this year is 28% lower than the amount of taxes collected last year.  What is remarkable is the Government claims this 28% reduction in taxes collected is the result of a 7.75% reduction in economic activity.  Something is seriously wrong when the reduction in revenue for the Government is four times larger, in percentage terms, than the reduction in economic activity.  This is a structural problem, right at the heart of what is wrong with the Government's direction.  It did not and would not recognise this even when the IMF made it clear this was what was wrong with the economy.The Government has undermined the ability of the taxation system to fund the economy, run the public finances and sustain the economic environment.  Accordingly, one must be fearful of the Government's ability to handle this crisis.  The Government is as guilty as the banks.  The banks borrowed money short term and lent it long term.  Likewise, the Government has taken in short term taxes and built up enormous commitments in public expenditure.  We are now in a hole.The IMF stated that there are many difficulties in the Government's choices over the coming months.  It said the formidable task ahead will involve difficult policy trade-offs and tackling large imbalances.  Tough choices will have to be made on policy proposals.  The IMF has said we will have to examine universal welfare payments, cuts in social welfare payments, child benefit, more cuts in public sector pay and the minimum wage.  My difficulty is that as these decisions are so fundamental, I am concerned about the ability of the Government in making these, the Government that first got us into this mess and masterminded such a massive structural deficit.  It is outrageous the IMF report has been welcomed by the Government.  Ministers should hang their heads in shame.  It is a disgrace we are in a situation where there is no hope and no help.  God help us if the Government has to make those decisions I have outlined.  I have no trust in the Government's ability to deliver economic growth out of nothing but cutbacks.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	243	Earlier the Taoiseach stated that no one predicted what would happen globally or in Ireland.  I do not accept his hypothesis, particularly if one compares Donegal's economic experiences ten years ago to this current economic crisis.  Donegal had put it eggs into one basket, the manufacturing sector.  By 1999, those manufacturing companies based in Donegal moved to low-cost economies.  In 1999 a task force was established with an interdepartmental group set up in 2002 to cope with the resulting economic problems.Since then there has been intellectual snobbery with how democracy works.  Today the Taoiseach did not show the necessary maturity in setting the tone for a proper debate.  In the past ten years, from Donegal to Cork, from east to west, the ordinary man on the street knew the construction bubble would burst, free money cannot be given out and that all one's eggs should not go into the one basket.  What we are left with is a "mediocracy" over a democracy.In Donegal, today 20,000 people are on the live register, 5,000 of whom are in the under 25s category.  The focus must be to get these people back working.  Yesterday morning, the UK exported 1,000 MW of electricity to France, due to summer peak demand.  France will need up to 8,000 MW throughout the summer, enough to light up Paris.  Meanwhile, Ireland has 8,000 MW outside of gate 3 waiting to be connected to the national grid which could be provided to France.  It has not been connected because the interconnector between Ireland and the UK, which would open up other markets, has not been built.  The Government must focus on the challenge of the future of green energy production.Over the coming months, up to 5,000 graduates in engineering, architecture and other disciplines will come out of our colleges without jobs and with gaps on their CVs.  The skills set of these graduates and those over the next four years must be examined for various employment schemes.Ireland has unaccountable governance.  In the past two years I have had 52 parliamentary questions ruled out of order or disallowed.  In the case of the Department of Transport, questions concerning the NRA's function were specifically ruled out.  Employers in Donegal wanting to set up businesses along national secondary routes are not allowed because of NRA policy, set in stone.  When I try to hold the Department or NRA accountable, I cannot even get a response.  The public knows this type of governance is unaccountable.  Reading between the lines of the IMF report, it is obvious the real missing piece of the jigsaw is in the democratic deficit.  The Government has not been listening to the people or to common sense.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	244	This has been another bad week for employment and job seekers.  The number of people claiming unemployment benefit rose by 11,400 in June.  For those who have lost their jobs and especially for this year's second level and third level graduates, future employment prospects are bleak.  No one can have any doubt about the economic crisis.  This week, even the Taoiseach publicly accepted that the number of people out of work will pass the 500,000 mark by the end of the year.The bursting of the Bertie Ahern bubble is now in plain sight for all to see.  For many, the dangers inherent in the economic and development policies followed by the Fianna Fáil-led Government were anticipated and documented.  In a speech before the last general election I stated:Of more importance to national economic success is the indigenous sector, both manufacturing and services.  The manufacturing sector has made little progress in the past ten years with the number of jobs falling.  There is an urgent need to review the effectiveness of the incentives used in the development of the sector.  This sector must get renewed priority so that investing in productive capacity for solidly based growth becomes more rewarding than making quick profit through speculation in property.I also spoke of the urgent need to improve the long term competitive advantage.Various international experts have now passed their professional judgment on the performance of Fianna Fáil-led Governments in the past decade.  The three main international credit rating agencies have removed Ireland's top credit rating, a direct commentary on the poor leadership performance of Fianna Fáil.No matter which way one reads the IMF report, the result is the same.  The Government is directly responsible for the crisis now engulfing the country.  The economic situation is the direct result of the policies followed by the Government, particularly since 2005.When I chaired the Committee of Public Accounts, I was aware of the indicators of political incompetence in the waste of public funds, poor value for money in departmental projects which various reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General documented.  It was also clear that Fianna Fáil Ministers never wanted to hear about these problems in the Departments.  They were only interested in good news stories, with problems being swept under the carpet for others to inherit.Listening to the various Government spokespersons trying to defend its record against the criticisms of the IMF report reminds me of the spokesman for the then Iraqi government during the 2003 US-led invasion, Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf, better known as Baghdad Bob.  Every day during the invasion he denied every obvious fact about the progress of the war.  Listening to the contributions from the Government side, several Members are worthy contenders to replace him as the official spokesperson for people who cannot face reality.  That no one pointed out the danger signals is a standard part of a defensive answer.  As long ago as December 2005, Deputy Bruton called on the Government to focus on improving the competitiveness of businesses that were trying to survive in tough external markets.  Ordinary people are paying the price for the Government's decision to ignore the warnings about Ireland's competitiveness.  One important voice, that of Deputy Bruton, spoke at an early stage about the dangers emerging in the economy.  He voiced his concerns many times.  Fianna Fáil Ministers, in their obvious incompetence, missed all the error signals and warning signs.  The core point is that the present Government, which was in charge of the levers of power when the Irish economy veered off course, carries the responsibility for the management of the economy.  I ask Ministers not to try to pass the blame for the current disaster to absent messengers, who allegedly failed to communicate adequately or loudly enough with them.I reiterate that Ireland is an open exporting economy.  No sector of the economy other than the manufacturing sector can offer the volume of quality jobs that will lead to full employment in the medium term.  We must declare manufacturing to be the foundation sector of the national economy.  We also need to benchmark manufacturing costs, including labour costs, to our main European competitors.  We cannot rely on tax breaks in the future as they can be wiped out at the stroke of a pen.  All other economic sectors must be benchmarked to the manufacturing sector.  If we take these steps, we will have real hope that we can weather the current storm.  As a businessman who employs more than 40 people, I remind the House that the retail sector, which should have job creation potential, is on the floor — it has reached rock bottom.  Business tenants are paying high rents that are based on the profits of others.  Per head of population, Ireland has ten times more square feet of retail space than the UK.  It is a fallacy.  The consequences of the policy of incentivising developers to build new shopping centres in every urban area are coming home to roost.  Tenancies are being handed back by retailers who are finding it impossible to pay the high rents they are being charged per square foot.The Government also needs to assist those who are unable to make payments to the banks.  Some €4 billion has been given to Anglo Irish Bank, which is unable to lend any money.  A further €3.5 billion has been given to each of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks.  Regardless of the rhetoric we hear from the Government, business people on the ground are unable to avail of those moneys.  Rather than talking about the IMF report, the Government should be listening to business people.  They will tell the Minister about the crisis in the economy.  A well-known company in Ballymote, McDonagh's Electrical, closed last week after 60 years in business.  It was to a small town like Ballymote what Lehman Brothers was to New York.  The proprietor, who is in his 82nd year, worked in the business, with 30 employed people, every day.  That is an example of the crisis that exists.  The Government is ventilating its views on the IMF report.  I suggest it should listen to business people.  Experience and new ideas are needed.  The Government has experience of the good times, when cash was rolling in, but it does not have the ideas or experience to deal with the economy now.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The most important part of the International Monetary Fund's Article IV report is the policy recommendations included in it.  The policy recommended in the report that was published last week is entirely in agreement with the strategy the Government has adopted to put this country on the path to sustainable recovery.  The IMF stated that the Government has moved in the right direction on the two fronts that matter most — the healing of the financial sector and the correction of the budgetary situation.  In the third paragraph of the report, the IMF states that the Government "has moved with resolve to counter the severe economic and financial shocks".  The IMF believes the Government has taken the right choices.  The report states that "the basic approach and elements of the plan are appropriate".  The IMF has suggested that the reliance on tax increases in the April budgets was appropriate as "a necessary process of returning tax rates to more normal levels".  That has not been the stance of the principal Opposition party.  Our policies and strategies for dealing with this unprecedented recession have been opposed tooth and nail by the parties opposite.  Fine Gael continues to rail against any tax increases that require to be introduced.  The Labour Party and an assortment of media and academic pundits complain on a daily basis about the State guarantee scheme, which the IMF regards as essential to stabilising our banking system.

In the middle of the most serious recession this country has ever seen, I want to know why the Opposition is at odds with a reputable international organisation like the IMF.  Much of the commentary in this House has disingenuously sought to apportion blame for our present economic difficulties.  The Taoiseach has already dealt conclusively with this unwarranted commentary.  The facts are clear and incapable of misrepresentation.  The Taoiseach has been accused of introducing expansionary budgets when he was Minister for Finance.  I will set out the facts.In the 2009 staff report, the IMF estimated large structural deficits for 2007 and 2008.  In fact, those numbers were recent revisions.  The figures for 2007 and 2008, which had been included in the 2007 staff report, envisaged structural surpluses in this country.  That report envisaged a surplus of 0.7% for 2007 and, admittedly, a surplus of 0.5% for 2008.  That point is made by a respected economic commentator, Jim O'Leary, in today's The Irish Times.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	250	These estimates imply that our budgetary policy was seen as prudent at the time.  The EU Commission also estimated structural surpluses in 2007 and 2008.  In its 2007 autumn economic forecast, the Commission highlighted the downside risks relating to the external environment and the correction in the housing market.  Despite these risks, however, the Commission expected Ireland's GDP to increase by 3.5% in 2008 and to accelerate slightly to 3.75% in 2009.  The Opposition parties agreed with these forecasts.  I am not sure who is the reputable economist referred to on the Opposition benches.  In its 2007 election manifesto, Fine Gael forecast continued robust rates of economic growth until 2010.  The Labour Party projected something similar.  Policy has to be made on the basis of the information to hand at the time.  It is easy to conduct business with 20-20 hindsight.  However, this House is not an historical debating society.  It is of benefit to learn from past experiences, to move on and to talk about where we are now.  Ireland faces the three critical interconnected challenges of restoring the public finances to health, renewing the economy and employment through restoring competitiveness and stabilising the banking system.  These are not discretionary items.  It would be a serious challenge to address any one of them on its own.  All three must be dealt with together by the Government and this House.Since last July, I have introduced fiscal adjustments totalling €8.3 billion, or 4.5% of gross domestic product.  No other finance minister in Europe has introduced adjustments of this scale voluntarily.  These actions were necessary because our economy cannot recover until the public finances are put on a sustainable footing.  The actions in question have generated international confidence in this country.  Deputy Perry referred a moment ago to the rating agencies.  The recent report of the Moody's agency, in the context of its downgrade, specifically commended the actions being taken by the Government as the correct actions for Ireland.  That is a terrible commentary on what we have heard from the Opposition benches during the past four budgetary adjustments.  The hail of criticism and torrent of abuse we received on those occasions were not accompanied by constructive alternatives.  The international commentators looking at Ireland believe the Government is taking the steps that are right for this country.  That is what we are being told overseas.The IMF has commended the Government on its actions to consolidate the fiscal position.  It has emphasised that these efforts need to be sustained.  My Government colleagues and I agree with that commentary.  As I have said many times, our focus must be on reducing expenditure rather than on increasing total taxation.  The conclusions of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes will make an important contribution to the debate and must inform the preparation of the 2010 budget.  The special group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Colm McCarthy, is finalising its report.  I will have it at hand next week.  Under its terms of reference, the group has reviewed the scope for reducing and refocusing the existing range of expenditure programmes.  The nature of the current economic challenges means that no area of expenditure has been excluded from this process.  In carrying out its work, the group has critically examined the numbers of public servants employed across all areas of the public service.  It has assessed the scope for transferring staff to priority areas, reducing overall numbers and identifying surplus staff.  The group has examined the overall efficiency of the public service, including ways of doing business that are out of step with the needs of a modern, responsive public service.  I expect it to make recommendations for further rationalisation of State agencies beyond those announced in budget 2009.  The report pulls no punches and will leave nowhere to hide for an Opposition that is more interested in playing politics with our current difficulties than coming up with worthwhile solutions.Another key priority identified by the IMF in addressing our current economic difficulties and in restoring the health of our economy is to stabilise the financial sector.

We shall give the necessary lead and if the Opposition does not want to join us in this, that is its business.  The simple fact is that the Labour Party opposed the bank guarantee scheme, while the IMF report supported the scheme.  The IMF support the scheme because it knows that it was a necessary measure to ensure that the banks had sufficient liquidity to operate on a day to day basis.  It knows that if this action had not been taken at that time, the whole banking system would have failed.  I want to quote something as regards banks, specifically for those in the Labour Party who criticise many of the actions we have taken:There are some who argue that the government should stand back and simply let these banks fail, especially since in many cases it was their bad decisions that helped create the crisis in the first place.  But whether we like it or not, history has shown repeatedly that when nations do not take early and aggressive action to get credit flowing again, they have crises that last years and years instead of months and months — years of low growth, years of low job creation, years of low investment, all of which cost these nations far more than a course of bold, upfront action.These are not my words.  They are the words of President Obama speaking at Georgetown University in April.  The banking system is at the core of a functioning economy and needs to be maintained in the interests of the economy and society at large.  Again, Opposition parties opposed the establishment of NAMA.

As long as this matter is not addressed, the banks will not be able to play their part in the restoration of economic growth.The IMF indicates that, along with ECB facilities, the bank guarantee has helped the banks obtain market funding and stabilise the banking system.  It notes the Government is willing to provide additional capital, subject to EU approval and an appropriate return to important banks.  I was glad to see that the directors of the IMF registered their support for the Government's proposals to restructure the financial sector and the decision to establish NAMA.  The IMF commended the speed and scale of the initiatives taken by the Government to counter the severe shock to the financial system.The IMF report notes that the estimates of the losses faced by the banks vary and it also provides its own estimate.  It is important to emphasise, because Members might be tempted to repeat these estimates in an uncritical way outside this House, that the estimate is based on projected losses before provision is made for them from the banks' resources.  That is a crucial point. The figure given by the IMF is a pre-provision figure in relation to estimated losses for the banks.  It is not a figure which outlines the possible liabilities for the taxpayer, who has to shore up the banks pending their working out their affairs over time.The IMF has also made it clear that this estimate was not based on a detailed accounting assessment of the banks, but rather on the wide range of estimates already in the public domain and arising from a top-down review.  It is just an estimate and one to which we shall give very serious attention and take very much into account, but it is an estimate.The reality is that the only reliable way to produce estimates is to use a detailed, bottom-up, loan-by-loan approach.

Until that exercise is complete, figures for anticipated losses are mere speculation.I have heard some members of the Opposition claim that the IMF said that the losses facing the banks could be made smaller if the Government adopted alternative policies.  The IMF did not say that.  The losses facing the banks arise from past lending decisions.  Our objective is to ensure that the banks absorb these losses without bringing down the whole banking system.  I have heard some members of the Opposition claim that the IMF said that the losses facing the banks will all end up being borne by the taxpayer.  In fact, Deputy Gilmore repeated that claim earlier in this debate.  Deputy Gilmore needs to read the report.  The IMF did not say that.  Banks' profits and accumulated capital will be first and foremost there to absorb losses.  Rightly, providers of risk capital to the banks, including owners of equity capital and subordinated debt, will have to absorb these losses.  The Government is determined to protect the taxpayer as much as possible from losses associated with the property bust.

The establishment of NAMA has been a key priority for Government and preparations for its establishment continue apace.  A number of expert advisers were appointed to advise the interim managing director and Government in the drafting of the NAMA legislation — as well as the practical preparations for the operation of NAMA.

In this House in May a Labour Party Private Members' Bill called for the pre-emptive nationalisation of all the institutions covered by the bank guarantee scheme.  Now it seems that Deputy Gilmore wants only the two largest banks to be nationalised.  Let us be clear, the IMF does not support the pre-emptive, wholesale nationalisation of the State guaranteed banks as an alternative to an asset management agency approach.  What the IMF said, and I agree, is that the State should be prepared to take larger ownership stakes in the banks, if necessary, and even full ownership in certain circumstances.

Let us be clear about this.  I have always made it clear that if any further capital injections are required from the State for either of the two main banks, they will take the form of equity capital which will increase State ownership of these two banks.  Clearly, the more equity injected the greater the share of the banks the State will own.  However, I am not prepared to take full ownership of the entire system immediately as an alternative to NAMA.  That is what was advocated by the various professors who signed the article in The Irish Times.  I am not prepared to do that.  I am waiting for the NAMA valuation exercise to be complete and I will look at the results to consider what an appropriate restructuring of our banking will involve.

I have always accepted that intellectually it is a case that can be made.

However, as regards the Fine Gael "magic bank", that is ignored.  It is a sin of omission in the IMF report and not even considered.  It is the stuff of Neverland. A sum of €2 billion from the taxpayer will not generate €40 billion from the European Central Bank.  That is the core issue.  The money is not available.  Fine Gael should own up and be honest about this, and not use this bank as a fig leaf to obscure the fact that it has no policy.

It is also clear that the actions taken to date have supported the financial system and provided an international demonstration of the commitment of this Government to sustain our financial system.  The third and most important challenge is to restore economic growth and competitiveness.  In the midst of this very deep recession it is essential that economic activity be restored to the type of activity we saw in the past.Earlier this week, the Central Statistics Office published data for the first quarter of this year which envisage an annual GDP decline of 8.5%.  This was a very sharp fall but broadly in line with our limited expectations.  Most of the economic data relating to developments in the second quarter suggest that the rate of deterioration may have slowed.  That does not mean we are out of the woods.  Economic activity is clearly still falling but not at the same pace as in the first quarter.Bearing in mind that economic forecasting is not an exact science, my Department's assessment of a drop in GDP of more than 13% over the 2008 to 2010 period is broadly similar to the IMF's recent forecast.  Moving beyond economic forecasting, one aspect of both the OECD and IMF analysis with which I strongly agree, is the need to improve our international cost competitiveness.  While there is much to be done in that regard, there is considerable evidence that the economy has adjusted rapidly to the changed environment.Wage costs have fallen in most sectors.  Regardless of what some may say, the public sector is no different in this regard.  This flexibility of our labour market was acknowledged in the IMF report, and is clearly a positive feature in which all of us can take pride and which will stand to us in the future.  While nobody likes to have his or her wages reduced, most Irish people — including those of us in Government — recognise and accept that the world does not owe us a living.  We have a firm determination and a clear strategy to restore the nation's finances and put our economy on the path to recovery.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The IMF report forecasts that the Irish economy will contract by 13% in three years.  This is the worse economic performance I know of in the world. Unemployment has doubled in not much more than a year and is expected to rise by the same amount again in the next two years.  We know the horrifying figures.  Some 420,000 people are out of work.  Many small business people and their families have been devastated, not just in the building and construction sector but across the economy and society.  The extent of human misery the Government is creating in our country is almost unimaginable in its breadth.Only the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance would have the brass necks to maintain that a report highlighting an economic collapse of 13% and mass unemployment and bankruptcy represents some type of vindication of their economic stewardship of the country.  It is depressingly obvious that this Government duo did not learn much about economics or business during their professional training but they obviously learnt something about putting forward the best argument for their clients no matter how hopeless the case.It is difficult and depressing to fully appreciate just how catastrophic the economic collapse really is.  The Minister is an optimist by nature, but an assessment of the pit into which Fianna Fáil has brought the economy and the country must be done.  If we do not fully get to grips with the nature and scale of the problem, it will be impossible to devise the best solutions and implement them.  I cannot find any instance of an economic collapse of equivalent magnitude in Ireland in the past hundred years, not even when we were suffering from the worst of Éamon de Valera's policies of economic autarky.This Fianna Fáil-led Government has brought about the worst collapse in the Irish economy since the famine.  The IMF report said this country would suffer the worst collapse and stress of an economic downturn of any developed economy since the Second World War.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	300	In December 2006 when the Taoiseach announced the 2007 election budget as Minister for Finance, I warned that it was simply an election budget and that the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, was being generous with the people's money.  The Taoiseach won the election but the people have paid an extraordinarily high price.  If the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and Fianna Fáil have their way, they will pay an astronomically high price to support the banks in such a way that is protective of property developers and speculators.The public should be aware that all the international institution reports on the Irish economy — the IMF, OECD and EU — are negotiated by officials from the Deportment of Finance before they are published.  This is important.  That is why there are differences between the IMF staff report and the general executive report.  The general executive report is in part a diplomatic document with our representative from the Department of Finance who works with and sits in the IMF being part of the negotiation of the language, verdicts and proposals.  It involves not just the writing of a report by the IMF staff group but negotiation and consideration with players in Ireland of whom the Government and Department of Finance are the key and critical players.Therefore, the normal style of these reports is that they are supportive of any Government's policies and positive about anything they see as potentially hopeful.  Let us not, therefore, get carried away, as the Minister has been, where he perceives some kind of positive mark in the IMF report.  Criticisms and arguments for policy changes are usually discussed in private and agreement is sought in private.  The published texts have to be analysed in detail to find any carefully veiled criticisms of the Government.  What is surprising about the 2009 IMF report is that some of the criticisms and policy disagreements are so obvious, up front and out there, particularly in the staff report, the back part of the report.I want to talk about what the IMF previously said to Fianna Fáil and whether Fianna Fáil listened.  Some five years ago, in 2004, the IMF report on Ireland stated, "Rapidly rising property prices in the face of slow growth have been a feature in many countries recently, but the extent, scale and duration of the boom in Ireland set it apart."  The report also stated, "The question remains whether the house price increases to date have outstripped developments in fundamentals."  The IMF staff appraisal in 2004, which is more independent than the summary report, went on to state, "At this conjuncture, public policy should aim to engineer a soft landing in the housing market but over the medium term reforms will need to improve the stability of the sector."So much for a soft landing.  The Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance would not eliminate the tax breaks on property that benefited the rich and property speculators — the Fianna Fáil supporters in particular — despite the constant urging of the Labour Party and despite the IMF report and the reports of other entities.  In 2005 the IMF warned:However, staff analysis suggests that not all of the increase in house prices over the past several years can be attributed to fundamentals and that the estimated house price overvaluation in Ireland is relatively large compared to other countries . . . Staff suggested that, given Ireland's cyclically advanced position and accommodative euro area monetary policy, fiscal tightening would be desirable...Banking system profitability and capitalization are strong, but vulnerabilities existThe Department of Finance should have known that when the interests of the country and Fianna Fáil winning an election conflict, Fianna Fáil will always go after power regardless of the cost to the country.  It has the slogan "we'll sort out the difficulties afterwards."  That is what so many hundreds of thousands of Irish people will need to carry on their backs for the next ten years.  There has been no better man than the current Taoiseach and then Minister for Finance to do that.  He proved he could give us an election budget as well as any of his Fianna Fáil predecessors.The immediate economic and financial issue that overwhelms all others in financial scale is the banking crisis and the billions of euro of taxpayers' money that the Government is giving away and planning to give away.  The Labour Party does not believe the NAMA proposal is the best for the country.  However, if the Government goes ahead with it, the critical issue will be the scale of discount to face value that the Government applies to tens of billions of euro worth of property loans from the banks.  A few minutes ago the Minister for Finance consciously attempted to sow confusion by talking about whether it was the €35 billion that the IMF mentioned or whether it was his €80 billion or €90 billion he himself chose to identify in his budget speech.  As a lawyer he is very skilled at sowing such confusion.  It is no wonder people end up confused.Many of these loans are now worth very little or at best a fraction of their face value.  However, the Government wants to discount these loans by only 20% of their face value.  The discounts consistently mentioned in the weekend newspapers, which are briefed by people presumably in the Government's advisory circle or directly by members of the Government, are 16% to 22%.  If they are the rates of discount, it would expose Irish taxpayers and their children to a total bill of possibly more than €50 billion.  When the IMF chose a figure of €35 billion, my guess is that it envisaged a discount of approximately 50%.  However, it is important to remember the Department of Finance would know what the rates were because it was party to the discussions when the report was written.  If those turn out to be the figures, it would mean there would be no financial room for practically any public capital spending for many years to come and we would be living in something similar to the Japanese lost decade about which I have spoken going right back to the night of the Government's disastrous guarantee scheme.  The annual Government debt interest burden would crowd out other much needed public spending and force tax rates to very high levels.Until perhaps yesterday, the Minister for Finance lived off telling the public that there was no cost to the bank bailout.  He repeatedly stated the bank bailout would not cost taxpayers a cent.  Did I hear him say recently that Irish Nationwide Building Society has not cost us a cent?  Our borrowing has gone out of control and risks sinking the country.  Moody's and other agencies have downgraded our rating, which means that our borrowing costs have soared.  Unfortunately the country is entering what is called a "debt trap".  The Government seems to have no exit strategy from the debt trap.On this critical issue, under the surface there is a major disagreement between the Government and the IMF.  The IMF report states:A key aspect of NAMA's success will be the prices at which the assets are purchased.  This will determine the extent to which banks' losses are transferred to the taxpayer.  Since price determination is a major challenge, risk-sharing structures could be usefully explored.  For example, if sold at a price that is clearly lower than the expected eventual recovery value, bank shareholders could be given a share in the upside.  Similarly, the government could be given an opportunity to participate in the upside of the residual healthy bank.  The authorities noted that they remained open to a number of refinements, including such upfront risk-sharing structures.  Also, while there has been some public discussion of a bank-specific ex post "claw back" provision, the authorities are considering an industry-wide levy to recoup any losses suffered by NAMA.That is the IMF giving the Government, the Department of Finance and the other agencies a very clear message to watch their step.  Of course, the Government previously had been very cool on the ideas that the IMF put forward here.  These have been proposed by a number of eminent economists.  The last sentence I quoted effectively shows that the IMF rightly believes the Government's levy approach is a bad idea.  It is clear that the IMF strongly believes the discount on purchased loans should be large and a mechanism can be put in place to compensate the banks if the discount turns out to have been too high.  The Labour Party and Fine Gael in their respective proposals have left significant room to do that for the bank shareholders.I lived in Tanzania in east Africa for three years.  I left there as the IMF came in.  When the IMF comes into a country, as it did in many countries, it normally slashes public spending and imposes extraordinarily harsh medicine on economies.  Clearly our relationship with the IMF is tempered by us being in the eurozone and the involvement of the European Central Bank.  Not everything the IMF says or does merits its traditional bogeyman reputation among progressive politicians.  Its present director, Strauss Khan, is one of the leading promoters of an international stimulus package to reverse the present recession.  The difficulty for Ireland about the stimulus package is that if there is a change of Government the commitments entered into by the present Government might be so great that a successor Government will have very little room for manoeuvre on borrowing, which would be a real problem in creating the stimulus the Labour Party and Fine Gael have mentioned.  On the other hand, the hard medicine inspectors continue to ply their traditional trade with abandon in individual countries.  Like Janus in the ancient Greek myth, the IMF shows two faces to the world, one for stimulus and nutrition, one for medicine and the draining of blood.  Departmental officials might like to read the remarks of Simon Johnson, who is now professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Until recently, however, he was the IMF's leading economist.  In a recent article he noted that when the representatives of the IMF arrive in a country, no one is ever happy to see them.  Moreover, a visit from the IMF or the kind of report Ireland has received constitutes the signal of failure when circumstances are dire and practically all else has failed.He also stated:The real concern of the fund's senior staff, and the biggest obstacle to recovery, is almost invariably the politics of countries in crisis.  Typically, these countries are in a desperate economic situation for one simple reason—the powerful elites within them overreached in good times and took too many risks.That is close to being a perfect description of Ireland's plight in 2009.  Mr. Johnson goes on to state these elites "reckon—correctly, in most cases — that their political connections will allow them to push onto the government any substantial problems that arise".  The Government then will push the cost of the adjustment onto ordinary people.  This is the core of what Members are debating, namely, the efforts of a politically well-connected golden circle to push the Government to take their losses on board.  That is what the ill-fated guarantee of 30 September was all about.  That is the heart of the NAMA policy and is the reason this country is on the edge of an abyss.As for the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, quoting from President's Obama's recent speech, I remind the Minister and his officials that an intense debate is raging in the United States at present to the effect that unless President Obama provides sufficient stimulus, he will bring the country to the same point reached in 1937 during the Great Depression, when President Roosevelt practically lost it.  Indeed, many would argue that he was saved by the Second World War.  Recently, Professor Christina Romer, who is the Chair of the Council of Economic Advisers in the United States, wrote an article about the lessons of 1937, the year in which President Roosevelt gave in to the deficit hawks.I listened recently to Professor Paul Krugman, who also visited the Department of Finance.  When asked what was going to happen to Ireland, he replied that he was sorry but people would be obliged to suffer repeatedly.  For whom are we suffering?  Was it the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who declared on "Questions and Answers" that the property developers etc. would be pursued for the money and that people in this awful situation would be dealt with firmly?  I do not believe that Fianna Fáil would pursue them as far as the plinth outside Leinster House and do not believe that Fianna Fáil intends to get tough with them.  In the meantime, however, our banking structure is in mortal peril and our reputation is not repaired.  Although Irish people have made extraordinary sacrifices and have endured extraordinary increases in taxes, the Minister appears to be suggesting that henceforth, his way out will be to save the developers and bankers and that the cost for so doing will be total deflation.

Such organisations also provide critical peer review and a reasonably objective means of comparative benchmarking against the performance of other developed partner countries.  The IMF used to have a fiercesome reputation among left-wingers in the 1970s, 1980s and perhaps even into the early 1990s that was somewhat akin to the big bad wolf.  If a Third World economy was managed badly, the IMF effectively would come in and dictate strong free market prescriptions, which might or might not produce some economic and fiscal cure but only at the expense of devastating the already inadequate social fabric or at least that was its image.  Both Deputies Morgan and Burton alluded to this but as far as I can recall, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was a socialist politician in France and Deputy Burton acknowledged that the spirit is different, which is what I intend to state this evening.I represented Ireland with a small team of officials from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank at the IMF annual conference last October in Washington at the height of the international banking crisis.  Given that a number of economies such as Iceland and certain countries in central and eastern Europe are in dire difficulties, the IMF has moved into the mainstream again from having been a relative backwater during the boom years and is approaching its great international task in what I consider to be a much more progressive and enlightened spirit than was the case in the past.  At present, it is doing a considerable service to the world community.  Nevertheless, coming back to Ireland, it is the determination of the Government to face up to its responsibilities and to take the immense challenges, both political and economic, head on, without abdicating its role to external organisations and leaving them in effect to impose solutions.I have been reading IMF commentaries on the Irish economy since the 1980s and always have found that they provide a useful, stimulating and reasonably objective external perspective.  Obviously, it is a perspective based on research and briefings inside this country, as well as comparative data and experience of other countries, and Deputy Burton explained well the process of how IMF teams visit Ireland.  While I welcome the recent report, and this is a point made by many Members, IMF country reports are not written on tablets of stone.  They are intended to stimulate discussion and to assist the taking of appropriate action.  However, their analyses and judgments certainly always deserve to be taken seriously.As Members are aware, it is always easier to gain in wisdom and perspective with the benefit of hindsight.  I have retained the last IMF country report on Ireland, which was published in September 2007, four months after the general election and it contains some striking statements in its opening introduction.  The first sentence reads:Economic performance remains very strong, supported by strong sound policies.  The growth rate of real GNP per capita continues to be one of the highest among advanced economies and the unemployment rate one of the lowest.In addition to outward oriented policies, key pillars of Ireland's performance are prudent fiscal policy, low taxes on labour and business income, as well as labour market flexibility.  Moreover, a box on that opening page entitled fund policy recommendations and implementation, repeats that:. . .fiscal policy has been prudent. . . . In the past couple years, windfall property-related revenues were saved and the fiscal stance was not procyclical, in line with Fund advice.The second heading on fiscal stability states: "The regulatory and supervisory framework continues to be strengthened in line with the recommendations of the 2006 FSAP Update."  On wage policies, it states "the present social partnership agreement contained no fiscal concessions, in line with Fund advice, though the wage increases were a little on the high side".  It is true that further on in the report, there are a number of references to an erosion of competitiveness and a warning of a slow-down in growth with the risks on the downside.  Moreover, there are criticisms such as "substantial fiscal stimulus in 2007 is unfortunate, but the authorities pointed to the need to achieve social objectives".  On banking it stated, "Stress tests by the Central Bank indicate that the major lenders have adequate funds to avert a range of shocks.

It is often suggested the Government is severely to blame for, and even should apologise for, policies that were, with some qualifications and admonitions, endorsed in broadly complimentary terms by the IMF less than two years ago in September 2007.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, as Minister for Finance, and his predecessor as Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, acted in good faith and in what they believed were the best interests of the country, with authoritative, though I do not wish to suggest totally uncritical, support from a leading international economic organisation the report of which we are now debating.

When it now says about Ireland that the stress exceeds that being faced by any other advanced economy and matches episodes of the most severe economic distress of post-World War Two history, it is referring to something that happened with little warning and the starkness of its message more than compensates for the level of approval implicitly withdrawn expressed in its last report.I highlight the last report not to criticise the IMF then or now, it has never claimed to be infallible.

The IMF is broadly supportive of the Government's efforts to tackle the crisis.  It endorsed the view that eurozone membership has provided Ireland with a degree of safety from currency speculation.  It has acknowledged that the Irish authorities have moved with resolve to counter the severe financial and economic shocks but underlined the need to sustain that resolve.  It emphasises what we know from the experience of the 1980s, "that expenditure reduction, as distinct from raising taxes, is the superior approach to fiscal consolidation" but it recognises as it may not have done in the 1980s that unless carefully managed, expenditure reduction risks hurting the most vulnerable.  The IMF states that the recent tendency of wages to decline, if sustained, will help to repair competitiveness.  It is the logic of eurozone membership and shows Irish labour market flexibility.With regard to the banking crisis, the IMF states that the authorities' extensive and ongoing support has been vital to maintain financial stability and the establishment of NAMA marks a significant step in the process of bank restructuring.  The Government differs from the IMF on the desirability of bank nationalisation.The IMF states that regaining credible control of public finances will require a steady hand over several years.  The present Government provides a steady hand and the next election is not due for almost three years.  It points to the formidable challenge in meeting financial targets by 2013 and argues that social welfare expenditure must be better targeted and the public service wage bill reduced.  On the tax side, broadening the base is the real challenge.In its conclusions, while emphasising the risks and formidable nature of the tasks ahead, the IMF states on the two fronts that matter most, the authorities have moved in the right direction.  Most recently, the proposed establishment of NAMA offers the prospect of extracting distressed assets from the banks, a precondition for their return to healthy functionality.  They have also laid out a multi-year plan to contain the fiscal deficit.Commenting on the IMF report, former Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, writing in this week's Business and Finance, argues that our political system needs some effective external validation of its response and that to maintain confidence we “...will need clear reassurance that a change of Government during the course of consolidation will not have the effect of throwing the whole business off course.  The experience of the 1980s shows that a softly, softly approach simply prolongs the pain unnecessarily.”  One cannot help but note that the language coming from ex-Fine Gael Ministers outside the House is a lot tougher than most of what is coming from the Fine Gael benches.

I have heard few references to the OECD during this debate.  It states in its economic outlook:Given the weak budgetary position and impact of support to the banking system, it is appropriate for consolidation to have begun while avoiding the destabilising effect of excessively rapid retrenchment.  Considerable further consolidation will be necessary in coming years to close the underlying gap between tax revenues and expenditure.However, despite listing a number of continuing risks it ends on a more positive note:  "Given the scale of adjustment in Ireland so far, the underlying economic imbalances may be correcting rapidly and this could add more strength to the recovery than anticipated".  Any improvement in the global economic climate could have that effect, given the degree of adaptability that has been shown by our society so far.One area in which OECD action has been beneficial to Ireland is its concentration on bringing tax havens and jurisdictions in the grey zone into compliance with OECD tax transparency standards so as to stem tax losses, which is badly needed in the current situation.  There have been two OECD meetings co-chaired by France and Germany on this issue, which I attended in Paris last October and Berlin this June, and much progress has been made.  In the last two weeks I signed on behalf of the Government two bilateral tax information exchange agreements with the Cayman Islands and Gibraltar.  This is an illustration of how international co-operation can be helpful to individual countries.Having sat in the House for two hours, I would like to comment on some of the points made.  Deputy Arthur Morgan said we could not tax or cut our way out of the situation.  The implication was perhaps that we could borrow our way out.

The report puts to bed the argument about what led to Ireland's current crisis being so much more serious than other countries' in the global economic turmoil.  It was said most clearly during an internal IMF conference call when the IMF mission chief to Ireland, Ashoka Mody, said:The imbalances in the Irish economy were serious. . . . I look back at the imbalances not to assign any blame, but they are a necessary part of the diagnosis.  There were three features that were particularly prominent in the evolution of this crisis: overvalued property prices, the vulnerabilities built up within the banks . . . and the gradual loss of competitiveness of the Irish economy over a period of several years.These are Government policy failures on an enormous scale and we should all recognise that so we can move on from the political squabble to concentrate our energies on formulating policies that can lead us out of this economic cul de sac.  I have little interest in pursuing the political blame game; it is a waste of time and a turn-off for most members of the public.  I would rather concentrate on elements of the IMF report to which we can respond with immediate actions and, more importantly, with longer term strategic policy.Let us consider the challenge of restoring lost competitiveness.  The IMF says clearly that Ireland needs to create a more competitive market for doing business and, perhaps more importantly, to create new and progressive sources of economic growth.  In short, we must transform our economy and we must do it quickly.  For Ireland to be competitive again, we must be cost competitive.  Doing business in Ireland has become too expensive compared to our neighbours.  My expertise is in the area of energy.  There are businesses in Ireland that are choosing to invest in the UK because electricity bills there are 50% more for the same plant in Ireland.There are specific things we can do immediately to bring down the cost of energy to both domestic and commercial customers.  We need an emergency response for the recession — perhaps a temporary response for the next two years — in order to bring some relief to business people and home owners.  We should be considering taking the carbon cost out of electricity pricing altogether.  We put this in place on a voluntary basis up to the end of 2012.  We could reduce energy bills by between 5% and 10% overnight for all customers.  Last year Irish businesses and consumers paid about €220 million in carbon charges to meet the cost of carbon credits that were actually given free by the Government to the energy generation industry.We could consider allowing the ESB to compete for electricity supply to home owners.  Bord Gáis and Viridian are offering attractive pricing packages of 10% to 15% below those of the ESB but we do not allow the ESB to respond.  We are deliberately preventing price competition in the energy market in an effort, supposedly, to allow competitors to get a foothold.  Bord Gáis is going nowhere.  It is well able to fight a price war with the ESB on electricity if necessary, and consumers would benefit from that, but we are not allowing it.  Ireland must be the only country in Europe that is artificially keeping energy prices high in an effort to encourage more investment into the energy market.We should consider freezing transmission charges.  Ireland is at war with recession and we need to take strong, decisive action for a temporary period to allow our companies to survive and start growing again.  We can do things on a temporary basis, such as freezing charges, in order to make that happen.  We have a Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources who is doing much in terms of trying to switch the emphasis from carbon-based fuels to more sustainable sources of power.  We are trying to transform our grid to facilitate that.  However, he is doing nothing to bring down the cost of electricity, which is killing businesses on a day-to-day basis.  In the last two days alone, 140 jobs were lost in a business in Cork and 27 more in another company.  All these collapses are partially due to the cost of doing business in this State, of which energy is a major factor.  The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Government are directly responsible for contributing to this problem because they are not taking the type of decisive action on a temporary, emergency basis that could bring the cost of electricity down next week.The same applies in regard to gas pricing, but that is more of a regulatory problem.  The reduction in gas prices of 10% last month is an absolute scandal when one considers that the wholesale price of gas in the United Kingdom has collapsed by some 60% since January.  Yet the Commission for Energy Regulation tells us that 50% of the price of gas is directly related to the wholesale cost of gas in that country, from which we purchase all our gas.  Therefore, a basic mathematical calculation suggests we should have seen a 20% to 25% reduction in the price of gas to households in the State.  Instead we have had a reduction of only 10% with an indication that there may perhaps be a further cut of 12% in September.  Why must consumers wait for price reductions when such reductions are already justified?If we are to be competitive in the economy of tomorrow, we must build a new and modern infrastructure.  Fine Gael has a plan to deliver this infrastructure through restructuring State companies and raising capital through those companies independently of Government.  The State does not have the capacity to raise funds of the scale required for this infrastructural investment.  That is what our NewERA package is all about.  It is not simply a case of job creation; that is a by-product of the core vision.  It is primarily about bringing about the same type of reform in the semi-State sector as we require in the public sector.  Semi-State companies, which are owned by this country, must put in place a strategic plan for recovery by investing cleverly and commercially in new infrastructure such as broadband, water and the electricity grid.  The State, via its companies, owns a substantial amount of broadband and information technology infrastructure through the metropolitan area networks, MANs, Iarnród Éireann, Bórd Gáis's pipelines and the National Roads Authority's ducting.  However, it is managed in an entirely disjointed way, with some of it not used at all.  Some €120 million was spent in rolling out MANs, but 59 out of the 80 networks are not being used.  This represents a wastage of some €80 million of capital investment because of sheer incompetence in terms of failing to allocate responsibility to a single entity with expertise in information technology and infrastructural management.There are many positive actions we can take to assist our economic recovery, but we are being distracted because of the enormity of the challenges relating to the banking sector and deficit management.  The Government must find a way to take all these positive initiatives while also resolving those problems.  We must restore some degree of optimism to the economy.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	357	Whenever the Taoiseach and Minister for Finance speak about their plans for the economy, they claim to have three objectives, namely, to stabilise the finances of the State, stabilise the banks and promote employment.  That is very laudable but the reality is that those objectives will not be achieved because everything we do must be concentrated on keeping the banks afloat.  The reason for this is that the Government has boxed us into a corner by extending the financial institutions guarantee scheme to the bank bond holders.  That was a great mistake and all our current difficulties flow from it in a way that is entirely limiting our options.  We were well and truly screwed as soon as the Government took that decision.Until September 2010, we must pray and we must borrow all we can to ensure none of the guaranteed banks collapses.  If one of them goes under, so does the country.  That is the situation in which the Government has placed us.  The unpayable bill of €440 billion will be due for payment if any one of those banks collapses.  Government Members repeatedly insist that we cannot possibly renege on the international bond holders.  That is rubbish.  These are the people who funded the property bubble in this State, expecting to do well in the good times, as they did.  They were aware of the dangers of a crash but were prepared to take on those high stakes.  They could never have expected that the Government would come to their rescue and take on their debts.  The Government says we cannot renege because this is senior debt.  The reality is that these are private loans, not sovereign debt.  Most countries have reneged on this debt; what Ireland has done is the exception, no matter what the Government claims.  Ministers point to what happened when the United States Government let Lehman Brothers go to the wall as justification for its stance.  However, that institution was the nerve centre of the financial sector not only of the United States but of the world.  Anglo Irish Bank is not comparable with Lehman Brothers, which was the custodian of large quantities of hedge fund assets.The problem is that the Government listened only to the banks in the early stages of this crisis.  It was led by the nose and we will pay the price for that in the next ten to 15 years, with taxpayers obliged to pour money into keeping afloat what is effectively a failed banking system.  By guaranteeing bond holders, the Government converted bank debt into Government debt, with the result that if any of the guaranteed banks goes broke, the State will also go broke.  That is the difficulty we face.The Government has certainly succeeded in making it cheaper and easier for banks to borrow money, but the price for that is that it is more expensive for the State to borrow money at a time when we never needed it more.  We do not even know how much we need to borrow, whether €35 million or €440 billion.  In what is a massive understatement, the IMF stated that the risks we face remain significant and that any further financial crisis of any description, including any type of global shock, and the accompanying loss of faith by the financial markets in the Government's ability to repay our debt will place us in major difficulty.  If the Government cannot borrow, it cannot guarantee the banks, in which case we will truly be finished.The CSO figures, the Exchequer returns, the unemployment figures, ratings by ratings agencies, the GDP figure — all of these are going inexorably in the wrong direction.  Even worse, they exceed within weeks the most pessimistic predictions of so-called experts.  That does not inspire confidence.  All the global evidence of previous recessions where property bubble bursts were accompanied by a financial crisis show that it took ten to 15 years for recovery to take hold, with employment being the slowest element of recovery.  We are not at the bottom of the crisis in terms of unemployment.  In the construction sector, for example, the loss thus far of some 20,000 jobs is merely the tip of the iceberg because many contracts still have some way to run and there is nothing to replace them.When it comes to tourism, 50,000 jobs have already been lost with more expected to go by the end of the year and in the course of 2010.  Incredibly, however, there has been total silence from the Government on this matter.  If any other sector were in similar difficulties, there would be rescue packages, task forces, Cabinet sub-committees and so on in an effort to reverse the trend.  Instead, the tourism industry has received not aid but additional taxes.  The argument was made in an article in one of the newspapers today that a departure tax is a good idea because it keeps people at home.  That may be the case but those people are not holidaying in Ireland.  It would be good if money earned in Ireland were circulating within the State, but it would be even better if French, German or British money were circulating here, paying Irish wages, keeping Irish hotels open and putting money into the Exchequer.  What an island economy least needs is a self-imposed disadvantage by way of a tax which may discourage visitors from other countries.The one recommendation I would make in regard to the €250 million rescue package the Government has agreed with the social partners is that the money be put into subsidising local government rates.  It should be given to local authorities so they can reduce rates.  I spoke to a hotelier recently whose weekly rates bill is €10,000, and that is before he puts a meal on the table or pays a wage.  This is unsustainable and our competitiveness has been shot completely.  It is no wonder we have lost 50,000 jobs.  If we lose the tourism infrastructure here, we will never get those jobs back.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	359	The IMF and OECD reports are an indictment of a Government that squandered the wealth of this nation.  Before their publication, the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government went on trial before the electorate on 5 June and was found guilty.  This is still a Government in denial, and we had an illustration of this today.There were two major admissions by the Minister for Finance last week.  First, he gave way under pressure from the Opposition and conceded time on the schedule to discuss the OECD and IMF reports on the Irish economy.  Second, and perhaps more important, the Minister admitted the economy had overheated and the Government must take responsibility for contributing to that.This may not sound like the abject apology due to the Irish people but for the Minister and his Government it is a major step forward to state that they got it wrong, emerge from the protective veil of the global downturn and face the anger of the people.  These reports told us nothing new.  According to the IMF report, since the start of the decade and especially from 2005 to 2007, easy credit fostered a property bubble and bank exposure to property lenders soared, while reliance on wholesale funding intensified.  Wages rose rapidly and international competitiveness was compromised.There can be no excuses from the Government as Fianna Fáil and the Green Party failed in their job.  The overheating of our economy, which made the crash more severe in Ireland than anywhere else, comes back to haunt us day after day.  The collapse of tax revenue, despite two tax-increasing budgets, will potentially push our deficit to 12% of the national income, and Irish banks face losses of €35 billion by next year.  Rash and ill-thought out Government expenditure, allied to a drop in tax revenue, has led to a major financial crisis.Prior to the publication of the IMF report, we saw self-justification from the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as he sought to shore up his own position by blaming his predecessor.  The Minister landed the Taoiseach right where the Opposition put him all along, at the epicentre of the creation of our economic problems.  What confidence can we have in the Taoiseach when his Minister for Finance has none in him?Ireland's vulnerability was built up during the boom years with an openness to global shocks.  Critical macro-economic imbalances emerged as credit supply accommodated an unsustainable rise in property prices, and bank exposure to property lending soared while the reliance on wholesale funding increased and rapidly rising wage bills resulted in declining international competitiveness.  As it currently stands, Ireland Inc. is viewed internationally as a sinking ship and it is very much a case of how the mighty have fallen, with the roar of the tiger becoming the mew of the tabby.Four short years ago Ireland was ranked as the second-wealthiest country per capita in the world ahead of the US and Japan.  With this supposedly enviable position came stigma and shame as a UN development programme found that despite our wealth, Ireland was one of the most unequal societies in 18 industrial countries surveyed, with the third-highest level of poverty.The Taoiseach tells us day after day in this House how essential it is to impose tax increases, levies and cutbacks but he has not told us where our money went, which is what people want to know.  He is not telling us the way in which his Government squandered the money.  We had it but he lost it.  Who will now pay but the most vulnerable and needy?  It will certainly not be the Government or protected elite, many of whom turned up time and again at the tent in Galway and slapped those in Fianna Fáil on the back over the years.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The IMF report, by and large, endorses the Government's planned response to our problems in public finances and the banking sector.  The IMF and the Government are in broad agreement on the corrective action needed on the budgetary position and the IMF analysis is in line with the Government's view that primary consideration should be given to expenditure reductions rather than increased taxation.  Whereas a readjustment of at least another €4 billion is likely to be required in the forthcoming budget, the scope for increased taxation, at least under existing guises, is limited so cuts in expenditure must be seriously considered.It is facile to argue with the benefit of hindsight that we should have acted differently in the past.  Once those decisions were reached on the basis of the best available evidence and all the material facts, nobody predicted the severity of the current economic meltdown that has included the demise worldwide of once-considered impregnable banking and other corporations.  In any event, we have our current problems and it would be far more productive to focus our energies on tackling them instead of trying to assign blame for what, in effect, is an international and worldwide crisis.The comments the Opposition parties made in the period leading up to and during the 2007 general election are noteworthy for their absence of any forecasts of the severity of the storms which would impact heavily on this island in a short time.  The value of hindsight is always tempered in that one is dealing with past events.  Even the worst weather forecaster can, with certainty of hindsight, correctly tell us today whether yesterday we should have applied sun cream or carried a brolly.Cuts in public expenditure are painful but with a dramatic fall in tax revenue, every aspect of public expenditure will need to be reviewed, no more so than in my own Department of Education and Science.  The IMF has drawn attention to the disparity between the growth in labour costs and overall productivity.  The loss of competitiveness, in particular, has been highlighted.  Wages and prices must be adjusted to reflect the changed circumstances and necessary adjustments are already in train.For example, the Government has taken steps to improve competitiveness with a reduction in energy prices, despite what Deputy Coveney contended earlier.  The IMF has also acknowledged the important steps taken to stabilise the financial system through the bank guarantee scheme and endorsed the establishment of the National Assets Management Agency.The concept and reasoning behind the NAMA proposal is simple, even if the operational mechanics are a little more complex.  The primary concern in setting up NAMA is the restoration of a functioning system and any other suggested motive is spurious and misleading.  Why otherwise would the IMF have stated that NAMA will be pivotal to the orderly restructuring of the financial sector and that it offers the prospect of extracting distressed assets from the banks, a precondition of their return to health?NAMA presents a better option than nationalisation, whether on a temporary or a permanent basis.  Nationalisation tends to be seen as the last resort wherever in the world it occurs.  The message sent by the nationalisation of our two major banks would be extremely damaging for this country.  At least one well respected businessman and entrepreneur has publicly stated his opposition to nationalisation, stating that it would undermine rather than promote confidence in Ireland.  Another commentator has warned that banks might be pressured into providing loans to failing firms which have no prospect of repayment, thereby compounding existing difficulties.In their more outrageous moments, the Government's detractors have suggested that switching impaired assets to NAMA somehow bails out vested interests, namely, builders and developers.  Nothing could be further from the truth, however, and the suggestion is merely cheap political posturing for short-term gain.  The transfer of bad loans to NAMA as a holding management company will mean that it will be separated from developers and bankers.  Its only vested interest will be the taxpayer.  International evidence indicates that Government owned banking systems serve their economies poorly and tend to result in greater interest rate spread, less private credit and preferential treatment of larger firms.The IMF has noted that the approach and basic elements of Ireland's budgetary plan are appropriate.  Its forecasts are largely in line with the recent supplementary budget and it concurs with the view that an improvement in our competitiveness will put us on a sounder basis to avail of increased growth.  In these difficult times, it is encouraging that the IMF has added its name to the list of independent organisations which support the Government's budgetary policies.  The European Commission has stated that our strategy was correct and we have received praise from the finance Ministers of other European countries.  The ESRI and some economists believe we are now following the correct strategy on the public finances.  Worryingly for the Opposition, there is not a united front regarding alternative means of addressing the twin problems of correcting the public finances and resolving the banking crisis.  However, independent commentators support the actions of the Fianna Fáil-Green Party coalition.Ireland has benefited greatly from the safety provided by eurozone membership.  This should not be understated in the forthcoming debate on the Lisbon treaty.  Next week we will debate legislation providing for a referendum on the treaty.  Given the serious financial situation in which we find ourselves, surely the electorate will see the wisdom of voting "Yes" and the importance of eurozone membership in recent months.Our decisions may be difficult or unpopular but never let it be said this Government has shirked its responsibilities.  The IMF agrees that we are taking the necessary measures to protect our collective future.  Our policies, and particularly those on NAMA, are the correct ones and we will not be deflected from implementing them.  The IMF has commended us on the scale and speed of our response thus far.  I welcomed the comments by the Taoiseach earlier today regarding his role as Minister for Finance and I fully support the current Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, as he deals with the difficult economic situation we currently face.  I also congratulate him on his excellent performance on yesterday's "Nightly News with Vincent Browne".

Not only does the report describe the challenges facing the economy, it also provides a reasoned defence of the Government's actions to date.  This report is a wake up call for the Opposition.  Without being facetious, it is probably the last thing Fine Gael and the Labour Party wanted to read because it scuppers their short-sighted anti-Government campaigning.  Their opposition has focused on a misguided reaction to the decisions of the Minister for Finance.  It must be galling for Deputies Burton and Bruton to be greeted with an IMF report which endorses the Government's position.

This Government is hiding nothing and we concur with the IMF's assessment of the situation to date.  Instead of playing the blame game, the Minister for Finance has trained his eyes on the future.Ireland is experiencing one of the worst economic downturns since the 1930s.  Mismanagement is not the cause of this crisis and we would be having the same discussion today regardless of who had been in power.  Every sector of society has been affected and diminished credit and global demand have resulted in job losses and, in turn, reduced income for the Exchequer.  These problems are compounded by a global property slump.Opposition parties and some elements of the media would have us believe that our open economy is a bad thing but we should not forget that most people have enjoyed substantial improvements in their incomes and standards of living over the past 15 years.  Many progressive measures were introduced during this period.  In today's The Irish Times, economist Jim O’Leary writes: “There is hardly a citizen of the State who didn’t benefit considerably from boom-time government largesse across all the major areas of spending”.  He cites generous increases in public service salaries and education expenditure across all levels.  Citizens also benefited from tax reductions worth €3.2 billion between 2003 and 2007.  We had the lowest tax rates in the entire EU during that period.  Fine Gael and the Labour Party did not complain about this expenditure at the time.The Government has taken a three-pronged approach to recovery.  Although our strategy has been consistently criticised by the Opposition, we were given the thumbs up by the IMF last week.  The steps this Government has taken are recognised as stabilising the financial system through the bank guarantee and the establishment of NAMA.  The IMF believes NAMA will be self-financing in the fullness of time.  The agency will manage bad debts in a way that allows banks to return to healthy lending practices.  By receiving Government bonds for the written down value of impaired loans, banks will be able to borrow from the ECB.  They will thereby be able to give businesses the credit lifelines they require to shore up holes in their operations and avoid further job losses.  It is hoped that restored growth in the world's biggest economies will allow our open economy to prosper.  This growth will not be possible either without the Government's action on banking.  I am glad Deputy Olivia Mitchell acknowledged that.  Since there is a great deal of scaremongering about the matter, I should stress that NAMA has not been established to bail out bankers or developers.  All developers will still owe 100% of their debts and will be pursued vigorously by NAMA, the banks and the State.  Any lending to banks which takes place through investment or recapitalisation will see a return of 8% dividend to the Government.  That is at least double the investment return that any organisation would get today.Recommendations to bring a greater regularity regime to the financial system have already been announced by the Government, which is an indication of the Minister for Finance's step-by-step approach to recovery.  However, it is my firm belief that we need expert and competent people in the regulator's office to ensure we avoid past mistakes.  There has been uproar from the Opposition about this report, including allegations about the Government's responsibilities.  The Minister for Finance has acknowledged that we have not got it all right, but where were the Opposition Deputies for the last ten years when they were asking the Government to spend more money?

This Government has dealt with the public in the same way over the past ten years.  First of all, it had a look at the possibility of gaining an overall majority before the 2002 general election and planned out how it would do this.  The best way was to buy the electorate and pay them well in advance, encouraging them by giving them a false sense of security.  They came up with a great proposal to give medical cards to the over 70s unconditionally and everybody said "Isn't that wonderful?"  The public were grateful.  They took their medical cards, went away happy and voted for the Government of the day.  Then the Government wrote to mothers all over the country asking "Would you like a dramatic increase in your child benefit?"  With an invitation like that, the public said "Of course, yes.  Sure everybody would love that".  So it came to pass that they wrote out to everybody.  The Minister sent a cheque, including arrears, to every mother in the country a fortnight before the election.  The public was duly grateful once again and rewarded the Government which was returned to office.

They went forth once more and called on the public to support them.  The poor unfortunate public was led astray and voted for them again, but boy oh boy is it paying for that now.  The Government said "You didn't give us an overall majority.  You wilted and welshed on us, so we are now about to punish you".  The Government then tapped the over 70s on the shoulder and said "By the way, remember those medical cards we gave you years ago when we were trying to buy the election?  We want them back".  Ouch.  It has now set up a commission to examine child benefit and are about to say to the mothers of Ireland "Excuse me ladies, there's something we would like to speak with you about.  We want our money back and we are going to take it".  Wait until the Government goes there, however, because it will get its answer very sharply.Two levies have been introduced.  The first levy was introduced to soften and daze the public.  The second one hit the public and the private sectors.  Then came more levies and what can only be described as punishment beatings.  The last speaker actually praised the banking system for leading the country astray under the supervision of the Government.The Minister referred to the three legged stool approach.  The Government has now seized that stool by one of its legs and is proceeding to beat the public over the head with it.  It will do it again and again because the poor, unfortunate public has not realised that this is now an angry Government.  The Government has led the country astray and the public has found out, so the Government is fighting back.  With a little bit of help from the Green Party, the former Progressive Democrats and a few Independent Deputies, it will continue to punish the public for as long as the public allows it to do so.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I was confused last week.  I knew about the IMF report so I spoke to a friend of mine in international finance, and he felt that such reports can be watered down when Governments are in power for so long.  Many drafts go back and forth between different Departments and eventually the Government of the day will settle for the worst case scenario, or at least to have it watered down to make the Government look quite good.  I listened to the radio interview with the Minister for Finance and I was delighted because I thought the Government might be doing a good job and that the IMF report was more or less endorsing our way out of this terrible crisis.  I take no pleasure from that crisis.  The Irish people need leadership.  They need a plan and the IMF report seemed to endorse the way out.That was the case until I read the report and I listened to other political commentators.  These commentaries are damning of the report and feel that the Government has no way out of the crisis.  Is it not extraordinary that the Government is taking credit for trying to retrieve a disastrous situation and that it claps itself on the back?  It is a bit like an arsonist who causes a forest fire, sees the fire brigade and tells them where the fire is located.  The Government has caused this problem by the reckless mismanagement of the Irish economy.  We must find a way out of it, but I do not think that the IMF report is endorsing the Government's action.The penny has not dropped with this Government.  The party is over and the money is gone.  People out there are unemployed and they need leadership.  The Government blamed the Opposition two weeks ago for not persuading it to ease up on its reckless spending habits.  It also blamed the people for the property bubble when the Minister said that we, the people, collectively decided to have this housing boom.  Governments are there to govern.  The Government led the way and unfortunately, many thousands of young couples followed, and they are now in negative equity and without jobs.  It is not right to blame the innocent people who followed the Government.  Sometimes we have to take collective responsibility and admit we made a mistake before we move on.  It can be difficult in politics to say that we have made a mistake, but the people would like to see a bit of humility before we can move on.  For the past 12 years, every Government Minister, Deputy and even councillor took credit for everything.  After 12 years, I will not take the blame on this side of the House for Government incompetence.Our unemployment is the second highest in Europe.  We want the taxpayer to pick up the tab for the banking crisis.  Billions of euro of taxpayers' money will be poured into NAMA in order to bail out the banks.  One of the Government's chief aims is to get credit flowing again, but small businesses and farmers are not getting finance.  Small businesses are the life blood of the economy, employing thousands of people, yet hundreds of businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy and have already gone to the wall.  If the banks do not start lending again, many hard working business people and their employees who keep the economy going will not be there.  I ask the Minister to get on to the banks.  He has given them terms of reference, but I believe they are abdicating from those terms.  I call on business people and small farmers to remind the banks that they have terms of reference and to make sure that they adhere to those terms of reference to get business moving again.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	422	If I was an international investor listening to the contributions of the Taoiseach and his senior Ministers, I do not think I would have any great confidence in restoring some of our credit rating.  Unfortunately, too much time has been put into spinning this as a positive thing, and looking to blame others such as the banks, the Opposition and the people of Ireland.The IMF stated that Ireland needs new sources of economic growth for the future.  We should look at re-examining some of the things at which we traditionally did well.  Two examples are the food and fishing industries.  We have a food industry that is currently worth €8 billion.  It contributes to 230,000 jobs, 20% of our net exports, and 80% of all the raw material that is bought in this country.  Over the last two weeks we have seen that industry under serious threat due to an unregulated domestic groceries retail sector.  We have heard the Tánaiste state that she will establish a code of practice for the retail sector but she has made no commitment to putting in legislation to underpin that, or to appoint the Ombudsman, the Director of Consumer Affairs or whoever to implement and enforce these regulations.  We recently had a graphic presentation from the economist Jim Power, who said that unless we do something shortly, 100,000 of those jobs will be lost.We should re-examine the areas in which we can do best.  A total of 85% of all our fish catch is untouched or exported for processing.  We could produce much more fish by way of conventional and farm fish if we got serious about trying to do it.  The groceries sector is 70% controlled by three major multiples.  We have no fair trade legislation and no genuine effort to legislate for a policy of labelling.  Professor Pat Wall pointed that to label the country of origin as Irish does not represent a "buy Irish" campaign, but rather an information campaign.I would agree entirely with what other Deputies have said about banks and finance.  Small businesses cannot get finance.  Members opposite have made accusations that this side of the House is not capable of governing. Between 1994 and 1997, the Exchequer balance as a proportion of GDP was plus 1.5%.  Between 2004 and 2008, it is minus 5.2%.  The debt ratio as a percentage of GNP between 1994 and 1997 was minus 23.5%, but between 2004 and 2008 it is plus 0.4%.  I am trying to be helpful, so that people can draw their own conclusions.

This report is very well written, straightforward, easy to understand, striking and quite qualified in its recommendations.  In terms of getting the economy back on track, we cannot make the mistakes of the past which were that we became over-reliant on the construction sector and our budgeting system put nothing aside for a rainy day.  We must have contingency funds built into our budgetary system.

We had nothing available to provide a stimulus to our economy.  Unlike other countries, our fiscal position did not allow us to that.  It is worth noting that we have no leverage in that area.  The financial position makes it very difficult to provide any form of stimulus to the economy.The National Pensions Reserve Fund is welcome but it is being depleted basically to bail out the banks.  It is not being used for the purpose for which it was set up.  It is effectively being used as a slush fund by the Government to bail out the banks.  We must take that on board.In terms of getting our finances and the economy back on track, we must deal with unemployment.  Some 413,000 people are now unemployed and we meet unemployed people every day in our clinics.  There is nothing to encourage employers to look at ways to retain employees.  We must look at our social welfare system and at ways to remodel it and to use it to ensure people are kept on in jobs.  For every person let go, it costs the taxpayer €20,000 per year.I refer to the banks and the National Assets Management Agency.  The Government always refers to the Swedish model.  The Swedish model was 8% of GDP and it was worth €9 billion.  It made a 50% loss and lost the taxpayer almost €4.5 billion to €5 billion.  NAMA will cost €50 billion to €80 billion.  It is half of GDP.  How will NAMA restore credit in the immediate term?  What we propose provides it.The key feature in terms of the economy getting back on track is that the banking system must function and credit must flow.  Small businesses cannot get access to credit.  The interest rates on the overdraft facilities are being increased.  It is prohibitive. This is about the real world.  The role of Government is to put in place structures so that private enterprise flourishes and to ensure we have infrastructure, look after the most vulnerable, do not have a punitive tax system, the economy functions and to allow people in business to provide jobs.  The private sector cannot do that currently because the system in terms of how business operates is unwieldy and they cannot access credit.  That slows growth and competitiveness.The Minister will agree this is the least competitive country in the eurozone.

Over the past ten years, the Government fuelled inflation.  It basically abandoned exports in 2002, which the IMF report effectively states.  It relied completely on construction.  It was short term and brought in tax revenues which could not be sustained.How many times did this report go back and forth between the Government and the IMF?  The people are entitled to know.

#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	435	I am delighted to have the opportunity to discuss the report.  I hope the media reports on this debate.  They would report on a row about a debate but would not actually attend it.  I urge the public, the voters, to go to imf.org and read this report.  As someone said, it is a very readable and understandable report.  Instead of listening to someone picking a sentence for his or her argument or to speak against the Government, people should read the report to get a full picture.A challenging picture is portrayed in this report.  Nevertheless, the IMF is very clear that in the two areas that matter most for the economy, namely, public finances and the banking system, the correct actions are being taken.  The report states that the Government is showing resolve.Our competitiveness is a huge challenge, as speakers have said.  Part of that is currency, over which we have no control, and another is wages.  When we speak about competitiveness, we must state that we are speaking about people's wages.  There are other parts but wages is a large part of it.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	436	What about energy?
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	437	Energy is another part of it but wages is a very significant one along with currency.  When speaking about it, we should let the people know exactly what we are speaking about.Another challenge in this report and for the economy is foreign direct investment.  There are indications that our exports are not doing quite as badly as those in other countries but that is a challenge on which we must work harder.I refer to social welfare.  People are reading selectively from the report and are reading the executive summary which speaks about the possibility of reducing entitlements.  However, the IMF also states that the social welfare system must protect and be focused on the vulnerable.  Surely, that is the policy of every party in this House, namely, that we do not just spend money willy-nilly and that we protect and better target the vulnerable.  The report does not mean target the vulnerable the way the Opposition does when it says we target the vulnerable.The Labour Party's reaction to NAMA initially was slightly hysterical but it has calmed down a lot, which is very welcome.  The nationalisation proposal is a serious one, although it is not one with which the Government agrees.  The Labour Party always says nationalise and then clean up but it never says what cleaning up is.  Cleaning up is the NAMA proposal; it will clean up the banks.I am delighted the debate on NAMA is becoming a bit more rational.  The Opposition will have points on, and criticisms of, it.  Some Labour Party spokespersons spoke about builder bailouts, banker bailouts and aeroplanes flying all over the world for NAMA.  That was pure hysterics.  It is one of the most serious issues facing the country but it is clear that most are of the opinion that this is the right thing to do, and perhaps the only thing we can do.I refer to the structural deficit about which we are getting much criticism — that it was appallingly high in the past year.  It was too high if one looks at this report and the figures contained in it.  We were called a disgrace by one Deputy opposite for having such a high structural deficit.  Again, it is like the competitiveness issue.  The Opposition Members do not explain the structural deficit.  It consists of entitlements, benefits, spending on schools and so forth.  I do not want to be harping on about the Opposition but its general criticism during the boom times was that the Government was not spending enough, hospitals and schools were failing, there were not enough teachers——

The Government is addressing the structural deficit issue through these means.On the issue of Lehman Brothers and Anglo Irish Bank, the failure to bail out Lehmans at the time is now generally considered a big mistake, as acknowledged by one Federal Reserve board member and many economists.  One reason the US authorities did not bail out the bank was political.  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae had just been bailed out, as well as Bear Stearns, and there was huge political anger in the US.  They are not like us in that they do not like public spending.

If we were to fail on Anglo Irish, the cost would be so much higher.  Those institutions that Fine Gael wants to default on are the very ones lending us the money to keep our deficit going this year and to pay for social welfare and public spending.  If we default on them, we would find it difficult to borrow to keep the country going.  We are trying to keep the show on the road.People need to read the IMF report.  It is a challenging report of the Government.  The idea the Government stitched it up with the IMF is not true.  While it would not be happy reading for any Government, it stated the right and difficult decisions are being made.  While the IMF does not agree with all of the Government's moves, it acknowledges the Government has a plan and in the two areas that matter most we are getting them right.  That is what will bail out the ordinary taxpayer and the economy.  We must keep giving people hope as best we can in these difficult circumstances.

Having listened to the debate since 3.30 p.m., I believe the general public would not be impressed with it.  Deputy Richard Bruton called for national solidarity and a parliamentary response.  We should give the people such an all-party response but people will have seen much of that.  Deputy Burton quoted Paul Krugman's comment "suffer, suffer, suffer".  People are looking to us because they are suffering and looking for a way out.  They want to hear about it from the Government as much as they want to hear it from the Opposition parties.Several months ago when political commentators and economists suggested the possibility of a property or bad bank every party examined it.  The Government has come forward with the idea of NAMA.  I support NAMA and believe it will get the banks back lending.  The sooner both the Opposition and the Government can clear the legislation for NAMA in this House, give the leadership required, show people we are about our business, the sooner we will restore confidence in the economy.  Krugman, Johnson and Obama were quoted in this debate by all sides of the House.  The one action Obama has taken which we have not is giving people hope and encouragement.The establishment of NAMA is the correct direction.  Deputy O'Donnell asked when will lending commence again.  It will commence when the banking matter is cleared through NAMA.  We may have to buy more shares in both of the banks before we get back to proper lending.

I was proud to go abroad with companies that did a fantastic job of winning market share for Ireland.  However, they are now fighting with the banks to get the credit they need for their everyday business.  They are not happy about local authority charges either.  As part of a stimulus package, we should tell local authorities to freeze or reduce their rates this year in line with the reductions that are happening across all sectors of the economy.

I am not talking about the lower-paid or those at the front line of services.  I regret I was misquoted by Deputies Gilmore and Stagg for political purposes.  They should have read the speech I gave in September 2008, which explained adequately and clearly that a system change is needed in this country.  It is being demanded by those we represent.  If we do not air our views in this Chamber, regardless of our ambitions for office or anything else, we are not serving them properly.  Decisions are made in this Parliament.

We should be leading Europe in demanding the change that is needed at WTO level to enable our exporters to access all the markets more easily.  That would make such a difference to all our companies at home and help to sustain jobs in this country.  If we do not lead the innovation in that area, we will fail Irish exporters.We need to get together in relation to the smart economy.  It is not good enough merely to talk about it.  Rhetoric will not create jobs.  We need to understand clearly what is meant by the smart economy.  We need to commercialise and internationalise our products, from county enterprise board level to Enterprise Ireland level and overseas.  If we do not invest in such products, we will fail to invest in tomorrow's companies and tomorrow's jobs.  I firmly believe it would be a mistake to fail to invest in the most important part — the central piece — of the economy — which is the creation of jobs in Ireland by indigenous companies.  As I have said previously, Bord Bia, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland should be amalgamated.  We need to send a single effective and disciplined body abroad to sell every product from this country.  We need to change.  We should not be afraid of change.  If we can find consensus in this House, we can bring about that change in the interests of those companies and the people we represent.

We would love to find consensus in this House.  We would love to work with the Government parties on finding a solution.  Every time we have offered something, we have been repulsed and repelled by a tribal Taoiseach who sees anything that comes from anyone other than a Fianna Fáiler as unworthy of consideration.  We are in a bad place.  The road to recovery starts with recognising that the whole country is in a bad place.  As with an alcoholic, the Government must start by recognising that it needs to heal itself.For me, this is a nightmare being repeated.  When I came into this House in 1977, the economy had just recovered after the first and second oil crises.  The landslide that returned Jack Lynch as Taoiseach in that year turned a recovering economy into a basket case within four years.  I will not waste my time by giving Members a history lesson with which they are already familiar.  Fianna Fáil brought this country's economy to its knees at that time.  The Minister of State who is sitting on the Front Bench as I speak knows all about this, as he was heavily involved in Fianna Fáil at that time.  He recognises that he was a victim, in part, of the shafting of Martin O'Donoghue during that era.  We are here again, 30 years on.  For the second time, Fianna Fáil has brought this country's economy to the brink of bankruptcy.  As a young Deputy at the time — not unlike the Deputy from Meath East who spoke earlier — I can recall sitting at this side of the House during George Colley's inane first budget.  I was appalled by the economic illiteracy of the Fianna Fáil Deputies who cheered and applauded the budget, in which Mr. Colley boasted that the combined spending measures he had introduced represented a deficit to GDP ratio of 13%.  The ratio permitted under the Maastricht criteria is 3%.When the rainbow Government left office in 1997, this country had a vibrant, competitive and consciously focused economy that was creating more than 1,000 jobs a week.  It was heading for the eurozone.  At the time, its bond spread was close to, if not aligned with, the deutschmark.  We were exporting services and goods of the kind about which Deputy McGuinness spoke.  Ireland was seen as a country with a stable economy and as a good place in which to invest.  We were export-led and competitive, and we were producing goods and services.  Before I explain why that is no longer the case, I will explain why Fianna Fáil needs to recognise that it is not possible to get where one wants, with the support and respect of the public and this House, if one does not start by saying one is sorry.  The Government needs to say "okay, we screwed up".  The Taoiseach needs to admit that as Minister for Finance, and previously as Minister for Health and Children and as a senior Minister in the Cabinet, he was part of an inner leadership group — in so far as anyone could be part of such a group with Deputy Bertie Ahern — that screwed up.  He should apologise for that before setting out what he and his Government will do during the three years between now and the next general election.  I have not once heard an admission of a screw-up, or a word of apology, from the Taoiseach and his colleagues.  If they do not recognise the need to act in such a manner, they will not succeed with what they are trying to do at present.I would like to tell the House an anecdote to show how the Government screwed up.  In the spring of 1997, in the run-up to that year's general election, I was in Carrick-on-Shannon, County Leitrim, with the then Labour Party Deputy for the area, Mr. Declan Bree.  Front and back bench Deputies will be familiar with the usual sort of thing that happens when one of the Ministers of the day comes to visit.  On the occasion in question, I met some of the members of Carrick-on-Shannon Chamber of Commerce.  As we all know, Leitrim is not a heavily urbanised county.  Although it has a land mass twice the size of County Louth, it has a population of fewer than 27,000 people.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I am coming to that very point.  They said, "We want section 23" and I asked what part of Carrick-on-Shannon they wanted it for, to which they replied, "Oh no, we don't want to make a selection".  I asked what other places they wanted and was told: "We don't want to be competitive between one town or one village and another."  I asked them what exactly they would like and they said, "We want you to give section 23 to the whole of County Leitrim."My reaction was not unlike that of the Minister of State opposite, except I was trying to win votes for a man who repulsed votes, Mr. Declan Bree, and it was not easy.  However, that was precisely my reaction.  Some 15 months later, the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Charlie McCreevy, gave the entire upper Shannon basin section 23 status.  Four years ago we were building 90,000 houses because of the McCreevy madness that turned the productive export driven economy — precisely the one about which the Deputy is talking and which took us a long time to get to — into a gambling casino, an adjunct to the ATM of the Galway tent one might say, where people were built houses.  Go through Carrick-on-Shannon now, or Keshcarrigan or Dromad and a host of other areas and one finds empty houses.  The poor devil left holding the lease on the ownership of them is now at the end of the poncy sale into which Fianna Fáil turned the economy.  That is what has happened.  Anglo started it and it went on and on.We in Opposition are accused by the Taoiseach and others to the effect that nobody shouted stop or said anything, and that we were all in it together.  It happened, and Lehman Brothers brought it all down, etc.  This time last year, as the Dáil was rising, the Taoiseach was saying, in effect: "Stop talking down the economy, wake up and smell the roses, there is no problem."I gave a radio interview at the time and was asked by the Sunday Independent  to turn it into an article, which was published on 13 July, almost 51 weeks ago.  I said the following:The economic and financial crisis facing Ireland is much greater than the Government will admit.  The Taoiseach Brian Cowen was Minister for Finance when the storm clouds began to gather.  But he ignored the warning signals and the advice from independent commentators.Decisive action is required immediately — above and beyond the timid measures which were put through the Dáil on Thursday.  Honest leadership is now needed.  This government has been basking in the sunshine of the economic success which it inherited 11 years ago.  I am not sure it has the experience or management skills to get us out of the crisisBut here is what has to be done.  The Government needs to drastically cut current expenditure so as to bring it into line with the tax revenues which our declining economy is generating.  That will ensure that we will operate within the budgetary rules of the eurozone currency.  But it must also generate confidence and hope that our economy starts to grow again.  This means substantial investment in our productive infrastructure.Let's start at the top.  The Government must unilaterally repudiate the recent pay increases for itself, top civil servants and the judiciary and not merely postpone them as it has announced.  In addition the big pay increases to chief executives in the commercial semi-state companies should be cancelled.  Dáil deputies and senators should take a cut in salary and allowances.Time prevents me from reading the rest, but it is in the records.  Incidentally, the Government has never repudiated those increases.  They will be collected by Ministers when they retire.We were saying those type of things this time last year.  The Government side said there was no problem and went off and played golf.  They came back in September before Lehman Brothers went down and thought there was a problem and something should be done.  The spin budget was called in by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  It was a fiction and a farce that had to be corrected early in January and subsequently.  If the Government wants co-operation from this side of the House, listen to what we are saying.  We and Fine Gael have been saying it consistently.We need to get out of where we are and the Government needs to say it is sorry so that it becomes credible.  We have to look at where we will be for the next three years if there is not to be a general election, because we are all in this together.  There needs to be some recognition within Fianna Fáil that it got us into this mess and is — sadly from my viewpoint — in charge of the ship until the next general election.  The Government should take good ideas from wherever they come, and it has been given plenty of them.  Try to talk in the privacy of parliamentary rooms and remove the tribalism from the man from Offaly.  Share some of the concepts that Deputy McGuinness was talking about.  Nobody has a monopoly of good ideas, but there are plenty of ideas across this entire Chamber, and by God this country needs them.

Other than that, we got a series of statements, a reheating of the same old positions and no real engagement.  I take the Taoiseach's script as an example of that.There has been a good deal of discussion in the past couple of minutes about Lehman Brothers being the cause of the situation we are in, but it is more likely that future generations will say that it was the Lenihan brothers who got us into this situation.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I knew the Acting Chairman would.  That, of course, was a joke.To deal with this systematically, the first thing the Taoiseach said was that the Government's strategy "has been broadly endorsed by the IMF".  The IMF actually said: "The Irish economy is in the midst of an unprecedented economic correction.  The stress exceeds that being faced currently by any other advanced economy and matches episodes of the most severe economic distress in post-World War II history."Deputy Kennedy, commenting on that, said it was a wake-up call for the Opposition.  We are to blame for many things, and properly for some things, but by God we are not to blame for the way the economy has been crash dived by Fianna Fáil or even the Lenihan brothers.  The Taoiseach pointed out that the IMF prediction as recently as 2008 was for 3% growth this year.  He wanted to draw attention to the fact that we were, instead, facing a contraction of some 8%.  However, the interesting thing is that he did not refer to the IMF report for 2004, which warned about the extent, scale and duration of the property boom and said we had the biggest risk in Europe in an overheating housing market.  That was in 2004.The Taoiseach's third point is really interesting.  He said: "Regarding these aspects within my control as Minister for Finance, I moved to end the tax incentives that then existed for the property market.  In budget 2005 I announced a review of tax incentives.  In budget 2006, in line with the recommendations I announced a termination date of 31 July 2008."  Therein lies the problem.  I remember very well why he made that announcement in the budget of 2005.  It was because of the pressure on him from this side of the House.  We had spent so long hammering away about the tax breaks and tax incentives that were there for property.  I recall pursuing the Taoiseach at Question Time about the Kenny report.  I remember the battle with the then Taoiseach about his referral of the issue to the All-Party Committee on the Constitution — because he thought there was something in the Constitution impeding intervention by the State in the land question.  I remember Deputy Burton speaking on the tax shelters and tax breaks for property at virtually every Question Time.  That is why he announced it in 2005 but he did nothing until 31 July 2008, and the damage was done.Deputy Quinn has just traced comments we made and articles we wrote on this side of the House at that time.  I remember being on the Seán O'Rourke programme, and I have great respect for the man, with Deputy Brian Lenihan shortly after he became Minister for Finance.  This must be traceable.  It was perhaps at the end of June or July of last year.  The question was what I thought the Government could do.  I said one inevitability was that it would breach the Stability and Growth Pact figure because the borrowing requirement would inevitably be higher.  When one looks back now that was not very prescient, but the Minister's response was that this was typical tax-and-spend Labour Party, back to the old days of borrowing.  He said we will never exceed the 3% limit.  The record of that programme can be found.The Taoiseach says he refuses to get rid of stamp duty and said we were right not to heed calls from those who wanted to remove it.  As Deputy Gilmore pointed out today, the man who started that was former Minister and Deputy Michael McDowell.  It is important people remember these things.  Mr. McDowell said we would remove it because we do not need the money.  He did not say we would remove it because we want a soft landing or because the housing market is going into difficulty, but because we do not need the money.  This man had great pretensions about economic wizardry, and that was his position.The Taoiseach said he had a good record as Minister for Finance.  He stated:  "The cumulative current budget surplus for 2005, 2006 and 2007 amounted to €22 billion.  The national debt as a share of national income fell from 30% in 2004 to 23% in 2007".  That is all very well, but the IMF report, and it is a short report, points out that the Taoiseach's budget in 2007 alone contributed 3.5% of the structural deficit and for 2008 it added another 3.8%.  That is 6.8%.

When one asks the alcoholic how he is getting on he says he is great, he is taking the water, exercise and tablets.  That is what the Taoiseach says about the IMF and the economy, that he is now doing the right things.  Fair enough, the IMF broadly says that, but the damage is done.  The economy's liver is in terrible shape.  I agree with a great deal of what Deputy McGuinness said.  The merit of this debate was that before the House rises, as Deputy Quinn said, we would begin to see the cross-fertilisation of ideas, for what they are worth, in this House about how we get out of the situation we are in.

He says we must fix the banks, stabilise the public finances, and then we will get around to the economy and getting jobs moving again.  I do not deny we must fix the banks.  Fixing the banks up to now has meant pouring huge amounts of taxpayers' money into them.  While I accept we must have a functioning banking system and that we must get the public finances back into some kind of kilter, I do not accept the chronology that comes with the Taoiseach's recipe, that we must implement steps 1 and 2 before we start to think about step 3.I also agree with Deputy McGuinness about the remarks he makes about public sector reform.  We have paid lip service to it in this House for years.  On the day the Taoiseach took office he said it was his first target.  Deputy Bruton earlier referred to Whitaker and Lemass.  In the 1950s Whitaker and Lemass had a project, namely, the modernisation of Ireland.  We were going to open up as a trading nation and do business with the rest of the world.  We were going to mainstream mass education and join the European Economic Community.  This Government has no project.  Its only aim is to hang on and, like Mr. Micawber, it believes something will turn up.

Looking at this clapped out Government I have the same feeling of despair.  I am worried.Fine Gael made a serious mistake.  Moving a confidence motion here the day after the calamitous election results was politically wrong.  It has shored up the many disquieted people on the Government backbenches and the unfortunate Green Party members who were wobbling.  It was a mistake in terms of getting them out.

I also thank Deputy Quinn for his recognition of my modest efforts in the former Department of Economic Planning and Development but more for his recognition of the need to be generous to former Minister and Deputy, Martin O'Donoghue, who has been blamed for many problems for which he should never have been blamed.We are in uncharted financial and economic territory.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I am very sorry about the thousands of people who are out of jobs.  However, we do not come in here simply to engage in rhetoric or abuse.  I agree with the point Deputy Rabbitte finished on.  We have a responsibility to come in here and try to agree the best solutions to this situation.  I agree with Deputy McGuinness's point, which Deputy Quinn took up.  There is a responsibility on everybody in this House to realise wisdom does not reside on any one side of the House.  That is patent hubris.  Wisdom is to be found in every part of this House, in the humblest, newest member of this House as well as those who think they are here by dint of ownership of the place.We all have a serious responsibility.  There is a distortion in public debate in this country and it is not confined to those of us on the political benches.  It is to be found in the distortion of academic commentary.  If anybody wants to examine that point further they should read an article by a Trinity College academic in today's  The Irish Times.  I do not know if the best possible solutions are the solutions the Government is putting forward, but I believe they are honest efforts.  To suggest as has been done time and again in rhetoric across this House that they have been done to bail out friends is disingenuous and demeans political debate.  However, at the end of the day it does not move us any closer to a solution.  For example, when dealing with the NAMA legislation we will need all the ingenuity of all the Members from all parties and none in this House to ensure it is right.  Perhaps for these few urgent weeks we could leave some of the rhetoric behind.Deputy Rabbitte accurately quoted from the IMF report.  He did so in a way that was amusing and apposite because he wanted to make a specific point regarding the Taoiseach's speech.  It is equally true that the 2009 IMF report is striking in the endorsement it gives, particularly on the NAMA issue.  It is well worth our while being accurate as to what that says.  The IMF analysis on future fiscal adjustments that we should focus more on expenditure than on taxation is also in line with relevant thinking on all sides of the House.  I was fascinated by and must look up the article the Deputy read into the record.  I suspect I will be able to quote it against him into the future.  How right he is.  We need to consider all aspects of public policy.  There is not a simple solution or magic powder.  Tempting as it is to score political points against each other, we are in a more serious place than that.The IMF highlighted the importance of improving competitiveness.  Deputy O'Donnell made the point that we lost sight of competitiveness.  We lost the run of ourselves, not just in government or in politics.  We paid ourselves too much and created State agencies that are a monstrous imposition on us.  We have quangos we do not need.

As Deputy Quinn knows, over the past 30 years there has been a monstrous failure by the political class in this country to deal with the issue of public service reform.  We are all guilty.  We have not taken it on.  It is now more than 30 years since the Devlin report was published.  Do we have a better administrative system now than we had then?  We do not.  We have a more costly administrative system.  We have an administrative system that is a major imposition on the taxpayers.  Are the people getting value for money?  They are not.  We are all guilty in that.  I accept my part of the blame and Opposition Deputies must accept theirs.  Anyone who has been in politics during the past 30 years has found it easier to acquiesce than to be innovative.  Deputy Rabbitte was absolutely right in his analysis of what Whitaker, Lemass and those people had right.  They had a grand project and a belief in this nation, and we have lost that.I wish to make a few points about some of the policies because that is why I rose to speak.  I do not suggest that Government policies represent perfection.  However, I suggest that they deserve a more honest analysis than they have been receiving.  I mentioned in particular an academic analysis today.  The banking guarantee scheme for all of the foibles and concerns we had about it at the time, has broadly worked.  It has helped to create at least some degree of certainty that banks will continue.  Would it have been better to let a bank go to the wall?  Perhaps it would have been — I do not know.  However, I know with certainty that if the guarantee had not been introduced when it was, the people who would have paid the real cost would have been the small people.  Deputies will recall what happened when Northern Rock ran into difficulties.  We had the extraordinary spectre of decent men and women, usually old people, queuing around the block.  It would have been fundamentally wrong because a failure in our system of regulation had caused something appallingly monstrous to occur in our banking system to subject the public to that abuse.NAMA is a critical step forward and is a good innovation.  The IMF's endorsement is important because we need to do something.  It is not just a case of doing something — we need to make absolutely certain.  As Deputies Rabbitte and O'Donnell recognised, a functioning banking system is the first thing we need if we are to have economic recovery.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2009-07-03 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I ask the Minister of State to give way.  Nobody is disputing the necessity for a NAMA or a vehicle that strips the toxic debt out of the banks.  However, the issue we raised on these benches and that the IMF report corroborates is that when it comes to pricing the assets it may have been better to temporarily nationalise the big two when doing that.  We would still need a NAMA.

The suggestion that NAMA has been proposed simply as a way of bailing out friends, cronies or people who attended the Galway Races tent — thank God I never did — is disingenuous.  It also devalues political debate.  While, as all those present know, I am not shy about scoring political points and am the first to admit it, we have gone past the point of having a bit of fun and games with each other.  We will need to make NAMA work.  Deputy O'Donnell asked when NAMA would be in operation.  The sooner the better is my answer.

The reality is that the Minister has outlined a timetable.I wish to conclude because I am taking the indulgence of the Chair.  It would be wrong if I, as Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, did not make a few comments on the importance of Europe to us and where we are.  In 12 or 13 weeks we will face another referendum.  It is more critical than any decision we made in any previous referendum other than the decision the people made to jump into the dark and join the European Economic Community in 1972.  If there was ever a time when Europe needs to be strong and focused, this is that time.  The world faces remarkable challenges and not just the economic challenge or global warming.  Later this year Europe will face a major energy crisis.  We need a strong Europe that is fit for purpose.  The only people in Europe of the 500 million citizens that can make Europe stronger now are the Irish people.  The Irish people have shown great perspicacity and extraordinary courage in the past in taking decisions.I do not know why and what failure on our part encouraged the people to be timorous on 12 June 2008.  It was temerity allied to considerable misleading propaganda that forced people to say they did not know enough about Europe.  We have a combined responsibility.  We all made mistakes during the last referendum campaign.  There was sniping on different sides in this House and we were all culpable.  On this occasion we really must work together.  It will not be easy to get it over the line and it should not be taken for granted.  We should never take the people for granted.  An honest effort to address the concerns of the people was made.  Those concerns were really well recognised by a committee of both Houses.  We should now have the courage to lead.  We are elected not just to be followers but also to lead and to make certain the people take a decision that is informed, focused and right.  They will do that by voting "Yes".I will say goodnight at that.
