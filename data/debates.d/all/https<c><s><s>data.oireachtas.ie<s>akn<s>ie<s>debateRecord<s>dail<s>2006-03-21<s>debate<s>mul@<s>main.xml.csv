#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 8, inclusive, together.The Government continues to support a full independent public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. We have made clear that we want to see the standard agreed at Weston Park, and set by Judge Cory, adhered to. We continue to share the concern of the Finucane family, and indeed of Judge Cory, that the new Inquiries Act, under which the British Government intends to have the Finucane case investigated, will not meet these standards. We have raised these concerns directly with the British Government.The Government welcomes the motion in this case, passed unanimously by the House on 8 March. I have met the Finucane family on many occasions. Most recently, I met Geraldine Finucane and other family members during my visit to the United States. I had a more detailed meeting with the family on 27 February in Dublin, prior to the recent debate in the House. I have on all occasions assured Mrs. Finucane of my firm support for their efforts to achieve the full truth concerning this disturbing case.I discussed the Pat Finucane case with a number of Senators and Congressmen on Capitol Hill last week. It is clear that the Finucane family also has considerable support there and that the concerns of this House are widely shared in Washington.I also raised the Finucane case at my meeting last week with President Bush. The US Administration has an ongoing interest in this case and I briefed the President on the current situation. I particularly thanked the President for raising the matter with Prime Minister Blair following our meeting last year.While in Washington, I also briefly discussed this case with the Northern Ireland Secretary of State. I told him that there continued to be fundamental concerns regarding the proposed inquiry and that we remained fully supportive of the Finucane family.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1	With all due respect to the Taoiseach, it is not a question of the reassurances he gave anybody and everybody. It is about what Mr. Blair said to the Taoiseach, when they met during the past two weeks, about a full proper public inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane. How does the Taoiseach interpret the intention of the British Government to hold the inquiry into that murder on the basis of legislation which can and will see vital evidence withheld? Does he believe the British Government wants to cover up the collusion between the killers of Pat Finucane and the forces of the British State? Did he put that point baldly to Prime Minister Blair when he met him?The Northern Ireland Office stated the motion demanding a proper inquiry passed by the Dáil was fundamentally flawed and misleading. What did the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hain, state to the Taoiseach regarding that? Did he contact the Government verbally or in written form following on from that motion? If so, what did he state exactly?When will the Taoiseach leave diplomatic niceties aside and square up to Prime Minister Blair on this issue? We have been around the garden in the same way seeking information on the horrific bombings in Dublin, in which collusion is also suspected, and we are no further forward. Will we be back in this House again next year with the Taoiseach having failed to get from the British Government any real commitment to bringing out the truth of this horrific murder? Is it not time for him to deliver on this and expose Prime Minister Blair in front of the world as a hypocrite if necessary——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Deputy speaks as though he is not aware of what has been going on over the past long period. What Prime Minister Blair and the Secretary of State stated was that they do not intend changing the Inquiries Act. Our position at every level, such as through the motion passed in this House, our position at meetings over the past year or year and a half with the British Government and in the United States and through a range of other civil rights groups and other groups, is that we oppose that position.The Secretary of State has written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister has replied to that letter within recent days. It comes down to the basic issue that the inquiry under the UK Inquiries Act 2005 will not be regarded as fully independent. That is the view we, all those who support our view, and the House stated. To make it clear and simple, the reason for that view is that under the new legislation the responsible Minister, not the chair, maintains significant control over the inquiry. For example, no matter how good the judge would be in carrying out the inquiry, he or she might see restricted material but could not use it, publish it or show it to the family or lawyers.It is our view and that of the family, civil rights groups and Deputy Higgins that this is clearly not covered in what we set out to get, which was a full, independent, public judicial inquiry. That is the position and as of now, I can give the House no comfort. There is no question of diplomatic niceties. This has been raised at endless meetings which have been far from diplomatic niceties. The British Government will not change.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Will the Taoiseach give his views on the reluctance of the British Government to grant a full public inquiry into this case? Does the Taoiseach accept that the inquiry on offer is in effect a British Government controlled inquiry into collusion by British Government security services? It is a nonsense. It is not an inquiry at all. The Inquiries Act restricts the control of the inquiry judges, allows for the deletion of details of findings made by the inquiry and effectively transfers control of the inquiry from the judges to a Minister.Does the Taoiseach accept that if the Finucane case were to proceed under the terms of that Act the end result would be another cover up, which is not acceptable? Is it not time to end the cap in hand approach on this issue and change tactics to demand a full public independent inquiry? If there is good faith between the two Governments, surely that can be achieved?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I agree with most of what Deputy Gregory said. It is clearly not what was envisaged as a full independent public judicial inquiry in the Weston Park proposals. This is new legislation introduced by the British Government and the restrictive clause in that legislation, which would effectively restrict the judge's handling of the information, renders it useless. It would not restrict the judge in seeing or reading the information but would restrict him or her in using it in public, publishing it or showing it to the family or its lawyers. For that reason it is of no use.The British Government, under significant pressure from all sides, has shown no inclination to move and in a recent letter the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland said that the Government intends to proceed with the inquiry. I spoke to him again last week in Washington and told him that he would be doing that without the support of the Government, or any parties in the Oireachtas, and the many human rights groups involved in this case. My officials spoke to Geraldine Finucane today. We keep in constant touch with the family and continue to help and support it in any way we can.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Taoiseach has a special relationship with the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, who has said he does not intend to lead the Labour Party into the next general election. Critics and political correspondents have their own views as to when that might happen. Given the Prime Minister's responses in the House of Commons over the past 12 months about the necessity for the truth to be known, he should understand that the restriction in the amended Act inhibits this information from being made available. There is no point going ahead with a restricted inquiry into the murder of Pat Finucane if the full truth cannot be made known.I do not know whether the Taoiseach has discussed in private with the Prime Minister the revulsion that people feel when they ask why the British Government will not have a full-scale public inquiry under the original Act. I agree with the Taoiseach that it is difficult to move this issue on. If the Prime Minister wishes to leave behind a legacy of progress and reform, the best quality public service and the truth, can the Taoiseach enter his mindset to achieve some closure on this murder? Can he persuade the Prime Minister that if the inquiry proceeds as proposed, and the Finucane family does not become involved, it is a useless entity and restricted findings will not bring closure or truth? Will the Taoiseach give the Prime Minister a copy of the unanimous motion from this House, which I was glad to see people supported, and express to him on behalf of the entire Parliament, the representatives of the people, how important we feel it is that this matter be finalised in an open and fully accountable fashion? In so far as Mr. Blair wants his legacy to be judged, it would be in his own interests to be a prime minister who saw to it that a restriction in the amended Act would be lifted, or that the inquiry should be held under the original Act. That would be a great day's work for politics, for both governments and in terms of finding out the truth for the Finucane family.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I do not disagree with anything Deputy Kenny said but it is worth going back over some recent history. The Bloody Sunday inquiry took place in part during the life of the government of which Deputy Kenny was part, but the British Government did not want such an inquiry. It took a great deal of persuasion and in the end it was the Prime Minister who ruled, against much opposition, to operate a successful inquiry. Nevertheless there were difficulties involving so-called "soldier A" and "soldier B", people who were not named, and the sessions not held in public session, and so on. I believe most people, though not all, were satisfied with it. It was enormously costly, involving some £100 million, but it was highly important.In more recent years, the British Government, when involved in some other inquiries with which I am not familiar, looked at the legislation and decided to bring in the Inquiries Act, which was clearly in gestation for some time.The British Government, including the Prime Minister and the Attorney General, say they intend to bring forward the arrangements for this inquiry. They clearly believe the truth can be established through an inquiry under the new Act, and that this is the only way they can do it. This is the belief right across the system. As well as talking to the Prime Minister I have talked to the Deputy Prime Minister and to others. We do not take that view. I have brought the Attorney General to some of the meetings with the Finucane family and he is assisting them as best he can. We take the view that the proposed British inquiry will not work.Knowing that we could not take thousands of cases — as time passes there are more and more people who feel very little was done about their cases at the time of the Troubles — as a result of so many terrible deaths on all sides, we decided to take a representative sample, and that was the Weston Park agreement. The issue then became one of how we were to arbitrate, which is when we suggested an international judge and legal team.That is where Judge Cory came in. He is considered one of the most eminent judges in the world, and though elderly he agreed to take on the job. He put a great amount of effort into it, even when his wife was dying — she subsequently died. Judge Cory deliberated, and I understood that was the end of the matter. We have to honour our commitment in Ireland, such as in the Breen case, which we have begun. All that happened prior to the final position on the Act. On the restricted case, at least there was much progress, with a good deal of debate on the amendments. It was an Act in which we and the Nationalist parties in the North took a great interest. There was a good deal of input and comments on the Act but in regard to the restrictive position, people have their own judgment. I have my view but there is no point in giving personal opinions on why they would have that view because I cannot prove it. During the past year I have tried to work out why they might have such a restrictive view.Whatever the reasons, and many people have suggested several other reasons, whoever is right or wrong does not matter. The fact is that we are trying to ascertain whether there was collusion by the British forces at whatever level. The inevitable questions are where they went within the system, whether they moved up through the system, went into the political end or whether they were in the Northern Ireland Office. Given the restrictive notice, how can one say it is a full, independent or public judicial inquiry when the judge has a right to see things but cannot publish them, say them in public or show them to the family? How is that a full, independent or public judicial inquiry? It is not any one of those three. That is the position. I wish it was just an issue between Mr. Tony Blair and myself at this stage because the powers of persuasion might persuade him but it is not at that level. This is a strongly held view of the British Government and I believe it is wrong.To answer the Deputy's last question, I was in London on the day the Dáil debated the motion. I gave Mr. Blair the motion, told him its history, said all the political parties were involved in it and that I believed it would be unanimous. I also told him that the House would be critical of him and his Government on this issue. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hain, has written to us to say he is still going ahead with the inquiry. I told him last week he could do that if he wanted to. He told me it could cost €50 million to which I replied he could spend that amount of money on it but it would not convince anybody in the collective interest of this case. I have spent hours on the Finucane case because it was picked out as one of the three. I still do not think we have got to the position we want. I would like to tell the House that another meeting, shouting exercise or table banging exercise would change the British Government, but at this stage I must be honest with the House and say I do not see it moving on this position.The only other new issue is that there is a possibility that the Houses on Capitol Hill will take our motion and also pass similar motions. We briefed the President and the US Administration in the White House last week. Without taking too much licence, I do not think they disagree with our view on this issue, whatever about other issues.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Where does that leave us? Has the Pat Finucane inquiry run into the sand? Is that what the Taoiseach is saying? He referred to the cases selected at Weston Park. I presume he will recall the remarks of Judge Peter Cory at the time when he said: "Without public scrutiny, doubts based solely on myth and suspicion will linger long, fester and spread their malignant infection throughout [the Republic] and Northern Ireland community". I presume the Taoiseach still agrees with that and agrees with the judge that when the term "public inquiry" was used then, it was in the context as understood in 2001. At the end of this Question Time on this matter, what point have we reached?This is not the only unresolved murder in Northern Ireland and sadly it is not the only one where there was suspected collusion by the security forces. I note that on a matter I raised in this House by way of the Adjournment and otherwise some time ago, the killing of young Raymond McCord, the Taoiseach has agreed, and I thank him for it, to meet his father and whomsoever he decides to accompany him. Perhaps the Taoiseach will take the opportunity to comment on that as well.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	10	The point to where it has brought us is unsatisfactory. The Secretary of State, Peter Hain, told me on Thursday that he was going ahead with his inquiry and that they are seeking a venue. I am told they have a venue for the autumn. They are also seeking a judge. I understand from international connections that they are having great difficulty getting a judge. The legal world has been quite active in putting out reasons a judge should not take up the position. I have been trying to help in doing that too. That is the position.Unfortunately, the position on this one is that neither of us can move. I talked to the collective group dealing with the Prime Minister on this issue. I cannot move because I cannot honestly say, and we have been through this with the finest legal people, that it is a full, independent or public judicial inquiry because a judge in this case could have his hands tied as the Minister has the responsibility. That is the unfortunate situation. If they want to go ahead, I cannot stop them but it will be with the opposition of effectively everybody. Judge Cory has recently restated his position; it is not just a case of what he said at the time. At this stage the Government, the Dáil, the human rights groups, the international legal profession, Judge Cory and the Finucane family are calling for this but the British Government is not indicating any movement.To answer the Deputy's straight question, they are saying they are going ahead. If they do, no matter what they come up with, and I have had to listen to people saying it will take five years to do it and it will cost €50 million, nobody will ever believe it, at least none of the people we must try to represent. Perhaps some people in the United Kingdom will believe it, although I have my doubts about that too, especially where the legal profession is concerned.I received the Deputy's letter. Earlier in the year I got my officials to meet that brave father. I am meeting him tomorrow with his representatives. As he has pointed out, he used always to believe that collusion was on the Nationalist side, but as I believe he explained to the Deputy, there appears to be considerable collusion in his case. I will meet him tomorrow, as the Deputy requested of me.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	11	On my Question No. 5 concerning the murder of Pat Finucane and the need for a proper public inquiry, does the Taoiseach agree it is unacceptable for any security forces, particularly those north of the Border, to be involved directly or indirectly in the murder of a human rights lawyer or any other citizen such as Seamus Ludlow? Does the Taoiseach accept that such a murder would cause enormous damage to the rule of law in any democratic society? Does he accept that the British security forces were up to their necks in killings and murders on this island over a 30-year period and has he pointed that out to the Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and his Government?Also, does the Taoiseach share my major concerns about recent allegations that one of the Greysteel massacre murderers, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for 12 murders at Greysteel and Castlerock, was a paid British agent who received £50,000 through a bogus Special Branch account following his release in 2000? Does the Taoiseach regard that as a disgrace and unacceptable, especially in the current era of co-operation? What will the Taoiseach do about these serious allegations of collusion? Does he accept that the truth must come out if we are serious about the peace process and a healing process?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I will not answer on individual cases because I do not have the facts on them. It is clear that there are many cases related to allegations of collusion in Northern Ireland during the Troubles. The hundreds of cases involving thousands of deaths and serious injury that occurred between the late 1960s and the mid-1990s — in many cases later than that but thankfully not in the same number — will obviously not all be subject to full inquiry, and that is why it was decided to take a sample number of these cases. The work of the Northern Ireland Office, Nuala O'Loan and the Chief Constable in setting up a historical data office is a good way to tackle this problem.We will continue to put our efforts into helping the Finucane family by exerting the maximum political pressure on the British Government. We are determined to meet the needs of the family. There is a view that in the absence of securing an agreement, particularly from the family, on an inquiry, there may be little point in holding an inquiry at all, bearing in mind the expense involved. That is a matter, however, for the British Government. It would be an enormous tragedy if the truth of this case did not come out and I hope a way can be found to meet the needs of the family. The British Government knows that. We have considered all the legal processes and have given the British Government our views on that. We find the current situation unsatisfactory and we will continue to argue the case in the coming months for Geraldine Finucane and her family, as well as for some of the other high profile cases. Otherwise, it will go on for years and will not end. We will particularly focus on this case because in this instance we got an agreement on a process and we will continue to exert our efforts.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Taoiseach mentioned that a full independent public inquiry was needed into the murder of Pat Finucane and in other cases, and that this was a sample of six cases. Having listened to Michael Finucane speaking to the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, it seemed that the six cases were considered to be of such significance that they required an examination by an independent judge. They were not just a sample, but were of particular significance because of the circumstances surrounding them and the evidence to date. Will the Taoiseach clarify that? Did he say that he is not sure if there is collusion, or does he believe that there is a certain amount of collusion and does not know the full extent of it? Is the Taoiseach aware that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hain, when he met the Finucane family on 7 February 2006, conceded that it was not a question of whether there was collusion, but how much collusion went on? It is important to clarify that point.Is the Taoiseach aware that the Finucane family believes he is essential to their efforts to bring about the justice they have been denied for so long? It is no wonder it is difficult to find a judge to do the job. Has the Taoiseach taken on board the statement by the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Hain, that the amended Inquiries Act was necessary to secure the co-operation of the security services? Does that not indicate that we are effectively dealing with a Government that can no longer claim to be governing, that it is being told what to do by the security services?Has the Taoiseach put it to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, that we run the risk of the United Kingdom no longer being able to account for itself as a democracy if the security services dictate the legislation that is required and the level of inquiry permissible? Does the Taoiseach not see reason to put it to the Prime Minister very seriously that it is not acceptable in any civilised, democratic society for the security services to dictate the extent of an inquiry? Has he put that position to the Prime Minister?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	14	When responding to the first question, I did not wish to convey the impression that all the names had been put into a hat and a few main cases pulled out. Deputy Sargent will recall that we took some from the Nationalist side and some from the Unionist or loyalist side. In all we took a balanced selection of six cases, although we could have taken any number. The case about which Deputy Rabbitte spoke could also have been one. I have personally dealt with literally dozens in recent years.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Were they significant?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	16	All were significant. However, they will not all receive full sworn inquiries as that would be impossible. It is good that there is a historical office to examine cases because some people hold the view very strongly that many of those cases got very little investigation at the time. Whether that is understandable, it is a source of great anxiety and long-term hurt to the families. It is deeply upsetting for them and they want to state their case. Many years ago Deputy Sargent raised the prospect of a peace and reconciliation commission, which I support, because it would at least be of some help to people if they could put their case. I do not claim that it would resolve matters, but even if it achieves no more, being able to record their position and how they feel is an issue for many of the families affected.The Deputy asked about collusion, which I have always believed took place, including in the case of Mr. Pat Finucane. I have asked many times in this House, the House of Commons and on Capitol Hill whether anyone would be surprised if, after publication of the report on Mr. Finucane's murder, headlines across the world proclaimed that evidence of collusion had been found. Quite frankly, it would be news to no one. We would be interested to find out what level of collusion obtained, how high up the chain of command it extended and how it operated. However, the headline would surprise no one. That is the truth of the system in Britain, America and elsewhere.Deputy Sargent quoted Mr. Peter Hain. I said I have suspicions on the matter, but I have no evidence or proof. However, I believe that there is some significant reason. That is why I have said that I cannot explain this, never mind stand over it, which I am not prepared to do. If a judge is restricted from publishing something or showing information to the victim's family or their lawyers, how can one call that a full independent judicial inquiry?

While it seems that political opinion in the UK differs little in this respect, we cannot put this forward as being what was envisaged in Weston Park. I deeply appreciate that we secured a full, independent, public and judicial inquiry into the Bloody Sunday case. However, I am not in a position to justify something which I am advised was not envisaged.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	21	Has the Taoiseach raised with Prime Minister Blair the disgraceful statement from the Northern Ireland Office in response to the all-party motion unanimously agreed in this House? The Northern Ireland statement claimed the motion was both flawed and misleading. Is the Taoiseach aware this statement was issued before the debate took place in this House? If the Taoiseach has not already done so, will he protest, in the strongest possible terms, to the British Prime Minister? Has the Dáil motion been formally conveyed to the British Prime Minister by letter or by the Minister for Foreign Affairs? If so, can Members have a reply to it?The Taoiseach has always expressed pessimism regarding the prospects of progress on the issue of collusion. There are powerful forces within the British political and military establishment who are blocking this and many other inquiries. Does the Taoiseach agree they must be faced down on the issue of collusion and if they are not confronted by Prime Minister Blair on this issue, they will continue to block the wider peace process?As my party leader has asked in the past, will the Taoiseach call a special, specific summit with the British Prime Minister solely devoted to the issue of collusion?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The answer to the first question is "Yes". As I stated to Deputy Kenny, I was in 10 Downing Street on the day of the motion. Admittedly it was before the debate, but I conveyed the motion and the reason behind it. Since then, I have conveyed it to the Secretary of State, Mr. Hain, who has written to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, regarding this issue. The Minister will reply to it.We secured a favourable position from the British Government regarding Bloody Sunday and many other issues. However, the response to this case is not in line with the strategy on which we worked for five years, starting with the Weston Park talks and followed by the great work performed by Judge Cory. Admittedly, there were delays in the process throughout this period. Then, in 2004 the British Government decided to change the law and move away from the 1921 Act, which delayed matters further. The form of the inquiry now proposed has been rejected as being inadequate by Judge Cory, the Finucane family, the Government, the Dáil and human rights groups, on the basic issue I have noted, namely, that the inquiry under the new law will not be regarded as being fully independent as we do not believe that the collusion issue will be properly addressed under this system.There is no necessity for a separate summit. While Prime Minister Blair is probably fed up with listening to me raising this issue, I have an obligation to make him even more so. That is what I intend to do.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I refer the Deputy to a previous reply to Question No. 11 of 29 June 2005.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department, supported by Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management, ADM, Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. It is, therefore, a matter for each Department to report on progress on the implementation of RAPID and details of funding allocations to the projects that fall within their remit.However, Departments were asked in 2005 to track funding against specific projects submitted in RAPID plans from each area. I am informed by Pobal that Departments have, to date, reported spend of the order of €337 million in RAPID areas since the inception of the programme. It should be noted that this amount relates solely to specific projects in RAPID plans and does not include funding to RAPID areas by Departments, which are in addition to the RAPID plans.As I stated previously, I believe that despite a slow start, the RAPID programme is now making a valuable contribution in disadvantaged communities. However, as the Deputy will appreciate, tackling disadvantage will require long-term commitment by Government and in this regard, I believe that the RAPID programme should continue beyond 2006.The programme is now progressing on a number of levels in tandem and clearly the benefits at local level are becoming evident. In the first instance, many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans are now being dealt with more effectively at local level. A dedicated fund of €8.8 million has been put in place in 2006 to support small-scale capital projects through co-funding with other Departments or local agencies as appropriate. I announced a number of co-funded schemes this year.As for the larger projects from RAPID plans that have already been submitted to Departments, these will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect that Departments will now be dealing with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions. Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will also continue as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Special provision was made by the Government for RAPID areas under the dormant accounts plan. RAPID-drugs task force-CLÁR areas have benefited from 60.8% of the €63.1 million in funding allocated to date. The next round of the dormant accounts disbursement will provide approximately €11.5 million specifically to support priority projects in RAPID areas. Discussions are ongoing with Departments regarding prioritisation of other non-capital actions included in the AIT plans.As the Deputy will be aware, the RAPID programme is running in conjunction with the National Development Plan 2000-2006. While no formal decisions have been taken on the lifetime of the RAPID programme, the indications are that it will continue post 2006.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I thank the Minister for the reply. I am conscious that we discussed this a few months ago but I am still trying to comprehend the RAPID programme, the commitments made under it and exactly how one will measure the achievements arising from it. While it is probably the right way to proceed, what can the Department do to measure the benefits of the programme and how good RAPID is? The Minister said it should continue after 2006. I agree, but I want to see exactly how this can be measured and the results coming from it.That last time we spoke the review was to be undertaken by each Department and they have since come back stating they spent €337 million, according to the Minister. Did the Department give a measurement tool or what results were obtained from that process? Was the Department satisfied with the money spent or where can we improve on it?What performance indicators is the Government setting down for the future? Some €377 million is a long way short of the €2 billion that was announced. We argued previously over who announced it, but it has been announced and we have proof of it.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	26	It might have been the Taoiseach, not the Minister, who announced it. From where exactly will the rest of this money come? Is the €2 billion figure to be reviewed or what is the target of spend under the RAPID programme? If it is not €2 billion, is it €1 billion or €800 million? What exactly is the figure and what does the Minister hope to achieve from it?The RAPID programme was supposed to tackle social disadvantage etc. Unfortunately social disadvantage has worsened in the recent past. In that case, how can the Minister say the RAPID programme is working?Some 60% of students leave school before completing the leaving certificate examination in many disadvantaged areas. That is evidence. The proof has been recorded. More than 1,000 children do not make it into secondary school from primary school and nobody can account for where they are or why they have left. More than 120,000 children still live in consistent poverty. Some 50,000 households are on local authority housing waiting lists. The UN report states that more than 600,000 or 15% of people in Ireland live below the poverty line or are at risk of poverty. With all this evidence, are we making progress? How does the Minister propose to prove in future that we are making progress, which is my biggest concern, and that we are getting value for money?

On this famous statement, to which people keep referring, of somebody referring in some way to €2 billion, my suspicion — I cannot find the reference anywhere and I went looking — is that it said X amount of money was available for social inclusion measures in the national development plan, and that relates to the original RAPID programme and how we have changed it.RAPID began as a re-prioritisation of existing spend on social inclusion measures under the national development plan so that it would be front-loaded in disadvantaged areas. Previously, under NDPs those who were best able to make the applications got the money and, therefore, we tried to make sure the funding under the national development plan would be allocated in RAPID areas. I suspect, in that context, funding for social inclusion was mentioned. However, I have looked up the press releases issued at the time and could not find a reference to this. It is difficult, therefore, to make a comparison with something I cannot find. It was not mentioned in the press releases when RAPID was established.

While Pobal has commissioned a review, the most powerful performance indicator is the AITs in the communities. If I am told by the teams the programme is working, I have much more faith in that than all the commentary of the external gurus.

One of the speakers said they were doubters of the process but that it had worked. It is working because many different strands have been added to it and every allocation has had an immediate effect on the ground because communities are given confidence that they can influence issues. These areas have been prioritised under the dormant accounts fund, which gives them specific money to spend. We have pushed hard on the co-ordination. The Deputy referred to many statistics but both of us know it will not be easy to solve this problem. We have laid good foundations on which to build. The four or five communities involved would not want us to scrap these foundations and move in a new direction because that always happened in the past. They want us to build and improve.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I have no plans to introduce further dormant accounts legislation. As I indicated in reply to Question No. 913 on this topic on 25 January 2006, the Government is fully committed to providing supports to vulnerable Irish communities living abroad. This commitment is clearly demonstrated by the allocation of significant funding directly from the Exchequer to support emigrant organisations. In 2005 alone, more than €8.25 million was allocated for such services and this figure will increase by 45% in 2006 to more than €12 million. This allocation demonstrates the Government's continued commitment to funding emigrant organisations without the need to expend time and resources on new legislation or to specifically earmark dormant accounts funding.With regard to the dormant accounts fund, disbursements are designed to assist three broad categories of persons, those who are economically or socially disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. In light of the significant funding for emigrant organisations as outlined above, I intend that allocations from dormant accounts in 2006 will remain focused on tackling disadvantage in Ireland. In this regard, following Government approval, I announced details on 4 January 2006 concerning the allocation of €24 million for the purpose of supporting programmes and projects tackling economic and social disadvantage.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	33	Does the Minister of State agree the Government had no problem introducing legislation to convert the dormant accounts fund into a slush fund to aid it in the run-up to the next general election? Does he further agree that a significant amount lodged to the dormant accounts fund came from bank accounts belonging to emigrants to England, in particular? They lodged money in Irish banks with the intention of returning to Ireland and using it, but that never happened. Does the Minister of State concur that equity and fairness is an issue in this regard and that an appropriate amount, based on the proceeds of accounts of emigrants who intended to return but did not do so, should be used to support emigrant services?The task force on emigrant services recommended the provision of €34 million for such services by 2005. In 2006, €12 million will be provided, one third of the recommended allocation. It is not the case that great things are being done for our emigrants. Does the Minister of State agree that not alone should the €34 million recommended by the task force be provided, but additional funding should be provided through the dormant accounts fund and it is incumbent on the Government to introduce amending legislation? It would not be as complicated as the legislation introduced to convert the dormant accounts fund into a slush fund.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I do not agree the money collected from the dormant accounts of emigrants should be used for emigrant services. That is not the direction the Government is taking. We have agreed three categories for the disbursement of funds and these funds assist people in disadvantaged areas. We do not have data on the locations of accounts, for example, how many were in Ballymun, Ballyfermot or Ballybunion, or how many were held by people living abroad or in Ireland. We will not go down that road because if we did, the money would not be invested in disadvantaged areas, given that it is likely few of the accounts were held by people from these areas. Funding will be provided for the three categories agreed by Government.Significant funding is being invested in emigrant services. I acknowledge the Deputy's comments on the task force recommendation but funding this year has increased by 45% and that is huge by any standard. Given that the funding is on such a curve, additional funding will be provided in the coming years. This year's budget is 12 times what it was seven or eight years ago. Significant funding is being allocated to emigrant groups. Funding could be spread thinly but the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the sponsoring Department, is looking after such groups and it is not our intention to allocate money from the dormant accounts fund in this regard. Since that Department is providing funding, it is not our intention to provide money from dormant accounts, while accepting that money is needed in this area. Money is being provided by the sponsoring Department and whether it should have been provided years ago is another issue.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I cannot fathom the Minister of State's logic regarding what the Government decided. Money in the dormant accounts fund is used for emigrant services and for the purposes he mentioned. Will the Minister of State at least acknowledge that a substantial number of dormant accounts, the proceeds of which were diverted into the dormant accounts fund, were held by emigrants to England, in particular? The report of the task force on emigrant services was accepted by the Government in August 2002 but only one third of the recommended budget will be provided this year. Does the Minister of State not agree that if dormant accounts money is additional to State funding within the State, the funding for emigrants should be dealt with similarly? There is inequity in the situation. Many of our people in Britain, in particular older people, are in need and the services for them require additional funding. We should remember these people. They did not go to Britain by choice but because Ireland could not provide them with a living. A proportion of the dormant account funds should be used to help those who went to Britain and who have fallen on bad times, whatever the reason.

The Deputy may want to know whether it is possible some of the accounts were held by people abroad. I am sure some were. We are spending the money on social and economic disadvantage.

It is in receipt of substantial core funding of approximately €80,000 per annum. In addition FÁS provides funding through its special category community employment scheme for the trainees and supervisor of the project.An application for additional assistance from the emerging needs fund has been made on behalf of the project. This application, with a large number of others, is being considered at present and a decision on the matter will be made soon.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	44	When will a decision be made? That was my question. I have raised this question on a number of occasions, but do not seem able to get that information. Will the Minister of State clarify whether there is a deadline on this and whether he intends to make a decision or leave it on his desk?Is the Minister of State aware that concerned people in the north-west inner city were encouraged by the health board, the drugs task force and everybody involved in the drugs problem in that area to create a process for rehabilitation and reintegration into the community? This group, the first community-based group to provide a workable and successful rehabilitation project, set up the project in good faith, but the funding door has been slammed in its face. It is not good enough that the Minister of State should speak of substantial funding when this group is running a project for heroin addicts on a shoestring with the assistance of a FÁS scheme. Is that the attitude of the Government and the Minister of State who has special responsibility for the drugs problem? Is the response to drug rehabilitation to leave it to a FÁS scheme?Is the Minister of State aware that the people benefiting from this scheme have, on average, been addicted to heroin for ten to 12 years, since their early teens? Is he aware their heroin addiction arose from social disadvantage and the neglect by Governments of this area of the inner city? Now, when they attempt to rehabilitate and reintegrate themselves into the community, they are again excluded by the Government. They are excluded from funding that would provide staff. Surely the Minister of State accepts that rehabilitation cannot occur without full-time staff and a proper premises. This cannot be provided by a FÁS scheme and the limited funding that has been made available to date. What are the Minister of State's views on this and how much money is being spent on drug rehabilitation projects in the inner city?I am told there is a Cabinet committee that deals with social inclusion and drugs, with the various Departments represented on it. Has this committee examined the issue of rehabilitation? It was the failure of the health services to provide this type of service that caused the community to fill the gap and develop a workable rehabilitation project. Having done this, the community is getting a slap in the face for its efforts from all concerned. Will the Minister of State make a decision on the issue as quickly as possible? In making his decision he should consider in detail the work and success of this project to date and the value to the community and society generally of reintegrating people who have been unfortunate to suffer from heroin addiction for more than ten years.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Some of what the Deputy has said is over the top and I do not quite understand him. He says there is a very good project in the area rehabilitating people and that is fine. It was set up under the process and has a FÁS supervisor and €80,000 per annum of core funding which provides two extra staff. Therefore, there are currently three staff involved in the project. FÁS is an important agency in the area of the rehabilitation of drug addicts and currently has approximately 1,000 CE places ringfenced for it. Many projects with FÁS CE places do great work. I distance myself from the Deputy's criticism of FÁS because its projects are worthwhile. The Deputy's comments are at variance with the facts and with what people on the ground would say.

In the Deputy's words and the words of others we have a project that is deemed very successful. It has three staff members and caters for 14 or 16 recovering drug users. The funding proposal put forward is for an extra €151,000 for three more staff. If the project is so successful, I am at a loss as to why it needs to double its staff.The proposal has been made and I have read the file on it carefully. I am still not fully happy and have many questions on it. I hope to visit the project and speak to those involved. Many people, including the Deputy and others, have recommended the project. However, if it is so successful, I wonder why it needs an extra €151,000 for three more staff. It seems a big change in resources to move from three to six. I will not reject the proposal without talking to the people involved.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	63	The report of the steering group on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy was published in June of 2005. The report was the culmination of a comprehensive review, which included extensive consultation with Departments, agencies and the public.The review was overseen by a steering group, chaired by my Department and made up of representatives of the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. Some assistance was provided by external consultants. The review sought to assess the impact and direction of the strategy at its mid-point and the steering group concentrated on identifying beneficial adjustments to the strategy and highlighting priorities for the second phase up to 2008.The steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound. It confirmed that there have been encouraging signs of progress since 2001, when the strategy was first launched, suggesting that our current approach to tackling the drug problem is proving to be effective.However, the review highlights the need to refocus priorities and accelerate the roll-out and implementation of various key actions in the remaining period of the strategy up to 2008. In this context, a number of new actions and amendments to others were identified. These changes have strengthened the strategy and will enable it to deliver its aims more effectively.Ten of the strategy's 100 existing actions were replaced, a further seven were amended and eight new actions, which aim to address issues such as family support and rehabilitation, were added. In terms of progress, the review found that 49 of the original 100 actions outlined in the strategy are completed or are of an ongoing nature, progress was ongoing on a further 45 and there were six actions on which considerable progress has still to be made.Rehabilitation was identified as an issue that needed to be developed. It was agreed that rehabilitation should become the fifth pillar of the strategy and that a working group be established to develop a strategy for the provision of integrated rehabilitation services.I established the rehabilitation working group, which includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services as well as the national drugs strategy team, the national advisory committee on drugs and representatives from the community and voluntary sectors. The report of the working group will be available in the coming months.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.All the actions in the national drugs strategy are progressing with significant input and co-operation from other Departments and agencies, such as the Health Service Executive, the Garda Síochána, the customs service of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Education and Science, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Irish Prison Service and FÁS, as well as the community and voluntary sector.I am confident that the current consensus on the direction of the national drugs strategy will remain and that we will continue to respond in a focused way as the situation evolves.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I thank the Minister of State for his reply, although I do not agree that there are encouraging signs of progress. The report he refers to was published almost a year ago and those who wrote it might change their minds in the current climate, with people being shot and drug usage increasing. We are going backwards in terms of the availability of drugs. Drugs are widespread and readily available in every town and village in the country and usage has increased considerably. Regardless of what a report indicates, the Minister of State knows that drug usage has increased. Progress may have been made in implementing some of the strategy's recommendations but progress has not been made in tackling the overall drug problem.A major part of the drug strategy was the introduction of regional drugs task forces. These task forces were set up three or four years ago and their plans were finally submitted last September, although many of these were simply a copy of the national plan. A sum of €5 million was allocated and we now discover that less than 13% of that has been spent or drawn down. Only 4% was spent in the greater Dublin region, where there is an enormous drug problem, and 0% was spent in the midlands, despite the fact that several reports have indicated a major increase in the use of cocaine and other drugs.What does the Minister propose to do to ensure the money is spent and results are achieved? I have spoken to people involved in the regional task forces who are not happy with the progress made to date. In some areas, staff have resigned. What is the problem and why is there a delay in spending the money? I complained in the past about the delay in publishing the plans. The plans finally arrived but now the money is not being spent. I have been told that staff in the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs are selecting certain elements from the plans and making recommendations on what should be funded. I do not know if that is true but my understanding was that if a task force produced a plan, it would be allocated funding and directed to implement that plan. The task forces spent four years designing their plans and the Department should back off.Money is not being spent but it is likely that next December or January, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and other Ministers will hand over large cheques and smile for photographers in the run-up to the general election. That will be next year's money. It is a shame. Let us spend the money now and get results.Community policing was highlighted in most of the regional drugs task force plans as an essential element of the way forward. Much ranting and raving has taken place in the past few days over the figures for the Garda Síochána and the fact that numbers have dropped in many places. In my home town of Navan, there are seven fewer gardaí than there were 20 years ago. In the greater Dublin area, there were only two more gardaí.

Will the Minister of State lobby the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to increase the level of community policing, given that it is highlighted in most task force plans as a successful way to tackle the drug problem?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I do not deny that there are more drugs available now but supply reduction is one of the pillars of the strategy. At some levels, the Garda Síochána has been very successful. Seizures in recent years have yielded enormous amounts of drugs. The Garda Síochána and customs officials have been very successful. I recently attended the launch of a new x-ray scanner for use by customs officials, which can scan full containers and trucks as they come through the ports, much like what happens with suitcases at airports. While the Garda Síochána and customs officers are seizing more drugs, a large amount is still getting through.The regional drugs task forces may have been slow in getting their plans finalised, but those plans are now agreed and approved, and funding has been provided.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Nothing is happening.

#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	70	The Minister of State knows this himself.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	71	We approve the plans and provide the funding.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I saw the Deputy's press release yesterday——
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Minister of State gave me the figures.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	80	Of course, but there is no problem with funding. Spending is being driven at local level by the regional drugs task forces. We do not give the money to those task forces. Different projects will involve the HSE, local authorities, VECs and so on. We would like such agencies to send their bills to us on a weekly or monthly basis but that does not happen. We will probably be hit by a raft of bills next November.The figures we supplied to the Deputy refer to the amount that has been claimed from the Department by the various agencies and is not necessarily an accurate reflection of the amount being spent on the ground. I do not have to give any further authority or approval in order for things to happen on the ground. That is now entirely up to the regional drugs task forces. However, just because something is approved does not mean it will happen overnight.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I totally accept that.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	82	There is a process involved in developing and building up a critical mass of appropriate staff. In many cases, it will take a number of months to get the key projects up and running. That is all being driven at local level, in co-operation with the national drugs strategy team. There is no block or hold in terms of the Department's role. All the plans from the regions were estimated to cost €12.5 million and to take approximately three years to implement. The task forces have been given approval for €5 million, which is more than enough for this year. Next year, they will probably be given another couple of million, as they develop and get projects up and ready to roll out.Garda numbers in Dublin are up by approximately 600.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The numbers are only up by two.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	84	No, they are up by 600 since the Government came to power eight years ago. The figures discussed yesterday do not include specialist units, most of which are based in Dublin. Extra gardaí have been assigned to the national drugs unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the bureau of fraud investigation. These are additional to the figures that Deputy English's colleague was arguing about yesterday. The reality is that there are 800 to 900 extra gardaí in Dublin.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	85	Will the Minister of State bring the issue of community policing to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? Although every Garda station may have access to a drugs squad, it will not have one based in it.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	86	Every Garda division has one.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	87	It does not. Every station needs a person dedicated to combating illegal drugs crime. As it takes so long to get a result in a drug crime, to keep detection figures up, many stations put their efforts into combating other areas of crime. Will the Minister of State bring this to the attention of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform?The Minister of State claims the money is available but there is no more he can do. I believe he is interested in tackling the drugs problem. Will he take charge and demand results? The strategy needs to be driven. We waited long enough for the recommendations of the mid-term review. We cannot wait any longer to spend the money. The Minister of State must take an active involvement in spending the allocated money and pushing the strategy. I am concerned it lacks drive. The Minister of State is the man to drive the strategy. There is no point in saying the money is available. I want to see it spent with results.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	88	We are driving the strategy. We are pushing it but we need a little pull as well. We are working with the national drugs strategy team. I understand the Deputy's concerns but it will happen as the year goes on. I would be concerned if a half a dozen staff were to begin working on the strategy next Monday. I would be much happier if there was one recruit every four weeks so that it is built up in a proper way. At the end of the year most of the funding will be spent.

However, since 2004 they have been regarded as a target group under the local development social inclusion programme, the LDSIP. The programme aims to counter disadvantage and to promote equality and social and economic inclusion through the provision of funding and support to local partnerships. It is administered by Pobal, on behalf of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, and is funded through the national development plan. At local level, it is delivered by 38 partnerships, 31 community partnerships and two employment pacts in their designated areas. The three measures it delivers are services to the unemployed, community development and community-based youth initiatives.Under the LDSIP a significant number of area-based partnerships, community partnerships and employment pacts have developed actions to support migrant workers and their families. While many of the actions are still at an early stage, the partnerships can build on several years' experience in the programme of providing supports for refugees and asylum seekers.Types of actions carried out under the LDSIP, with other agencies and programmes, to meet the needs of migrant workers and their families include helping ensure that migrants' information needs are met in appropriate ways, including in a variety of languages, arranging language classes that are accessible to migrant workers and their families, facilitating the participation of migrant workers and their families in intercultural events and their use of local amenities, community development processes to facilitate migrant workers and their families to take an active part in programmes and policies that affect them and anti-racism initiatives at local level.Pobal, the Dublin Employment Pact, and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland are supporting an action research project on local development strategies to meet the needs of migrant workers and their families. The research, intended to share practical lessons and to inform thinking about future strategies, will be published by the middle of 2006. As part of the cohesion process on local development the Department is extending the coverage of area partnerships to the whole State.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	90	For the past five years, migrant workers and their families have comprised the largest single group of new residents in the State. There have been problems, most notably with employment and work permits. A report is to be prepared on the pilot project run by Pobal, the Dublin Employment Pact and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland. I understand the analysis was to have been completed by December 2005 and the report documenting the planning process and good practice was scheduled for publication in spring 2006. From the Minister's reply, I take it the project is well behind schedule.

Pobal, the Dublin Employment Pact and the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, the groups involved in the project, operate independently of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Since I cannot hold Pobal to anything, there is no point in holding me to when its report will be published.

#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	99	This is an important issue and every effort must be made to have an integrated and multicultural society. The Minister has informed us that no one is answerable to him or that he has no control over measures that are being drawn up for planning processes and good practices for migrant workers. Is that not an admission that he is doing nothing in the area? The issue of the integration and the welcoming of the migrants and their families into our society is not moving as it should. This is because the Department is not forthcoming in its support.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	100	It must be the jet lag that is getting to me. Pobal is funded by the Department and it operates independently on a day-to-day basis. On certain days of the week, it is the Labour Party's favourite policy that people should operate independently of the Department.Pobal established a review group that claimed in autumn 2005 that it will publish a report in spring 2006. Now, it claims it will publish it in the mid-year. The end of spring and mid-year are not far apart. The Deputy then asks me to hold them to that. Since I did not commission the report, it is not so simple. Deputy O'Shea is always laying down good practices for me to follow, one of which is I should lay down policy. However, I cannot become involved in the day-to-day management of the agency. Deputy English asked the Minister of State to drive the drugs strategy, yet the Opposition go mad with the Government for introducing legislation to ensure control over——

If I introduced legislation to take over Pobal, I would be accused of creating another slush fund and trying to take total control. At times one cannot win with the Opposition because it is so inconsistent.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I am not accusing the Minister of creating a slush fund. I am accusing him of doing very little.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	105	I assure the Deputy that I am in ongoing contact with all those involved in disrupting the use of illegal drugs, not just the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The available figures come from the joint national advisory committee on drugs and the drug and alcohol information and research unit, Northern Ireland, drug prevalence survey. This study surveyed 8,442 people aged 15 to 64 in Ireland and Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003.The survey showed that the use of crack cocaine was very low at that time: 0.3% reported lifetime use, 0.1% reported use in the past 12 months and there were no positive respondents concerning last month use. It is intended that a second comprehensive drug prevalence study will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007. Preliminary analysis will be done in the months following that, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected late in 2007.I am confident that through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the local and regional drugs task forces, the problem of crack cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in its area based on its own identified priorities. They continue to have ongoing contact with their local communities.These projects deal with supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation for a range of drugs, including crack cocaine. Most drug users engage in poly-drug use and, therefore, projects generally aim to address this pattern of usage rather than concentrating on one drug to the exclusion of others.Over the past year or so, I have visited a number of drugs task force areas and discussed with community representatives and others the nature of the drug problem in their regions. I have also met senior members of the Garda Síochána who are involved in the drugs area. My meetings and discussions indicate that crack cocaine is not being used extensively in Ireland but is confined to small areas of the population.Garda figures show that most of the recorded seizures of crack cocaine, particularly in the past two years, have been in the north central division of the Dublin metropolitan region. Garda drug units and community policing personnel are targeting this problem with a view to addressing it and stopping the spread of crack cocaine to a wider area.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.I fully accept that a potential danger exists that the use of crack cocaine could spread rapidly. Crack cocaine is a most damaging drug. Its use can cause fatalities in young, otherwise healthy people as a result of strokes, heart attacks and clots and damage to the heart muscle or lungs. It is also a highly addictive drug. Moreover, the Garda Síochána has informed me that the aggression associated with crack cocaine use could result in a rise in street crime and anti-social behaviour.The potential damage of widespread crack cocaine use is startling. However, I assure the Deputy that I will continue to monitor the situation. In addition, I will ensure that all necessary steps are taken to address increased threats, should they arise.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	106	I thank the Minister of State for his reply but one sentence in it gave me cause for concern. That was a reference to a study of one drug to the exclusion of others. On the last occasion we debated these matters, I tabled a Priority Question on crack cocaine. We went through the various issues pertaining to the use of crack cocaine, which make it a much more dangerous drug than any of the others we have dealt with heretofore. For instance, 80% of crack cocaine users become addicted within a fortnight of first smoking it. That is serious and represents a rapid growth in its use. In dealing with this particular drug we need a focused, hands-on approach, including monitoring and surveillance. No specific study has been carried out on the use of crack cocaine in the State.The Minister of State also mentioned the new drug prevalence study which is to start this autumn and will continue until mid-2007. Is that sufficient, however, given that this drug has the potential to cause a serious escalation of drug-related illnesses and chaotic lifestyles? It also has the potential to cause an increase in all crime committed by cocaine addicts seeking to obtain funds for their next fix. As a crack cocaine trip lasts 40 to 50 seconds, it is well known that such addicts need to get frequent fixes. The Minister of State knows exactly what I am talking about. More focused monitoring is required to cope with the increasing use of crack cocaine which can be extremely damaging to society. As these developments can occur rapidly, a close eye needs to be kept on them.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I do not disagree with anything the Deputy has said. There is no doubt that crack cocaine is much more dangerous than any other illegal drugs. The potential damage of its widespread use is quite startling. When I was abroad last week, I took the opportunity to visit some drug awareness projects and discussed them with those concerned. The problems they have with crack cocaine are frightening and put other drug problems in the ha'penny place. There is no doubt that what the Deputy says is true but potential crack cocaine users are more likely to be existing drug addicts who are already in treatment. I sincerely hope they are less likely to be first-time drug users in the 15 to 20 year old bracket.We try to combine treatments for many drugs to help people who already may be receiving rehabilitative treatment for cocaine or heroin. We have upskilled many staff so that they can spot and deal with various kinds of drug abuse. I agree with the Deputy that we need to be more careful, focused and aware because if crack cocaine abuse increases to a large extent we will be dealing with a problem that is totally different from anything we have yet seen. There is no substitution treatment, such as a methadone equivalent, for crack cocaine, however, so it is up to trained, vigilant staff, including counsellors who are already dealing with these people, to keep a close eye on the situation.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	108	I wish to inform the Minister of State that crack cocaine is in my area in Tallaght so there is a problem in that regard. I welcome the fact the Minister of State has visited other centres. There is a need to erect a firewall to stop the spread of this drug, which has the added danger of the violence that is associated with it. A number of pilot drug treatment schemes have been launched in Dublin, which are currently being assessed and evaluated. In my area, more than 100 people are attending one such programme but it is up for evaluation and we have been told it will close in April. A sum of €80,000 in funding was provided for this project for six months but it has been running for 14 months. I realise the Minister of State is seeking responses from the projects but is there a date for the conclusion of the evaluation process? The sooner it is concluded the better. One of the key areas we need to address involves the use of cocaine and crack cocaine.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I do not have an update on the evaluations but I have heard favourable reports on the project to which the Deputy referred. I will check on the situation and will revert to the Deputy privately on it. One part of the national drugs strategy is that projects must be evaluated before they are mainstreamed and funding is allocated. I accept that the reports of that project are positive and it is being professionally evaluated.The Customs and Excise service and the Garda Síochána have been targeting cocaine and crack cocaine dealers and have had much success in this regard. Garda statistics show that most recorded seizures of crack cocaine in the past couple of years have occurred in a confined part of the Dublin north central division. There is no substitution treatment for crack cocaine, however, and the best that can be done is the provision of counselling and behavioural therapy. One can only provide that, however, when people seek treatment or are observed to have that problem. While we are being vigilant, some responsibility must rest with the individual. Many likely users of crack cocaine are those who have previously had a drug problem and who have been stabilised and weaned off it. Some cases involve chaotic people. However, there is no doubt that crack cocaine is a serious matter and even people who believe they are experienced drug users or abusers must be very careful because, as Deputy O'Shea stated, one can become addicted to it quickly.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	110	While I have responsibility for the implementation of the national drugs strategy, the licensing of drugs such as methadone to treat heroin addiction is the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children. Objective reviews and evaluations have consistently shown that the prescription of methadone can lead to reduced heroin use, reduced criminal activity and reduced spread of HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. It can stabilise an addict, allowing many to lead otherwise normal lives.While methadone is not the only tool we have to combat heroin use, it has been an enormous aid in helping thousands of drug misusers to beat their addiction. More than 7,900 people receive methadone treatment. Encouragingly, estimates from the national advisory committee on drugs indicate that the number of heroin users has started to decrease in Dublin and has stabilised at low levels nationwide. The methadone maintenance programme has played a part in this decrease in numbers. The 2005 report of the steering group on the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy called for the expansion of methadone treatment.An alternative to methadone, bupenorphrine, was licensed 18 months ago by the Irish Medicines Board for use in specialist settings. Clinical trials have shown that bupenorphrine can result in reductions in heroin use, increased retention in treatment and reduced craving. Compared with methadone, there is less sedation and more limited withdrawal symptoms. I understand the Department of Health and Children is in discussion with the Irish Medicines Board on the issue of prescription of bupenorphrine by general practitioners.I established a rehabilitation working group to examine the provision of services for drug misusers, including those who abuse heroin, and to make recommendations for improvements. The report of the working group will be available in the coming months. Treatment and rehabilitation is just one aspect of this Government's approach to combating heroin use. Approximately 1,000 places are available for recovering drug misusers under the special FÁS community employment scheme.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	111	I asked this question because I am aware of the increase in the number of people on the methadone programme from 1,861 in 1997 to 8,962 in 2005 and that many people believe addicts are individuals and while methadone may work for one individual, it may not work for everyone. What is the alternative? Addicts seem to be pushed down the methadone route. However, many people believe that it replaces one class A drug with another. Statistics also suggest it is harder to give up methadone than heroin. Have we examined any alternatives? What supports are there for addicts who do not want to go down the methadone route? In any treatment centre, if a person is on heroin, the next step is to go on methadone. In many cases an addict who wants to reduce the quantity of methadone is not allowed to do so. We need alternatives. People are individuals and supports do not seem to be in place.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	112	The Deputy's comments are reasonable. I repeat the reply that the programme has been generally successful and has reduced crime. I accept it is not suitable for everyone and it is not a long-term solution to put people on methadone and expect it to last for the rest of their lives. I mentioned bupenorphrine, which is called subutex in other countries. A report also exists on naloxone. The Department of Health and Children is examining those other drugs and they may be prescribed for some people. Some of them have aspects which would be suitable for some and not for others.As part of the mid-term review we generally accepted that putting people on methadone is not a long-term answer. That is why the working group on rehabilitation was established and why rehabilitation will get a higher status as the fifth pillar from now on. I accept the point made by Deputy Crowe that being put on methadone is a temporary solution and it should not continue for years.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Yesterday, we witnessed the extraordinary scenes of a Minister making disgraceful political and personal remarks against a Member of the House. That the allegations were made against one of the most committed, honest and diligent parliamentarians made the offence all the worse. I heard the apology of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform this morning. Deputy Bruton has, as one would expect from him, accepted that apology with great dignity. It might be of interest to the Taoiseach that one of the books which Joseph Goebbels attempted to have published was called Michael. I hope this experience will be a watershed for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and that, in the future, instead of responding to serious matters of crime and growing crime with bluff and bluster, he will deal with the facts and recognise the serious problems which the Garda Síochána face in keeping our streets safe.Will the Taoiseach confirm that the figures used by Deputy Bruton on Garda numbers in the Dublin metropolitan area being at 3,740 on 31 December 2004 as against 3,742 on 31 December 2005 were correct and based on replies given to him by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? It is a "yes" or "no" answer.The Taoiseach's Government stated it will be judged on whether people feel safer in their homes and on the streets at night. I will examine some of the key performance indicators in that area. Every year since 1998, detection rates have fallen. Serious crime has increased by almost 20% since 1998. Last year, 54 murders occurred, 16 more than in 1997, a 42% increase. Rape increased by 61% and firearm offences by a whopping 440% in the same period. These crimes terrorise families, communities and individuals. There is a sad story behind every statistic.Last night the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform had a restless night. If so, he was still protected by two armed gardaí, unlike the woman who keeps €200 under her pillow, in fear that she will be broken into for the third time, as something to offer to keep herself safe. Perhaps the Minister does not have two armed gardaí at his house.The following are critical questions for the Taoiseach and his Government in respect of being able to keep our policing methods up with 21st century criminal activity. Why, after nine years, are gardaí reduced to making telephone calls on their own mobile telephones for communication purposes? Why, after nine years, have we not had a serious review of rostering to let gardaí on the streets at night and weekends to be seen by the people who want to see this happen? Why is it that after nine years there are still 200 gardaí doing work that civilians could do?I hope today might be a watershed for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and for the Government. Serious crimes are running at more than 100,000 a year. If this Minister survives for another 12 months, he will have presided over 500,000 serious crimes which is truly a horrific legacy. Yesterday's events showed us that the Minister is hurting badly because his policies are not working. It is time for action in dealing with the serious facts exposed by Deputy Bruton yesterday.

Starting in January 2005, more than 1,100 new officers per year have been and are being recruited for three years.The number of officers assigned to stations in the Dublin metropolitan area has risen by more than 600 since 1997, from 3,200 to 3,794. In addition to those gardaí assigned to stations in Dublin there are 147 officers in the Dublin traffic unit, 99 officers in the Dublin command and control unit, bringing the strength of the force in the Dublin region to 4,400 personnel today. This does not include any of the several hundred officers included in the special units, such as the drugs squad and others. They are not included because they work mainly but not exclusively in Dublin.The reason for the seemingly low number of gardaí in Dublin Garda stations in December 2005 was the transfer of 50 personnel from the uniformed service in Dublin stations in November to the national bureau of criminal investigation. Under the auspices of Operation Anvil, those 50 officers dealt exclusively with criminals involved in gun crime.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	157	Mr. Goebbels used to say that truth was the enemy of the state. I asked the Taoiseach a question. He has a pile of statistics in front of him. Deputy Bruton used figures supplied by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, according to which on 31 December 2004, there were 3,740 gardaí in the Dublin metropolitan area, and on 31 December 2005, there were 3,742 in the same area. Is that figure right or not? Is it correct or incorrect — yes or no?The figures the Taoiseach has read out seem to indicate that he is trying to portray a lessening of aggression on the streets, a diminution in killing by firearms, and a lower incidence of murder on streets around the country. That is not the case. Under the stewardship of this Minister and his predecessor, detection rates have fallen continually. Those detection rates and the rise of serious crime are the key performance indicators by which this Minister and the Government will be judged. This refers not only to headline crime but to rape, assault, murder, possession of guns, larceny and so on.Why were 65% of assaults undetected in Bray compared with 21% undetected in Santry last year? Why were 72% of robberies undetected in Clondalkin compared with 36.8% in Crumlin? Why must gardaí use their mobile phones to communicate when they are up against the most sophisticated criminal underworld this country has ever seen? Does that not indicate a total failure by the Minister to supply the gardaí with the equipment to do the job the people want them to do? Why are community police not deployed more often at weekends and at night on streets and in estates throughout the country where people want to see them?There is a crying need for the comfort of knowing that uniformed gardaí are on patrol. Why is this not happening? Why has there been no review of effective rostering to get gardaí out on the streets where people want to see them? Is it not a fact that fundamentally the commitment in terms of garda numbers given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform cannot be met and, despite all the hype, rhetoric, bluster and intervention, will not be met?It remains a fact that there is aggression on the streets, the incidence of gun crime, assault, robbery and serious assault is increasing, and the level of detection has fallen under this Government's stewardship. Surely that is an indication of failure at a time when law and order have become fundamental to the lives, fears, safety and concerns of our citizens.

The strength of the force has increased significantly and the Garda budget is up 39%. The Commissioner has undertaken to review the force's performance, looking at some new techniques in the areas where detection rates are not so high.Detection rates for crimes against the person continue to compare very well internationally. Detection rates for property crime, vandalism, criminal damage and burglary, particularly of unoccupied houses and business premises, are low internationally, and we are no exception. The detection rates for property crime are falling and the Minister raised this issue with the Garda Commissioner several months ago. I understand the digital communications system for the Garda will be in place next June.If one excludes the people transferred, in particular the 50 personnel from the uniformed service who were moved, the answer to Deputy Bruton's question is "yes". As one who is good with mathematics, I think Deputy Bruton will accept that when making a comparison it is wrong to exclude 50 people.

The policy was also to resource the Garda properly, both in terms of existing staff, overtime rates and equipment. Allowing for the population increase, the figures do not show that crime rates have increased, except in some areas, which I accept.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	184	What is wrong with that reply is that the Taoiseach, like the Minister, is rhyming off statistics as if we were insulated in this House from what is going on in the streets and the estates. There is little point in telling people one is spending more money. The Government is spending more money, on the health services, for example, but it is not getting better value for it. Crime rates are worsening and more seriously, detection rates are worsening. In Dublin, the subject of this controversy, homicides were up 53% last year, yet detection rates in Dublin have fallen to 32%. If one takes any of the other areas, whether it is the 85% of burglaries, the 65% of thefts, the 62% of robberies or 44% of physical assaults which go undetected, we have a crisis of confidence in the Government's capacity to administer justice and police protection.Many parts of the Taoiseach's constituency and of mine are tortured by anti-social behaviour yet it is not possible to have the relevant estates policed visibly by gardaí on the beat. The Minister seems to miss that point. He made a gracious apology for his entirely unbecoming antics yesterday and I will say no more of that. However, I heard people say he did not believe what he was saying. My concern is that he does believe what he is saying and does not acknowledge the concern on the streets and in the estates. He seems to confuse the number of interviews he gives with the number of additional gardaí he appoints.Since the Government made zero progress on zero tolerance for the five years before the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform took office, with the Taoiseach having the wisdom to remove the former Minister and put him in charge of hanging pictures and attending race courses, is there now an argument for appointing Deputy McDowell to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs? He speaks the language well and would be able to go about the country doling out little gifts from the dormant accounts fund. He is manifestly overstressed and there are citizens out there who do not feel safe in their homes or on the streets. The rate of detection is falling to a level which is alarming most people.I draw the attention of the House to the 2001 Garda report on civilianisation. Under this plan, 556 gardaí were to be freed up to attend to the prevention of crime. Five years later, does the Taoiseach know how many of the 556 have been transferred to operational and crime prevention duties? None. Some 113 people have been appointed to civilian posts but no clerical administrative personnel have replaced gardaí to free them up for crime detection and prevention purposes. That is the snail's pace performance on civilianisation, just one aspect of the responsibility of the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I do not want to repeat all the figures again, but we will have an additional 3,500 gardaí on the streets. Our population has increased. The Minister took action to increase Garda numbers to what they are today. That took an enormous effort. Anyone familiar with the training programme and the top class new facilities at Templemore will be aware of the effort to do that. We will reach the figure of 14,000. We got rid of the revolving door because there are 1,900 extra places, due to the fact that we have resourced the Prison Service and the Garda in terms of capital and resources, including overtime which, perhaps, is not always the best means but it is necessary to have the individual programmes. We have managed to cut crime in many places. I do not wish to get into the argument with Deputy Rabbitte on the number of homicides for Dublin. I want to give the number of homicides for the country which in 1993 was 53 and in 2005 was 58 with a population of a difference of 600,000. That is 53 and 58 too many. I am not happy with those numbers.While the figures from the provisional headline crime statistics for last year show an increase of 2.7% compared to 2004, the level of headline crime in 2005 is lower than for 2003 by 1.6%. Even with an increase in population there is very little difference. The figures show that manslaughter is down 50% and aggravated sexual assault is down 43%. Those are substantial reductions. It is fair to examine the numbers per 1,000 of population. Going back to 1995, the figures show a reduction — I wish it was far more — from 29 crimes per 1,000, to 24.6 crimes per 1,000.There are problems of lawlessness in some areas. The Public Order Act was successfully implemented on St. Patrick's Day. This time last year I was here dealing with the difficulties that arose on St. Patrick's Day. I congratulate the Garda and the Minister on the fact that there were very few difficulties on St. Patrick's Day this year. One of the reasons for that——

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	195	On the Minister's performance yesterday he does not need any personal security. If the Taoiseach wants to move outside Dublin I will instance the case of the answers given to my colleagues, Deputies Stagg and Wall. The increase in serious crime in the past five years in Kildare is 55%. We can swop figures all day. Those figures came from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The fact is the position is worsening and there is no confidence out there. People are concerned when they are the subject of a burglary, a robbery or a personal assault that the crime will go undetected. That is the issue and the Minister speaks about all his legislation. Let us take the Criminal Justice Bill which has been around for two years. When published it had 34 pages. Today the Minister published 340 pages of amendments to the Bill. That is the way this Minister legislates. The Bill bears no similarity to the one originally published. When the House demands adequate time to debate it, he will complain the House is an irritant. The Taoiseach gets up and defends him for all his life is worth, despite the memory of the posters. We have some great photographs from yesterday for posters in the next election. The Taoiseach will not say a word of condemnation about, for example, the disgraceful behaviour of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the floor of the House when he sought to link the Green Party to rioters and looters in South Frederick Street. It was an outrageous charge to make against the Green Party and its members and yet the Taoiseach never issued a word of rebuke.The fact is that detection rates are falling at an alarming rate. Some 85% of burglaries go undetected and 44% of personal assaults go undetected. That is why people are afraid to walk some streets of this and other cities at night. That is why people are targeted for anti-social behaviour in their homes in estates in parts of my constituency and in parts of the Taoiseach's constituency and there is no Garda to be found. The Garda reforms have foundered because the Minister is not doing his primary job and the Taoiseach appears quite happy to acquiesce in that position. He will hear all about it when he goes out to meet real people.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	197	While I have acknowledged some of the difficulties it is entirely wrong for any Member, not least Deputy Rabbitte, to try to portray this or any other city as a lawless zone because that is totally untrue. This city has the third highest number of tourists in Europe. All the research carried out shows it is a safe city. I acknowledge there are pockets in my constituency and in that of the Deputy. For crimes against the person the detection rate is very good but when the crimes are against property the detection rate is not as good. I acknowledge that.We will have 14,000 gardaí shortly. We have a number of dedicated specialist units. The highest amount of resources in the history of the State are being given to the Garda. It has a substantial capital programme — resources it has never had — to deal with technology and other issues. Its training is acknowledged internationally as being second to very few. To give the impression that in some way this is a lawless country is not correct. I have acknowledged that any crime is a bad thing. Though perhaps the number is not as high as it was many years ago, unfortunately too many people are involved in drug-related crime. There is also a bad and sinister element in society which shoots each other, even friends of people, and shoots others also. I do not deny any of those things. Let us not try to portray that the 12,500 gardaí are not doing their best to deal with crime.In regard to the Criminal Justice Bill the Minister has already said he will have it recommitted. Effectively this will be a Second Stage debate to deal with the amendments. We all know it will help the Garda in crime detection. I have also said that the Minister has asked the Garda Commissioner, and I understand the Deputy Commissioner, Fachtna Murphy, is undertaking an examination of that issue, to ascertain what more they can do by way of procedures to improve their lot. With a far bigger population the level of crime, in international and national comparison, is down. The level is still too high because we do not want to see a society with any crime, particularly when there is close to full employment. Some 20 years ago unemployment and social disadvantage was given as the reason for high rates of crime. That argument is gone.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	200	When former Deputy Desmond O'Malley predicted wrongly that Deputy Michael D. Higgins would go mad if in Government, it was bound to happen to one of his own. I said from this spot three years ago that it was a mistake to allow the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform close that last padded cell in Mountjoy because it might be required for himself. Yesterday's events go to show that.In the past few weeks the Taoiseach has got many letters from Aer Lingus workers asking him to step away from privatisation of the company. Will he agree that as the financial experts of the Government say, privatisation would realise only approximately €400 million, the price of a mere four aeroplanes? The argument that this vital strategic public asset should be privatised does not stand up.I ask the Taoiseach to reflect on a number of issues. The European Commission has clarified there is no barrier to the State investing in the national airline. The chairman of the National Development Finance Agency, Dr. Somers, told me at the Committee of Public Accounts that if the Government asked it, it would have full powers to source funding for equity into Aer Lingus and would have the expertise. We were also told that the National Pensions Reserve Fund, on the directions of the Government, invests billions of euro in private industries throughout the world including, shamefully, in the armaments industries and big tobacco "killer" industries yet it will not be asked to invest in the socially useful underpinning of the national airline.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Will the Taoiseach reflect on the inglorious record on privatisation of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats? Eircom involved an orgy of asset stripping and speculation, with huge detriment to investment in that industry. The Irish Sugar privatisation has wiped out the beet industry to be replaced not by small holders from the Third World but sweated sugar. We had the B&I Line privatisation and last year's spectacle of Irish Ferries replacing trade union workers with virtual galley slaves.When it comes to the privatisation of public assets, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have shown themselves to be the Podge and Rodge of Irish politics, reinforcing one another's ideological banalities and prejudices and the backbenchers, like their audience, do not know whether they should laugh or squirm in embarrassment. They should squirm in embarrassment if they are prepared to tolerate the sell-out of thousands of Aer Lingus workers, their communities and the national airline.Why will the Taoiseach not show the same commitment to a publicly owned airline as that shown by the Aer Lingus workers? All the Independent Deputies, who have different ideological viewpoints, are opposed to the privatisation of Aer Lingus, as are the vast majority of Irish people. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect again on where he is going and adopt a different tactic of maintaining the airline fully in public ownership and investing in it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	203	For Aer Lingus to grow, develop and expand in the immediate future, to get access to many new locations which it wants, and to avail of the opportunities of the European-US open skies agreement as against the current position where it can only fly into the five airports, it needs the flexibility and the competitive advantage to be able to operate on that basis for its employees and the other issues. It needs approximately €2 billion, not €400 million, over the period ahead to successfully operate on that basis.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	206	It is still a charge. The Ministers for Transport and Finance are completing the review of the report prepared by the advisers on the nature, scale and timing of the investment transaction and will shortly advise the Government of their consideration of the issue. Third party investment is necessary to provide the company with access to equity to fund its business expansion plans and ensure it has the strength on its balance sheet to withstand the recurring downturns and external shocks that are a recognised feature. In the future, unlike the last two occasions when the State was able to help when the airline ran into difficulties, the State will not be able, on those day to day issues, to put in resources.The National Treasury Management Agency is an independent body. Because of a wise decision made by this Government some years ago to put 1% of our national growth into a fund, we now have €15 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund. I am aware that in the first few years, because of Y2K, the returns were not good but last year I understand the figure was 19%. We have €15 billion which we can write off against our national debt and bring it down to a very low figure. They are independent in their decision making. We are talking about a number of international figures. If they believe, and I am sure Dr. Somers would have told the Deputy this — that is a good strategic investment for them in Aer Lingus when the options become available, they can make that decision. There is nothing barring them from doing that. I want to see Aer Lingus grow and expand and not remain in its current position or to decline. There is a good opportunity for it to do that with an increasing number of passengers and locations, good opportunities in the future and more employment, not only in Aer Lingus but in the related areas of tourism throughout the country, which is a very good employer.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	207	Dr. Somers said the NTMA can raise up to €5 billion and that this money could, in theory, be invested. He said that is a policy issue and not a decision for him to make. He said that simply put, while it is technically possible it is not his call. It is the Government's call. The Government could make the call. A combination of borrowing in this way and leasing is entirely possible to kit out the national airline with all the aeroplanes it needs in the future.Is it because the Taoiseach does not have any confidence in the future of Aer Lingus that he is not prepared to do this or is it that he is hamstrung by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats ideology? How does the Taoiseach explain what happened to the other industries he privatised? Is he not ashamed of what has happened to B&I, Irish Sugar and Eircom? Does he not realise it is inevitable that if he privatises Aer Lingus, it will finish up in the hands of the same sharks that moved in, with dreadful consequences for workers and for this State, to take control? Does the Taoiseach want his contribution to Irish history to be that of a facilitator for the asset stripping of the national airline?

Is the Taoiseach aware of the history of New Zealand Air, which was privatised with disastrous consequences and then had to be bought back by the New Zealand state?I ask the Taoiseach to listen to those workers who have been in touch with him and who have shown tremendous commitment to this public asset and will continue to do so. Instead of taking a direction of privatisation, will he bring them into the heart of the management of the airline, together with the investment, so that we can build up this even more powerful company which will be beneficial for the economy and the people of Ireland?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I made the point to Deputy Higgins that the workers will have 15% of the company. The workers are part of it and the State will retain whatever percentage it decides to get. I do not believe that will hold back or result in a decline in Aer Lingus. When I was Minister for Finance in 1993, Aer Lingus had to let several thousand workers go and it happened again a few years ago. At the same time, Aer Lingus was not allowed to develop, expand and move ahead in the market. It should be allowed to do so given the opportunities that exist in the aviation market.I understand the point the Deputy is making. I referred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund, whereas the Deputy spoke about the NTMA raising funds for the State. However, my first answer still applies. If the NTMA wants to use money from the reserve fund, that is a strategic decision that can be made. The employment potential is great for Aer Lingus and that has a knock-on effect. There have been difficulties with airlines around the world due to terrorism and other factors, but Aer Lingus can still expand and grow. The EU-US open skies policy will allow us to access many more airports in the US.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	233	When is it proposed to publish the Abbeylara report into the death of Mr. John Carthy? When can we expect publication of the Harris report on the decline of spoken Irish in primary schools that has been with the Minister for several months? I assume the reason is not to facilitate translation into Irish but that the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment wishes to make recommendations before publication. Perhaps the Taoiseach will state when those two important reports are expected.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I do not believe that we have yet received the Abbeylara report, but I may be wrong.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	235	Has the Government set its face against using the census to update the electoral register? At Question Time with the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Kitt, there were several suggestions that advantage be taken of the fact that every door is being knocked on, allowing a more reliable database for the register.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	237	As stated previously, I acknowledge the difficulties with the register. I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, has discussed the issues with the Central Statistics Office and has written to the Minister. However, I believe that the CSO is anxious to concentrate on census work, not using it for any similar exercise. The Minister is examining options for the register in the short term. There are also long-term issues, but most of us are concerned with what he can do over the next few months.

He is asking about a motion on the Order Paper and whether it will be taken in Government time. That is appropriate, but he cannot debate that issue.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	248	I would like the Minister of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to set the record straight.

Today, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proposed 200 amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 despite its passage through Second Stage in the House. As there are only 38 sections in the Bill and there will be no Second Stage perusal of such an extensive change to that legislation, would it not be better and more appropriate if it were withdrawn and debated again in the House from the outset?When is it planned to bring the Health (Repayment Scheme) Bill 2006, which was published last week, to Second Stage in this House? What programme does the Taoiseach and his colleagues propose to introduce to inform people of the methodology of application?

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"2.—Nothing in Section 40 (13) the Air Navigation & Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 shall (i) permit the detention or sale of any aircraft that is not owned by the operator who is liable for the charge or (ii) prejudice any right of a Company to recover any charges, or any part thereof, by action. Any sale ordered under this section shall be on such terms as to preserve the priority and interests of any third parties with an interest in the aircraft or any part of it (including equipment, stores and documents) at the time the aircraft was detained.".There has been considerable debate on this aspect of the Bill and its shortcomings in the Seanad and on Committee Stage. I hope that as the Minister of State has now had an opportunity to reconsider his position, he might agree to the amendments tabled by Deputy Olivia Mitchell and me.Many concerns were expressed regarding this Bill by aircraft leasing companies and aircraft maintenance and repair organisations because it will make it easier for Eurocontrol to take action against the customers of both types of company. The Bill puts Ireland at a competitive disadvantage by allowing Eurocontrol to go further here than in any other country in terms of providing it with powers to seize and dispose of aircraft. As Eurocontrol is already very successful in collecting unpaid fees, why should such additional powers be provided in Ireland? On Committee Stage, the Minister of State made the point that it would act as a deterrent. However, the existing powers already do so and there is nothing to indicate that any further deterrents are required or would be provided by the provisions of this Bill.Under these proposals and given the international nature of the industry, Irish aircraft owners could find themselves being sued before a foreign court. Any statements made by the Minister of State in the House or on Committee Stage would be of no value because what matters is not how the Minister of State may wish the Bill to be construed but how it is actually construed. It seems extraordinary that no cognisance will be taken of the rights of aircraft maintenance companies and aircraft leasing companies in respect of the principles regarding private property.On Committee Stage, I remarked that the provisions of this Bill are akin to giving the ESB the power to seize the house of a landlord whose tenant has not paid his or her ESB bill. It is exactly the same as that scenario. This constitutes interference with the private property rights of owners of aircraft, or in my example, landlords, because people with whom they do business have defaulted on paying a bill. This is what the Minister of State proposes.In natural justice, I cannot see how such proposals stand up. Undoubtedly, if the Minister of State proceeds along these lines, the legislation will be challenged in the courts. I hope he has had time to reconsider this matter, that sense will prevail in this regard and that he will accept these amendments.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	341	This issue has been debated at some length in the Seanad and in this House on Second and Committee Stages. I again, with Deputy Shortall, make this plea on Report Stage. We genuinely believe that a significant wrong will be included in this Bill. It is contrary to natural justice. I tabled a composite amendment to the effect that no liability would be created on the owner of an aircraft unless that owner was also the operator. There should be no lien on an aircraft in circumstances where the operator reneges on fees to either Eurocontrol or an airport. There should be no grounding of an aircraft unless the offender is both the owner and the operator, and neither airports nor Eurocontrol should be given the power to sell aircraft unless the person who reneges on the bill is also the operator.If Members allow this situation to pertain, they will merely allow tardy and sloppy debt collection on behalf of airports and Eurocontrol which has had few problems in collecting bills. As my colleague, Deputy Shortall, noted, this runs counter to natural justice. It makes no sense to go beyond what is required to comply with the regulation.I made a similar point in respect of property rights on Committee Stage. Deputy Shortall used the analogy of an ESB bill. I used the example of renting a car where a person may be fined for an offence such as speeding. In a case such as this, the Garda could take the car, even though it was rented. It makes no sense to give this kind of power to either Eurocontrol or the airports and it goes far beyond what is permissible under company law for other sectors.Moreover, as this goes beyond what the laws in other countries require in similar circumstances, we will penalise our own aviation sector. We will penalise those who lease aircraft or manufacture aircraft parts as well as those who are involved in repair or maintenance. In addition, this measure will make Ireland an unattractive place for planes to land because it exposes them to being grounded, put up for sale to pay bills or debts, or used against money that is outstanding. Hence, we will penalise ourselves as well as the tourism industry and the air freight business. In other words, this will create a competitive disadvantage relative to every other European country.Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister of State to go back to the drawing board and reconsider this provision. I am also convinced that there will be constitutional challenges to this measure based on property rights. We should get this right now. Why put an industry that we value, or say we value, at an unnecessary disadvantage?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	342	This amendment and amendments Nos. 2, 3, 5 and 11 are being taken together.The Deputies are quite correct. This matter was debated at length on both Second Stage and Committee Stage. All of these amendments arise from concerns about the powers of detention and sale of aircraft for non-payment of airport, air navigation and communications charges.We have taken a policy decision not to impose the provisions of the revised Eurocontrol Convention concerning joint and several liability in the case of unpaid Eurocontrol en route charges. We are not providing in this Bill for those provisions in Annex IV of the revised convention relating to this matter. I assure Deputies Olivia Mitchell and Shortall that the passage of this Bill in its current form will not increase our current powers relating to detention and sale of aircraft for unpaid charges. There may be a perception that we are doing something new. I will clarify the position and give the facts. These provisions have been in place since 1988. It has been suggested that this may be unconstitutional and it may be challenged.I acknowledge that, in addition to Deputies Mitchell and Shortall voicing concern, a number of leasing companies also voiced concerns about the powers in earlier Acts dating from 1988 and asked, as the Opposition spokespersons to whom I refer did, that these be modified in the Air Navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill 2005. As a result of this and the contributions of the Deputies, I consulted the Attorney General's office and other interested parties such as the Irish Aviation Authority, the Dublin Airport Authority and Eurocontrol. All argued against the removal or dilution of the existing powers of detention and sale.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	343	Of course they did.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I am advised that the detention and sale provisions in Irish law are similar to those in UK law. Both are common law systems. Eurocontrol have also advised that Greece has a detention procedure and that Cyprus has legislation which will become effective on the entry into force of the revised convention which provides for detention of aircraft until judicial measures are taken against the operator and-or owner.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	345	That is outrageous.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	346	In addition, Eurocontrol has indicated that member states that have civil law systems have similar powers to seize aircraft for non-payment of debts. All of these procedures, whether under common or civil law, have the same effect of freezing the asset in question and making it available as a security for the payment of a debt.While I gave further consideration over the past ten days to the points raised by Deputies Mitchell and Shortall, I regret that I am unable to accept the amendments proposed and I will repeat a number of reasons for that. First, there is a safeguard for an owner in the selling of the aircraft for the purposes of meeting a debt to Eurocontrol in respect of liability of an operator. To sell an aircraft an application must be made to the High Court and the registered owner would have to be on notice of any proposed sale.Second, it is not a procedure that has been resorted to lightly in the past. In fact there has been no instance in the past, from 1988 to date, where an aircraft has been detained and subsequently sold due to non-payment of a debt to Eurocontrol. I would make clear, however, that the existence of these powers is regarded as having a significant deterrent effect.Third, the aircraft leasing companies can afford themselves financial protection by building provisions into their lease agreements with these aircraft operators. This facility is not available to the air traffic control provider when doing business with airlines. In practice an aircraft lessor is usually in a better position than an airport authority or air traffic control provider to monitor the financial status of the operator as it can specify any necessary requirements under the aircraft lease. Furthermore, any amendment to the legislation that would give rise to different legal treatment of leased versus owned aircraft would be inappropriate.The provisions apply equally to debts incurred by airline companies for Eurocontrol charges or for airport charges. Any change in the legislative provisions relating to Eurocontrol charges would give rise to different treatment of air navigation and airport charges. This would lead to arbitrary discrimination between service providers to airlines and would not be appropriate.Following consideration of all the views expressed by Members of the House, and by the Irish Aviation Authority, the Attorney General's office and the Dublin Airport Authority, I have decided not to make any changes to the existing powers at this point. We are not making any changes in legislation. This would not make it any more unattractive for aircraft to land in Ireland. It did not have that effect from 1988 to date and I do not see it having that effect in the future. I have looked at this seriously and taken on board all of the recommendations made to me. Regrettably, I am unable to accept the amendments, which I believe were tabled in good faith.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	347	There is not much point in repeating comments made on Committee Stage. The Minister of State made these five points on Committee Stage and they all were refuted. He is merely repeating them here again today. There is no point in pursuing it. It is regrettable that the Minister of State has decided not to concede any of these points, not to listen to the industry, who are extremely concerned about its impact on business here. There is a real risk that this will be challenged. I wish to press the amendment.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	348	The fact that it has not impacted negatively since its introduction does not mean that it is not a timebomb waiting for us. All it takes is one example of a grounded aircraft for Ireland to become a no-go area for other aircraft. That is the danger. It is not that it has not happened so far, but that it may happen and if so, we will become the pariah of the aviation industry. This is an important issue and I very much regret that it is not being taken on board.

#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I move amendment No. 6:In page 8, line 39, to delete "or".This amendment is grouped with amendments Nos. 7, 8, and 9 which refine the technical amendments to section 40 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001. These original technical amendments related to the consideration of appeals of airport and aviation terminal charges determinations made by the Commission for Aviation Regulation. The amendments made on Committee Stage to section 40 of the Act extended the maximum time available to the appeal panel established under that section to consider an appeal from two months to three months. They also extended the time available to the Commission for Aviation Regulation to consider any matter referred back to it by the appeals panel from one month to two months.There was a further amendment to section 13 of the Aviation Regulation Act 2001 to cover a situation where an appeal panel referred to the Commission for Aviation Regulation took place when the commissioner's post was vacant. The purpose of this further amendment, amendment No. 6, provides that in the event of a commissioner starting consideration of an appeal panel referral but being unable, through incapacity for example, to decide on an appeal within the proposed two-month statutory period, the appeal can be decided by the deputy commissioner or another commissioner. While this may be a remote circumstance, it is considered preferable to address it to avoid any doubt.

Following consideration of Deputy Shortall's amendment on Committee Stage, I have had the matter re-examined by the Parliamentary Counsel. The principle outlined in Deputy Shortall's amendment has now been accepted, but her specific wording has not. I take this opportunity to thank Deputy Shortall for highlighting this issue. I ask her to withdraw her amendment in favour of amendment No. 9a. In principle it does the same as her amendment, but I am advised the wording in amendment No. 9a is more acceptable.

I thank them and other Deputies who have contributed for their support and understanding and for their acceptance of amendments concerning the employee share ownership scheme for Aer Lingus and the appeals process regarding decisions of the Commission for Aviation Regulation.After the House formally agrees this Bill, it will return to the Seanad with the amendments approved by the House.Enactment of the Bill will allow Ireland to ratify the revised Eurocontrol convention which will provide for the necessary institutional reforms required to achieve a uniform European air traffic management system for the control of general air traffic in European airspace and airports. This revised convention seeks to provide for a more effective air traffic management institutional policy and decision-making structure for Europe, with the overall objective of increasing airspace capacity and reducing air traffic control delays.Cuirim mo bhuíochas in iúl do na Teachtaí as ucht an chomhoibrithe eadrainn i rith na Dara agus Tríú Céime den Bhille. Tá súil agam go mbeidh an Bille fíorthábhachtach seo tríd an Oireachtas tar éis na seachtaine seo chugainn.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	362	I said on Second Stage that the public at large had no idea we were discussing this Bill and could not care less. While it is arcane, technical and not easily grasped by the majority of people who have no interest in aviation or how it is organised, nevertheless it is important legislation for the aviation industry and for every one who travels by air. Eurocontrol does a very important job on our behalf. I thank those involved in drafting the Bill, a job I would not envy in any way. I agree with the Minister of State that the copperfastening of the shareholding for Aer Lingus is an important measure, to put a belt and braces on it, as it were. I thank the Minister of State for his courtesy, particularly as he took over this Bill mid-stream, which is no easy matter, and all the staff involved.

I dealt with the generalities of the legislation during my previous contribution, but given the week we have just had in terms of Irish sport, it is worthwhile to reflect on the relevance of sport to the Irish nation. It is often said we are a nation of sports fans, and last week during the Cheltenham racing festival I heard that said as a criticism. People do not seem to understand the psyche of sport and its importance to this country. I am not referring here to selfish, personal preferences but rather to the failure to understand the place of sport in the social fabric of this country and its hugely positive influence.The emergence of the Celtic tiger was by no means coincidental to the emergence of the Irish soccer team as a competitive international force, which gave us all confidence that we could compete internationally and pit our wits, in athletic terms, against anybody in the world. The supporters, the ordinary people of Ireland, travelled the world, held their heads high and provided an example of good social interaction without any of the security risks associated with certain international sporting events, particularly soccer events. It was a huge boost to the national psyche when we qualified for the European Championship in 1988 and the World Cup finals in Italy in 1990, the United States in 1994 and Japan and Korea in 2002.The renaissance of the GAA took place in the same period. The organisation which had been a bedrock in our local communities and national community for over 100 years has re-emerged and renewed itself over the past ten or 15 years. It has created a timeless memorial to the position of the association in Irish life and sport as well as in the sporting world itself, way beyond our shores. It has constructed an edifice that will stand up to comparison with any stadium I have visited and will do so for a long time to come. Those two factors over the past 15 years have proved how important sport is to the social fabric of the country.One only has to consider the sporting events of last week. Not well known outside her own discipline, a young woman from Cork, Derval O'Rourke, took gold in the world indoor athletics championships. It was a marvellous achievement that opens many possibilities at a stage in her life which could not be more timely.For the second year running, we had huge successes at Cheltenham. The jewels in the crown of champion hurdling, the Queen Mother Chase and the Gold Cup, were won for the second year in a row by Irish horses. The place of the Irish thoroughbred in international racing was reasserted in the most glorious and positive manner, not only by the trainers, the jockeys and the stable staff but also by the supporters who bring a level of enjoyment and positive social interaction to this important event.On Saturday, it was capped by a marvellous performance from the international rugby side against England at Twickenham. The performance from players, backroom staff and supporters reflected nothing but credit on the country.It is important that sport is considered not just as a business or a means of grabbing positive headlines at home or abroad, it must be considered holistically for what it can do for us as a nation, its health and social benefits and the general sense of community and positivity it brings. The Bill will give effect to the establishment and construction of a national sports campus. It will provide a magnificent facility for all national governing bodies of sport. On completion of the various phases, it will provide Ireland with an international campus that will stand comparison with most others in the world.When the original proposal for the national stadium was floated, the national sports campus was an intrinsic part of it. Unfortunately, the campus was overshadowed by the stadium project. The more important element of the project is the sports campus. I am delighted that it is going ahead independently of the stadium. It is the key to the future development of sport in the State. It must, however, be coupled with ongoing investment in local sporting facilities on a community basis. This has been the hallmark of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism for several years and particularly since Deputy O'Donoghue became Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.The top echelons of sport, particularly professional sport, are akin to showbusiness; they are professional, they are businesses and they are about entertainment. The sport we want to promote at local level on a community basis with the sports capital grant programme is not showbusiness. It may be entertainment in the broadest sense, but if it is, it is entertainment for a small number of people. However, it is real sport and the essence of sport as it should be. It is the type of sport that will generate the maximum advantage for our communities. I accept a showbusiness element is required. People such as Derval O'Rourke, Paul Carberry, Brian O'Driscoll and Shane Horgan are essential in sports. Although one wonders about sports stars as role models, by and large this country has been lucky. The majority of our domestic and international sports people are excellent role models who will inspire new generations. All sporting organisations have youth programmes on a national basis. The role model will encourage further participation.The Bill's provisions facilitate and encourage elite athletes in all sports, even the minority ones. I welcome the fact that facilities will be made available to the minority sports. It brings with it the prospect of sport-for-all. Although sport for all will not happen overnight, the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill is a key stepping stone to facilitating this worthy and realistic goal. The Bill will compliment the high achievers at international level of which we are lucky to have many. It has come about not by pure fluke but by well funded and well organised programmes from national governing bodies, supported financially by various Governments over many years. Sport for all is the goal to which we all aspire. In times to come, the legislation enabling the development of the national sports campus will be seen as the seminal event in the evolution of sport on the island. Hopefully, it will be looked back on gratefully by many participants at local and elite international level. I wish the Minister well with the project and I especially commend him on the highly successful term of office he has had to date.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this Bill which is important in terms of the development of the sports and recreational industry. I use the latter term advisedly. I concur with the sentiments expressed by my colleague Deputy Glennon on the importance of sport as a medium to enable people to express themselves locally, nationally and internationally. Sport also enables people to develop their disciplinary expertise in playing for the sake of it and not necessarily expecting to win all the time. One should be magnanimous in victory while also being able to accept defeat when it comes. Sporting endeavour is an important part of a human being's development.I do not want to dwell on the negative aspects of some recent incidents but I believe that if sport is adequately funded and plays a central role, the unsavoury events we decry from time to time will fade into the distance to be replaced by something more positive and people-driven than some other antics we have seen.The concept involved in this legislation is a good one. Deputy Glennon said that Campus Stadium Ireland overshadowed its contents, which is quite correct. I do not want to go down that route, however. I am glad that we have got to this juncture whereby we now have an opportunity to establish a centre of excellence in which everyone can become involved. Everyone will be able to participate in the venture as well as seeing where they are going and ascertaining the extent to which they can progress. That is critical, especially in the international sphere where we triumph occasionally. One such recent triumph was achieved by Derval O'Rourke, which was an excellent performance. She deserves all our congratulations, as do some of her colleagues who also participated in Moscow and did very well.I hope the developments envisaged by the Bill will give an opportunity to young athletes to become involved and develop their full potential. In this way, they will recognise the ability of sport and recreational activities generally to portray the country in a different light both here and abroad. No amount of debate here can do other than pay a simple tribute to the importance of those aspects of sport.The centre of excellence concept is a good one as long as a number of matters are observed, as I presume they will be. For example, there is no sense in having the requisite buildings and other facilities unless we have managers, trainers, dieticians and other experts to enable us to compete internationally. There is no reason we cannot do so. Many other countries as small or smaller than ours have done so repeatedly in the past.In the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s, when Ireland was relatively under-developed, we still had people who excelled in track and field events, including athletics. I will not bore the Minister by going through a list of them but there were a good few Munster people involved and we recognise their endeavours. Sport has been lifted to a new plane in the era of semi-professionalism, which puts greater stress and strain on competing countries. Some people say that these developments are not necessarily good for sport. Deputy Glennon is an expert in rugby who played at international level but I am not sure that semi-professionalism has done much good for that game. If one looks back at some of the rugby matches played in times gone by, well known players from all over the country could still have shown a clean pair of heels to anybody around today, notwithstanding the degree of professionalism that is emerging. In other sports, likewise, there are several similar illustrations.Sport is a medium for promoting the country's culture and tourism and has tremendous potential in this regard. In the not too distant future the Ryder Cup competition will be held in my constituency. I hope that those involved in all sporting categories will take full advantage of the situation to promote their own sports. Ireland should be promoted as a location where sport is pursued open-handedly with due regard for young amateur participants.Coverage of major sporting events can be of immense benefit to tourism. One cannot possibly measure the degree of positive advertising that can be gleaned from a major sporting event such as the Ryder Cup. My constituency has a long-established association with the racing industry, which I am sure will play a role in the presentation of various events accompanying the Ryder Cup competition. That will benefit not only County Kildare and its racing industry but also the country as a whole where sporting pursuits are encouraged. Australia, New Zealand and the United States take a keen interest in their own games, so we should not underestimate the degree to which we can promote this country positively through the medium of sports.Previous speakers referred to the GAA which has lived up to its responsibilities admirably. One may say that because the GAA is active in every parish it is easier for it to do so. Nonetheless, it is active at all levels in virtually every town and village. GAA clubs have provided social facilities as well as sporting expertise and training. The GAA deserves recognition for having provided the wider community with a large volume of social support. In the context of this Bill, due regard must be had for the GAA's work and the even greater contribution it will have to make in future as our population increases.Our population was low for 150 years for obvious reasons which I will not go into now. The fact remains, however, that the population will increase considerably beyond anything we can anticipate.In those circumstances, the degree to which sporting organisations can contribute to social inclusion, the promotion of the country's culture and the well-being of individual communities is significant and I hope it will receive due recognition.Track and field events are lonely sports, as anyone involved will state. In sports such as cross-country running, people train on their own. It is quite boring and requires a great degree of devotion as well as expertise and athletic ability. While the sport's organisation is available and supportive, support is also necessary from the State through the institutions we are discussing. It affords the State an opportunity to encourage and provide facilities for young people to allow them to develop their skills and advance.When I attempt to ask questions of the Minister on such matters as preparing for the Olympic Games I am usually refused because another organisation has responsibility. There is no reason we cannot compete effectively in the Olympic Games if we have the right training, preparation, promotion, opportunities and selection of the most suitable people. That would not serve to exclude others, as the ability to recognise those with specific talent is critical and is the work of a centre of excellence.Another role of a centre of excellence is to liaise with organisations throughout the country. It is pointless to have such a centre, and the sport development that goes with it, if it is isolated in Dublin, does not relate to the rest of the country and is not involved in a meaningful and promotional way with all centres of education at all levels, such as universities, third level and second level institutions.A centre of excellence must be able to identify at the earliest possible stage the sporting potential of young people. One cannot tell someone at 25 or 30 years of age that if he or she had been spotted in time, he or she could have been a great 100 m sprinter. That is of no benefit to anyone. The necessary technique is to identify such people at five, seven or ten years of age and develop them from there. That is what the best people do and I hope it can be done in the course of this development. Like everything else, the concept of the Bill is good and has great potential. Its success depends on what is done within the confines of the proposal. It may be very good and of significant benefit to the country in ways such as those mentioned by previous speakers. However, it will be useless if it is not followed up.I am sure the Minister knows in each sport it will be necessary to identify how best to promote, facilitate, prepare, train, and ensure the availability of the best coaches. It will also be necessary to ensure that when people want to progress, they are encouraged to do so and are reasonably assessed, by which I do not mean that they are put down, but that they are given a reasonable assessment of their ability so they can progress in the knowledge that they have a reasonable chance against certain competitors. I cannot understand how we can send people into the international arena who have never had a time even remotely close to their competitors. It is disheartening for the people concerned. Time, energy and effort should be put into increasing their speed to enable them to compete well, readily and evenly with their contemporaries. It would be hugely beneficial to their confidence and that of the country and to the development of sport generally.The Minister's Department covers many positive areas in which people like to be involved. People like to kick a football, play rugby and hurling, swim, get involved in track and field events and participate in sports. It is important we recognise it is also a means of promoting tourism and the image of the country. Deputy Glennon reminded me of Italia '90 and previous European competitions when hordes of Irish supporters travelled all over the world with their faces painted green, white and gold. We became recognised as a nation of good-humoured human beings who could go anywhere, have a few jars, enjoy ourselves and laugh it off.A peculiar development beset the country recently. We still have a few jars, perhaps more than we should on many occasions. However, we do not seem to have the same ability to laugh at ourselves and deflect the barb when it is thrown, resulting in some unsavoury scenes. I do not want to dwell on that unnecessarily. However, it is a development in our society which requires attention and sport is the best means of deflecting it. The Minister will recognise this is not a criticism of anybody. It is a simple fact of life that as we evolve and become wealthier, we tend to become more self-centred and of the opinion that we are superior. We are not. We are all human and should try to behave as normal, supportive human beings. Anything we do should reflect well on ourselves and our country. If we do not always win, we should be able to state it is only a game and not a life or death issue. The discipline that goes with sport allows us to recognise that and put it to good and positive effect in terms of how the country is viewed abroad.The concept of the Bill is good. I hope all sporting groups will have an opportunity to develop to the best extent possible. I hope the influence of the centre will spread throughout the country in an inclusive and all-embracing way, as a result of which our athletes will have the support, back-up and recognition they and the country deserve.
#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	367	Like the previous two speakers, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006. I agree with them that sport can be an all-embracing and powerful force in the community. In a comparatively small country such as Ireland the stock of resources matters less than how that stock is used to maximise efficiency. We will never have the resources that sport enjoys in Britain but last week when our rugby team won in such thrilling circumstances at Twickenham, it showed that quality can often be better than quantity. We cannot always beat our chests but there are events, such as that win, about which we can speak gladly.Sport is a social event and often provides an escape from the complexities and difficulties of everyday life. When we choose to pursue a sporting activity, be it hurling, rugby, soccer or golf we want it to be memorable and worthwhile. Elite athletes whose sporting ambitions are their livelihoods also want to avail of modern and professional facilities.Those who follow sport also share a sense of community through their allegiance to teams and sports heroes. This can lead to immense pride in respect of local and county teams, and national fervour and patriotism when there is success on the international stage. There were examples of this last week and not just in Twickenham. The games in Croke Park made an impact on Portumna and people there responded, despite the tragic accident that night at the team's homecoming. It brought a sense of euphoria to an entire area. The same was true of Newtownshandrum last year and the year before, and of clubs such as Nemo Rangers and Salthill last week. Sporting success can lift the country too as Deputy Durkan said.Sport can also be viewed as a natural regulator in society and a natural enemy of disorder and anti-social behaviour through its ideals of fair play, participation, co-operation, social interaction and respect for the rules. As those who have been involved in promoting community games know, the concept behind them is that people participate and medals are awarded. It has become very competitive but the initial idea was to get people competing rather than to focus on winning.It is important to foster sport at all levels. I hope that when we are finished with the development of the stadia we are discussing such a facility will be provided for community games. We ran into some trouble recently when facilities were not available. For example, Mosney was out of bounds for a time or was difficult to use. I hope the Minister, who is enthusiastic about community games, will comment on whether we can give them a new centre and area of recognition.People have become increasingly aware of the value of sport in promoting good health. Personal health nowadays covers physical, social and emotional well-being. Meanwhile we suffer from heart disease, cancer, strokes and obesity, all of which are significantly linked to a lack of activity. A sports strategy taking all these factors into account is needed to unite the Departments of Arts, Sport and Tourism, Health and Children, and Education and Science in a common aim. The national sports campus at Abbotstown has the potential to be such a unifying force.I was one of the few people from outside Dublin who was disappointed when the previous suggestions for Abbotstown and related projects were attacked. Any person who had a real commitment to sport and was not playing a political angle would have supported the concept. Some speakers mentioned minority sports. My major sporting activity was track cycle racing which is almost non-existent, primarily for lack of a velodrome or indoor racing track. This would have been included in the original Abbotstown concept. I was disappointed because people started to score political points and cite figures such as €1 billion when that was a frightening sum. Much damage was done. The same people would now tell us to grab the chance of hosting the Olympics and so on.The Government has a major part to play because public investment in sport must match the twin aims of cost-effectiveness and the personal development of individuals and communities. It is easy to keep track of economic success indicators but the benefits for the public good in terms of well-being and social capital are sometimes less tangible and harder to quantify but should be of most concern to the Government. While we may debate these benefits now and again, overall programmes must be built on such positive factors.Government intervention in sport does not cement the divide between the haves and have-nots but contributes to a situation in which sport is made accessible to all. We need to consider many aspects of that idea. I wrote to the Minister for Finance last year pointing out that it is difficult to get insurance cover to use school or other community-based facilities. I suggested that the State find some method of underwriting these insurance costs nationally. The Minister agreed with the idea but qualified it. We should return to the issue. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism is interested in promoting any idea that will help to promote sport.Sports funding for this year is close to €250 million. It is a great deal more than the €17 million allocated in 1997, even allowing for the gap in time. The public supports the idea of spending such a sum on sport, and on preventative medicine rather than hospital-based medicine, as far as possible. Everybody in this House should support that idea. The Minister has taken the lead in that regard and is involved in promoting projects across the sporting spectrum. Regardless of anybody's political affiliations or sporting allegiance, he has given it full support at every opportunity. There are many exciting projects under way, such as the redevelopment of Lansdowne Road and major investments in smaller club grounds throughout the country.We must compliment the GAA which was building and providing facilities before national lottery funding became available 14 or 15 years ago. This is true not just of the Croke Park development but also of hundreds of county and club grounds throughout the country.The Minister has been able to assist the development or refurbishment of many pitches and facilities. For instance, in my constituency, Cork South Central, many clubs providing facilities for a variety of sports have benefited from such developments. GAA clubs such as Blackrock, Bishopstown, Douglas and Nemo Rangers have undertaken major projects over the past two years or so. I hope my local St. Finbarr's GAA club will be able to do something similar this year. Major change is being forced on it by a realignment of a nearby national road route and I hope the club will be financed for its project.Another project in my area has grabbed my attention and I strongly support it because it follows the precept of the Minister to get people to share facilities. This is a gymnasium project based at Coláiste Críost Rí in Bishopstown, which is novel because it would become the centre for the Cork indoor bowls association, and indoor bowls is, for the older sector, the fastest growing sport, certainly in the Cork region. This would also be the home base for the Leevale athletic club, the home club of Derval O'Rourke, while the Bishopstown-Wilton badminton club would also be a tenant. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, always encourages the sharing of facilities and this project would be a textbook example of the concept. School personnel of the Presentation order and others are behind the project which I hope will be supported.The Government has spent more than €750 million on sport since 1997, with 18 swimming pool projects completed since 2000, Churchfield in Cork being among them. I had the honour of proposing in Cork City Council that the pool in Douglas be named after a former colleague of mine, a former lord mayor of Cork, the late Gus Healy. I hope that will be one of the pools to be modernised in the coming year.The national campus at Abbotstown will be the apex of this development in modernising Irish sports infrastructure and will provide top-class facilities to cater for both the elite and community sports people to international standards. Deputy Durkan mentioned how people improve all the time, but we have examples of late starters, probably none better known than the captain of our hurling team last year, Seán Óg Ó hAilpín, who started out at quite an older age for hurling. One is supposed to be born with a hurley because otherwise one cannot play the game, as most Kerry people discover. Seán Óg was a late starter in that regard but it shows that if encouraged, people can develop their talents and do not have to start at the age of five, six or seven.In 2004 the Government decided to move forward with the Abbotstown development after consultation with the major governing bodies in sport and other interested groups. Phase one of a five-year plan will provide a national field sports training centre, a national indoor training centre and sports science, medical and athletic accommodation facilities following on from the development of the national aquatic centre as part of the Abbotstown project. Training requirements for up to 30 national governing bodies will be met by the development at Abbotstown.This is the concept we want which is why I am so disappointed we had difficulties in the past. Major or minor, every sporting activity should be encouraged and have facilities. This is an exciting time for sport. The national sports campus will aid dedicated athletes such as Derval O'Rourke from Douglas, our most recent world champion, to continue to prosper on the national and world stage. Deputy Durkan mentioned staging the Olympics and clearly that is what we should aim at, but I also emphasise the community games concept. Reports after the Sydney and Athens Olympic Games indicated that the system of support for athletes in Ireland fell far short of what would be expected internationally, and the national campus will go a long way towards addressing that. We now have a chance to develop modern and up-to-date facilities which will be among the best in the world.To achieve our goals of participation, performance and excellence we need a network of facilities at local and national level to be built around one centre, the national sports campus. The estimated cost of the Abbotstown project is €119 million. It will have its detractors, as previous efforts had. Some people might say the money would be better spent on health but they might be the same people to bemoan our lack of success on the Olympics or World Cup stages. It is incredible that the same people will have such split views.As the Minister noted, the 2012 Olympic Games in London will present opportunities for Ireland to market itself as a centre for elite athletic excellence. The timeframe for the campus at Abbotstown appears to fit in too. If we are serious about the development of sport in this country we must invest, and the investment will reap major dividends in terms of elite success and community involvement if it is planned properly and done right. With the national sports campus at Abbotstown, Ireland is going for gold in a big way. We will finally be able to compete in the fast lane of world sport. I wish the Minister well in speeding up the plans as he negotiates his way down the winning straight. He has done some great training along the way.I also pay tribute to the Opposition. I do not know if Deputy Deenihan is the formal Opposition spokesperson on sporting activities but when I mentioned detractors and critics of the original concept, one of the real exceptions was Deputy Deenihan, a man who gave us rough going now and then — Cork being a smaller, modest county — when he hammered us a few times. However, he always supported the Minister in his genuine efforts to promote sporting activity. I come from a sports-mad county. If this Bill had been discussed this time last year, we might have felt we should have had a monopoly view on it because we had security guards to mind all the silver trophies at various functions. We may have lost our way a little at the outset of this year but I hope we will recover.Deputy Durkan mentioned Derval O'Rourke and noted that many of her co-athletes are doing very well and are just a few seconds from the centre of the rostrum. We also want to remember the community games, the Special Olympics and those with special needs. Sport is great at joining people and lifting their spirits. To revel in the success, we do not all need to participate, but those who take part in sport will forever talk of the friends they made, the enjoyment they got from it no matter how tough the training or how mad one might have seemed to be. When one has done 5,000 or 6,000 miles of training on a bike, one imagines one might be mad or wonders if one is doing the right thing. However, when we look back at the end of the day, all of us will have enjoyed our time in sport. We must look forward now, and the Minister is doing that by putting the plans in place. With the passing of the Bill which I hope will have support from all, we will move on to a very successful international stage.

Book of Proverbs, Chapter 29, verse 18 reads, "Where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law, happy is he".Politicians of all persuasions have to provide a vision but sadly in the chamber of Dublin County Council on O'Connell Street there was no vision at that time and the chequer-board pattern of land rezonings in north-west and south Dublin sowed the seeds of urban sprawl that continues to haunt us today. At the time the Green Party raised its voice about what was going on but that voice was drowned out by the snuffling of corrupt public representatives at the trough in Patrick Conway's pub on Parnell Street, around the corner from the council chamber on O'Connell Street. Some others had voiced concern. Frank McDonald and Mark Brennock from The Irish Times had dissected the dubious rezonings that had occurred. The Irish Planning Institute had publicly questioned what had been going on and the barrister, Michael Smith, and his colleague, Colm Mac Eochaidh had offered a £10,000 reward for information on alleged planning corruption. It is a damning indictment that in the current Government the Taoiseach has failed to condemn or discipline the members of his party sitting in the Oireachtas who have suffered collective amnesia in regard to the payments they received. At a time when members of my party were running election campaigns on a budget of hundreds of pounds Fianna Fáil was accepting thousands upon thousands of pounds and forgetting about it afterwards. They were dangerous times for speaking out and I would like to think we have moved on but many of the county councillors who made questionable rezonings then are still sitting on seats in Dublin City Council. Even Senator Don Lydon who caught our party leader in a headlock in the Dublin County Council——

#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I accept your ruling. Even Senators still sitting in the Upper House performed questionable acts back then. I note that an individual sitting in the Upper House admitted to the tribunal that he failed to disclose a £2,500 donation from Monarch Properties in 1992. The same individual caught my party leader in a headlock. It is time for the Taoiseach to take action and call to account those in his party who suffered from amnesia. Curious rezonings are still going on around Ireland. One need only glance at the website Irishcorruption.com to see many of the counties throughout Ireland being named and the individual acts of councillors who are performing rezonings for all the wrong reasons today.It is not a victimless crime. It is the people who suffer, those who have to commute longer distances to work, those who have no option of public transport who must have a car to drive several miles to buy a litre of milk, whose children have to be shoved into the car to get to school, and whose workplace is located dozens of miles from where they live. That is the legacy of corrupt rezoning that continues to today. It is time a line was drawn in the sand by the Taoiseach and members of the Cabinet to rule out those kinds of rezoning.The only action taken by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government was to call to attention Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for not rezoning enough land and the debased currency under his tenure and previous Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government continues without a whimper from successive Ministers.The way forward is simple. All parties must decline funding from developers as the mere acceptance of such moneys is an undue influence on development decisions. We have to put in place measures to ensure the majority of the increase of value in rezoned land accrues to the State and we have to endorse and legislate for the recommendations of the Kenny report of 1974. Put simply, that report stated that local authorities should have a pre-emptive right to acquire rezoned land at the existing use value plus 25%. That, in one fell swoop, would remove the influence brought to bear on elected representatives. It would also help to reduce the crazy house price inflation of recent years. It would allow local authorities to buy land for development for housing, for local authority housing, voluntary housing associations and affordable housing. That would slice a significant chunk off the over-heated prices in the marketplace.There is an onus on the Taoiseach to act. He was handed the ninth report of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution almost two years ago which contains the recommendations of the Kenny report and has failed to legislate. The Taoiseach should not only move against Members of the Government but on those recommendations that have held the test of time. Time and again in the property pages we note that lands have increased tenfold and 100 fold in value overnight as a result of questionable rezonings. The answer is simple and the Minister could move on that if the will was there but, sadly, I doubt the will is there.We also need to create properly planned communities. They need to be well-designed and contain a variety of housing types and tenures. The Minister must upgrade the building regulations that have fallen far behind what is on the Statute Book in the UK. We need a mixture of uses in development, rather than sterile industrial estates located miles from where people live. We need to encourage people to live, work and relax within the same neighbourhood. That can be done and if the Minister is mindful he can make that happen through the use of planning regulations. We also need to ensure these communities are well linked by sustainable transport. In partnership with his colleague, the Minister for Transport, he can make that happen and I urge him to do so.

It is important to cast our minds back to that time. I have the distinction of being the first Deputy to call for the resignation of the former Minister, Ray Burke. At the time a commentator said to me that it was a low blow. It was not, it was the truth. I remember a Fianna Fail backbencher, a fairly decent bloke, standing up and asking me if I was trying to tell him that if somebody put £30,000 on a table in front of me that I would not take it. I said I would not. He rolled his eyes up to heaven and walked off. That says something about the culture of the time. It says that the person who does not take money is the oddball and that it would be human to take the money.My colleague, Deputy Cuffe, said we should draw a line in the sand. I remember the former Minister, Ray Burke, standing in front of the gates of this House telling us he had drawn a line in the sand. I also recall the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, saying she had full confidence in Ray Burke. Does the Tánaiste have confidence now in all her Fianna Fáil colleagues? I suspect the reason she is not saying anything is that she too has been part of that culture. I also believe the Taoiseach is not taking action because he hopes that tribunal fatigue has set in and that everyone is tarred with the same brush. "Sure they are all at it" is the refrain, but we are not all at it. There are people who do not want to take bribes or, as they now call them, legitimate political donations.I recall the evening when there was a motion of censure against the former Deputy Liam Lawlor. He was left alone on the backbenches and treated like a pariah. His friends in the Fianna Fáil Party deserted him. I decided to go up and speak to Liam Lawlor. I asked him if he would not make a clean breast of it and tell everything he knew and he replied, "All in my own good time, John". That will not happen now but it is interesting that he had information which he passed on to me. I will not be one of those people who abuse Dáil privilege and reveal this evening what he told me. There are others in this House who abuse Dáil privilege, but I am not one of them.

That was published in The Sunday Business Post and it is worth going back over it because it reveals the reason the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, does not take action against anybody on the opposite benches. It states:The Tánaiste proposed or seconded seven motions with the former Deputy Lawlor for section 4 approval or material contravention of the county development plan. The proposed developments included a section 4 directing officials to grant a planning application for a Mr. V. Cosgrove for a restaurant at Rathcoole service station on the Naas Road. A planning official said at the time that "the proposed development would endanger public safety by reason of a traffic hazard".It goes on to state that there was a development for a Mr. Henry Beattie. The article states:Mr. Beattie was a Fianna Fáil activist and neighbour of the Tánaiste at the time. A section 4 motion proposed by Deputy Lawlor, seconded by Deputy Harney, directed the council to grant permission to another neighbour of the Tánaiste [that is Mr. Beattie] for a bungalow at Brownstown, Newcastle.All this is on the record. It further states: "At that stage——

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The Private Members' motion before the House this evening in the name of my party colleague is one of the few opportunities we have had in the 29th Dáil to either bring forward Private Members' legislation or bring to task what we believe are poor standards in the Government's day-to-day operations and in upholding the standards of public life in general. In all the Private Members' time my party has had in this Chamber we were fortunate to have won the support of other Opposition parties and Independent Members of this House. We welcome any process whereby motions we put down are subject to amendment because, unlike others in this House, we do not operate on the maxim of knowing what we know and knowing more than others. On those grounds we look with interest on amendments that have been tabled to our motion by other Opposition parties. They appear to suggest other routes of achieving the same objective and we would be open to such discussions.Unfortunately, there appears to be a quibble with some of the wording in our substantial motion and I take this opportunity of putting those quibbles to rest. Our motion condemns those parties that have failed to discipline their members. It is fairly accepted that one party more than others has been predominant in all this process but it is also an established fact that other political parties have chosen to discipline their members by other means. There have also been parties of Government during this period which have not done so.There appears to be a difficulty with the part of our motion that states that funding should be declined from developers. I note in the Labour Party amendment it is willing to set up an all-party grouping to look at means by which all political party funding is examined. We would be prepared to go down that road but in terms of the most recent political history of this country and political decision making, both at local and national level, in the way property developments proceed here, it would be a statement of intent, and not to wait for decisions made in other places, that all political parties in this House would decide that particular types of donations from particular types of corporate entities should no longer be accepted. If other parties have difficulties with that, that is something they need to examine in terms of their own decision making processes.I share the views of my two party colleagues who opened the debate on the motion regarding the points we are trying to make. It is unfortunate that in the nine years of the lifetime of this intertwined mono-Government, regardless of its intention to appear to be some type of coalition, there has been no attempt to bring forward reforms in this area. There have been no attempts to tackle the culture that existed then and may even exist, albeit on a smaller scale, today. In particular there has been no attempt by the head of the Government to discipline members who have, by public utterances, deviated from what should be normal, accepted standards of public life. Such individuals, when they have been caught out in the nature of their behaviour and the standard of their public representation, still find themselves members of a parliamentary party supporting the interests of the Government and keeping such a Government in power. It is our duty as an Opposition party to question the inconsistency and even the immorality of the lack of action in that area. On these grounds, this Governments stands indicted. The substantive Government amendment is several times longer than the Green Party motion and is nothing other than a sea of verbiage. The Minister makes no attempt to defend the poor standards for which his Government has been responsible.Our party is not confident that the Government will take on board anything from our motion but we feel confident that the reality of those poor standards in public life will hit home in the coming general election when the electorate makes its decision.

It is often said that the people are suffering from tribunal fatigue. Since 1997, the planning tribunal under Mr. Justice Flood and Mr. Justice Mahon has slowly exposed the complex web of planning corruption in and around our capital city. This has been a very cumbersome and drawn-out process. The tribunals now seldom make the headlines. It is true that many people have switched off, but that does not mean that people have forgotten or have absolved those involved in planning corruption — far from it. The tribunals have been a process of education, confirming what many of us suspected for years — that there was a corrupt relationship between developers, property speculators and the establishment political parties in this State. In recent times, certain senior members of those parties have admitted receiving very large payments.Although we cannot go into detail, It is crystal clear to anyone with a brain that those payments were not made by developers out of the goodness of their hearts. Conveniently, certain witnesses claim that they have forgotten about payments made to them. The tribunal may find that in most or all cases, there was no evidence of illegality. It may not even use the word "corruption", but only the most naive and the most partisan can refuse to believe that Dublin County Council in the 1980s was rotten with corruption. The developers and speculators called the shots.Two questions arise. What was the result and what has changed? The result was bad planning on a massive scale. People were housed in what were often badly built and badly serviced estates with few facilities. We live with the legacy of that to this day. Large and often sub-standard local authority estates were built with communities experiencing high unemployment. The speculators stripping the inner city for profit forced long-established communities out of the city and into these suburbs. That is part of the forgotten human cost of corruption.The brown envelope culture has been exposed but it has been replaced with the institutionalised brown envelope. This Government's housing policy is driven not by the housing needs of families and individuals but by the profit motive of developers and speculators who still call the shots. Early this month housing figures exposed the abject failure of this Government's social and affordable housing policy. They confirmed that we now have legalised and institutionalised bribery of local authorities by developers, facilitated by this Government. It has allowed developers to bribe their way out of providing social housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. As originally passed, this Act required developers to devote 20% of each housing development to social and affordable housing. The friends of Fianna Fáil in the construction industry raised an almighty clamour and the Act was amended to allow them to side-step this obligation by paying money or providing land to local authorities. Seldom has a lobby succeeded in getting a law changed in such a short time.The amending legislation to allow the developers off the hook was rammed through the Dail with the use of the guillotine in December 2002 and it has turned out exactly as we predicted. It has done nothing to provide homes for those most in need of them. It has fuelled the spiralling cost of housing and encouraged property speculation. We now find that of 80,000 new homes built last year, only 830 were allocated to local authorities under Part V of the Act. That is not much more than 1% of all housing and is a far cry from the intended 20%. Since 2002, more than 230,000 homes have been completed for sale on the market, a third of which are second homes or owned by investors. At the best estimate, just over 1,600 have been provided under Part V of the Act. That is pathetic.When Part V was introduced in 1999 the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, said "the plan will lead to an additional 35,000 local authority units, an increase in the voluntary housing sector provision of houses . . . to 4,000 a year and an increase to 2,000 units per year under the current local authority affordable housing and shared ownership schemes". That reads like a bad joke. Less than 6% of all housing now being built is local authority housing. More than 130,000 people are denied decent housing in one of the wealthiest states in Europe. When I raised this with the Taoiseach recently at Leaders' Questions, his ears were closed. If the Government were really sincere about housing and planning, it would reinstate the requirement on developers to provide homes under Part V, implement the recommendations in the report of the National Economic and Social Forum and set a target for the provision of homes for the 43,600 households on local authority waiting lists.I have been calling for a just social housing policy since my election in 1997. There is no prospect that this Government will change course in its remaining time in power. I can only hope that we can place our trust and faith in the people and that we will see real and substantive change after the next general election.

Níl aon loighic le roinnt de na cinnithe móra atá déanta sa tír seo maidir le tógáil mótorbhealaí nó príosúin nua in Thornton Hall. Ba cheart dúinn féachaint ar an mótorbhealach atá ag dul trí Theamhair. Tá siad ag díol beairicí do lucht an rachmais, na tógálaithe, seachas d'údaráis áitiúla. Níl aon loighic ar na cinnithe seo seachas go bhfuil an Rialtas ag iarraidh slad a dhéanamh ar an oidhreacht agus an timpeallacht chun a bpócaí féin a líonadh. Tá sé sin fós ag tarlú. Nuair a fhéachtar siar 20 bliain, tá an t-airgead sin fós ann, agus deirim go bhfuil brú fós ar an chosmhuintir bogadh as Baile Átha Cliath, mar níl siad ábalta maireachtáil agus tithe a cheannach i mBaile Átha Cliath, nó fiú i mbailte móra eile timpeall na tíre.Molaim an rún seo, agus tacaím go hiomlán leis.

#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I am happy to speak on this motion, and while I fully support its thrust, I have one small caveat. I would not want to suggest that all builders and developers should be tarred with the same brush. There are those in the construction sector who are not corrupt and do not pass brown envelopes to people but who make a vital contribution to the economy.However, there are ongoing and shocking revelations in tribunals. Part of the problem may be that we are so used to hearing such revelations that they are no longer shocking, and ordinary people simply shrug their shoulders with grim acceptance of a totally corrupt situation. In that context, I fully understand, accept and support this motion's intent. I was not a member of Dublin County Council in the dark days referred to by the Green Party. In that context, I commend those who stood up and were counted, shedding some light on this dark and corrupt corner of Irish life. We owe those people a debt, since they put their heads above the parapet and risked ridicule, which at times was heaped upon them.There have been far too many instances of unacceptable methods being used by certain developers seeking the zoning or rezoning of land. There has also been an unacceptable accumulation of large land banks by a small number of developers who have been placed in a position to dictate the excessive cost of housing throughout the country and especially in the Dublin area. Land acquired for development should be built on within a short time or surrendered at an equitable price to be used for its zoned purpose. If that mechanism existed, we would not have the current, totally unacceptable situation where numbers of social and affordable houses built are massively short of Government targets. It reflects once again the unacceptable influence of developers on the Government.I see particular merit in the Green Party's call for greatly increased efforts to create properly planned communities. In recent years, there have been some improvements, but they still fall far short of what is needed. We are still building housing estates without adequate infrastructure, especially social infrastructure. There is not adequate community space, indoor or outdoor, for communities to meet, flourish, integrate and create their own sense of identity and pride of place. Communities need adequate child care and recreational facilities. Otherwise, we are actively destroying them.In this House we speak of children on the street and childhood obesity, yet we are guilty by omission. We have community and voluntary groups and local associations raising money and lobbying every politician in sight, writing tonnes of letters and generating hundreds of Dáil questions and answers. It happens because we still allow developers to build estates and developments without providing the community space. We must live as communities and not as individuals in boxes all in a row.When we speak of sustainable communities, we must ensure we include rural ones. Given that one third of people live in the country, we must ensure that the choice remains for those who wish to continue to live in rural areas. Current rural housing guidelines are still too restrictive and will not allow rural areas to regenerate themselves or maintain a balance between rural and urban living. I urge the Minister to revisit the current rural housing guidelines——

In England, they seem to have loans for peerages, but in this country, it is donations for land rezoning or brown envelopes for contract work. Let us stop kidding the public and call a spade a spade. When senior Ministers or leaders of political parties get donations in envelopes in the middle of the night and then claim not to remember the kind donor, the public simply does not believe them. It is as plain and simple as that. That is the reality and what people on the street are saying.What a country this is, now that we have a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who blatantly abuses his power. He shows no respect for due process or the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. He gloats and brags about taking out the Centre for Public Inquiry, which was established to root out corruption and sleaze. He destroyed Frank Connolly's name by leaking files. He stayed silent on the Greysteel massacre and evidence regarding collusion. He huffs and puffs about crime while working-class people are slaughtered on our streets.This political bully and intellectual snob has to be challenged, and I do so tonight. He is silent regarding his colleagues' amnesia, since he too will look after his powerful and wealthy friends. He should resign and apologise to the Irish people for damaging the integrity of the office of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. This is clearly where I stand. He should also apologise once more to Deputy Gormley and the Green Party for his recent remarks. A little humility might do him well in future.Regarding the motion, I commend the Green Party for highlighting the sleaze and corruption in Irish political life. I agree with their philosophy and political vision that green politics is clean politics. I advise them, however, not to get into bed with right-wing, conservative, pro-war, pro-greed, pro-exploitation parties. They will destroy that vision and damage their integrity.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	422	This motion is about the common interest of the Irish people, their families and communities. Once known as the land of saints and scholars, Ireland today is better known as the land of scandals and tribunals. Politics, banking, the church, business, medicine, law and the gardaí have suffered from an erosion in public confidence in the wake of an astonishing list of scandals. Moreover, Ireland has undergone rapid social, economic and political change over the last decade that has had a profound impact on its value system. For example, the declining authority and influence of the Catholic Church in recent years has forced many to seek other sources of ethical and moral guidance. However, this creates dilemmas of its own. Difficult decisions about the distribution of resources raise awkward questions for society. How is the tension between the rights of individuals and the overall good of society to be resolved? We will not look for guidance from the political elite, the Christian church, the medical and legal professions or from business leaders. All have had their credibility seriously tainted by damaging scandals. Politicians have damaged the integrity of politics. We must face up to this reality and win back politics for the vast majority of the people.Moreover, the housing situation is a scandal, as we are unable to provide homes for young couples and people on social and affordable housing waiting lists. This is unacceptable. I also challenge those parties which have failed to discipline their members for their collective amnesia with regard to money received from developers and their agents, at a time of widespread rezoning by local authorities. I am amazed at the brass neck of some politicians in this House, Ministers and leaders of Opposition parties included, who state they cannot remember, or found nothing strange or amazing about people coming with envelopes in the middle of the night.This motion is about honest politics and a fair and just society. It is concerned with cleaning up politics and with decent and quality planning. Finally, it is about respecting our citizens and ensuring a quality of life and future for our children. I urge all Members to support the motion tabled by the Green Party.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"having established and resourced the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments:—notes the four interim reports of the Tribunal and awaits the findings of the Tribunal on matters currently under examination in public hearings, as well as any overarching recommendations for legislative amendment;—notes the comprehensive ethics framework applicable to local government councillors and employees under the Local Government Act 2001, supported by separate Codes of Conduct issued under the Act in 2004;—notes the importance attached by this Government to probity in public office generally, as reflected in the Standards in Public Office Act 2001, the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 and the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004;—notes the detailed controls in relation to political donations and election spending enacted in the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1998, the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, and the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001;—notes the increased transparency of the planning system under the Planning and Development Act 2000;—commends the Government's commitment to implementing the National Spatial Strategy (NSS) as the strategic national planning framework for achieving more balanced regional development, in the context of Ireland's rapidly changing economic and social circumstances, including population growth which will see the population increasing to around 5 million people by 2020;—notes that the NSS is having an increasing influence on policies and programmes across a range of Government Departments and agencies, underscored by the Government's decision in July 2005 that the regional dimension of the next National Development Plan, now in preparation, will be broadly based on the NSS;—notes that at regional level, a key policy bridge between national development priorities and local planning has been put in place with the adoption of Regional Planning Guidelines in each region to provide a strategic framework for local authority development plans and local area plans;—notes that the priorities of the NSS and regional planning guidelines have been recognised in the Government's 10-year investment plan for transport, Transport 21;—notes the success of Government policy in expanding the range of housing supports and facilitating record housing output in the face of unprecedented demand;—notes the requirement upon planning authorities to prepare housing strategies providing for a mixture of house types and sizes to meet the needs of all categories of households, including provision of Part V social and affordable housing, and to zone adequate land to meet these projected housing needs;—welcomes the record levels of funding being provided for social and affordable programmes, under which, for instance, 23,000 units of social housing will be commenced in 2006-2008;—endorses the Government's new Housing Policy Framework ‘Building Sustainable Communities', under which active land management strategies are being put in place to support an expanded programme of social housing delivery in mixed community settings; and—notes the broad range of measures under which an element of the increased value of zoned and serviced land may be recovered, including, development levies, Part V provision of social and affordable housing or its equivalent value, capital gains tax and the Government's readiness, if necessary, to pursue other options in this regard."While I have a great deal of time for Deputy Cuffe on a personal level, I am amazed at his brass neck in talking about amnesia. Frankly, I am stunned. I like him as a person, but when it comes to the hypocrisy stakes he takes the gold medal, or rather his friends over there on the Sinn Féin benches do so. No one in politics can be happy with what went on in Dublin County Council during those years.  However, regardless of what went on in Dublin County Council, something infinitely more sinister was going on over on those benches.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	517	Since the Government was elected in 1997, it has done more to tackle corruption than any Government since the foundation of the State. First, it has established tribunals to investigate planning corruption and payments to politicians.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	518	To bury the issue.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	519	Second, it has improved the transparency of the planning system. Third, it has introduced a new regime of ethics in local government. Fourth, it established the Standards in Public Office Commission. Fifth, it introduced new controls over political donations and finally, it modernised the legislation governing corruption.In that context, the motion tabled by the Green Party and supported, among others, by Sinn Féin, is cynical and opportunistic in the extreme. Given the pop-eyed indignation from the Green Party at reported comments by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform earlier today this motion is also somewhat hypocritical, to put it mildly.In a blatant attempt at political point scoring, the Green Party Members seek to pre-empt the ongoing work and ultimate findings of a tribunal of inquiry established by the Oireachtas. They also seek to tar all politicians in the main parties of this State as criminals or closet sympathisers.They ignore the substantial body of legislation introduced by this Government to ensure probity in public office and in the public service. More importantly they ignore the fact that the vast majority of the men and women who serve in political office, from all parties in this State, do so with integrity. The bizarre proposition——
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	520	More than the vast majority.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	523	That particular section of law is part and parcel of the democratic law of the land. The vast majority of people from all political parties in this State have nothing to do with hypocrisy or corruption and have served with great integrity. By drawing this broad stroke across all political parties, the Green Party does politics a disservice.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	525	Through a mixture of innuendo, allegation and conspiracy theory, they would have us believe that our planning system is corrupt and inefficient, when by any international standard it is open, transparent and effective.Indeed, the Green Party has some brass neck to preach about the planning process. This is the same party that regularly supports professional protesters who have scant regard for the planning process. We see this in my constituency, where they came out to support professional protestors who have wasted tens of millions of euro in taxpayers' money in the Glen of the Downs and Carrickmines.

They deliberately conflate a range of important issues in a failed attempt to attack the genuine achievements of the Government in planning and housing delivery, and they endorse a policy proposal that could have major implications for the housing market.

However, the Government has put down its own constructive amendment, outlining what has been done to root out corruption, and we consider that this is a more positive approach. We will be pressing our amendment.I have no intention of engaging with the Green Party in fruitless discussion or argument concerning recent disclosures at the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments. These tribunals which were set up should be allowed to run their course and produce their reports, and then we can deal with them.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	535	The bottom line is that the tribunal was established by the Oireachtas to investigate acts of planning corruption and it continues its work in public hearings.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	545	To date, the tribunal has issued four interim reports, which made certain findings. Following the conclusion of its public hearings, the tribunal will prepare and furnish to the Oireachtas its final report. In this regard, the tribunal has a mandate to make recommendations and, at that stage, we will follow those recommendations.
#CiaranCuffeGP	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-party	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-dob	unknown-#CiaranCuffeGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	546	We all will be dead at that stage.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	547	While we await the completion of the work of the tribunal, the Government has not been slow to put in place reforms to protect the openness, probity, fairness and efficiency in the operation of the planning system. To this end, we have introduced various new measures to improve the openness and transparency, a few of which I will outline. For instance, the Planning and Development Act 2000 extended the existing rules relating to ethics for planning authority staff. It also introduced more opportunities for public consultation and scrutiny of both zoning decisions and the grant of individual planning permissions, and it increased political oversight of the system of development contributions.As well as changes to the planning code, there have been significant developments in the legislative and regulatory framework governing the conduct of public representatives and public servants. In so far as local government is concerned, the Local Government Act 2001 provided a new and comprehensive ethics framework for local government employees and councillors. As its starting point, the Act provides that it is the duty of every councillor and employee to maintain proper standards of integrity, conduct and concern for the public interest. The framework is based on three basic requirements, first, an annual declaration of a wide range of interests, second, disclosure of any pecuniary or beneficial interest in a matter coming before the authority and, third, a public register of these interests. There is also a requirement to disclose interests in any matter which arises in the performance of functions by the local authority and in which the councillor or employee concerned or a connected person has an interest. Failure to comply with the key requirements of this legislation is an offence and the penalties concerned have been set at a high level to achieve a clear deterrent effect.In addition, separate national codes of conduct for local authority employees and councillors were published under the Act in 2004. Their purpose is to set out standards and principles of conduct and integrity, to inform the public of the conduct it is entitled to expect and to enhance public trust and confidence in the local government system.Of course, we already had the Local Elections (Disclosure of Donations and Expenditure) Act 1999, as amended, which sets out comprehensive requirements on the size and disclosure of political donations. The Local Government Act 2001 is bolstered by other public service-wide ethics legislation.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	548	There is no limit to expenditure in local government elections.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Under the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 corruption is presumed where there is proof that certain persons in public office have received money or other benefits from a person who has an interest in the way certain functions are carried out or the outcome of specified decisions, including planning decisions. In effect, this reverses the normal burden of proof. A person who receives a payment in these circumstances will have to prove the payment is not corrupt, instead of the prosecution proving that it was. This should make the prosecution of corrupt payments much easier.The Standards in Public Office Act 2001 provided for the establishment of the Standards in Public Office Commission with wide investigative powers, and the Members are aware of the facts there. The Act imposes on politicians an obligation to have one's tax affairs in order and to swear a statutory declaration that this is so. Members of the Dáil or Seanad are required to furnish annual statements of registerable interests. The Commission can also have regard to a person's compliance with the Local Government Code of Conduct in carrying out its functions.The Electoral (Amendment) Acts 1998 and 2001, together with the Local Elections (Expenditure and Donations) Act 1999, strengthened substantially the controls that apply to political donations and election spending. The new controls included a requirement to open special accounts for political donations.This corpus of legislation reflects the intent of the Government that our planning and local government systems, as well as the wider public service, are seen to operate to the highest standards of probity in the common interest. Therefore, I reject emphatically any suggestion that we are less than wholehearted in our pursuit of this objective.I consider that the body of law I outlined provides a robust framework within which legitimate political donations can continue to be received across the political spectrum. I do not accept the proposal that all such donations from any particular group must be deemed undesirable per se. That is a nonsense. That discredits politics. I have outlined what the Government has done and emphasise, because Deputy O’Dowd is looking across at me, that this was built on a good foundation that was put in as we were coming into office. Those are the facts. There is a substantial body of legislation. It is new and it is working.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	556	With regard to the scale and nature of the physical development which has taken place over past decades, there is common cause in this House that it is not good enough that, as has happened in the past, we built without putting the infrastructure in place. Certainly, nobody can suggest that I have any less interest in this than anybody on the benches opposite because I have a record on the matter over the years.Building sustainable communities means delivering quality dwellings in quality developments with a proper transport infrastructure, social services, schools etc. Expanding communities need education and health facilities, child care services and so on. Departments and regional and local authorities have been working, and will continue to work, together to ensure the unprecedented rate of population growth and housing development being experienced in Ireland is planned for in a manner that will support more balanced regional development and the creation of sustainable communities.In planning for housing provision, we need to ensure high standards are applied and this will be done through quality development plans and local area plans. The Green Party has members on local authorities which make those plans, and the party can make an input there.Reference was made to the issue of urban sprawl. I am not familiar with a case in which the Green Party has favoured higher density developments.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	561	From a national perspective, the eastern half of the State has witnessed the most rapid development over the past decade. It has been a challenge to respond to this phenomenon in infrastructural investment in areas such as transportation and housing, two issues referred to in the motion.Housing development rapidly accelerated over the past decade throughout the so-called outer Leinster counties. Housing output in the Dublin city and county area was more static. However, this has put more distance between where people live and work. However, in recent years a good deal of progress has been made in countering these trends. In a far-reaching measure, the Government has for the first time put in place, and is committed to implementing, a national spatial strategy. The strategic planning guidelines of 1999 and their successors, the regional planning guidelines for the greater Dublin area, GDA, have set a policy framework aimed at accommodating significant population and housing growth in the GDA.Major development areas such as the Adamstown strategic development zone, Pelletstown and the north fringe of Dublin city have been facilitated by significant and continuing investment in critical and enabling infrastructure such as new water services schemes and enhancement of the capacity of rail and bus services. The concentration of development in these areas represents best practice in the effective integration of physical planning and provision of transport and essential services.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	566	About a week ago. Transport 21 will support the spatial development framework for the GDA from a transportation perspective. In Adamstown, for example, this will result in the four tracking of the Kildare-Heuston suburban rail service, providing a rapid and frequent link between west Dublin and the city centre and other transport networks such as Luas. People and communities will also benefit from the extended Luas, the new metro and the quality bus corridors systems which the Transport 21 plan will deliver. I hope that when these projects come up for critical planning, they will have the support of the Green Party.

Last year was the 11th year of record house completions, with output of more than 80,000 units. Crucially, we are delivering where demand is most acute and have increased supply to 18,000 units in Dublin and 28,000 in the GDA. This is almost double the level of a decade ago. In overall terms, the quality of Ireland's housing stock is very high.

This will be a major challenge but one where this Government's track record justifies confidence.

While we will continue to facilitate the strong housing market necessary to meet the needs of our increasing population, the market on its own cannot address the housing problems.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	591	Accordingly, the provision of strong support for social and affordable housing remains a key objective of this Government.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	593	The Deputy should at least have the honesty to acknowledge that fact.We are using these resources to good effect. In the past three years, local authorities have started on average 5,100 units, 40% higher than the average number of units commenced between 1994 and 1997. During that period, the voluntary and co-operative sector supplied approximately 900 units per annum but this has increased by two thirds to average 1,500 units in more recent years. A total of 23,000 new units of social housing will commence between 2006 and 2008. Rather than crow from the benches, Opposition Members could join me in encouraging local authorities to meet or surpass their targets.Further households will be assisted through the new rental accommodation scheme. The output of affordable housing in 2005 was double that between 1994 and 1997. A total of 15,000 units of affordable housing will be delivered between 2006 and 2008. Almost 100,000 households have benefited from various social and affordable housing measures over the past eight years. We are greatly expanding this provision and we expect 50,000 households to benefit from various social and affordable housing measures over the coming three years. Part V will make an increasing contribution to meeting these targets.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	595	It will make much more sense than anything the Deputy has said.The delivery of housing under Part V of the 2000 Act is beginning to increase significantly. At the end of 2005, almost 1,400 units had been delivered during the year, 2,500 were under construction and a further 3,500 were proposed under agreements with developers.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	596	That is 1%.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I expect 6,000 social and affordable units will be delivered under Part V between 2005 and 2007.Recognising the affordability issues in the Dublin area, the Government last year established a new agency, the Affordable Homes Partnership, to co-ordinate and add impetus to the delivery of affordable housing in and around the capital. The partnership is well established and is making good progress on the implementation of its work programme, including the advancement of affordable housing projects on State lands and co-ordination of the provision of housing related infrastructure.The new housing policy statement, Building Sustainable Communities, provides the framework for a wide-ranging review of housing policy. To support the introduction of these policy initiatives, my Department has commissioned a research study into apartment size and space standards that will feed into new planning guidelines due later this year. I share the concerns about the quality of some apartments. Additional guidance on best practice mechanisms in the effective linkage of the development of new residential areas with the provision of wider social infrastructure such as schools and amenities is also envisaged.The Green Party motion proposes the recovery of betterment due to land rezoning, through the introduction of a complex mechanism first proposed in 1973, the designated area scheme, whereby local authorities would be required to designate and acquire all development land in the State at its existing value, plus 25%.Before addressing this proposal, it is worth pointing out that there are already a number of existing mechanisms that in effect recover increases in value arising from planning decisions to improve public infrastructure. The longest standing is capital gains tax.

Fine Gael proposes an amendment which reads:To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and substitute the following:"—condemns the corruption in planning matters exposed by the reports of the Tribunal of Inquiry into Certain Planning Matters and Payments;—condemns the actions of those public representatives, officials, developers and landowners who engaged in the corrupt activity outlined by the tribunal; and—notes the deterioration in public standing of all politicians as a result of this corruption;calls:—for the immediate passing of whistleblower legislation to protect those working in local authorities who reveal corruption; and—on all parties to fully comply with the provisions of the Electoral Acts in relation to financial donations."Our amendment deals specifically with one issue which we think will bring about an immediate change in how people address corruption and planning in local government generally. It calls for the immediate passing of whistleblower legislation to protect those working in and elected members of local authorities who reveal corrupt practices.The corruption that was so prevalent in local authorities in Dublin in the 1980s and 1990s must be unequivocally condemned and I welcome this opportunity to condemn it. It seems that at that time, the era of Mr. Charles Haughey and Mr. Ray Burke, the system of planning in this city was hijacked by a few greedy people intent on making a quick buck, regardless of the consequences on our system of planning, on local government and on the communities of Dublin. Corrupt politicians, landowners, developers and their intermediaries must share the blame for the disgraceful series of events that occurred. This must never be allowed to happen again.Central to the change required is a proposal that comes from the Standards in Public Office Commission. In its 2004 report it recommended a whistleblowers' charter whereby council employees and councillors who reported illegal, improper, unprofessional or unethical activities would be protected. However, successive Fianna Fáil Ministers have ignored this recommendation.The Minister is ignoring the issue also. Where Fianna Fáil dithers, Fine Gael, in government, would act. The Fine Gael amendment calls for one of the most vital anti-corruption tools in the history of the State to be put in place, whistleblowers' legislation. Faith in government is at the heart of democracy and we will not take a back seat on issues of transparency and faith in local government but will enact the necessary legislation.I wish to address some of the issues with practical suggestions for what we ought to introduce. I made these suggestions previously, but will make them again. Notwithstanding all the Minister said, he is missing an important opportunity to change our local government system. We want him to introduce a code of ethics or code of planning practice to which councillors and officials throughout the country would sign up. This system would be open and transparent and if any members of the public felt it was not being followed they could make a complaint through the relevant office dealing with the code or standards. This system could be set up immediately. Despite all the pious talk on the issue, we will have nothing if we do not act now. Land rezonings around the country create millions in profit for some people and the matter must be addressed. I accept that the tribunals have a significant part to play in how we deal with this issue, but this does not mean we should stand idly by as the Government has done by refusing to face this reality head on.British county councils have adopted a code of practice that we could follow. When councillors are making decisions they are under a lot of pressure from the community. We need to ensure that when a decision is made, the common good of the community is the sole consideration at the time of the decision. To ensure this, we should protect our councillors and provide them with the same guidelines as provided for British councillors. They should not make statements in advance of a meeting on how they will vote on a controversial planning matter, they should not take up a campaigning role for or against an application, they should not act as an advocate for groups opposed to or supporting the application and they should not take part in prior consideration of the application through membership of organisations such as residents' groups, lobby groups or civic societies which are consulted on the application.This does not mean that councillors should remain silent about an application or should not listen to or meet developers or other groups. Councillors are entitled to express a legitimate concern about an application when approached by constituents. Care must be taken and councillors should not approach a decision with a closed mind. A key point is that councillors must act in a quasi-judicial fashion. They must act independently and as if they are judging all the evidence in each case. At the heart of the corruption in Irish life is the absence of such a code of ethics or guidelines which would reinforce and ensure councillors would always act with due process and without prior commitments.A further section of the British code of conduct is important. It suggests that in personal dealings with applicants councillors should be mindful of the need to avoid giving a firm commitment to support or oppose the application. They should bear in mind that their overriding duty is to the whole community and not just to the people in their ward, that planning decisions need to be taken on planning grounds and that they should avoid the appearance of improperly favouring any person, company, group or locality. They should not accept gifts, hospitality, bribes etc. These are simple fundamental rules that we could introduce and I urge the Minister to introduce them because this would protect the body politic and the public and would have due process in the planning area.A key point of the British code deals with an issue at the heart of the planning problem. It recommends that all elected members should pay particular attention to the professional advice and recommendations of officers. Councillors should not be bound to follow officers' advice or recommendations, but they should only depart from the advice or recommendations when they have good reason to do so, based on clear and legitimate planning grounds.The current situation here does not insist on these protocols. We should introduce this code. I do not see why the Minister cannot do so after consultation with all the parties in the House. One of the proposals made by the Labour Party was that we should get together on this. Let us put forward the proposal and see how we can bring about change. A core Fine Gael belief is that we must ensure the public has total confidence in the planning process. I know the Minister believes the same so let us do it.I welcome the condemnation of corruption from all sides of the House but I am sick to the teeth of Sinn Féin lecturing me on corruption when they, or their associates, are the very people who have robbed banks left, right and centre throughout this country, most recently the Northern Bank.

However, that is done now.I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion, which is principally about the function of elected members with regard to planning. Elected members have two rights or responsibilities in this regard. They have the duty to adopt, every five years, a county or city development plan. They also have the right, written into legislation, to implement what are known as section fours and, sometimes, material contraventions, of the plan. This is very dicey ground. Section fours or material contraventions of the plan should only be entered into in extreme circumstances. That said, there are cases where a section four is necessary because sometimes planners do not get it right.I was a member of two local authorities, a county council and a city council, for many years. I was involved in the adoption of at least four county development plans and three city development plans and I am aware of the pressure exerted on councillors when a development plan is being adopted. Working as a councillor was relatively easy when I started in 1974. It was left to the councillors and officials to adopt the plan. However, as time went by, and especially in recent times, lobbying became much more severe and demanding. No matter who came to me with recommendations for a county or city development plan, I listened but kept an open mind until the draft plan was published. Once the draft was published, people were entitled to make their submissions but I still kept an open mind until I had read the manager's report. Only then did the council collectively make a decision on adopting the draft plan or supporting submissions referring to that plan.One could get very strong representations from those on both sides of the argument. For example, a draft development plan is produced. A man has 20 acres on the outskirts of a town or village which it is proposed will be zoned residential. There are meetings with community councils, residents' associations, the public and lobby groups to which all elected representatives are invited and which, particularly during an election year, all attend. Councillors will be lobbied. Submissions will be presented to have the land zoned as an open space, for example. Councillors then have a decision to make. If the land is zoned residential, it would probably be worth, in terms of land in Galway, approximately €16 million to the land owner. If the land is zoned for open space, it would be worth about €3 million or €4 million. The difference could be as much as €14 million and that is an enormous responsibility for elected members to bear. Perhaps there is a better way to adopt development plans than the method used heretofore.I understand from councillors on the city and county councils now that the lobbying has become even stronger than before. Councillors are under severe pressure. They are also lobbied by those who wish to have their land zoned as residential land in the draft development plan. When the matter of open spaces is being decided, planners use maps and outline where they should be located. They should consider, where several landowners have adjoining lands on the outskirts of towns or cities, the option of zoning part of each landowner's land as open space rather than designating all of one parcel of land as residential and the other as open space. That might solve many of the problems that arise and would make it easier for councillors to make a decision on the matter.The Planning and Development Act 2000 contained a provision requiring developers to devote 20% of their developments to social and affordable housing. In 2002, that Act was amended to allow developers to give land, money, some houses or some of each instead. They were not even required to give land in the area being developed but could give land from any part of the local authority area. For example, around Galway city in the areas of Castlegar, Oranmore and Moycullen, land is very valuable so the developers offered the local authorities land in Glenamaddy, Tuam and other places, where land is not as valuable. They have succeeded in doing that because of the Government amendment to the 2000 Act. The Government simply caved in to the demands of the developers, some of whom they meet annually in Galway at a famous sporting event.I call on the Minister, Deputy Roche, who I think was the Minister in 2002——

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	629	It might have been real money but one's name and family are worth more than that, as is politics. People have let down the political system, the people who elected them and the community. My name is worth more to me than £1,000, £1,500 or whatever the case may be.I come from a constituency where that problem did not exist until this year. In fact, at times we were looking for developers to build houses, but that is no longer the case. Will the Minister, as a former councillor, review the drafting of development plans? The officials have all the resources of the State at their disposal. They have consultants, engineers and others advising them on what is right. When a development plan is being adopted, councillors should be able to employ an independent consultant who will advise them separately from the officials. The officials have their own people and resources but the councillors should at least be advised by a professional person.Deputy McCormack is correct about lobbying, which has never stopped. In fact I had first-hand experience recently, even though I am not a member of the council, of lobbying in my area in Westport. A parcel of land was zoned as agricultural and a certain sporting organisation wanted that zoning to be maintained. It wanted to buy the land and develop it into a sports ground. It was zoned as commercial and was sold for €3.5 million last week. That is what rezoning means. A bit of land that was worth possibly €100,000 as agricultural land was sold for €3.5 million as commercial land.Local authority officials should not have all of the power in the planning process. There should be a committee comprising elected representatives and planners from the council with an independent planning officer who will adjudicate on a decision on which he or she believes there will be no agreement. As a former member of a local authority, I feel we have given away all its powers.

The one power that must be reconsidered is zoning. Some other process must be put in place where local authority officials and elected council representatives are both involved. I never believed I would say that in the House. The time has come for another process for re-zoning land. The current system allows for too much temptation with big money and with the builders having an input into political parties. Councillors do their best and make the best decisions they believe are correct.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	632	A community hospital for Tralee has been promised since 1999. Since that time, Tralee senior citizens, campaigning for the hospital, have met with three different Ministers, all of whom have given their word that the project will go ahead. The last meeting was as recently as May with the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. Many of the senior citizens who initiated the campaign in the mid-1990s have since passed away.Despite the undertakings given by Ministers and the high status of the proposed hospital in the Health Service Executive, HSE, capital programme, it is feared the project will be further delayed. The HSE has informed the campaign of unresolved revenue costs implications of the project. It is feared this may be used by the HSE as an excuse to abandon or further delay the project.Given the ongoing crisis afflicting Tralee General Hospital, any further delay in the building of a community hospital will place further strains and pressures on the provision of health care in Kerry. Many in the county are unable to access care, particularly in emergencies.Tralee General Hospital is the second largest of the southern region's seven acute hospitals and provides services to County Kerry, as well as a proportion of people in west Limerick and north Cork. Statistics have shown a marked increase in demand, yet the hospital is forced to get by with the same number of medical staff as 20 years ago. Facilities are stretched beyond limit with an unsustainable nurse to patient ratio. I commend the staff and physicians who are doing fantastic work in spite of these factors.A full-time consultant cardiologist with necessary support services is urgently needed in the area. A long-promised consultant cardiologist was appointed in March 2005 and shared with the Bon Secours Hospital in Tralee but has since resigned. A replacement is being sought but again that consultant will have to be shared with the Bon Secours Hospital. County Kerry has the highest rate of coronary diseases in proportion to its population. The 2003 national cardiovascular strategy report recommended the appointment of a full-time cardiologist for the county. The strong support for such a provision was proved by over 30,000 signatures on a petition that a cardiologist be appointed.Tralee General Hospital services a large catchment area of north Kerry, parts of west Limerick and into east Kerry as far as Killarney. However, it has no public community service for elderly people in need of full-time care. This week, a 72-year-old woman attended my constituency office. For the past ten years she has minded her husband, who suffered a stroke, at home in north Kerry. He was recently moved to a community hospital in Killarney. If she wanted to visit him, she would have to drive 75 miles on a round trip. Due to her health and age, she is not in a position to do so. Instead, she is dependent on family members and neighbours to take her to visit the husband with whom she has shared 40 years of her life.This is the situation across north Kerry where there is no facility for elderly people in need of full-time care. Anyone in that situation will find themselves located to St. Columbanus's Hospital in Killarney. People living as far away as Tarbert must drive to Killarney to visit their loved ones. It is an intolerable situation. I appeal to the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, to make the funding available for a community hospital to be built In Tralee to allow elderly people live their lives in dignity and security.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	633	It is the policy of the Department of Health and Children to maintain older people in dignity and independence at home in accordance with their wishes, and at the same time to provide high quality residential care for older people when living at home is no longer possible.The Government's commitment to the development of a comprehensive range of services for older people has been demonstrated by the significantly increased resources made available in recent years. From 1997 to 2005 inclusive, additional spending on services for older people is in excess of €302 million. In the budget package announced for 2006, additional revenue funding of €150 million in full year costs was allocated, that is €110 million in 2006 and a further €40 million in 2007, for services for older people and palliative care.The proposed development in Tralee is a 50-bed unit to be built on a greenfield site located off the Killerisk Road, Tralee. The facility will comprise two modules of 25 beds each, plus ancillary facilities providing continuing care, respite and convalescent care to dependent older people.The prioritisation of all health capital developments is a matter for the HSE under the Health Act 2004. The capital plan has been approved by the HSE board and was recently submitted to the Tánaiste for consideration. The plan, which includes the proposed development at Tralee Community Hospital, is being considered by the Department of Health and Children in conjunction with the Department of Finance. I expect to be in a position to revert to the HSE in the near future about the plan.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise the important issue of funding for the Health Service Executive, HSE, in the north east.The population of counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth and Meath, in what was then the north-eastern health board region, has increased more than in any other region between 1971 and 2002. The most recent figures available show that between 1996 and 2002 there was an increase of 12.7% as against an 8% rise in the overall population. From 1971 to 2002 the population increased from 250,000 to almost 345,000 in the north-east region and that trend has continued at a significant rate to date.Unfortunately funding for health services in the north east, even this year under the new HSE, has not taken into account the massive population increase. The most dramatic increase is in the 25 to 44 year age group. There is also a massive increase in the number of persons aged 65 years and over, many whom have to be dealt with by the HSE through home help or home care and nursing home structures with the support of subvention. The demand for the services provided by the HSE continues but unfortunately funding does not match. Funding is based on the funds supplied when the health boards were established in 1971. It was not adjusted to take account of the massive increases in population in the region. Having raised the issue before, I appreciate arguments will be made that the north east benefits from the services provided by hospitals in the Dublin region. However, the same can be argued regarding the midlands, the west or any other region.My problem and that of the people I represent is that we find out the services available in other areas are completely different. For instance, only recently I came across a seriously handicapped person having to use a wheelchair. She had lived in Donegal were she was receiving 12 hours home care per week, yet because her husband's involvement brought him to Monaghan she now receives only two hours.In another case I dealt with, a constituent from Cavan-Monaghan was put into full-time care in the western region to be near some of her family members. However, the owner of the home could not believe the difficulties he had in getting the subvention agreed initially and then getting payment of that subvention from the time the person entered the nursing home. He told me that there would not be the same financial pressure in his region.Another issue of serious concern is the fact that almost 10,000 people in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan have lost their medical cards since 1997. That figure is out of a population of 109,000 people with an average income, according to Government statistics, of approximately €14,500. By comparison, only 8,000 people lost medical cards in the county and city of Cork, with a population of 550,000, although the figures suggest the average income there is around €16,000.Out of a national population of 4 million, 100,000 medical cards were lost. This clearly shows a totally unacceptable and uneven distribution of access to free medical care, with Cavan-Monaghan at a serious loss. This loss was even more clearly highlighted to Oireachtas Members from Monaghan who, with the deputation from the VEC, met the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. They were advised that the only reason Ballybay College in County Monaghan was not classified as disadvantaged was the fact that parents of the children did not have medical cards. That means they would have to pay for bus services, if such were made available. In addition, they do not benefit from the free book scheme or the back to school clothing allowance.This is the reason I am not just asking but begging the Minister and the Health Service Executive to treat the people of the north east on equal terms, like everyone else, for funding. They are not seeking better terms or asking for any advantage. Wherever they live, elderly persons should have the same services available to them. A low-income couple with a young family should have the same right to a medical card as those elsewhere. I urge the Minister to ensure that a per capita sum is made available nationally, rather than being based on some historical and irrelevant numbers that bear no relation to the current situation.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	635	I thank Deputy Crawford for raising this matter on the Adjournment and I wish to reply on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.The aim of the home help service is to enable people, who might otherwise need to be cared for in residential care, to remain at home where appropriate. It is recognised that the home help service is an essential support to family and informal carers. In line with the Government's continued commitment to community support for our older people, an additional €33 million was allocated in the budget to the home help service —€30 million for 2006 and €3 million for 2007. The additional investment will provide 1.75 million home help hours this year and is being implemented in a flexible way by the HSE.By its nature, the home help service is a flexible service which responds to clients' needs. As a result, therefore, the level of service required in individual cases will fluctuate from time to time. To ensure effective prioritisation of the service, assessments are undertaken at local sector level and carried out in all cases by the Health Service Executive's public health nursing services. The service is targeted at high and medium dependency clients in accordance with their assessed needs. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the implementation of the home help service on a national basis. The HSE has advised the Department that it is currently implementing the national rollout of the additional €30 million allocated to the service for this year.In addition, €55 million was also allocated in budget 2006 for home care packages. It is planned to have an extra 2,000 packages in place by the end of 2006, almost trebling of the current service. Home care packages will deliver a wide range of services and in many cases these will also include an element of home help.In the case of the particular example cited by the Deputy, the HSE has indicated to my Department that it would be happy to review this case if requested.Under the Health Act 2004, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Persons aged 70 and over are automatically eligible for a medical card without reference to their means. Assessment guidelines, having account of both income and allowable outgoings, are used by the HSE to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility. These guidelines are not statutorily binding and in cases where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the HSE considers that his other medical needs or other circumstances would justify this.Information supplied to my Department by the HSE's primary care reimbursement service for March 2006 indicates that there are 1,168,273 persons covered for services under the general medical services scheme. This is 23,190 more than the comparative figure for January 2005. A further 10,034 people hold GP visit cards.Funding of €60 million was provided in 2005 to the HSE to provide an additional 30,000 traditional medical cards and a further 200,000 persons with GP visit cards. Since the beginning of 2005, significant improvements have been made to the way in which eligibility for medical cards and GP visit cards is assessed. In January 2005, the income guidelines were increased by 7.5%. In June 2005, the means test for both medical cards and GP visit cards was simplified. It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work costs. This is much fairer to applicants.In October 2005, the income guidelines for both medical cards and GP visit cards were increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now approximately 29% higher than they were at the end of 2004. It will be noted that the income assessment guidelines used for GP visit cards are 25% higher than those used for medical cards. The HSE has publicised these changes to encourage people to apply and has made the application process as simple as possible. The HSE has also provided a national information helpline. My Department and the HSE will continue to monitor the number of cards issued and will examine any further changes to ensure the targets of an additional 30,000 medical cards and the provision of 200,000 GP visit cards are met.Records show that between June 1997 and March 2006 the number of medical card holders recorded by the HSE has reduced by approximately 76,000 — that is, from 1,244,459 to 1,168,273. However, these changes may largely be attributed to the increased number of people in employment and the improved economic situation nationally with people on higher wages. The ongoing management and review of medical card databases has also been a factor which has improved data quality in the HSE's databases.Regarding counties Cavan and Monaghan, current information for March 2006, provided by the HSE, shows that there are 35,540 people with medical cards compared to 34,752 in March 2005. Thus, over the last year, the number of people with medical cards has increased by 788. Furthermore, including GP visit card holders, there are 1,191 more people in counties Cavan and Monaghan who now have free access to GP services under the general medical services scheme than this time last year.
#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	636	I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for the opportunity to raise this issue which is important both to my constituency and the east coast generally. I refer to the decentralisation plans for Drogheda and south Louth. Some time ago, many parts of the country welcomed the Government's decision to decentralise significant portions of the public service. People recognised the significant economic impact that decentralisation would have in the target locations.Being situated in the North-South corridor, Drogheda was one of the prime locations to be considered as part of the decentralisation programme. The decision to relocate a significant number of public service employees to Drogheda was welcomed. In recent years, the town has been one of the most rapidly growing areas on the east coast and some may say in western Europe. The number of housing units built in the town has grown phenomenally and a significant dormitory population live in Drogheda and work in Dublin. That they can live in Drogheda and commute on a daily basis to Dublin is a tribute to the positive and worthwhile investment in road infrastructure by way of the M1 from Dublin to the Border. It illustrates the importance of investment in our road network for the development of towns such as Drogheda in County Louth.People in the public service have significant and understandable interest in coming to Drogheda. I am sure it will be much easier for public servants who live on the north side of Dublin to turn the car northwards towards Drogheda than to face the traffic problems they may encounter in going to work in various Government Departments around the city.It goes without saying that people with an interest in the completion of this project are anxious to see the timescale for locating the offices in Drogheda and for public servants to begin to come to the town in greater numbers than previously. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply on this subject.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	637	I thank Deputy Kirk for raising this matter. On behalf of my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, I wish to reply. The Government's decentralisation programme envisages that the headquarters of the Department of Social and Family Affairs will be relocated to Drogheda, County Louth, together with a number of other public service operations, including, inter alia, Comhairle, Reach, the social and family affairs appeals office and certain maritime elements of the Department of Transport. All told, the total number of posts to be decentralised to Drogheda is approximately 700. These numbers will provide a significant and welcome economic boost to the town of Drogheda.The Office of Public Works has the task of sourcing suitable property solutions to meet the requirements of the decentralising Departments and agencies throughout the country. The office has made good progress in this regard. To date it has completed or significantly advanced property acquisition negotiations in 23 of the more than 50 locations targeted under the decentralisation programme. Sites for the balance of the decentralisation locations are also being actively pursued by the Office of Public Works.In the case of Drogheda, the Office of Public Works has identified a number of centrally located sites which meet the criteria of the decentralisation implementation group together with those of the relevant decentralising bodies. These sites are in the ownership of the local authority. Agreement in principle has been reached with the local authority officials for the sale of these sites to the OPW for decentralisation purposes.Detailed site investigations and archaeological assessments are under way and are expected to be completed shortly. In tandem with the ongoing technical assessments, negotiations on the terms and conditions of sale have commenced with the local authority. Subject to satisfactory terms being agreed and satisfactory outcomes to the technical assessments, the Office of Public Works hopes to be in a position to complete the purchase of the selected sites in the near future. The decentralisation implementation group has set out indicative timescales for the completion of the construction of decentralised offices in the "early mover" locations, which include Drogheda.The indicative timescale for construction completion in the case of the Department of Social and Family Affairs offices is the first quarter of 2009. For the maritime related bodies, the indicative timescale is the first quarter of 2007. It is important to remember that these timescales are indicative. This reflects the fact that many unforeseen circumstances could impact on these timeframes. However, the Office of Public Works will continue to strive to ensure that the decentralisation plans for Drogheda are implemented within the indicative timescales set out by the decentralisation group.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I wish to raise the situation regarding the Westport fire station. In 2003, details of the fire service capital programme were announced, which included the construction of a new replacement fire station in Westport. Approximately €445,700 was recouped by Mayo County Council to meet expenditure already incurred in respect of the site and fees for the Westport project. On 26 October 2005, the Department authorised Mayo County Council to invite tenders for the construction. The tenders have come back to the council and the Department. However, to date an announcement on the fire station has not been made.I wish to outline how serious the situation is in Westport, a town that has almost doubled in population during recent years. It has 12 hotels and in the summer months the population trebles. Last night, the fire service had to travel as far as Leenaun to deal with a serious fire and tonight it has been called out to another fire.I compliment and congratulate the station officer, Noel Duffy, and his staff for the excellent job they have done over the years on behalf of Mayo County Council and the people of Westport and surrounding areas. They have been in rented accommodation for a number of years and it is time the Minister made the announcement and provided the necessary funding, which is the problem.I believe €4 million has been allocated for the construction of the station, the cost of which has increased to €4.4 million. If that is the problem, I ask the Government and the Department to sanction the extra €400,000. However, they should first appoint a contractor and start building as soon as possible. A site has been chosen, planning permission has been received and everybody is ready for the development.During the local elections last year, I thought the former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, would dig the foundations and put down the blocks when he was in Westport because announcements had been made. I thought it was ready for off and that the roof would be on the building before he left the town that evening. That has not happened.I hope the Minister of State will have good news for the fire station staff, that the project will be sanctioned, that we will have the tender out next week and that the operation will be up and running as soon as possible. The staff are in rented accommodation, which costs a small fortune. Westport is an expensive town and it would be better to put the money into a project to get their own building up and running and to give that staff the building they need to provide their service. It is not fair that staff work in rented accommodation unsuitable for the job they do.Everything is in order and I hope the Department and the Minister will sanction the project within the coming days. The tender has gone in and it is a matter for the Government to select a builder, announce that funding has been approved and get the project up and running.
#SeanPower	unknown-#SeanPower-party	unknown-#SeanPower-dob	unknown-#SeanPower-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	639	I thank Deputy Ring for raising this matter. I wish to reply on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The Minister is aware of Deputy Ring's interest in the provision of a new fire station at Westport and he shares his desire to have this project completed as quickly as possible. There has been no delay in dealing with this proposal since the Department approved the contract documents for the project on 26 October 2005. Mayo County Council advertised for tenders on 25 November with a closing date of 30 December.Following examination of the tenders by the county council's technical advisers, a proposal for the acceptance of a tender was submitted to the Department, where it was received yesterday. This proposal must now be examined in the Department before a decision can be notified to the county council. This is likely to be within a number of weeks unless queries give rise to further correspondence between the Department and the county council. Assuming that everything is in order a decision will be announced within a couple of weeks. Funding will be available for the project as expenditure arises and a sum of €445,700 has already been paid to the local authority in respect of site costs and fees.

The Government also determined that the general scheme should be sent to the Office of the Attorney General for priority drafting. Deputies will have noted that the general scheme is a large and complex document, comprising 148 heads and four Schedules. However, I hope that priority drafting should facilitate publication of the Charities Regulation Bill during 2006.The matter of legal structures for charities does not constitute the purpose of the future Charities Regulation Bill, which is to regulate the charities sector for the first time since the foundation of the State. Under An Agreed Programme for Government, there is a commitment to ensure accountability of the charities sector and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud. That is the commitment on which the Charities Regulation Bill will deliver.In the two weeks since publication of the general scheme for the Charities Regulation Bill, the feedback from the charities sector has been favourable. The general scheme has been called "a hugely positive step in the right direction". A welcome has also been given to our stated intention that the legal structure of those charities which are companies limited by guarantee under existing company law will not hinder compliance with the new legislation. The Charities Regulation Bill will ensure that dual registration and dual filing of annual returns, that is, with both the future charities regulator and the Companies Registration Office, will be avoided where corporate charities are concerned.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I dealt with this issue comprehensively during Priority Questions. The Government is fully committed to providing supports to vulnerable Irish communities living abroad. This commitment is clearly demonstrated by the allocation of significant funding directly from the Exchequer to support emigrant organisations. The figure in 2006 comes to over €12 million.With regard to the dormant accounts fund, the Deputy will be aware that disbursements are designed to assist three broad categories of persons: those who are economically or socially disadvantaged, those who are educationally disadvantaged and persons with a disability. In light of the significant funding for emigrant organisations as outlined above, it is my intention that allocations from dormant accounts in 2006 will remain focused on tackling disadvantage in Ireland. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that following Government approval, I announced details on 4 January 2006 concerning the allocation of €24 million for the purpose of supporting programmes and projects tackling economic and social disadvantage.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	643	I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 94 together.My Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy 2001-08. This incorporates the work of the local and regional drugs task forces and the young people's facilities and services fund. Through these initiatives a broad range of community and voluntary groups are funded to tackle drug misuse.To date, approximately €125 million has been allocated to implement in the region of 440 projects under two rounds of local drug task force, LDTF plans; approximately €99 million has been allocated under the young people's facilities and services fund to support in the region of 450 initiatives; and a further €13.66 million has been allocated to projects under the LDTF premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. Expenditure on the implementation of the new action plans of the regional drugs task forces, which cover all areas not covered by a local drugs task force, commenced in 2005 and allocations totalling almost €5 million have been made to facilitate getting a range of projects up and running in the regions this year. Furthermore, funding of the regional drugs task forces will be increased incrementally over a number of years until full implementation of their plans is achieved.A sum of €43 million has been allocated in my Department's Vote for the drugs initiative-young people's facilities and services fund in 2006. This represents an increase of 37% on the original 2005 allocation and a massive 61% increase on the 2004 figure. It will allow us to consolidate and build on previous investment and continue to tackle the drug problem in a comprehensive way.All of the projects and programmes funded through the national drugs strategy have been devised through a partnership process involving consultation and discussion with the relevant Departments and agencies as well as the community and voluntary sectors. I am satisfied that the range of activities and initiatives currently being funded represents a comprehensive approach to tackling the problems of drugs misuse.

Older people benefit under a number of my Department's programmes and schemes, including the local development social inclusion programme, the scheme of community supports for older people and the community development programme. This is in addition to the supports for older people provided by the Government across a range of Departments.A number of groups focusing on the needs of older people also receive funding from my Department, including the Federation of Active Retirement Association, the Older Women's Network and the Senior Citizen's Parliament. I do not believe that the establishment of a dedicated community development unit for older people would necessarily improve service to this important group. Indeed, the focus at the moment is on promoting linkages, cohesion and sharing resources between existing local and community agencies to improve service delivery generally.

However, as I have recently indicated, an additional €5 million has been allocated to the community services programme in 2006 to fund new projects. It is my intention to expressly include services for people with disabilities in the eligibility criteria for new project funding. My Department is engaged in discussions with the Federation of People with Disability and with the Department of Health and Children to determine how best to complement existing services.Responsibility for the social economy programme transferred to my Department on 1 January 2006. It has been renamed the "community services programme" to reflect the fact that I intend to change the nature of the programme from a labour market training scheme to a scheme which supports essential community services. In addition, disbursements of dormant accounts have a particular emphasis on disability. The Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board approved 109 projects under the heading of disability, totalling almost €18.4 million.

The White Paper on Rural Development defines Government policy in this regard and provides a context for realising these goals.In view of the time that has elapsed since the publication of the White Paper, Brendan Kearney and Associates were engaged in June 2005 to prepare a background report on changes in factors affecting rural development since the publication of the White Paper on Rural Development 1999. A copy of this report has been forwarded to the Deputy for his information.At present, my Department together with the Department of Agriculture and Food are jointly engaged in the preparation of a national strategy for rural development for 2007-13 as required by the new European Council regulation on rural development. A detailed national programme will be prepared following completion of the national strategy. This will be submitted to the European Commission with a view to its agreement by the end of 2006 to enable commencement of the new programme in January 2007. The report prepared by Brendan Kearney and Associates will be used in this context.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I propose to take Questions Nos. 73, 78 and 91 together.I refer the Deputies to my answer to Question No. 116 on 8 February 2006 where I made my views on issues of access to the countryside clear. On that occasion and in my speech to the Irish Farmhouse Holidays Association I stated that a local community based approach is the way forward where issues of access to the countryside arise. Where it is not possible to reach agreement, in a particular location, alternative routes should be explored and developed so that landowners' rights over access to their lands are not interfered with. In addition, I must again restate my view that any proposal for direct Exchequer payment for access would not be acceptable.The issue of access to land and the development of walkways is one that can only be solved by the active participation and support not just of farmers and recreational users of the countryside but also the wider rural community, who stand to benefit a great deal from the development of activity based rural tourism, including walking. For many years in rural Ireland, communities have adapted and used their heritage, music and archaeology to promote their areas to tourists. I firmly believe, however, that the area of activity based holidays is important but has so far been left relatively underdeveloped in rural Ireland.The issue of access to land is fundamental to this question and it was in this context that, in February 2004, I established Comhairle na Tuaithe to address the three priority issues of access to the countryside, developing a countryside code and developing a countryside recreation strategy. Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and State bodies with an interest in the countryside. It has approached its work in a spirit of co-operation and through working groups, which progress components of these aims.Comhairle na Tuaithe has identified and reviewed a set of access parameters in the countryside, which it believes will serve as a basis for conflict prevention and integrate a variety of needs and responsibilities. It has also agreed the key features necessary for countryside code development, with a focus on the potential application of the internationally recognised Leave No Trace initiative. Details of the access parameters and the countryside code are available in a booklet, which I launched in September of last year and on my Department's website at www.pobal.ie.Comhairle na Tuaithe is currently working on the development of a national countryside recreation strategy. The first phase in the development of the strategy involved consultation with interested parties. In this regard, it invited submissions from interested individuals and groups. The three main farming organisations, that is, the IFA, the ICMSA and the ICSA, made submissions to Comhairle na Tuaithe following the call and each of the organisations listed has a representative on Comhairle na Tuaithe and is actively involved in the development of the strategy. I have also met with representatives of the farming organisations to discuss their views on the matter of access to the countryside in particular and countryside recreation in general.I look forward to receiving the draft strategy from Comhairle na Tuaithe following its consideration of the issues arising. I will, of course, carefully consider any proposals which Comhairle na Tuaithe makes regarding countryside recreation which will help inform policy decision in the wider rural development domain.

Under this round, the board approved 521 projects for funding totalling over €60 million. While to date approximately €13 million of this amount has been drawn down by successful applicants, the amount drawn down from 1 January 2006 was over €2.5 million. Full details of these draw downs, including the names of the relevant organisations and the amounts involved, are in Table 1.The Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Act 2005 provided for significant changes in decision making on disbursements from dormant accounts. Following the commencement of the Act on 1 September 2005, the Government now makes decisions on disbursements in line with the process set out in the legislation. In this regard, the Deputy will be aware that the Government approved the allocation of a further €60 million from the fund in 2006. A breakdown of this figure shows that €24 million will be allocated towards projects tackling economic and social disadvantage, €18 million towards projects tackling educational disadvantage and €18 million towards projects assisting persons with a disability.After consulting the appropriate Ministers and having obtained the approval of Government, I announced details on 4 January 2006 concerning the allocation of €24 million for the purpose of supporting programmes and types of projects tackling social and economic disadvantage. Details of the announcement are available on the website of my Department at www.pobal.ie and in Table 2.With regard to the other two categories, educational disadvantage and persons with a disability, the consultation process required under the legislation has now been completed. Proposals which provide for funding of €18 million under each of these categories are in the process of being submitted to the Minister and will be brought to Government very shortly for approval.Details of amounts paid from Dormant Accounts Fund between 1 January 2006 and 13 March 2006Name of GroupAmount Paid€Avondhu Development Group9,338.00RosEqual Ltd21,067.00St. Brendan’s The Glen Senior Citizens10,000.00Cork YMCA Ltd8,182.00Community Addiction Programme14,975.00Waterford LEDC Ltd102,720.00Cahir Development Association21,000.00North & West Connemara Rural Project32,277.00Loreto Centre8,463.00Avondhu Development Group5,467.00St. Teresa’s Football Club5,000.00Vita House Family Centre19,256.00Adrigole Family Resource Centre720.00Castlecomer Community Project35,402.00Kerry Adolescent Counselling Services5,180.00Aspire Asperger Syndrome Association3,700.00Bray Adult Learning Centre20,810.00Crosscare Aftercare Support Unit24,708.00Ability Enterprises1,590.00The Intercom Initiative11,200.00Cheshire Ireland50,000.00St. Paul’s Youth Club25,000.00Dóchas Family Centre20,000.00Duniry Community Pitch & Putt Dev.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	649	I propose to take Questions Nos. 76, 80, 93, 109 and 111 together.While anecdotal evidence suggests that there has been a growth in the use of cocaine, we are not in a position to quantify the level of any increase. The 2002-03 national drug prevalence survey provides comprehensive baseline information on cocaine use in this country. This study, which surveyed 8,442 people aged 15-64 in Ireland and Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003, reported that 3% of the population had used cocaine at some time, 1.1% had used it in the previous 12 months and 0.3% had used it in the previous month. I understand that these figures put us at roughly average at that time in terms of cocaine use in other European countries where similar comprehensive population surveys were undertaken.It is intended that a second comprehensive drug prevalence study will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007. Preliminary analysis will be done in the months following that, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected late in 2007. At that stage we will be much better placed to measure effectively changes in the level of cocaine use in Ireland.I am confident that through the implementation of the actions in the national drugs strategy and the projects and initiatives operated through the local and regional drugs task forces, the problem of cocaine use can be addressed. Each of the drugs task forces has in place an action plan to tackle drug use in their area based on their own identified priorities and they continue to have ongoing contact with their local communities.There is no substitution treatment drug for cocaine and existing services, such as counselling and behavioural therapy, are the best treatments available. In this context, the Health Service Executive has recruited additional counsellors and outreach workers in recent years. Furthermore, in 2005 I launched four pilot cocaine treatment projects to examine different methods of treatment for cocaine use, as well as a training initiative focusing on frontline workers. Funding of almost €400,000 was provided by me to support these initiatives. The four projects deal with the following cohorts of cocaine users: intravenous cocaine users; poly-drug users using cocaine; problematic intranasal cocaine users; and problematic female cocaine users.The evaluation of these pilot projects has commenced and it is expected that a preliminary report will be available in the coming months. The main thrust of the evaluation will be to analyse, in a systematic manner, what is being achieved by the projects and to report on the lessons to be learned as a result. It is hoped that the results of this evaluation will aid the formulation of effective actions aimed at tackling cocaine misuse. If they prove to be effective, I will roll similar projects out on a national basis, where necessary.All schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes. In addition, the national drugs awareness campaign focused specifically on cocaine use in 2004-05. This well received campaign sought to dispel the image that cocaine was a clean and safe drug with few detrimental consequences. Moreover, I have established a rehabilitation working group to examine the current provision of services for drug misusers, including those who abuse cocaine. This group includes representatives from a range of Departments and agencies involved in delivering rehabilitation services as well as the national drugs strategy team, NDST, the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, and representatives from the community and voluntary sectors. The report of the working group will be available in the coming months.I assure the Deputies that I am in ongoing contact with all those involved in the provision of treatment, including the Minister for Health and Children. While the problems of cocaine use must not be underestimated, I believe progress is being made and I will continue to respond in a flexible and focused way as the situation evolves.

This includes the continuation of their input to the work of the national drugs strategy team, NDST, in partnership with other members. The community sector representative on the NDST has recently resigned and I have asked the NDST to liaise with the community sector representatives on the local and regional drugs task forces with a view to recommending a replacement representative. Meanwhile, the community sector representatives also continue to play a full part in the work of the local and regional drugs task forces. There is similar full engagement with the national assessment committee of the young people's facilities and services fund and the interdepartmental group on drugs.I believe that the significant steps being taken, both by my Department and other agencies involved in the implementation of the strategy, including the substantially increased funding for this year, will help allay concerns community representatives might have about progress and our sustained commitment. At the same time, there are encouraging signs of progress in recent years — be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services or in prevention programmes in schools. The landscape has changed significantly and, while there is certainly no room for complacency, it is also important to acknowledge our achievements.All of us who are involved in tackling the problems of drugs misuse share the same aims. I am sure that we will continue to address and overcome any issues that arise from time to time so that we can jointly tackle the misuse of drugs in the most effective way possible into the future.

This task is being carried out in association with the European Commission. In October 2005, advertisements were placed in the national newspapers inviting representative organisations with an interest in rural development to indicate if they wished to be consulted on the preparation of the national strategy. In December 2005, a consultation document — draft — Ireland Rural Development National Strategy Plan, NSP, 2007-2013 — issued to the interested representative organisations which were invited to make submissions by 27 January 2006. Some 70 submissions have been received to date and are being considered by both Departments.The public consultation process on the national strategy culminated with a seminar, organised by the two Departments, on 14 March 2006 in Tullamore. Over 70 representative organisations participated and approximately 170 people attended the seminar. The views elicited will be considered in finalising the national strategy, which I expect to be agreed with the European Commission in the coming months. A detailed national programme/s will be prepared following completion of the national strategy. This will be submitted to the Commission with a view to its agreement by the end of 2006 to enable commencement of the new programme/s in January 2007.Indicative funding for rural development programming was agreed at the December 2005 European Council. Its distribution between member states will be agreed at a forthcoming meeting of the EU Council of Agriculture Ministers.

Thus, all parts of the country are serviced by a drugs task force.Local drugs task forces, LDTFs, are well established and have been operating for almost ten years. The LDTFs have prepared two rounds of local action plans and these include a range of measures relating to treatment, rehabilitation, education, prevention and curbing local drug supply. The LDTFs are currently implementing the second round of those plans at an annual cost of approximately €16 million. In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in these areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of services. They are designed to complement, and add value to, the extensive range of interventions being delivered through the State agencies.Additionally, progress has been made by the regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, which were established in 2003, in the development of their action plans. A sum of €5 million has been allocated to the ten RDTFs to progress implementation of those plans for 2006. I envisage that funding will be increased on an incremental basis over the coming years to achieve the full roll out of these action plans, which are estimated to have a full cost in the region of €12.2 million per annum.

In this context, public bodies have a period of six months to prepare and submit draft language schemes to me for confirmation. My Department officials have then to examine the draft schemes and in many instances this requires further discussion or clarification with public bodies before schemes are forwarded to me for final confirmation.Although the number of schemes approved are small, they include agencies and Departments either with a strategic importance nationally, a large customer base nationally or a functional area with a Gaeltacht in it with a large customer base.

The discussions focused on a range of corporate governance issues and work priorities and goals for 2006, as part of our regular review of the work of these bodies.With regard to An Foras Teanga-Tha Boord o Leid, Minister Hanson and I reaffirmed the two Governments' commitment and support for language and cultural diversity across the island and commended both the Ulster-Scots Agency and Foras na Gaeilge on their achievements to date. We agreed in principle, subject to the approval of the North-South Ministerial Council, that 30 Foras na Gaeilge staff posts should be located in Gaoth Dobhair and that the board of foras should now bring forward firm proposals on the phases of locating this staff complement to Gaoth Dobhair, and a decision on the precise sections and functions to be located there.With regard to Waterways Ireland, Minister Hanson and I welcomed the publication of a socio-economic summary report for the north-east and south-west sections of the Ulster Canal and a feasibility study into the Re-opening of the Ulster Canal, which Waterways Ireland had commissioned at our request. We noted the potential these reports give for the canal to be developed and for boosting its social and economic potential and we were pleased to acknowledge the assistance provided by the Blackwater Partnership to Waterways Ireland in the production of these reports. Minister Hanson and I, and our respective Departments, will now consider the reports.We also noted with satisfaction the achievements made by Waterways Ireland against 2005 business plan objectives and its steady progress on the main targets for 2006. We expressed support for the ongoing work of developing and promoting the inland waterways network on this island and commended Waterways Ireland for its progressive approach to identifying the issues facing staff in a cross-Border context, bringing together existing and new staff from different backgrounds and cultures and putting in place a positive action plan to take the organisation forward. I have arranged for a copy of the joint statement that was issued following the meeting to be forwarded to the Deputy.

The issue of access to land and walkways is fundamental to this question and it was in this context that, in February 2004, I established Comhairle na Tuaithe to address the three priority issues of access, developing a countryside code and developing a countryside recreation strategy.Comhairle na Tuaithe comprises representatives of the farming organisations, recreational users of the countryside and State bodies with an interest in the countryside. As well as having identified and reviewed a set of access parameters in the countryside, Comhairle na Tuaithe has also considered the key features necessary for countryside code development, with a focus on the potential application of the internationally recognised Leave No Trace initiative.Comhairle na Tuaithe is currently working on the development of a national countryside recreation strategy. The objective of the strategy is to put in place an accepted and agreed vision for countryside recreation and a blueprint for action and implementation of that strategy going forward. A total of 190 submissions were received in answer to a call in national and provincial papers and by letter to stakeholder organisations. These submissions are currently being examined and the work of drafting the countryside recreation strategy is proceeding.I look forward to receiving the draft strategy from Comhairle na Tuaithe following its consideration of the issues arising. It is also intended to use the rural social scheme to develop and maintain walkways.I am aware that recent Fáilte Ireland figures indicate that the number of visitors to Ireland continued to increase during 2005 but that the trend towards short urban based breaks continued, which draws the overseas leisure visitors away from rural areas. It should be noted that my Department is working in close partnership with the Department of Agriculture and Food on the new rural development programme/s 2007-13. Under axis 3 of this programme — The Wider Rural Economy — the overarching objective is one of creating employment opportunities. The range of measures available under this axis will be used to promote the development of rural communities and also to ensure that rural areas remain attractive for future generations. To meet these priorities, the EU strategic guidelines and Council regulation identify key actions, among which is encouraging the development of rural tourism.

In line with that decision, local and community development agencies were requested to advance improvements in linkages, cohesion and sharing resources. City and county development boards were given the role of overseeing and co-ordinating the cohesion process. Cohesion Funding of €3,248,600 was allocated during 2004 to support specific measures arising from that process.The core objective of the 2005-06 round is the alignment of local, community and rural development organisations to achieve full area coverage. The major advantage of such an approach is that the State will be able to deliver programmes such as the local development social inclusion programme and the rural social scheme through these new unified structures because they will have all-area cover. My preference is for unified overarching structures based around county boundaries where practicable. However, I am prepared to consider variations across county boundaries on their merits.The intention is that from 2007 there will be one company delivering services in any given area and fewer companies overall in the country. This will lead to improved co-ordination of service delivery and maximise the impact of social inclusion measures at a local level. To date, I have been able to support a number of proposals for integration of Leader and partnership companies. Further proposals are being developed by the relevant agencies. I will consider these proposals in due course.A total of €4,836,927 was awarded in respect of cohesion initiatives during 2005, including €1,463,400 for promotion of volunteering. I have approved a further €760,600 from the cohesion fund since the beginning of the year.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	665	The national advisory committee on drugs and the drug and alcohol information and research unit, Northern Ireland, commissioned the first drug prevalence survey, the purpose of which was to establish the population prevalence of drug use on the island of Ireland in 2002/03. This study surveyed over 8,000 people aged 15-64 in Ireland and Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003 and examined the prevalence of a number of drugs. The survey collected data relating to both cocaine powder and crack on a lifetime — ever used — basis; last year — recent use — basis; and last month — current use — basis.Expressions of interest from potential tenderers have been sought for a second population drug prevalence survey. With the baseline information in place from the first survey, the findings of this survey should prove very informative, giving valuable information on trends, including those relating to crack cocaine, that can feed into drugs policy formulation for the future. It is intended that the drug prevalence study fieldwork will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007. Preliminary analysis will be in the months following, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected in late 2007.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	666	I am pleased with the increasing levels of funding being made available to tackle the problems of drugs misuse. An allocation of €43 million has been made to my Department's Vote for the drugs initiative-young people's facilities and services fund in 2006. This represents an increase of 37% on the original 2005 allocation and a massive 61% increase on the 2004 figure. It will allow us to consolidate and build on previous investment and to continue to tackle the drug problem in a comprehensive way. I remain hopeful that through this sizeable programme of investment we will continue to impact in a serious way on the availability and usage of illegal drugs.With respect to the availability or usage of illegal drugs, although there is anecdotal evidence of a growth in the use of some illegal drugs, albeit from a relatively low base, we are not in a position to quantify the level of any increase. At the same time, the rate of success of the gardaí and the customs service is significant, with seizures of approximately €49 million in 2002, increasing in 2003 and 2004 to €100 million and €132 million respectively. Overall, there are encouraging signs of progress in recent years, be it in the areas of drug seizures, the decline in the number of new cases of problematic opiate misuse in Dublin, the expansion of treatment services or in prevention programmes in schools.It is intended that the field work for the second drug prevalence study will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007. Preliminary analysis will be done in the months following, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected in late 2007. At that stage, we will be much better placed to measure effectively current drug use in Ireland.

It is intended to arrange the first examination in April 2006, with a view to having a panel of accredited translators in place for both public and private sectors by May 2006. When operational, this will be a significant resource for public bodies in their implementation of the Official Languages Act.I am currently considering how additional measures could be put in place to increase the output of qualified translators and I hope to be in a position to make an announcement in this regard before too long.

A comprehensive framework for a co-ordinated Government response to the issue of drug misuse is already in place. The national drugs strategy 2001-08 addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars — supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research. Implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies, and directly involving the community and voluntary sector, is co-ordinated by my Department. Moreover, although there is anecdotal evidence of a growth in the use of some illegal drugs, albeit from a relatively low base, we are not in a position to quantify the level of any increase.It is intended that the field work for the second drug prevalence study will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007.

At that stage we will be much better placed to measure effectively the level of growth of drug misuse in Ireland.The report of the mid-term review of the national drugs strategy, which was published in June 2005, found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound and that there were encouraging signs of progress in its implementation. Officials of the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Education and Science and Health and Children sit on the regional and local drugs task forces, the national drugs strategy team and the interdepartmental group on drugs, illustrating the degree of co-ordination involved between our Departments under the national drugs strategy. I am confident that the general consensus on the direction and implementation of the strategy will continue.

The headquarters will relocate to Knock Airport while some 13 posts will transfer to Na Forbacha in Galway. The move to Knock Airport is scheduled for completion by the end of 2007. It is, however, planned to relocate up to 70 posts in advance of the main move to temporary accommodation in the general Knock area. This advance move is planned to take place from mid-2006. A further small number of posts may be relocated there in early 2007. Of the 13 Na Forbacha posts mentioned, seven have now transferred to our offices there and it is expected that the remainder will be in place by the end of this year.As my Department will be decentralising in full, staff who are not relocating with it will move to other Departments, either by way of bilateral transfers with officers transferring into this Department or under the arrangements agreed centrally for redeployment of staff remaining in Dublin.At a meeting with my counterpart, Mr. David Hanson MP, Minister for Culture, Arts and Leisure, in Belfast on 6 March 2006, we agreed in principle, subject to completion of the formal North-South Ministerial Council approval process, that 30 Foras na Gaeilge staff posts should be located in Gaoth Dobhair. The formal approval process is being taken forward at official level. The board of foras will be asked to bring forward firm proposals on the phases of locating this staff complement to Gaoth Dobhair and a decision on the precise sections and functions to be located there.Pobal, formerly ADM, will transfer some 40 posts to Clifden, County Galway. The first phase of this programme, the transfer of the management of the rural social scheme, RSS, involving ten posts, has been completed, while a second phase involving a similar number of staff will be completed in May-June of this year. Temporary accommodation has been acquired in Clifden for these staff. The OPW has identified a local authority site for Pobal's permanent Clifden office. Negotiations are at an advanced stage and it is anticipated that contractual procedures for the acquisition of the site should be finalised shortly. Indications from the OPW are that if everything proceeds according to plan, the offices would be available for occupation in late 2007 or early 2008.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	671	I have had no specific discussions with the Minister for Education and Science on drug use among undergraduate students in full-time third level education but I am in ongoing contact with all those involved in efforts to disrupt the distribution and consumption of illegal drugs throughout society, including the Minister for Education and Science.The primary focus of the 108 actions of the national drugs strategy is on the illegal drugs that do the most harm and on the most vulnerable drug misusers as well as their families and communities. The main focus of the strategy with respect to the education sector is on preventative strategies targeting the primary and secondary levels and the informal education sector, including youth services. Arising from this, all such schools now have substance misuse prevention programmes included on their curricula. A consequence of this strategy should be to arm undergraduate students with the knowledge about the dangers of drug misuse before they enter college.The strategy also includes a national awareness campaign, managed by the Department of Health and Children and aimed at promoting greater awareness and understanding of the causes and consequences of drug misuse throughout society. Aspects of this campaign were specifically targeted at the young adult population.It is very difficult to quantify drug use by socio-economic group. The drug prevalence survey carried out for the national advisory committee on drugs and the drug and alcohol information and research unit, Northern Ireland, which is recognised as the most comprehensive baseline data we have for prevalence rates in this country, identified usage in the past 12 months by young adults — 15 to 34 years — as 8.6% for cannabis and 2.3% for ecstasy. That survey covered 8,442 people, aged between 15 and 64, on the island of Ireland.The college lifestyle and attitudinal national — CLAN — survey, which was jointly carried out by the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children and NUI Galway in the academic year 2002-03, dealt with a sample of 3,259 students from universities and other third level institutions across Ireland. Drug use was one of the many areas under focus. The focus and methodology of the survey differed from the 2002-03 drug prevalence survey. Therefore, the results of the two surveys are not directly comparable and they do not throw up the same figures. However, the findings are nonetheless valuable in improving our understanding of drug misuse by university students in Ireland.Established research suggests that this cohort is more likely to experiment with drug use than are other sections of society and the CLAN survey reflected this. In the CLAN survey, 37% reported having used cannabis and 8% indicated that they had used ecstasy in the previous 12 months. It would be expected that these figures would include many who experimented once, or at least very few times, rather than reflecting more problematic long-term or regular use, which is the main focus of the national drugs strategy.

I travelled to New Zealand for the St. Patrick's Day celebrations there and was accompanied by my wife, the Secretary General of my Department, the private secretary and the media adviser. As we arrived in New Zealand on 10 March and departed on 18 March it is not practical to provide an accurate indication of costs involved at this juncture.I attach a comprehensive itinerary for information and the Deputy may wish to note the wide range of Irish groups and interests met with during the trip across New Zealand in Auckland, TaranguaTauranga, Christchurch and Wellington; meetings with Ministers of the New Zealand Government about rural tourism, including walkways, and with the chairman of the Maori Language Commission on language issues; my formal presentation to the New Zealand Parliament; breadth of contacts with both local and national representatives throughout New Zealand; key representational work undertaken for St. Patrick's Day, commencing with the parade in Auckland on 11 March and continuing daily throughout the visit; attendance at consular reception in Auckland on 17 March, attended by Minister Clayton Cosgrove MP on behalf of the Prime Minister, Members of Parliament, and representatives of the diplomatic corps, public and business life; extensive media coverage, including interviews on national television.There is great potential to enhance economic and cultural ties between us — total trade with New Zealand in 2004 was valued at €83 million and substantial numbers in the New Zealand population claim Irish ancestry. Also of the order of 26,000 visitors from New Zealand visited Ireland in 2005 and their stays tend to be above average in duration, and encompass visits to the regions, as well as Dublin. Against this background, and matters of common interest which we share, I believe that the visit was immensely worthwhile and will help reap considerable benefits for the State.

In this regard, the Department is consulting the Department of Social and Family Affairs on how best to implement some of the changes. In this context, it is worth noting that following the agreement of that Department it has already been agreed that children and siblings of qualifying herd/flock owners, subject to certain restrictions, are now eligible to participate on the scheme.

He explained that the new Department was being set up to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country as they pursue their own development. It is now acknowledged that the setting up of the Department marked a new focus on the importance of community and social connections in Irish society.In the period since, the key principle underlying the Department's activities has been the provision of support that enables communities themselves to identify and address issues in their own areas. That support takes the form of programmes and measures which, individually and collectively, focus on communities, particularly those that are vulnerable or under threat. Those communities may be in rural or inner city settings, grappling with difficulties caused by a range of factors, including declining populations, unemployment, language issues, social disadvantage or drug misuse. As well as communities that can be defined in terms of geographic location, the Department also supports communities that are defined on the basis of a common focus on a particular issue.My Department's purpose is to provide support to communities in the most appropriate way as they work to shape their own futures, address their common goals and achieve their full potential. To be effective in this vital work, the Department has sought to provide a co-ordinated approach not only across the range of programmes and measures for which it has direct responsibility but also with other Departments and State agencies.In the relatively short period since 2002, significant progress has been made and is recorded in the Department's annual reports. We have adapted and improved some of the programmes we inherited, we have introduced new programmes, we have taken steps to ensure cohesion between programmes and we have secured more resources for investment in key areas such as community development, rural development, supports for volunteering and for the formation of social capital and tackling the problem of drugs misuse. The results of that can be seen in communities right around the country. We have also taken a series of measures to ensure that what we invest is targeted on areas of real need.The new approach taken in 2002 is working and is delivering results and it is my intention that we will continue with that approach.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	677	My Department funds, through the Leader companies, the area based rural development initiative, a sub-measure of the regional operational programmes aimed at providing support for the development of the rural/agri-tourism sector. The initiative, in so far as it supports the latter sector, has a budget of €30 million for the period 2000-06 and provides support for the development of the rural/agri-tourism product, including the provision of amenities, accommodation and marketing. This support is provided for eligible projects in rural areas generally.My Department also funds the western development tourism programme, WDTP, through the rural development fund, RDF. The WDTP was established to develop a strategic approach to tourism initiatives in underdeveloped areas within the western region. It has been awarded €405,000 from the RDF for the period April 2003 to December 2006. In addition, €192,500 has been allocated from the RDF for Galway East Tourism Marketing Limited for the period 2003 to the end of 2006. This project aims to promote and develop the potential for rural tourism in east Galway.Funding of €55,000 has recently been approved from the RDF for the Irish Rural Tourism Federation to assist it in developing a communications strategy. Údarás na Gaeltachta and the islands section of my Department also support rural tourism in various ways.

Significant work has been done since the publication of the report in response to its recommendations to improve the competitiveness of the agri-food sector and to contribute to a healthy and vibrant rural economy. The result is the Agri-Vision 2015 action plan which will be launched tomorrow, 22 March, by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, Deputy Coughlan. Many of the key recommendations contained in the report will be reflected in the next national rural development programme which will encompass EU priorities for the next generation of rural development policy.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	679	The emerging needs fund was devised to address an evolving situation in regard to the misuse of drugs on a flexible basis, in the light of new needs. To date I have allocated almost €850,000 under the emerging needs fund to 14 projects.In the light of the substantially increased level of funding allocated in the Revised Estimates figures for drugs initiatives under my Department, I will shortly make further allocations under the fund. The total allocation to projects under the fund is likely to be in excess of €3 million. I look forward to successful outcomes from the initiatives that are allocated moneys under this fund.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	680	As I have already indicated in response to similar questions, the matter of the advisability of a 20 year strategic plan for the Irish language has been amongst the issues which have been considered in general terms by Fóram na Gaeilge in its deliberations thus far. In that context, the need for the development of a clear statement on the part of the Government regarding the Irish language and its importance as a whole has emerged as a key issue and considerable work is in hand on this matter. I hope to be able to advance the matter at a meeting of the fóram in the near future.Substantial progress is being made to foster the language and to further underpin its viability since the publication of the Gaeltacht Commission's report in 2002. The Official Languages Act is benefiting both the Irish language and the Irish language community, and substantial progress has also been made regarding the status of Irish in the European Union. A number of new initiatives have been introduced in Gaeltacht areas, including the language planning initiative, the scheme for language assistants, the expansion and development of the summer camps scheme as well as the development of public awareness measures aimed at the Gaeltacht community in particular.All of these practical measures will assist in consolidating the viability of the language. The Deputy will also appreciate that significant resources continue to be made available to support the work of Foras na Gaeilge in promoting Irish on an all-island basis.

Since then, it has hosted some 25,000 electronic transactions a year and has virtually eliminated manual dissemination of Cabinet papers. Further phases, adding functionality and improving user experience, have been deployed since then. Over 5,500 users are registered to the system.The final planned phase of the e-Cabinet project was delivered to my Department at the end of 2005. Testing of that final phase to ensure operational stability and performance, which is technically complex, is nearing completion. The software is expected to be deployed and become fully operational during March-April. Deployment will be accompanied by familiarisation briefing for key users across all Departments. The software developers are working under the terms of a fixed price contract and final payment to them is contingent upon satisfactory testing and operation of the software in my Department.The e-Cabinet system is one of the most complex and innovative ICT projects undertaken in the public sector to date and has won a number of prestigious awards. It has involved designing and building a system that incorporates all Departments, with different internal working practices and technical infrastructures and configurations. Although the impending deployment of the final phase of the e-Cabinet project marks the project's completion, as with any live system, it is our intention to continually seek to improve the benefits and efficiencies that the system brings.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	685	In December 2004, the Government approved a memorandum dealing with increasing the use of e-payments by Departments and in the public sector. It was decided that by the end of 2005, where possible, all Departments and offices would use electronic funds transfer, EFT, to make payments. In the case of my Department, EFT has been implemented as a payment method and is used to make payment to all suppliers who have provided the necessary authorisation details. Continual efforts are being made to increase the number of payments by EFT with a view to eventually making all payments by this method.Work is also progressing at a European level where the European Payments Council, an industry body, is leading an initiative aimed at creating a single European payment area, SEPA. This initiative has the objective of eliminating any effective distinction between a cross border payment and a domestic payment within the eurozone. The intention is that as early as 2008, European banks should be offering SEPA compliant products to their customers.This initiative is supported by the European Commission and the European Central Bank. Ireland is participating with other member states in Council negotiations on a proposed directive setting out a legal framework for payment services in the EU. This directive will provide the necessary legislative backing for SEPA. However, neither SEPA nor the directive apply to cheques, which will remain a purely domestic payment instrument.

The Governments communicated their final proposals for a comprehensive agreement, addressing these key issues, to the DUP and Sinn Féin in early December 2004. I received a letter on 7 December from Sinn Féin in which it indicated that it could agree to the political package contained in the proposals of the two Governments.

I am not aware of complaints relating to contracts. However, I am advised that one unsuccessful software tenderer has raised a concern with Safefood regarding its participation in a recent tender for a laboratory information management system which was tendered and awarded using the EU restricted tendering procedure.Responding to this concern, Safefood held a debriefing meeting with the company in accordance with the European Union remedies directive. Safefood further addressed the same concern through freedom of information, FOI, procedures under the FOI code of practice for North-South Bodies and Tourism Ireland Limited. Safefood has informed my Department that it considers that it has fully and fairly discharged its duties regarding the unsuccessful tenderer's concern.

Additional funding of €155 million has been allocated to services for people with disabilities in 2006. Of this funding, €59 million is being provided to meet costs associated with the various elements of this programme.The bulk of the balance of the €41 million revenue provided in 2006 is being used to enhance the multi-disciplinary support services for people with disabilities, in line with the Government's commitment to build capacity within the health services to deliver on the various legislative provisions contained in the national disability strategy, with a priority in 2006 on enhancing the assessment and support services for children with disabilities. As outlined in the multi-annual investment programme 2006-09, additional capital funding amounting to €55 million is also being provided in 2006 to support these developments.

I have made inquiries of an tArd-Chláraitheoir and he advises me that his office, in consultation with the public services e-broker, REACH, is in the final stages of the development of an on-line application system for certificates of life events.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	690	The Office of the Minister for Children, OMC, has been given responsibility for the early child care supplement which is being introduced with effect from 1 April 2006. The payment, which is non-taxable, will amount to €1,000 per annum and will be made to parents of all eligible children aged less than six years, in quarterly instalments of €250. The supplement will be paid where a child is eligible for any part of a quarter.The OMC is putting arrangements in place with the Department of Social and Family Affairs to administer the supplement on its behalf on an agency basis. These arrangements will provide for the supplement to be made to parents in the same way as they receive their child benefit payments. The OMC expects the first payment, which would be due in July 2006, to be made in August with the subsequent quarterly payments this year expected to be made in October and December.The criteria governing eligibility for child benefit will be applied to the early child care supplement. As a result, parents in receipt of child benefit and with children aged under six years will automatically receive the supplement. Over 350,000 children under the age of six are expected to benefit from the Supplement at an estimated cost in 2006 of €265 million rising to over €350 million in a full year.The OMC will be in contact with parents of eligible children shortly with details of the supplement and how it will be paid to them in the coming months.

Consequently, while grant applications under the EOCP continue to be processed, new grant schemes under the national child care investment programme 2006-10 may be applied for.Responsibility for both the EOCP and the new child care investment programme have been assigned to the new Office of the Minister for Children, OMC, under the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan. The establishment of the OMC is an important development for children's services as responsibility for key policy areas affecting children, including child welfare and protection, early years education, youth justice, the national children's strategy and the child care strategy, have been brought together in a single office under one Minister.With regard to the national childcare investment programme 2006-10, the necessary arrangements to implement the new programme are now in place and new applications are being processed. A key objective of the new programme is to ensure the development of quality child care supports and services in a proactive way which takes account of identified local child care needs. As a result, arrangements have been put in place to enable the initial developmental stage of grant applications to be facilitated at local level by the city and county child care committees, CCCs.Applications may be made by completing expression of interest forms and returning them to the relevant local CCC. The expression of interest forms are available from the CCCs and also from Pobal, www.pobal.ie, and the OMC, www.omc.gov.ie. Full contact details for the CCCs are available on the OMC website. Following completion of the developmental and technical stages of the assessment process, the applications will be forwarded to the OMC for final appraisal and decision.As in the case of the EOCP, different levels of large scale capital grants are available to private and community-not for profit sector child care providers under the new programme. Private sector child care providers may apply for grant assistance of up to €100,000 towards the capital cost of developing a child care services in a catchment area where there is a demonstrated child care need. An applicant may apply for more than one grant provided the subsequent child care facilities are in different catchment areas and subject to an overall ceiling of €500,000. In each case, an applicant must provide at least 25% of the total cost of the project. Community-not for profit child care providers may apply for grant assistance up to a maximum of €1 million per project.Eligibility for grants under the national child care programme 2006-10 will be determined having regard to an applicant's rating across a range of criteria each of which is intended to contribute to the overall objectives of the programme. These include the service being located in an area of identified need for the type of service proposed, its resulting in an increased provision of child care places for particular child care services, including pre-school places aimed at three to four year olds and school age child care, a focus on the needs and development of the child and compliance with regulatory and other legal obligations.

For example, a parent receiving child benefit by means of an EFT transfer to his or her bank account will receive the supplement, which will be paid on a quarterly basis, by this means also.I understand that full details of the arrangements for the payment will be sent to parents of eligible children in the coming weeks.

The Medical Council conducted an inquiry into the medical practitioner referred to by the Deputy and by order of the High Court dated 2 September 2003 the medical practitioner's name was struck off the general register of registered medical practitioners. Accordingly, the Medical Council has completed its statutory function and has no further role in relation to this medical practitioner as he is no longer on the register.As you may be aware, the Government, at its meeting on 6 April 2004, gave its approval to the terms of reference for a non-statutory inquiry relating to certain events at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital by Judge Maureen Harding Clark. Following the recent publication of the Lourdes Hospital inquiry report, I have asked Judge Harding Clark to advise the Government on an appropriate scheme of redress arising from the findings of her report. Judge Harding Clark will also advise on the cost of such a scheme and on a mechanism for ensuring the maximum recoupment of such costs from wrongdoers and indemnifiers.

This position was signalled to the support group representing the women at a meeting that I had with them in February 2005.

This group is due to have its first meeting on 23 March 2006.An additional €33 million full year cost was allocated to the home help programme in budget 2006, €30 million of which will be for 2006 with the remaining €3 million in 2007, which will enable the Health Service Executive to provide an additional 1.75 million hours nationally in 2006. The additional resource will further enhance the service and facilitate the expressed wish of many more older people to continue to live in their own homes for as long as possible.

There is evidence in relation to some specific cancers which show that population based screening can improve population health in terms of survival, morbidity and quality of life. Population based screening programmes for two specific cancers, breast and cervical, have demonstrated their efficacy and planning is underway for the national roll out of these two programmes to all regions in the country.I received a strategy for cancer control in Ireland 2006 from the chairman of the National Cancer Forum in January this year. As part of this work, the forum developed a framework for evidence based decision making in relation to the introduction of population based screening programmes. I am examining the strategy with a view to bringing proposals to Government. I expect to have the strategy published shortly.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I propose to take Questions Nos. 149, 176, 263 and 295 together.As part of the Estimates for health services in 2006, additional funding of €3 million was allocated specifically for the further development of neurology and neurophysiology services. This funding was provided to allow the Health Service Executive to further progress the implementation of the recommendations made by the former Comhairle na nOspidéal in respect of these services. The comhairle report, which has been published, recommended significant enhancement of services, including the appointment of additional consultants. While reaching the full complement of consultant posts as recommended will take some time, major improvements in patient care can be achieved in the shorter term through a combination of additional consultant posts and the appointment of a number of clinical nurse specialists and allied health professionals.My Department is advised by the executive that the development of three new neurology units will commence during 2006, one in the mid west, one in the north west and one in the south east, with the appointment of multidisciplinary teams comprising consultant neurologists and support staff.The HSE will also be investing in neurophysiology services in 2006, with the development of an innovative teleneurophysiology link between Sligo General Hospital and Beaumont Hospital. This initiative is designed to reduce waiting times for diagnostic testing.

The national population figures for 2003, 2004 and 2005 are as estimated by the Central Statistics Office:YearNo. of persons covered by a medical cardPopulation% of population20001,148,0553,786,90030.3220011,199,4543,838,90031.2420021,168,7453,917,33629.8420031,158,1433,978,90029.1120041,148,9144,043,80028.4120051,159,3974,130,70028.07The HSE has advised that on 1 December 2005, some 2,824 people held a GP visit card. The executive has also indicated that, as of 14 March 2006, some 11,177 people hold a GP visit card.Changes in the number of medical cards can largely be explained by a number of factors including the introduction of automatic eligibility to medical cards for people aged 70 and over in 2001. Other factors which have contributed to the changes include the increased number of people in employment and the improved economic situation nationally with people on higher wages. Also the ongoing management and review of medical card databases has been a factor which has improved data quality in the HSE's databases. For example a cleansing exercise undertaken by the former health boards in 2003 resulted in the removal of approximately 104,000 cards. Most of these cards would have been considered by the health boards to be normal deletions due to death, change in eligibility status or persons moving from one board area to another with a certain proportion removed due to being duplicates or expired records.

For an item to be included on the list, it must comply with published criteria, including authorisation status as appropriate, price and, in certain cases, the intended use of the product. In addition, the product should ordinarily be supplied to the public only by medical prescription and should not be advertised or promoted to the public.My Department was advised by the manufacturers in 2003 that the product referred to by the Deputy had been discontinued and that it should be removed from the common list. This was a commercial decision taken by the company concerned as it considered that the product was no longer viable. The Irish Medicines Board indicated at the time that newer and more efficient products were available.

The Pharmaceutical Society of Ireland, PSI, is the professional organisation for pharmacy in Ireland. All practising pharmacists in Ireland must be registered with the PSI.Pharmacists from outside the EU/EEA, Australia or New Zealand are registered under the adjudication route of the society. However, the PSI has experienced difficulties in the operation of this route of registration. In order to address these difficulties, the PSI submitted a proposal for amended regulations to the Minister at that time. However, the PSI's proposals for amended regulations are not possible under current legislation and an amendment to the Pharmacy Act is required. The PSI has suspended the adjudicating route of registration and are unable, at this time, to consider any application for registration under this route.A Government decision was taken in June 2005 to introduce new pharmacy legislation. The legislation will take the form of a bill which will remove the ‘derogation' on EU-EEA qualified pharmacists, introduce fitness to practice regulations and give an appropriate statutory basis for the PSI. It will also address the problems with adjudication route of registration. My Department is at an advanced stage in drawing up the heads and general scheme of a pharmacy fitness to practice Bill and I intend to take a memorandum to Government in the very near future, seeking approval for the draft heads and general scheme and requesting that the legislation be referred to the parliamentary counsel's office for formal drafting of the Bill.

For existing employees, defined in the Act as non new entrant public servants, the maximum retirement age remains 65.However, public health service employees who have retired are sometimes re-employed on contract for various periods and have a very useful contribution to make. This generally occurs where vacancies have arisen in particular sectors due to a shortage of skilled personnel. My Department issued a circular last October which changed the method of calculation of pension abatement in these cases. In general, this means that where it is necessary to re-employ pensioners this can be done on the basis that they can earn, in effect, up to half what they would have earned in their previous position before their pension is reduced.

Accordingly, the Department has requested the parliamentary affairs division of the executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.The foster care allowance can only be paid in respect of children who are taken into the care of the Health Service Executive under the Child Care Act 1991 and placed in foster care or relative care in accordance with the Child Care Regulations 1995.The issue of relative care was dealt with in detail in the 2001 report of the working group entitled Foster Care — A Child Centred Partnership. The report sets out a number of basic principles that should guide placements with relatives. These are: that the best interests of the child are paramount; that the child should be placed only in an appropriate, safe, healthy and stable environment; that the standard of care must be equivalent to that provided in a traditional foster care arrangement; that relative placements should only be made where a secure attachment exists or has the potential to develop between the child and the relative concerned; that a partnership approach should be used in developing skills and supports for relatives providing foster care; and that placements should not be made as a means to provide income support.The working group considered the possibility that some children are placed in the care of the health boards in order to provide income support for the family in relation to the child. The group was strongly of the view that such a practice would be highly inappropriate. Income support is a matter for the Department of Social and Family Affairs and those in need of such support should contact that Department. The working group stated that children should only be brought into the care of the health boards if they meet the criteria regarding the need for care and protection set out in the Child Care Act. In addition, the choice of placement of any child in the care system should be based on the particular child's individual best interests.Under the current legislation, the Health Service Executive must assess the needs of a child placed in care and the suitability of the prospective foster or relative carers, and draw up a child care plan. The implementation of the child care plan places significant responsibilities and duties on foster carers, whether relatives or non-relatives. The foster care allowance is paid in recognition of these additional responsibilities and the additional costs of looking after foster children.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	729	I advise the Deputy that the planning and delivery of health and personal social services is a matter for the Health Service Executive in the first instance. This includes identifying priorities for the development of a capital programme for the health system. Accordingly, it is more appropriate for discussions to be held with the HSE with regard to this proposal.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	730	Additional investment in speech and language therapy services in recent years, coupled with enhancements in the professional training, career development and remuneration of these therapists, have led to significant improvements in staffing levels. These developments are in line with the recommendations made by the expert group on various health professions which included new pay scales and enhanced career structures.In general, developments such as pay increases, improvements in career structure and enhanced opportunities for professional and career development have all supported increased staffing levels for key health and social care professions, including speech and language therapists. The implementation of the pay recommendations of the public service benchmarking body made a further important contribution to recruitment and improved retention. The continued implementation of the action plan for people management, a key action under the health strategy, has a crucial role in improving retention and reducing turnover of skilled staff.The success of the intensive efforts to improve staffing levels in speech and language therapy in the public health service has contributed to an increase of 266, or 95%, speech and language therapists over the number employed at the end of December 1997, and reflects significant increases in the numbers employed in promotional grades. At the end of September 2005, 548 whole-time equivalent speech and language therapists were employed in the public health service In addition, three new speech and language therapy courses commenced in the 2003-04 academic year in UCC, NUIG and UL. In total, these courses provide an additional 75 training places in speech and language therapy. This expansion in training numbers was identified in the Bacon report as sufficient to meet the long-term demand-supply balance for speech and language therapists in Ireland. The first graduates from the two year masters course in UL completed their studies in June, 2005. The first graduates from the BSc courses in UCC and NUIG will graduate in 2007.Essential to the successful roll-out of these additional training places is the provision of sufficient quality clinical placements in speech and language therapy. The funding I provided this year, along with that allocated in the past two years, will enable the Health Service Executive, working with my Department, to put in place the enhanced structures necessary to ensure that students will have access to a sustainable, high-quality clinical training model. The number of speech and language therapists employed in the various regions of the Health Service Executive is set out in the following table.Former Health Board AreaEnd 1997End September 2005Change 1997 to end September 2005% change 1997 to end September 2005Eastern1172119379.76Midland224625114.56Mid-Western24241041.08North-Eastern173922134.20North-Western19281051.89South-Eastern32562476.88Southern288456200.29Western245026108.49Total28254826694.56Source: Health Service Personnel Census at 31 DecemberNote: All figures are expressed as wholetime equivalents.

Acute hospitals have emergency plans designed to cope with a surge in capacity requirement arising from a major emergency. The plans involve calling in off-duty doctors, nurses and other staff, opening additional areas to receive and treat casualties, cancelling admissions and discharging patients to free capacity.The Government framework for a co-ordinated response to major emergencies was recently reviewed by an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This group also included representation from the Departments of Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The revised framework will be presented to the Government shortly.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	749	The health contribution was introduced by virtue of the Health Contributions Act 1979 and came into effect on 6 April of that year. The contributions are levied on income at a percentage rate set in pursuance of the Health Contributions Act and are paid over to the Minister for Health and Children in respect of the Vote for the Health Service Executive. The current rate of contribution is 2% of gross income and, subject to exemptions, is applicable to all persons over the age of 16 with reckonable income, earnings or emoluments.The exemptions, as outlined in section 11 of the Act, are those whose income does not exceed €440 per week, those who are fully eligible for health services as set out in section 45 of the Health Act 1970, such as medical cardholders in this State, including those workers covered under EC Regulation 1408/71, recipients of a social welfare widow's or widower's pension, one-parent family payment or deserted wife's benefit or allowance, as well as those in receipt of a widow's or widower's pension acquired under the social security legislation of an EU member state.When the primary legislation was enacted, no upper age limit applied to the health contribution. However, as the Deputy is aware, following the announcement in budget 2001, full eligibility for health services under section 45 of the Health Act was granted to those aged 70 and over, effectively placing an upper age limit of 69 years on liability to pay health contributions. There are no proposals to alter any of these exemptions or to provide an exemption from paying health contributions to those aged between 65 and 69.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	750	There is no statutory obligation on the Health Service Executive, HSE, to provide chiropody services to general medical services, GMS, patients. However, in practice arrangements are made to provide these services. Prior to the establishment of the HSE, the nature of the arrangements for chiropody and the level of service provided was a matter for individual health boards and a degree of variation in practice developed over time. Priority is usually given to certain groups of people, including people who are medical card holders aged 65 years and over. In several regions the service is provided by private chiropodists by arrangement with the HSE.I consider it inappropriate for private chiropodists who provide services on behalf of the HSE to charge patients a top-up fee, and I have conveyed this view formally to the HSE. My Department requested the HSE to initiate a review of the fee arrangements in place for the provision of chiropody services, with a view to ensuring that such additional fees will no longer be levied on persons in receipt of this service. The HSE recently advised me that it has initiated a review of chiropody services.

Approximately 160,000 women are in the target age group in these regions and since the programme commenced more than 1,600 cancers have been detected.Planning is under way for the roll-out of the programme to the remaining regions in the country. Approximately 130,000 women are in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions. BreastCheck is confident that the target date of next year for the commencement of the roll-out will be met. On full roll-out, women in the 50 to 64 age group in every county will have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment where appropriate.When the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that a quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and thereby continuing the screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	770	I propose to take Questions Nos. 220 and 227 together.Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition, through the long-term illness scheme. The scheme does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness, for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. There are no plans to extend the list of eligible conditions.Products necessary for the management of the specified illness are available to patients on the scheme. Other products are available according to the patient's eligibility. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. In the assessment process the Health Service Executive can take into account medical costs incurred by an individual or a family. The Deputy will be pleased to know that people in receipt of payments from the Department of Social and Family Affairs may retain the medical card for a specified period of time following return to work or participating in an approved scheme.In November 2004, I introduced a new graduated benefit — the GP visit card to extend free GP care and treatment to individuals and families on low incomes. In June last year, I simplified the means test for both medical and GP visit cards. It is now based on an applicant's and spouse's income after income tax and PRSI, and takes account of reasonable expenses incurred in respect of rent or mortgage payments, child care and travel to work. In October, I announced that the income guidelines for both medical and GP visit cards would be increased by an additional 20%. This means the income guidelines are now 29% higher than they were this time last year. These improvements have also made the assessment process much fairer and ensure that those on low to moderate incomes can qualify for free GP care. Non-medical card holders can use the drug payment scheme, which protects against excessive medicines costs. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month, or approximately €20 per week, towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. The scheme is easy to use and significantly reduces the cost burden for families and individuals incurring ongoing expenditure on medicines.

The agreement covers all reimbursable prescription medicines in the general medical services and community drug schemes, and all medicines supplied to hospitals and the Health Service Executive. A price freeze is in place for products supplied under the terms of the agreement.There is a common list of reimbursable medicines for the general medical services and drug payment schemes.

Following negotiations with the company concerned, agreement was reached on a revised reimbursement price, which came into effect on 1 March. Deltacortril has been available in the usual manner from that date.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	799	For the sake of clarity, avian flu or H5N1 is primarily a disease of birds. To date, there have been a very small number of human cases of H5N1 infection documented, in situations where there has been very close contact with infected birds. There is no evidence of human to human transmission.The Department of Agriculture and Food is responsible for controlling avian flu in birds and mammals other than humans and has put in place a range of measures aimed at maintaining Ireland's avian flu-free status. The health sector's role in relation to avian flu relates to the human health implications that would arise were there to be an outbreak of avian flu in this country. My Department is working very closely with the Department of Agriculture and Food in this context.The Department of Agriculture and Food is an active participant in my Department's influenza pandemic expert group. A subgroup of the expert group has developed guidance documents for use in the event of an avian influenza outbreak in animals in Ireland. Guidance on the investigation and management of suspected human cases of avian influenza has also been developed and circulated within the health system. These guidance documents are available on the HSE health protection surveillance centre website, www.hpsc.ie.
The overall aims of influenza pandemic planning are to reduce mortality and morbidity and minimise the resulting disruption to society. In line with information and evidence available internationally, my Department has consistently stated that the consequences of a global pandemic are likely to be serious. Pandemic planning can only mitigate the effects. There is a very clear distinction between the current avian flu outbreak and the possibility of a future pandemic influenza in the human population. Experts advise that such a pandemic may arise as a result of the current H5N1 avian flu situation, but this is by no means inevitable.My Department and the Health Service Executive are working closely together on pandemic planning. This work is ongoing on a number of fronts. The influenza pandemic expert group is updating expert guidance and the pandemic influenza operational response plan is being updated in line with the most up to date expert advice. This work is being progressed through working/implementation groups established by the HSE to address actions within the functional areas of surveillance, health services, public health measures, vaccines/antivirals etc., communications, laboratories and materials management. My Department has established a standing interdepartmental committee to consider issues which go beyond the health aspects of an influenza pandemic and arrangements have been made to procure a stockpile of H5N1 vaccine for key health care workers and other essential workers. My Department is also actively pursuing an advanced purchase order for a pandemic strain vaccine and we are stockpiling a million treatment packs of the antiviral drug, Tamiflu, 600,000 packs of which have already been delivered. The remaining 400,000 packs will be delivered this year. Arrangements have also been made to purchase a supply of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, oseltamivir phosphate powder, to treat children aged between one to five years of age. Arrangements are also being finalised for the stockpiling of additional supplies of the other suitable antiviral drug, Relenza.

The campaign, which is supported by my Department, highlights the need for organ donors by promoting the carrying of an organ donor card. I will launch the 2006 donor awareness campaign on 28 March.In the context of increasing the number of donor organs available for transplant, the Health Service Executive was asked by the Department to undertake a review and analysis of the factors that impact on organ procurement and retrieval rates in hospitals around the country. This review has commenced. My Department is advised by the Health Service Executive that arrangements have recently been put in place to facilitate the distribution of organ donor cards throughout the community pharmacy network. The Irish Pharmaceutical Union has arranged with the Irish Kidney Association on behalf of the Irish donor network for pharmacies to stock organ donor cards.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	803	In November 1977 the then Minister for Health established the expert medical group on whooping cough vaccination to examine persons who, it claimed, had been permanently damaged by whooping cough vaccination, to review the medical information available in relation to them and to indicate whether, in its opinion, the damage was attributable to the vaccination.There were 93 cases presented to the expert group, which found that there was a reasonable probability that the vaccine was responsible for damage in 16 of these cases. Where there was a reasonable doubt in any case, the group gave the benefit of that doubt to that person. In 1982, an offer of an ex-gratia payment of £10,000 was made in 14 cases with a further two offers in 1984, on condition that no claim would be made on the child’s behalf in respect of the whooping cough vaccination. There was no acceptance of liability on the part of the State or any public authority. Award of the ex-gratia payment was on condition that the persons concerned waived any further liability against the State or any public authority. The expert group reviewed all the cases that came before it and is no longer sitting.I presume the Deputy's reference to a tribunal relates to the introduction of a no-fault compensation scheme as recommended by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children in its report on childhood immunisation. The feasibility of introducing a vaccine damage compensation scheme is currently under examination in my Department. The process is at an advanced stage and will be given priority in the Department's 2006 business plan.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	827	The charging for long-stay care under the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 is being implemented by way of the Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005. These regulations were signed on 14 June 2005 and reinstated charges for inpatient services and provided for the levying of a charge in respect of the maintenance of persons in receipt of inpatient services. The regulations were prepared following extensive consultation with the Health Service Executive and others.Section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended by the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, provides, inter alia, for the levying of a charge where inpatient services have been provided for a period of not less than 30 days or for periods aggregating not less than 30 days within the previous 12 months. In this regard, charging of patients in long-term care commenced on 14 July 2005, which was after the expiration of 30 days after the regulations were signed.The regulations, in keeping with section 53 of the Health Act 1970, as amended, have provided for two different classes of persons on whom charges can be levied. Class one refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this case, a weekly charge can be levied of €120 or the weekly income of that person less €35, whichever is the lesser. Class two refers to people in receipt of inpatient services on premises where nursing care is not provided on a 24-hour basis on those premises. In this situation, a weekly charge can be levied of €90, or the weekly income of that person less €55 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser.These regulations provide for the maximum charge to be levied on either class of person. The Health Service Executive has the power to reduce or waive a charge on the grounds of undue hardship. Under section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005, the Health Service Executive can examine a person’s overall financial situation in view of the person’s reasonable expenditure in relation to himself or herself or his or her dependants, if any.The mechanism for levying and collecting charges in respect of patients in receipt of social welfare pensions and also in respect of patients who are adult dependants on the social welfare pension of their spouse, is an operational matter for the Health Service Executive. The Health Service Executive has informed me that the patient has a choice of two mechanisms to pay the charge. The patient can ask the Health Service Executive to become an agent on his or her pension. The Health Service Executive would then cash the pension on a weekly basis and either give the balance of the pension to the patient on the ward or lodge the balance to the patient private property account. The alternative option available to the patient is to receive an invoice from the Health Service Executive on a monthly basis for the charge due. Normally the next of kin would arrange payment of this invoice directly to the Health Service Executive. The mechanisms outlined above can be chosen by the patient in all cases whether the patient has his or her own pension book or where a joint pension book exists in the case of a spouse and adult dependant.The position in regard to the mechanism for levying the charge in respect of patients who are in receipt of social welfare pensions and those who are adult dependants on their spouse's social welfare is as follows. Section 1(b) of the Health (Amendment) Act 2005 states that the Health Service Executive shall have regard to the person’s overall financial situation, including the means of the spouse, if any, of that person in addition to the person's own means, in view of the person’s reasonable expenditure in relation to himself or herself and his or her dependants, if any. It is a matter for the Health Service Executive, based on its own legal advice and taking into account the individual circumstances as well as the service being provided, to make a decision on any charges levied.

It does not come within the remit of the inspection of children's residential centres by the Health Service Executive provided for in the Child Care Act of 1991. Neither does it come within the remit of the social services inspectorate which inspects residential child care services operated by the Health Service Executive. However, I understand from Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, that an inspection of the school to which the Deputy refers was conducted in the school year 2001-02 as part of the regular programme of school inspections conducted during that year.The social services inspectorate has been in operation on an administrative basis since 1999. During this time it has inspected all children's residential centres which are operated by the Health Service Executive, former health boards, and piloted some inspections of foster care services against national standards. Its programme of inspection is ongoing.As the Deputy may be aware, there are commitments in Sustaining Progress, the social partnership agreement 2003-05, An Agreed Programme for Government, June 2002, and the health strategy, Quality and Fairness, in regard to the establishment of the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and the extension of its remit to other social services including residential services for people with disabilities and older people. It is the intention to include the necessary legislative provision for the establishment of the functions of the social services inspectorate on a statutory basis and the extension of these functions in the Bill, which will also establish the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA.The Tánaiste announced on 7 March 2006 that the Government had agreed to the undertaking of a public consultation process on the draft general scheme of the Bill providing for the establishment of the HIQA. The draft heads of the Bill provide for, inter alia, the establishment within HIQA of the office of the chief inspector of social services and the establishment of a registration system for residential services for children in need of care and protection, for persons with disabilities and for older people. The public consultation will commence within the next few weeks.

It is anticipated that construction of the first of three schemes within the overall Fermoy project would commence early in 2007. Construction of the three schemes is likely to take five years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	832	I take it that the group of Ministers to which the Deputy is referring is the group which was established in 1997 by the previous Government to perform a specific task. It was established to facilitate regular contact between the then Minister of State with special responsibility for rural development and ministerial colleagues from the west on matters of concern to the Western Development Commission in its work towards promoting the economic and social development of the western region. In regard to the second element in the Deputy's question, there is in fact no such plan.Regarding disbursements, the national development plan is delivered through a number of operational programmes in the BMW region. These are directly managed and implemented by Departments, the BMW regional assembly and other agencies. Investments in the BMW region will continue under the national development plan until the end of 2006 with respect to Exchequer only funded projects and to the end of 2008 for projects co-funded by the Structural Funds. I draw the Deputy's attention to my reply to Question No. 105 of 9 March 2005 in which I outlined my Department's responsibility with respect to resources for the national development plan. Departments have been asked to ensure that the investment objectives for the BMW region are prioritised.Table 1 sets out the indicative expenditure profiles and the estimated expenditure incurred under each operational programme in the Border, midland and western, BMW, region.Operational ProgrammeProfileExpenditureExpenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure5,3194,51485Employment and Human Resources Development3,3783,15693Productive Sector2,03069234Border, Midlands and Western Regional3,1681,94661PEACE II and Technical Assistance1458659Total Expenditure14,04010,39074Profiles and Expenditure data includes all NDP sources of funding: Exchequer, EU and private.As the vast bulk of NDP spending is financed by the Exchequer, table 2 sets out the indicative expenditure profiles and estimated expenditure by the Exchequer for the same period in the BMW region for the operational programmes.Operational ProgrammeProfileExpenditureExpenditure versus Profile€m€m%Economic and Social Infrastructure3,7563,63397Employment and Human Resources Development3,2382,90390Productive Sector1,66351431Border, Midlands and Western Regional Programme2,5421,55761PEACE II and Technical Assistance24811145Total Exchequer Expenditure11,4478,71776The expenditure data presented in the tables relate to the period from January 2000 to the end of June 2005, the latest data reported to the operational programme monitoring committees. The 2005 annual expenditure profiles have been reduced by half in calculating the profile. However, the Deputy will be aware that significant expenditure, particularly Exchequer expenditure, takes place in the latter half of the year. The position will become clearer when expenditure data to the end of December 2005 become available in April prior to the spring meetings of the monitoring committees.The Deputy will note from the data presented in table 2 that the Exchequer contribution to the BMW region under the key economic and social infrastructure operational programme, ESIOP, is very near to profile. Performance of the employment and human resource operational programme, EHROP, is also on course. Both programmes are likely to achieve the NDP targets for Exchequer expenditure.The performances of the productive sector and the BMW regional operational programmes remain disappointing due a number of factors such as poor demand for a number of schemes, particularly in the agricultural sector. Spending on research and development has also been less than profile owing to initial excess optimism in relation to the timing of expenditure in the region. There has also been poorer than expected private sector involvement in these programmes. The underspend in the BMW regional operational programme is also a feature of the equivalent operational programme in the southern and eastern region. These operational programmes and the PEACE programme are unlikely to achieve their end 2006 targets. However, it should be noted that considerable EU co-funded expenditure will continue on these programmes until the end of 2008.

The Commissioners of Public Works have recently issued a further licence to upgrade its equipment on this site to provide 3G services. Two other companies have applied to co-locate on the mast and their licences are being finalised.The OPW encourages co-location where possible in line with Government policy. It is our understanding that more than one site for antennae is necessary in Howth because usage is approaching antenna capacity limits for a single location.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	834	I assume the Deputy is referring to the term time arrangements that apply in the Civil Service and in certain parts of the public service. In replying, I will refer to the arrangements in the Civil Service for which I have direct responsibility.In December 2000, term time was introduced as a pilot scheme for all civil servants covered by the conciliation and arbitration scheme and provided for ten weeks or 13 weeks' special unpaid leave for parents or primary carers. At present, an eight-week term time scheme is being piloted.The merits and drawbacks of a proposal for other periods of leave in the Civil Service term time scheme have to be carefully assessed in the context of work-life balance policies and the business requirements of the Civil Service. I understand that the issue is being discussed with the Civil Service unions at present and I do not want to anticipate these at this stage.However, as well as term time, the Civil Service has a wide range of family friendly and work-life balance schemes in operation, including,  inter alia, flexi-time, work sharing, career breaks, leave for domestic reasons, paternity leave, bereavement leave and marriage leave. These various options are in addition to the general statutory entitlements such as maternity leave, adoptive leave, parental leave and so on and, together with family friendly and work-life balance schemes, represent good employment arrangements for staff.

He has consequently not been in contact with Revenue for many years. However, deposit interest retention tax was deducted from interest which he and his wife received on their investment income. Owing to their age and income level, they are entitled to a refund of deposit interest retention tax amounting to €3,769.18 for the past four years. A cheque will issue shortly.The Revenue Commissioners have been in contact with the person concerned and advised him that he may be due further refunds in respect of deposit interest retention tax. On receipt of the relevant details from the financial institutions, any further refund due will be dealt with without delay.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	839	With regard to car registration regulations, the Revenue Commissioners are the vehicle registration authority in the State. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the owner-driver of a vehicle is responsible for ensuring that his-her vehicle registration plates comply with the law and it is an offence under section 139(1) (b) of the Finance Act 1992 to be in possession of a vehicle displaying a vehicle registration plate in a format other than as prescribed. The format, dimensions and technical specifications of identification marks of vehicle registration plates to be displayed on vehicles in the State are set out in SI 318/92 as amended by SI 432/99. These regulations are well known and widely understood by the motor trade.The Deputy may wish to note that Revenue mobile units and the Garda Síochána are actively engaged in the detection of vehicles displaying non-conforming registration plates and that the Department of Transport, which has responsibility for the provision of the national car test, rates such display as a fail in its test. There are no plans to impose further regulatory control in this area, such as by regulating the providers of the number plates.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. Member states are only able to apply the reduced VAT rate to those goods and services which are listed under annex H of the EU Sixth VAT Directive. As the service referred to by the Deputy is not listed under annex H, it would not be possible to apply the reduced VAT rate to monitoring fees charged by service providers for socially monitored alarms. The monitoring of home security systems are, therefore, subject to the standard VAT rate of 21%.In regard to the issue of allowing a VAT exemption on the purchase of such a service by a person with disabilities or a visually impaired person, the position is that the rate of VAT which applies to a particular good or service is determined by the nature of the good or service, and not by the status of the consumer. There is no provision in European VAT law that would allow for the introduction of a VAT exemption on the purchase of such services by consumers with disabilities or a visually impaired person. However, under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981, it is possible to obtain a VAT refund in respect of the purchase of a pendant alarm system as it is considered a medical device for the purpose of this refund order. Applicants should contact the Revenue Commissioners, VAT Repayments (Unregistered Section), Kilrush Road, Ennis, County Clare. VAT on monitoring and maintenance fees are not recoverable.In addition, the Deputy may be aware of the community support for older people scheme which is operated by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. The purpose of the scheme is to encourage and assist the community's support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. Funding under the scheme can be provided for small-scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling, including security lighting, smoke alarms and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. Annual monitoring fees or maintenance fees associated with socially monitored alarm systems are not provided for under the scheme. The VAT refund for the purchase of a personal security alarm by or on behalf of a disabled or elderly person combined with the community support for older people scheme outlined above are important measures that go towards ensuring that those who are most in need of security systems can avail of them.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	842	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that an on-line vehicle registration tax system is available since November 2002. Using the Revenue on-line service, ROS, motor dealers can register new vehicles on-line in their own time seven days a week. More than 94% of all new vehicles are registered via ROS.As regards payment of VRT, motor dealers also arrange payment of the VRT due when registering the new owner of the vehicle in ROS by nominating whether the payment is to be made from their FACT or deferred account. FACT, flexible accounting of cash transactions, accounts are held by Revenue and motor dealers lodge money to these accounts for payment of VRT when due. Deferred accounts are, in effect, guaranteed bank accounts which the motor dealer arranges with their bank to guarantee payment of VRT. Motor dealers can also use ROS to look up their VRT account balances. This secure electronic service is of benefit to the motor dealer, particularly during the peak vehicle registration months at the beginning of each year when they need to ensure that sufficient funds are available in these accounts to pay the tax due. Used vehicles continue to be registered at vehicle registration offices and still require to be examined by Revenue officers. However, since September 2004, there is an on-line vehicle inquiry system where customers can calculate in advance the vehicle registration tax payable on used vehicles being imported into this country. This facility is available to the public and has been very successful with more than 1.1 million inquiries made to-date.The Revenue Commissioners already provide an on-line application form for applicants for tax clearance certificates on their website, www.revenue.ie, and will shortly launch an on-line verification facility that will enable verification of tax clearance status. The verification system will be available to self-employed and corporate customers of Revenue. Applicants for tax clearance certificates will have the option, in the process of completing their tax clearance application, to make their tax clearance status visible to their customers. Public bodies and others can then view the current tax clearance status on line, with the permission of the applicant, through the use of a tax number and PIN number supplied by Revenue to the applicant. Revenue is finalising the details relating to the implementation of this initiative and will make a formal announcement shortly.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The climate change strategy says that from 2002 onwards taxes will begin to take into account the amounts of greenhouse gases produced in any activity. It is Government policy to take greenhouse gas emissions into account when formulating or developing tax policy in any particular area.In September 2004, the Government decided not to introduce a specific carbon tax, following a thorough examination of the issues involved, including how a carbon tax would be implemented and the associated environmental, economic and social impacts. In addition, my Department carried out an extensive consultation process in which 117 written submissions were received. Following this examination, the Government decided that a carbon tax was not an appropriate policy option and that, instead, it would intensify action on the other measures under the national climate change strategy. The Government concluded that the environmental benefits of a carbon tax would not justify the difficulties that would arise, particularly for households, from the introduction of such a tax. In this respect, the carbon energy tax would have imposed price increases on many products already suffering sharp increases, particularly as a result of increases in international oil prices. While a carbon tax would have involved a range of compensatory measures, these would not fully address the adverse economic and social effects arising. Moreover, a carbon tax would apply to products which are in the main already subject to excise duties and where a new tax is not specifically necessary to increase tax rates.The carbon energy tax was just one possible element of the Government's approach to meeting Ireland's commitments under the Kyoto Protocol to which the Government remains fully committed. Taxation can play a part in attaining environmental objectives. However, as Minister for Finance, I am concerned to ensure that in developing policy on tax measures, we take into account any effects on Ireland's international competitiveness, particularly in regard to non-EU countries which compete with us and which may have low taxes on energy. I am also concerned in framing policy about the effect that the imposition of such taxes may have on the consumer price index and how they could impact on the less well off members of our community.Apart from the carbon tax, the national climate change strategy envisages other initiatives in the tax area with one such example being tax reliefs for green initiatives. This approach uses the tax system to provide incentives for certain behaviour. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to the significant biofuels excise relief scheme which I announced in the budget and for which provision has been made in the Finance Bill 2006. The Bill also contains a complementary provision which provides for VRT relief, in 2006 and 2007, for cars which are manufactured to use either biofuels or conventional fuel, flexible fuel vehicles.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	845	I am satisfied that good progress continues to be made on this ambitious programme. I am particularly pleased with the continuing popularity of the programme among civil and public servants. There are approximately 10,600 applications on the central applications facility.I would like to refer the Deputy to the decentralisation implementation group's report of June 2005 which identified progress on property, implementation planning, numbers of applicants, human resources issues and industrial relations issues. In line with the group's approach to phasing, the report provided indicative construction start and completion dates for the procurement of office accommodation in the new locations. The full contents of this report can be accessed at www.decentralisation.gov.ie. The final construction dates can only be confirmed when the tender process has been completed in respect of each location and are contingent on the level and quality of market interest in respect of sites, successful negotiation of contracts, receipt of acceptable planning permissions, timely completion of briefs and successful acquisition of suitable sites. I understand that the OPW is updating the position on the property aspects of the programme in light of experience to date.Discussions have progressed with the Civil Service general service unions on a number of human resource and industrial relations issues. Actual movement of staff within and between Departments and offices is now under way with more than 1,200 staff already assigned to posts which will decentralise. Discussions are continuing with the professional and technical staff representatives in respect of arrangements for staff in those grades.In regard to the State agencies, the decentralisation implementation group took the view that it would not seek to dictate every step in the process to the management of the State agencies. Although the group proposed a group of State agencies for early mover status, it did not include specific timeframes in recognition of this approach and also of the fact that it is the responsibility of the board and senior management of each agency to implement Government policy. The group stated in its June 2005 report that each agency included in the programme should have a successful relocation as a high level strategic objective and should prepare the next and deeper iteration of its implementation plan. I understand that agencies are preparing these plans at present. In the meantime, the OPW is continuing to seek property solutions in respect of any agency that requires it.In regard to promotional opportunities, it has been clear from the announcement of the programme that promotion policies in the Civil and public service must take account of the reality of the decentralisation programme. Discussions with the unions representing general service grades in the Civil Service are at an advanced stage. Under these arrangements, a proportion of all promotion posts are linked to decentralisation. Discussions with the unions representing professional and technical personnel are also ongoing. As part of their planning process, the State agencies are also taking account of how recruitment and promotion opportunities may facilitate the early achievement of the decentralisation targets in an efficient manner.The following tables provide information on the number of applicants for each Civil Service Department-office going to a new location, broken down into internal and external applicants, and the number of applicants for each State agency going to a new location, broken down into internal and external applicants.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	846	As the Deputy may be aware, the monthly Exchequer returns are available on my Department's website as are my Department's receipts, expenditure and debt service profiles for 2006. The results for the first two months of 2006 confirm that the public finances remain sound. There was an Exchequer surplus of €2.415 billion at the end of February. Tax receipts to the end of February, at €7.310 billion, were up 19.4% on the same period last year and were €77 million or 1.1% ahead of profile. The main excesses over profile were on capital taxes, €131 million, corporation tax, €91 million, and stamp duty, €40 million, while VAT, income tax and excise were €163 million, €30 million and €12 million below profile, respectively.Overall Exchequer issues for net voted spending were €5.385 billion at the end of February compared to €5.161 billion for the same period last year, an increase of €224 million or 4.3%. This was €147 million or 2.7% below profile due to lower than expected issues for current spending. Debt service is in line with expectations.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	847	I am aware that in recent years the Revenue Commissioners have taken advantage of developments in technology to deliver more and enhanced facilities for customers. There are three main areas where Revenue has developed services with a strong customer focus, the Revenue on-line service, ROS, the Revenue website and their telephony service.The Revenue on-line service offers customers or their agents the facility to make returns and payments for a range of taxes and duties including corporation tax, employer's PAYE-PRSI and income tax for self-employed customers. Further services offered to customers registered for ROS include the facility to view details of payments made, returns filed or due, information provided in the original registration for tax with Revenue and details of all debts due to Revenue. ROS can also be used to request statements of account.Future plans for ROS will see the following services being made available to PAYE customers during 2006: view-amend tax credits, view-request balancing statements, make a claim for health expenses and up-date personal information such as address details. Revenue allows payment by debit instruction and laser card through its on-line facility. There is an on-line banking payment facility for self-employed customers paying income tax and for customers paying capital gains tax. To use this facility, a ROS registered customer, or their tax agent, details the amount of their payment and choice of payment method on-line with ROS. A separate transaction is then undertaken on the relevant banking on-line website, to authorise the payment to Revenue. Only after these actions are completed will the customer's bank account be debited by Revenue, so the customer controls how much and when payment is made at all times.In addition to ROS, Revenue has also developed its website, www.revenue.ie, to offer a range of facilities to customers. The website is a useful source of information relating to taxes and duties and is tailored to suit the needs of business and the individual. It allows the customers to order forms, apply for tax clearance and claim tax credits. The site is continually updated to ensure relevance.The third area where Revenue has made significant improvements is in its telephony service. Over the past 12 months, Revenue has substantially improved its telephone service to PAYE customers. Customers have available to them self-service options to request the most popular PAYE forms and leaflets and to claim for certain tax credits rather than waiting to speak to an operator. A PAYE text messaging service is also available. It enables the customer to request certain PAYE forms and leaflets and to claim certain PAYE tax credits using their mobile phone. In 2005, more than 100,000 transactions were successfully completed using the available self-service options. Future plans for telephone self-service in 2006 include the ability to monitor progress of correspondence submitted to Revenue.I am satisfied that Revenue has been, and continues to be, progressive in delivering enhanced facilities to its customers.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	848	Stamp duty is a charge on documents, which are mostly legal documents, used in the transfer of property. Where a property is purchased or swapped, stamp duty is charged on the conveyance or transfer effecting change of legal ownership of the property concerned.Under the stamp duty code, a developer can obtain a licence from a vendor to build on land owned by the vendor without incurring a stamp duty charge at that stage of the venture. Once the buildings, whether commercial or residential, are completed, the conveyances or transfers of such properties to purchasers are chargeable to stamp duty in the normal manner unless specific exemptions are available to such purchasers. A similar stamp duty treatment would also arise in a situation where a builder or developer contracts to purchase land from a vendor without taking legal title to the land. The developer might complete the contract and not take a conveyance but rather, under a power of attorney given by the vendor, have the power to convey completed buildings to the ultimate purchasers. The normal stamp duty charge will arise on conveyances or transfers of the newly built properties to sub-purchasers subject to any exemptions applying. In such cases, the stamp duty, if any, is paid but at a later stage.Certain developments structured in the manner outlined above have come to the notice of the Revenue Commissioners and the situation is being kept under review. I have asked Revenue to let me know the outcome of their review and I will decide what action, if any, is required, bearing in mind the effect on the housing market and the cost to the Exchequer.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	850	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that they do not have information on the numbers of flight movements into and out of Cork, Dublin or Shannon airports going back to 2002. Such information is the property of the airport authority. It has not been possible to get the same level of detail on flight movements from the relevant authority for each airport, with the result that some numbers in the response are estimated.Since 1993, citizens of EU countries have had the right of free movement within the EU. Customs authorities are not permitted to impose systematic checks on travellers whose point of origin is within the EU. In effect, intra-Community flights have been regarded as domestic since 1993. Customs authorities can impose selective checks for prohibited or restricted goods, but only on the basis of reasonable grounds for suspicion. Flights from non-EU countries are subject to checking at the discretion of customs. Customs experience is that for the purposes of detecting smuggling flights and types of passenger can be risk-rated quite accurately and checking is now mainly risk-driven. In addition to such risk-driven checks, random checks are sometimes performed to validate risk assessment. Checks are carried out by rostered staff or by on-call non-rostered staff depending on the availability of rostered staff, and on the number of officers required.Throughout the period in question, Revenue has had, and continues to have, officers rostered on a 24 hour, seven-day week basis in Dublin Airport. In regard to Shannon Airport, up to the end of 2004, staff were rostered on a 24-hour basis and all flights were attended. A review of the risk associated with late-night flights prompted a change in 2005. During 2005, there were 17 flights per week outside of hours when rostered staff were on duty. Fourteen of these originated in the USA. Two flights per week originated in London Heathrow. The final regular flight outside rostered hours is a winter holiday flight from North Africa. These flights are monitored and checked as appropriate. Overall, the majority of Shannon flights outside rostered hours were attended and checked in 2005. All scheduled flights to Cork originate within the EU. In summer, there are occasional unscheduled charter flights from holiday destinations such as Turkey, Morocco, etc. They are monitored and attended by non-rostered officers as required. There are 15 scheduled flights per week, Monday to Friday, three per day on each of five days, that arrive during hours that officers are not rostered. Ten of these originate in the UK, two per day, and five in Dublin, one per day. These 15 flights are regarded as domestic flights. They are monitored and attended by non-rostered officers on a risk-management basis. Officers are rostered at weekends for a total of 16 rostered hours. The officers are rostered to attend at the times of highest risk. It is estimated that approximately 40 flights per weekend arrive during hours that officers are not rostered for attendance. As with all flights, these are profiled and a proportion attended by non-rostered officers.

The Revenue Commissioners will review the taxpayer's affairs in light of the disclosure and take appropriate action regarding additional tax, interest and penalties due.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	854	There were no changes to VAT rates in the 2006 budget. Periodical publications such as magazines and newspapers are generally liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5%. On the other hand, part-works, that is, component parts of large works that are published over a limited and pre-determined period and which include a related binder supplied free of charge, are treated differently for VAT. Such part works are not regarded as periodical, but rather are treated as a book or booklet and attract a zero rate of VAT.Section 11(3) of the Value-Added Tax Act 1972 provides a special rule, commonly referred to as the package rule, for the VAT treatment of goods that are packaged for sale as a unit. To guard against abuse of the VAT system, such packaged goods are made liable to VAT by reference to the highest rate appropriate to any of the goods in the package, which can be the 21% if goods, such as toys, make-up, etc, are supplied with a magazine or newspaper. However, excluded from the package rule are goods the total VAT-exclusive value of which does not exceed 50% of the total VAT-exclusive price of the package or 40 cent, whichever is the lesser.Moreover, the rule is not applied in the case of goods which are genuinely supplied free as part of the sale of a package. For example, a newspaper that is sold with a free CD remains liable to VAT at the 13.5% rate and does not fall into the 21% rate. Also, in certain limited circumstances, Revenue has agreed to set aside the package rule and accept an apportionment of the total price of the packaged goods by reference to the individual goods that make up the package and have permitted traders to account for VAT at the appropriate rate for each of the individual goods.During 2005, as part of its normal operations, Revenue had dealings with a number of suppliers of magazines and, in the context of giving guidance on the practical application of the rules and regularising the VAT treatment of certain magazines, etc., agreed an approach with the suppliers which was to be used with effect from 1 January 2006. In the light of the issues now raised, Revenue will contact the suppliers in question to ascertain the precise circumstances under which the supplies in question were made with a view to providing any further guidance necessary on the correct application of VAT law.The Finance Bill 2006 contains proposals for replacing the current rules in this regard with different methods of arriving at the correct VAT liability on the supply of goods or services that are sold in conjunction with each other for a single price. Under the proposed new rules, when a separate good, for example, a toy, CD, etc. is supplied with a magazine, the relative value of each element of the supply will be taken into account in determining the VAT liability. The Revenue Commissioners will be issuing new guidelines on the practical application of the new rules in due course.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	855	The Freedom of Information Act provides that a request for a record must be made in writing or in such other form as may be determined by the Minister for Finance having had appropriate regard to the needs of requesters. The needs of individuals who may be unable to comply with the requirement to make a written Freedom of Information request is recognised in this context.Guidelines have been prepared under section 6(3) of the Freedom of Information Act, which provides that the Minister for Finance shall, following consultation with whatever other Minister(s) he or she considers appropriate, introduce guidelines on the provision of reasonable assistance to persons with a disability in exercising their rights under the Act, and that public bodies shall have regard to such guidelines. These guidelines recommend acceptance of oral requests from requesters who are unable to read, print and-or write due to their disability. In receiving oral requests, the appropriate officer should make a verbatim record of the request, to be read back to and agreed by the requester. This would make such requests consistent with section 7(1) of the Act, which requires that freedom of information requests are in writing. The usual fee arrangements apply in such cases.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	856	The question of taxpayers' entitlement to repayment of tax and interest was examined in the context of Finance Bill 2003 with a view to introducing, in so far as practicable, a uniform scheme which was fair and reasonable for taxpayers, and which also took into account the position of the Exchequer. On foot of that review, a new provision was introduced in the Finance Act 2003, section 17, which gives taxpayers a general right to repayment of tax overpaid subject to a four-year claim limitation period. A corollary to the restriction to four years of the taxpayer's right to a repayment is a new restriction on the Revenue Commissioners going back more than four years to assess taxpayers, where fraud or neglect is not a feature of the case.The four-year time limit came into effect from 31 October 2003 with transitional measures applying initially. Since 1 January 2005 all claims for repayment — for whatever year — are subject to the four-year time limit on claims. This is the general time limit that provides the necessary protection for the Exchequer against claims for repayment going back over many years.The legislation referred to above precludes the Revenue Commissioners from allowing a claim for repayment outside these limits. Where a person is aggrieved by a decision of the Revenue Commissioners on a claim for repayment, the normal appeal provisions apply.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	858	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that there is no automatic procedure in Revenue's computer systems for activating a tax refund where a person becomes unemployed for a period or has a change in personal circumstances, such as becoming widowed. In the case of a gap in employment, a refund of PAYE will be made by Revenue on receipt of a claim for an unemployment repayment. If an unemployment repayment tax refund claim is not made to Revenue and the employee takes up a new employment, then the new employer will deal with any refund due, calculated by reference to the unclaimed tax credits during the gap period and the particulars of pay and tax on the P45.In the case of a person becoming widowed, Revenue will amend tax credits due as soon as they are notified of the death of a spouse. In the case of a PAYE taxpayer, the employer or pension provider will make any tax adjustment automatically once the amended tax credit certificate is received; where a self-employed person notifies Revenue of a change in personal circumstances, this will be reflected in the notice of assessment.I am advised that Revenue is planning to introduce an on-line service for PAYE taxpayers later this year to make it easier to self-amend tax credit certificates to reflect any change in personal circumstances, and to claim tax refunds.

Under the Investment Intermediaries Act 1995, as amended, it is unlawful for a person to claim to be an investment business firm unless so authorised.Irish legislation is enforceable against unauthorised investment service promoters within the State and there are effective mechanisms in place to deal with similar entities originating in other EEA jurisdictions. However, investors remain free to invest in products and schemes available in markets outside the EEA, including those offered over the Internet. I would urge investors to be extremely cautious in relation to such investments and at a minimum to obtain independent professional advice.The Financial Regulator, in co-operation with the Garda, investigates alleged breaches of the law relating to the taking of deposits or intermediation of investments. The Financial Regulator is aware of the particular scheme to which the Deputy refers. If people believe they have been offered investment advice or sold a financial product by an individual who is not authorised to conduct this business, they should report the matter to the Financial Regulator in the first instance. Similarly, if people believe they may have been induced to invest in a fraudulent scheme they should report the matter to the Garda.

In other circumstances, other routes to transposition may be appropriate, for example, through changes in primary legislation.Council Directive 2003/48/EC — OJ No. L 157, 26.6.2003, p.38 — of 3 June 2003 concerning the taxation of savings income was transposed into Irish national law on 19 December 2003 by way of regulation, SI 717 of 2003. These regulations had immediate statutory effect and were then confirmed by section 90 and Schedule 4 to the Finance Act 2004 which was enacted on 25 March 2004.Two further statutory instruments associated with the implementation of Council Directive 2003/48/EC, the savings tax directive, were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 4 July 2005. For the purposes of clarity a reference to one of these, SI 317 of 2005, is contained in section 124 of Finance Bill 2006 as passed by Dáil Éireann.The details of these statutory instruments are as follows. The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 — sections 898H, 898I, 898J, 898L and 898M (Commencement) Order 2005, SI 286 of 2005, provides for the commencement of sections 898H, 898I, 898J, 898L and 898M of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 with effect from 1 July 2005. These sections were inserted in the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 by the Finance Act 2004 and amended by the Finance Act 2005.The European Communities (Taxation of Savings Income in the form of Interest Payments) Regulations 2005, SI 317 of 2005, also amend the original implementing legislation in a number of ways, including reflecting the correct interpretation of derogations contained in Article 6.6 of the savings tax directive.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	865	The Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 provides for three stamp duty reliefs in respect of the acquisition of dwelling houses and apartments. They are as follows: section 91A — new dwelling house with floor area compliance certificate; section 92 — new dwelling house with no floor area compliance certificate; and section 92B — first-time purchaser relief.Since these reliefs are claimed and given at the time of stamping of the legal instrument concerned, the instrument is required to include a statement that certifies, inter alia, that for a period ending five years after the date of execution or, if earlier, the date of sale-on, the dwelling house will be occupied as the only or principal place of residence of the purchaser, or of a person in right of the purchaser; and that no rent will be received for the use of the dwelling house other than under the rent a room scheme by the occupier of the dwelling house. Each section also contains a provision that imposes a penalty — effectively a claw back of the relief — should rent for use of the house, other than under the rent a room scheme, be received in the five-year period. There is no concession in relation to the clawback where a person moves for work or family reasons.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	866	I should explain that the public service obligation, PSO, levy is a charge shown separately on bills issued by the Electricity Supply Board, ESB, to its customers since March 2003. The PSO levy is based on the costs incurred by the ESB in meeting its obligations to produce, or buy, electricity that is generated from peat and other environmentally sustainable forms of energy. It was previously included as part of the standing charges shown on ESB bills.The PSO levy is part of the price which customers pay the ESB and is directly linked to the price of the electricity supplied. In these circumstances, the ESB is obliged to charge VAT on the levy. The rate at which VAT must be charged is 13.5%, which is the VAT rate that applies to the supply of electricity.In relation to the issue of whether applying VAT to the PSO levy is appropriate, the position is that the VAT rating of goods and services is subject to the requirements of EU VAT law with which Irish VAT law must comply. The method through which VAT must be calculated has been transposed under section 10 of the Value-Added Tax Act 1972, as amended, on the following basis: "...the total consideration which the person supplying goods or services becomes entitled to receive in respect of or in relation to such supply of goods or services, including all taxes, commissions, costs and charges whatsoever, but not including value-added tax chargeable in respect of the supply". The PSO levy on ESB bills is therefore legally subject to VAT.

#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	880	The Government has, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve the objective of restoration of salmon stocks.It is clear to me that future policy must be designed to ensure the survival of the species, while balancing the interests of various stakeholders in relation to the quantum of catch that appears to be possible within the independent scientific advice and taking account of the detail of that advice in relation to location and types of fishing.I am advised that there is no legal requirement to introduce any compensation scheme in the event of a curtailment of fishing effort on conservation grounds in accordance with the Fisheries Acts. In that context, expectations of high levels of monetary compensation are unrealistic. Similarly, and in consideration of equity in the matter, if there was some form of compensation for hardship cases in the event of curtailment of fishing effort on conservation grounds, some meaningful contribution could be expected from the economic beneficiaries of a reduction in commercial fishing whether that is delivered in cash or in kind.The Deputy will be aware of the Oireachtas joint committee's acknowledgement that any compensatory schemes should largely be funded by those stakeholders who would be the main economic beneficiaries of more salmon being free to return to the rivers. I also draw the Deputy's attention to the committee's comment that "public moneys spent must have, as a primary aim, ensuring the survival of the salmon species and that this precept must be regarded as more important than any economic gain to any sector that may accrue".

The Department has asked the licensee for details of any fish movements from this area, and will review the position on receipt of this information. The data on sea lice levels requested by the Deputy are being compiled and will be forwarded to him as soon as possible.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	882	Significant progress has been made in recent years on the development and management of Ireland's inshore fisheries, particularly on such issues as fleet licensing and registration, inshore stock assessment and research, and also management policy.The scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet is now in the process of being completed and will see some 500 inshore vessels regularised and brought into the licensing and registration system. In addition, the recommendations made by Padraic White on the segmentation of the Irish fishing fleet post decommissioning have been implemented. The scallop fleet has now been ring fenced to better match fishing effort to the resource and the polyvalent segment has been further segmented into over and under 18 metre vessels to prevent the transfer of capacity between the inshore sector and the offshore sector which will also underpin resource sustainability.The process of producing resource assessments to support the development of management plans for key inshore fisheries is also making significant progress. Resource assessments, essential to making informed decisions on the future management of these stocks, have now been completed for the brown crab, lobster and scallop fisheries.Following the launch of the shellfish management framework last year, significant progress has been made in its implementation. Inaugural meetings have been held for all four species advisory groups, enabling the full participation of the sector in the management process in a unique co-operative framework between State and industry.I do not accept that there is over-regulation in this sector. Regulatory measures are in my view a key element in the achievement of stock sustainability and I believe there is widespread acceptance in the sector of the various measures and initiatives that are being taken.As regards the numbers employed in the inshore sector, periodic surveys carried out by Bord Iascaigh Mhara over the past few years indicate that this has remained fairly constant at around 3,500.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	883	Inshore fishing vessels are divided into two groups on the basis of the licences which they hold. Those registered in the full polyvalent category may fish with both pots and nets and can catch quota species. However, those vessels licensed under the scheme for the licensing of traditional pot fishing boats in the Irish inshore fleet are restricted to fishing non-quota species by means of pots only. This scheme was introduced in 2003 to permit the regularisation of a significant number of inshore fishing vessels which had been operating on an unlicensed basis.In drawing up the terms of that scheme, due consideration had to be given to the interests of those fishermen that had been properly licensed and registered and who had, in many cases, incurred considerable expenditure in purchasing replacement capacity to register their vessels. Therefore, to maintain an appropriate differentiation between those vessels with full polyvalent entitlements, which in the majority of cases had paid considerable sums of money to license their vessels, and those vessels to be licensed under this scheme, restrictions on fishing using nets and catching quota species was applied to licences issued under the 2003 scheme. Data from an earlier scheme showed that in fact an extremely small percentage of applicants seeking to have their vessels registered under the scheme had actually fished with nets and accordingly the number of vessels affected by that restriction was relatively small. An additional factor in the setting of this restriction was the general need to avoid an increase in fishing effort on quota species where many such stocks were already under pressure.In so far as making the regulatory process more navigable and user friendly to inshore fishermen, the Bord Iascaigh Mhara network of officers around the coast has been of great assistance in this regard. These officers provide important assistance and advice to inshore fishermen at a local level.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I propose to take Questions Nos. 355 to 358, inclusive, 362 and 367 to 369, inclusive, together.The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, the independent regulator.It has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband so my Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities. These metropolitan area networks, MANs, will allow the private sector to offer world class broadband services at competitive costs.In planning the next phase of the MANs programme, a review of the availability of DSL broadband in the regions showed more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector, and these towns have been targeted for the provision of MANs under phase 2.A number of regional towns, including Athy, already had DSL broadband on offer from the service providers, so priority was given to the provision of essential broadband infrastructure in those towns where none existed.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under phase one and are being managed by ENet, the management services entity. The second phase of the programme involves the building of MANs in more than 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that do not have a satisfactory broadband offering from the sector. Kildare is developing nine projects in respect of the following towns: Kildare, Newbridge, Rathangan, Sallins, Maynooth, Clane, Monasterevin, Kilcock and Prosperous. The network routes are being finalised prior to issuing the invitation to tender for detailed design. Construction on these projects is expected to commence in 2006. Athy is not part of the current roll-out but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available. Kildare County Council has submitted a strong case for a MAN to be built in Athy and this is being kept under review.For rural communities and the hinterlands of larger towns my Department offers funding under the county and group broadband scheme to enable these communities to become self-sufficient in broadband, in association with the service providers. To date 12 schemes have been approved across Kildare county representing total capital investment of €396,750, making broadband available to 68 communities and 17,790 people. Full details of the scheme, including application procedures, are on the website www.gbs.gov.ie.My Department's website, www.broadband.gov.ie, lists all service providers offering broadband services in all towns in Kildare and gives contact details for each company, together with prices for the various service levels on offer.

After the back-office systems went live, a more comprehensive look was taken at the business processes relating to the e-services with regard to change and modernisation before proceeding and this explains the delay. Analysis, design and build of the listed e-services will be complete by the first quarter of 2006. Testing and complete implementation of all these listed e-services on the Department's websites will take place during the second quarter of 2006.

The Geological Survey of Ireland, which is the national earth science organisation, provides data, maps, publications and services on line as well as downloads, web-based geographic information services and metadata, that is, data listings with contact information details. GSI, as part of its earth resource information warehouse project, is working towards the fuller on-line provision of data, including on-line purchasing. As part of this process, GSI will be launching a new website this year. It is the policy of GSI to provide information free of charge for bona fide research and educational purposes.The exploration and mining division maintains an e-enabled minerals administration programme support system that allows free, on-line access to all non-confidential data held by EMD including company exploration reports, GIS data-sets and regulatory information. The petroleum affairs division provides on-line access to reports and concession maps as well as metadata listings of all its available data and how to obtain it from PAD's data agents.

These approvals include the plan of development approval on 15 April 2002 under the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960; consent to construct a pipeline dated 15 April 2002 under the Gas Act 1976 as amended; consent under section 5 of the Continental Shelf Act 1968 as amended dated 15 April 2002; and foreshore licence approval on 17 May 2002 under the Foreshore Act 1933 as amended. The developers are finalising their work plan for 2006 and will commence well completion operations with the drilling rig Sedco 711 on the field in late April or early May 2006. My Department is at present considering the following applications from the developers for consent to install and commission an onshore pipeline and umbilical; offshore umbilical; manifold installation and infield works. The requirement to seek the approval for consent to install and commission the pipeline is an administrative condition attaching to the consent to construct the pipeline.On 25 of August 2005, I commissioned an international consulting company, Advantica, to carry out a thorough and independent safety review of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline. Advantica is the world leader in the area of advanced hazard and risk assessment technologies for gas pipelines. At my request the developers of the Corrib gas field ceased all works on the onshore pipeline pending the outcome of this review to allow for a period of public discussion and dialogue. In addition, works on the offshore pipeline were deferred to 2006 by the developers. In parallel with this safety review, I established a public consultation process to ensure that the concerns of the community would be fully addressed in the review. As part of this process, a two-day public hearing was held in Geesala on the 12 and 13 October, chaired by Mr. John Gallagher SC, during which the community was given the opportunity to express its concerns directly to the consultants. The consultants also made a separate site inspection of the pipeline route.The results of this review have now been forwarded to my Department and I am considering it, along with an additional report from my Department's technical advisory group. I hope to make a decision regarding the applications on hand having regard to these reports. In addition to the above, I have appointed Mr. Peter Cassells as mediator in the Corrib dispute. I hope that the mediation process will allow all those concerned to work together to resolve the difficulties that have arisen.

I have made inquiries and understand that the position is as follows. ESB operates a national customer contact centre that deals with all customer queries from any of its 1.8 million customers. In 2005, a huge volume increase occurred in calls to the NCCC, driven by a number of factors including implementation of new systems to facilitate electricity market opening. This had a negative impact on call-answering performance and ESB accepts that customers did experience delays in contacting the company. However, steps have now been taken to address this and calls are now being answered on a much more timely basis and in line with industry norms. As with all utility call centres, there may be certain times when customers experience delays contacting the ESB. Following the improvements ESB has implemented, it is anticipated that these will be limited to isolated events such as widespread storms or forced outages. ESB advises that a dedicated hotline should not be necessary and that in general all customers should at this point be able to get through to the NCCC on a timely basis.

There are no plans to roll out a fibre-optic network to every home and business here. It would not make economic sense nor would it be feasible. In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers, today there are more than 150 companies with at least 45 different broadband offerings. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.

It is a commercial operational matter for the Internet service providers to determine such issues as the cost of establishing broadband services, revenue streams, minimum break-even subscriber numbers, technology and locations. Information about broadband services and prices, provided by the industry to my Department on a voluntary basis, is posted on the website at www.broadband.gov.ie. My Department also administers the group broadband scheme which is aimed at grant-aiding broadband service providers when establishing services in rural areas with populations below 1,500. Details of the scheme are available on my Department’s website at www.dcmnr.gov.ie.

The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network. The challenge for all stakeholders in An Post is to generate sufficient profitable business to maintain the network at its current size. I have asked the company to ensure that any strategy for its development should ensure the long-term viability of the post office network. In this light, An Post is working on a new initiative which would see the development of An Post financial services. Its aim is to supply a wide range of retail financial services through the branch network. If successful, it could lead to a significant increase in post office business and contribute to the viability of the network.

The group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Liam Twomey of the National Aquarium of Ireland, included Ms. Anne Wilkinson of the Marine Institute; Mr. Sean O'Coistealbha of Údarás Na Gaeltachta; Mr. Martin Bradley of Ireland West Tourism; Mr. Tim Quinn of Leader and Mr. Peter Hynes of Mayo County Council.I understand that the first formal meeting took place on 20 December 2001 and subsequent meetings were held on 30 January 2002, 28 February 2002 and 26 April 2002. The funding claimed by the Mullet Peninsula project group from the Department, which amounted to €4,471.59, included fees for the professional services of a heritage tourism consultant and travel and subsistence expenses. The chairman advised that the group undertook a survey of the derelict buildings on the peninsula with the purpose of examining whether an initiative could be devised to assist in upgrading these properties. The group identified a need to build an entrepreneurial culture with the assistance of a dedicated programme based on a model run previously by Shannon Development.The chairman advised, in his final report to the Department in January 2004, that the existing and extensive body of work by Udarás na Gaeltachta and the local Leader office allied to recent development reports from Mayo County Council gave a clear picture of the prevailing position in the context of tourism and marine tourism in the locality. According to the chairman, there was nothing that the committee could have added to the volumes written on the subject.

The final report was submitted by the consultants in December. The total cost of the report was €1,214,033, including VAT.As part of their terms of reference, the consultants undertook a comprehensive consultation process with industry stakeholders, including the ESB, to underpin the review and all comments and submissions made have been channelled through this process. Because of the commission's statutory responsibility for the regulation of the electricity sector, I have supplied the three commissioners on a strictly confidential basis with copies of the draft and final reports. The Department of Finance has also been given a copy of those reports on the same confidential basis.I am considering the report in the context of the energy policy consultation paper, which is being drawn up by my Department. I intend to publish the report in that context in the coming months.

I am aware that to date 560, or approximately 12.4%, of telecommunication sites have been audited and that no site has been found to be in excess of the International Commission for Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, emission limits. There is no breakdown available from ComReg for how many of these are solely mobile phone masts. I understand that these audits are carried out on a random basis and that ComReg does not maintain information on a county-by-county basis.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	901	To date I have not seen any estimates or breakdown of the costs associated with this proposal. The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit in the regions by building high speed, open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide. Phase 1 of this programme has delivered fibre-optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country.This programme has been extended to more than 90 towns in various locations nationwide. It is expected that these MANs will be completed during 2006 and 2007. These networks will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs. My Department also offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities through the county and group broadband scheme. The scheme is technology neutral, allowing the community to select the most suitable broadband delivery platform for the area. To date, more than 150 projects have been approved for funding under this programme.A joint industry-Government fund of €18 million has been established for the broadband for schools programme, which will provide every school in the country with broadband by the beginning of 2006. This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and my Department's wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities throughout the country. The construction-installation phase is now under way and the project is on target for completion within the set timeframe.In 2004 there were more than 80 Internet service providers; today there are more than 156 companies with at least 45 different broadband offerings. Wireless broadband technology is improving rapidly, and the lowering of equipment prices has made this technology much more attractive of late. The use of fixed wireless local access is increasing, especially in rural areas that cannot obtain ADSL connectivity and the development of Wi-Max offers considerable potential in the future.

Rumours being circulated are inaccurate and mischievous. As the Deputy will be aware, proposals adopted by Government in relation to the restructuring of the inland fisheries sector were announced in November last. As the first step in the reform process, the Government has authorised the drafting of a Bill to establish a national inland fisheries authority, which will subsume the executive functions of the central and regional fisheries boards. The new authority will play a key role in the transformation of the sector.It is my firm belief that the policy adopted will allow the sector to reach its full potential through more coherent and consistent policy making and resource allocation and use and will give the whole range of stakeholders the opportunity to be central to the development, promotion and protection of the inland fisheries resource.

In 2001 the council submitted a report prepared by consulting engineers on the estimated cost of a plan for development of Ballycotton Harbour. The proposed development was estimated to cost a total of €6 million. Cork County Council applied for funding in 2002 under the marine tourism grant scheme of the national development plan for a development, including a marina, at Ballycotton. However, as the applicants had not obtained the necessary statutory permissions, their application could not be considered further. The applicants were informed of this and that they could apply for funding under a future call.No funding was available for the marine tourism grant scheme in 2003, 2004 or 2005. The findings of the mid-term review of the regional operational programmes recommended reallocation of funds to other priorities. The allocation for the fishery harbours development programme is €21 million for 2006. The fishery harbours programme involves co-funding by the local authorities. An updated proposal for development in three phases at Ballycotton was submitted by the local authority to the Department in October 2005. The estimated cost of phase 1 is €2.5 million. Cork County Council would be required to contribute 25% funding to the project. There is no Exchequer funding available for Ballycotton phase 1 development in 2006. The question of providing funding in future years will have to be considered in the context of the available funding for fishery harbour works and overall national priorities.

I have recently obtained a Government decision, which provides for the preparation of legislation to regulate the provision of the service and to prepare a tender for the identification of a new undertaking, which will take over the provision of the service. The Department will be assisted by an interdepartmental committee made up of the representatives of the emergency services and consultants who will manage the process of identification of a new undertaking and the transition of the service to the new undertaking. I understand that there are discussions within Eircom in relation to employees working in the area.

Most recently, the issue was discussed when the Taoiseach and I met President Bush on St. Patrick's Day. The President was appreciative of our concerns and has made it known that he favours a broad approach to the issue, involving reform as well as enforcement. The Taoiseach and I also conveyed our views to key players on the Hill, including Senators Kennedy and McCain. There was much appreciation in Washington of the all-party approach of the Oireachtas, as reflected in the resolutions in favour of the Kennedy-McCain bill. The matter rests with the US Congress. The debate there is marked by differing approaches and strongly held opinions. The Deputy can be assured that the Government will continue to lobby actively for a favourable outcome in the critical period ahead.

The consul-general in Boston also met the defence attorney for the person concerned on 23 January 2006.During the latest consular visit on 23 February 2006, the person concerned requested that the Government take a case against the US Government on his behalf on the grounds that his Vienna Convention rights had not been adhered to as he had not been given access to a consular call following his arrest. I have asked that all aspects of the case be further discussed with the lawyer and that the position be reported back to the Department for further consideration.

Most recently, the issue was discussed in the White House last week when the Taoiseach and I met President Bush on St. Patrick's Day. The President was appreciative of our concerns and again reiterated his support for a broad approach to the issue, involving reform as well as enforcement. The Taoiseach and I expressed appreciation for his understanding and emphasised the importance of addressing the situation in a pragmatic and sympathetic way, as for instance in the approach in the Kennedy-McCain bill.The matter rests with the US Congress. The debate there is marked by differing approaches and strongly held opinions. It is clear that achieving the necessary compromise remains a formidable challenge. In all our meetings, including with the President and with Congressional figures, the Taoiseach and I made known the Government's strong support for the inclusion of the key elements of the Kennedy-McCain bill in any final compromise legislation. We conveyed our appreciation and support directly to Senators Kennedy and McCain. Many of our friends on Capitol Hill, including these two Senators, greatly appreciated the all-party Oireachtas motions in support of the Kennedy-McCain bill.The Taoiseach and I also had a valuable meeting with Niall O'Dowd and Grant Lally of the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, ILIR. I strongly commend the work of the ILIR organisation, which has had a significant impact on the immigration debate in Washington and elsewhere in the US, and whose work I have been very pleased to support financially. While our primary focus at present is on the proposals before the US Congress, the Deputies can be assured that, as the outcome of the congressional debate becomes clearer over the next few weeks, the situation will be actively reviewed to see what, if any, revision to our strategy and approach may be required.

In pursuit of this, discussions are ongoing with the Reach agency to enable, as a first step, applicants to submit their personal passport details on-line. However, until the level of authentication of identity required for passport security is available under the public service broker, applicants will still have to be requested to submit their photographs, signatures and supporting documentation by post or by hand to the passport authorities.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	911	In line with the commitments made by the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair at their meeting in Farmleigh on 26 January 2006, I have had ongoing contacts with Secretary of State Hain and with the political parties with the aim of advancing arrangements and a timetable for the restoration of the devolved institutions in Northern Ireland as soon as possible. I met the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Peter Hain, in London on 1 February when we jointly chaired a meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. We had a very useful and constructive meeting. At the meeting, the Secretary of State and I reaffirmed our commitment to bringing about an early restoration of devolved government on an inclusive basis. We confirmed that, in the period following the meeting, we would be stepping up our contacts with the political parties and, in particular, would be engaging in a joint series of meetings with them in order to discuss how best we could make progress on restoring the institutions at the earliest possible opportunity.The first in a series of talks with the parties took place in Hillsborough on 6 February. On that date, the Secretary of State and I had a series of meetings with the DUP, the SDLP, the PUP, Sinn Féin, the UUP, Alliance and the UKUP. We had a further round of meetings again in Hillsborough on 20 February. In addition to these talks, separate discussions with the parties on strand one issues were convened by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Treacy, and Northern Ireland Minister, David Hanson. These formal meetings with the parties represented useful opportunities to test their views on the way forward and to listen to their concerns. They complement the informal contact which I maintain with a broad range of political figures in Northern Ireland.I had a short meeting with Secretary of State Hain in London on 23 February to review progress. I also participated in the Taoiseach's meetings in Dublin with Sinn Féin on 1 March and with the SDLP on 2 March. On 8 March, when I accompanied the Taoiseach to Downing Street for a meeting with Prime Minister Blair, I also had a separate meeting with Secretary of State Hain. We took that opportunity to reflect again on our meetings with the parties and to consider a joint strategy for the period ahead.Most recently, I travelled to the United States on 11 March where I attended a number of events over the St. Patrick's Day period both in Dallas and in Washington. In addition to accompanying the Taoiseach to his meeting with President Bush at the White House on 17 March, I had an opportunity to brief members of the House of Representatives and Senate, and a wide range of US contacts, on recent developments in the peace process and the Government's perspective on the way ahead. I also met informally with representatives of the Northern Ireland political parties present in the US for St. Patrick's Day.As the Taoiseach and I have made clear, including in our remarks at the weekend, our firm objective is to achieve full restoration of the devolved institutions and to have the Assembly and Executive operational and fully functioning this year. We firmly believe that partnership government, as set down in the Good Friday Agreement and endorsed by the people, is the best way forward for Northern Ireland. In the coming weeks, the two Governments will announce our joint strategy to fully realise this objective in 2006.
#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	912	Kenya and neighbouring countries in the Horn of Africa are in the grip of a severe drought that has brought millions of people to the brink of starvation and killed thousands of livestock, leaving pastoral communities in northern and north-eastern Kenya destitute. The impact of poor rainfall during the long rainy season of March-June last year has been compounded by the failure of the short rains in October-December. The water shortage has decimated livestock herds. Pasture for remaining animals is nearing exhaustion. Livestock is the main source of income and subsistence for the nomadic pastoralists. Without this income, they cannot buy food to survive in the immediate term or rebuild their herds in the future. The World Food Programme estimates that 3.5 million Kenyans now require food aid.As the scale of the crisis became apparent, Ireland responded promptly. In early February, more than €5 million in emergency humanitarian funding was provided to agencies working in the Horn of Africa. The greater part of the €5 million funding for the Horn of Africa —€3 million — is being used for the regional emergency response programmes of UN agencies and the International Federation of the Red Cross, while almost €1 million has been provided to the NGOs, Concern and Trócaire for programmes specifically in Kenya. In addition, we estimate that in 2006 an additional €2 million will be delivered for development activities in Kenya through our long-term partnerships with Concern, Goal and Trócaire. While there has been some rainfall in early March, the worst-affected areas of Kenya have not benefited from this and the situation remains extremely serious. We are continuing to monitor developments closely.

The Governments communicated their final proposals for a comprehensive agreement, addressing these key issues, to the DUP and Sinn Féin in early December 2004. The Taoiseach received a letter on 7 December from Sinn Féin in which they indicated that they could agree to the political package contained in the proposals of the two Governments.

Ireland signed the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Cooperation in respect of intercountry adoption in 1996. Ratification of the convention requires legislative amendment and the designation of a central authority.In 2005, following the publication of the Government's proposals for change, a consultation process was undertaken with people involved with adoption or working in that field, at the request of the Minister of State with responsibility for children. The consultation process included, inter alia, consideration of legislative proposals relating to the ratification of the Hague Convention. The proposals also provided for the establishment of an Adoption Authority which will replace the existing Adoption Board as the central authority required under the Hague Convention. The heads of the adoption (Hague Convention, adoption authority and miscellaneous) Bill are being drafted in the Parliamentary Counsel’s office. It is anticipated that a Bill will be published in autumn 2006.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	915	It has been the policy of successive Irish Governments to limit recognition to states and not formally to recognise governments. Diplomatic relations were established between Ireland and Cuba in 1999. Our ambassador in Mexico City is accredited to Cuba. In 2001, Cuba established an embassy in Dublin which, since October 2005, has been headed by a resident ambassador.I understand that in July 2005 Mr. Caleb McCarry was appointed "Cuba transition co-ordinator" in the US State Department, to direct US Government "actions in support of a free Cuba". To the best of our knowledge, there is no basis for any claim that his function embraces a role as "transitional Governor" of Cuba. Department of Foreign Affairs officials have not met Mr. McCarry in his official capacity since his appointment. Ireland conducts its foreign relations according to the United Nations Charter, article 2, sub-paragraph 4 of which states: "All Members shall refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations."A European Union common position on Cuba has been in place since 1996. The aim of the common position is to "encourage a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, as well as a sustainable recovery and improvement in the living standards of the Cuban people". We believe that the way to achieve this is by engagement rather than by isolation. Increasingly, and in particular since 2003, the Cuban authorities have had recourse to more coercive measures against dissidents and civil society more generally, including, in the course of the past six months, increased levels of "acts of repudiation" whereby activists have been maltreated, expelled from their dwellings and beaten up with the connivance or encouragement of the Government.Notwithstanding these disappointing actions, Ireland and our EU partners will continue to persevere with our policy of constructive engagement with Cuba with a view ultimately to seeing the aims of the common position achieved, namely, the initiation of a transition to a system of pluralist democracy embracing human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Over the last five years, Zimbabwe has slipped over 25 places down the human development index, HDI. This is the UN index that measures the human and material well-being of a country and its people across a wide range of indicators. This slippage mirrors the descent of a once moderately prosperous country to a situation today where hunger is a daily experience for millions of Zimbabweans. Life expectancy today is under 40 years in Zimbabwe. In the first half of the 1970s, it was 55 years.Ireland's assistance to Zimbabwe is delivered through partnerships with the humanitarian agencies of the United Nations, particularly the World Food Programme and NGOs such as Christian Aid, Concern, Goal, Trócaire and missionary organisations. We also work with local groups and organisations, particularly those with a focus on HIV and Aids. Our programme has one clear objective, to deliver aid effectively to the most needy and vulnerable people throughout Zimbabwe. Since 2004, Ireland has committed approximately €12 million in aid to Zimbabwe, including more than €2 million this year to address emergency needs. The largest proportion of this funding is for immediate humanitarian needs, particularly the provision of food assistance. My Department is in regular contact with NGOs operational in Zimbabwe and with the WFP. As recently as 16 March, my officials met with the head of the World Food Programme in Zimbabwe, Mr. Kevin Farrell, an Irish national, to discuss the ongoing food security situation in Zimbabwe and the best way that Ireland can assist.It is difficult to envisage the situation in Zimbabwe improving in the near future. The policy and political failures which have led inevitably to the ongoing food crisis and the deterioration in the basic well-being of the people of Zimbabwe show no signs of being reversed. In this context, Ireland must concentrate its efforts on working with the poorest people and with the organisations and agencies best equipped to deliver our aid.

Government support for sport is predicated on the need for tolerance, mutual respect, fair play and equal access for everybody. The Irish Sports Council, which is the statutory body for the development of sport, is fully dedicated to the development of Irish sport for all people across a wide range of support programmes and initiatives.The national lottery-funded sports capital programme, which is administered by my Department, allocates funding to sporting and community organisations at local, regional and national level throughout the country for projects which must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities.The guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme clearly stipulate that "Applicants will have to submit rules and procedures as evidence of non discrimination on the grounds of sex, religion, ethnic origin etc."Government policy on racism in sport is reflected in the national action plan against racism, which was launched by the Taoiseach in 20 January 2005. A strategic monitoring group, SMG, has been established under the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to drive the plan forward. The group comprises representatives of the Government, the social partners and relevant non-governmental organisations.One of the key objectives of the national action plan is concerned with enhancing recognition and awareness of cultural diversity, and the SMG is currently examining how it can assist sports organisations in developing initiatives to tackle racism and promote diversity in sport.The SMG recently met with the FAI, the Professional Footballers' Association, Sport Against Racism in Ireland, Show Racism the Red Card, which involves elite Gaelic, rugby and soccer players, and the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism, with a view to furthering co-operation and agreeing a plan of action on the issues raised by the Deputy. My Department was also represented at that meeting.Several initiatives are already under way in soccer in Ireland, including the implementation of an anti-racism campaign at National League grounds, cross-Border initiatives such as the Setanta Cup, the organisation of several intercultural football events and the encouragement of ethnic minorities to become involved in existing FAI programmes. In accordance with the written declaration of the European Parliament, the FAI is already engaged with UEFA on the implementation of UEFA's ten-point plan, which it intends to implement fully, and will develop a programme of actions that will further enhance its work in promoting integration and in preventing racism and sectarianism in soccer in Ireland.

The implementation of the various recommendations put forward in the report across areas such as revised structures, marketing, community involvement and financial viability is clearly a matter for the Eircom League and the FAI to determine.The improvement of facilities to ensure high-standard, safe, family-friendly stadia conforming with club licensing requirements is also identified as a key requirement. The report signalled the need for Dublin clubs to consider ground-sharing to secure the significant public investment required to provide modern city stadia necessary to attract higher attendances. It is in that context that the issue of ground-sharing among Dublin clubs has been discussed, among other issues, at meetings between me, my officials and the FAI.I have indicated to the FAI, my desire to see the provision of two modest-sized modern football stadia in Dublin, attractive to spectators, which would be a great boost for football and the Eircom League. I am committed to the completion of the new soccer stadium in Tallaght, and I would support a similar development on Dublin's north side in an existing or new location. In that context, the FAI, is engaging in discussions with the main Dublin clubs to secure their agreement in principle to that concept and to identify the main issues arising to ensure its success.

I do not consider that any of the dealings relating to the company would be open to a successful legal challenge. The transitional provisions of the National Sports Campus Development Authority Bill 2006 ensure a smooth transfer between the company and the authority. One of those transitional provisions, section 38, confirms the power of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to hold and transfer shares in CSID.

FETAC's functions include the making and promoting of awards, the validating of programmes, monitoring and ensuring the quality of programmes and determining standards.FETAC published guidelines for providers in 2004 which set out a common framework for quality assurance which all providers must apply in a manner appropriate to their own context. That common framework requires providers to develop and document a series of policies and procedures capturing their existing best practice, complemented by an internal monitoring and evaluation system to recognise excellence and facilitate improvement.I understand that several providers of health and safety training have agreed quality assurance systems with FETAC and offer courses leading to FETAC awards.The Health and Safety Authority does not operate a system of accreditation for companies which provide classes and courses in regard to health and safety in the workplace, and I have no information regarding the provision of training for State companies by the company concerned in County Limerick.

However, it is necessary to use a software package to avail of that facility. A recent development is that companies have been able to appoint electronic filing agents since 1 December 2005. The further development of the on-line annual return facility is at an advanced stage and will be launched by mid 2006.Regarding the registration of new companies, it is currently possible to file company incorporation documents electronically with the Companies Registration Office by using CRODISK. However, CRODISK requires the paper application form to be filed in addition to the electronic version. The paper application form contains various signatures, including a statutory declaration of compliance which is necessitated by section 5(5) of the Companies (Amendment) Act 1983 and section 42(2) of the Companies (Amendment) (No.2) Act 1999. Statutory declarations were expressly excluded from the ambit of the Electronic Commerce Act 2000. A statutory declaration must accordingly be in written format, as this is required by the 1983 Act.The company law review group's first report included recommendations to facilitate easier registration of new companies and to facilitate electronic communications with customers by the Companies Registration Office. Those recommendations must be implemented to facilitate electronic filing of documents with the Company Registration Office, including on-line company registration.It is expected that the recommendations will be given effect by the Companies Consolidation and Reform Bill. I expect that the Bill will be published at the end of this year, and enactment is anticipated in 2007.

An updated version was made available on 10 April 2005 incorporating the new simplified provisions of the Redundancy Payments Act 2003.This was followed on 31 May 2005 by the introduction of a new on-line redundancy application system. On-line claims are processed more quickly than manual applications received by post, as they are automatically validated and recorded on the system. Since the service came into operation, the percentage of customers using the facility has increased to 40%, at February 2006, from an initial take-up of 12% in summer 2005.The easy-to-use calculation facility and the on-line redundancy application system are available on the home page of the Department's website at www.entemp.ie. Both employers and employees are strongly advised to use those facilities to ensure accuracy and ease of calculation, and quicker processing of rebate and lump-sum applications.

In those circumstances, a work permit may not be granted.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	938	According to the quarterly national household survey, the unemployment rate for the west region for the last quarter of 2005 was 4.3%. I also note that the live register recorded a decrease in Ballina from 1,574 to 1,421 over the 12-month period to January 2006.Support for job creation and investment in individual counties and regions is a day-to-day operational matter for the development agencies as part of their responsibility under the Industrial Development Acts. While I may give general policy directives to the agencies, I am precluded under the Industrial Developments Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I have been assured by the agencies under the remit of my Department that they are endeavouring to attract new investment, encourage the start-up of new businesses, the growth of existing businesses and the development of the labour market in County Mayo.IDA Ireland, the agency charged with the attraction of foreign direct investment, is actively marketing and promoting the linked hub towns of Ballina, Castlebar and Westport for new green-field investment. The agency is at an advanced stage in the acquisition of 27 acres of land on the Sligo Road in Ballina with a view to developing a high-quality business and technology park.As part of its regional development role, Enterprise Ireland works with other agencies in the county to develop the business infrastructure. The community enterprise centres operating in the county, which are part-funded through the agency, are designed to assist small new companies in their start-up phase.The Mayo County Enterprise Board approved a total of 23 projects in 2005 throughout the county, and five of those are in the Ballina area.FÁS also provides a range of programmes in the area to assist job-seekers to improve their skills and obtain employment.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by these agencies, together with the ongoing commitment by the Government to regional development and the national development plan, will bear fruit in investment and jobs for the people of Ballina and County Mayo.

Enterprise Ireland supports companies employing ten or more people and start-up companies with the potential to employ ten or more people and reach or exceed €1 million in exports over three years.The county enterprise boards have responsibility for companies that employ fewer than ten people, and provide a range of supports to companies that fall within their remit.Enterprise Ireland operates under policy directions given by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment or as specified by the Enterprise Ireland board. The key focus of Enterprise Ireland's policy is to work with indigenous companies which have the potential to develop sustainable export sales, and to qualify for support a company should demonstrate clear potential to do so. All projects have to be commercially viable and must be supported by a business plan. Every business development plan is considered on its individual merits.Enterprise Ireland has a wide range of supports for high-potential start-up companies, HPSUs. As part of its new strategy launched in May last year, Enterprise Ireland works more intensively with HPSUs at their initial start-up phase to accelerate their growth. Enterprise Ireland provides financial support to such client companies and assists them to build management capability and access Enterprise Ireland-supported seed and venture capital funding. In addition, Enterprise Ireland provides business advice and mentoring and assists HPSUs through its overseas network to develop their exports.Enterprise Ireland's range of supports for companies includes strategy development, production and operations, marketing, human resources development, finance and research and development. In addition, a wide range of support and knowledge is provided by specialists in Enterprise Ireland offices in Dublin and through its 33 offices worldwide. That independent support involves a range of services, including identifying new opportunities, providing market and technical information and promoting clients in Ireland and overseas.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	940	The labour inspectorate of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment is responsible for monitoring certain employment conditions for all categories of workers in Ireland, including immigrant workers. The inspectorate operates without any differentiation with regard to worker nationality, as statutory employment rights and protections apply to immigrant workers in exactly the same manner as they do to Irish workers.For the avoidance of doubt, section 20 of the Protection of Employees (Part-Time) Work Act 2001 provides that all employee protection legislation on the Statute Book in Ireland applies to workers posted to work in Ireland in line with Directive 96/71/EC of the European Parliament and Council of 16 December 1996.Section 20 of the 2001 Act also provides that all employee protection legislation applies to a person, irrespective of his or her nationality or place of residence, who has entered into a contract of employment that provides for his or her being employed in the State or who works in the State under a contract of employment. Thus all employment rights legislation applies to migrant workers engaged to work in Ireland under a contract of employment.Labour inspectors pursue allegations of worker mistreatment, and when evidence of non-compliance with the relevant employment rights legislation is found, the inspectorate seeks redress for the individual or individuals concerned and, if appropriate, a prosecution is initiated. Employers are required to maintain records in respect of such employees, and those records, together with other substantiating evidence, for example, a statement from an employee, provide the essentials of a basis for legal proceedings. Failure to maintain adequate records by an employer is an offence.It should be noted also that, in many cases, employment rights legislation has provisions whereby workers who believe that they have been denied their entitlements, or otherwise unfairly treated, can, as an alternative to dealing with the labour inspectorate, take the matter before a Commissioner in the Rights Commissioner Service of the Labour Relations Commission.I urge anyone who has evidence of the mistreatment of workers to furnish all the relevant details and any related materials to the inspectorate with a view to pursuing the matter.

FÁS has already been in contact with the company and is providing advice and training opportunities for the employees being made redundant. FÁS is making its full range of services available to the workers, which includes: top-level agreement with the company on responsibilities and actions; intensive interviews, individually and in groups, with affected workers that will outline the range of supports and services available; preparation of a skills analysis report by FÁS based on identified workers' needs and local opportunities; referral of affected workers to jobs, training courses or other opportunities; establishment of special or customised training courses where necessary; and ongoing support and action to keep redundant workers in touch with the labour market.The north-west region is a priority area for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland as the agencies continue to market this region strongly for new investment. On 9 March 2006, I announced the establishment of AssetCo in Buncrana, which it is hoped will lead to the creation of over 260 jobs in the next two to three years. Also, on 21 March 2006, I announced that Abbott, one of the world's largest health care companies, is to establish a manufacturing facility for its diabetes care products in Donegal town. The project will create 155 high-quality jobs, with over 45% requiring a third level qualification.

#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	945	Section 18 of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 deals with zero-hours contracts.Under that section of the Act, if an employee is required to work (a) a certain number of hours per week, the contract hours, or (b) as and when required by his or her employer, or (c) a combination of (a) and (b) above, but is not called to perform any work during the week, he or she is entitled to receive in the case of (a) above, the pay for 25% of the contract hours or the pay for 15 hours, whichever is the lesser, or in the case of (b) or (c) above, the pay for 25% of the hours of work done by another similar employee or the pay for 15 hours , whichever is the lesser.The employee is also due compensation as above if he or she works less than 25% of the contract hours or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser, or if he or she works fewer hours than that performed by another similar employee or 15 hours, whichever is the lesser. However, home help workers, given the nature of their work, would not normally have a comparator as described above.Nevertheless, if an employer does not compensate an employee for working what are termed zero-hours contracts as described above, but which include all three categories mentioned in the first paragraph above, it is open to an employee such as a home help worker to refer the matter to a rights commissioner for redress under the Act.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	946	Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a competitive and profitable European location from which to do business is a key priority for the Government, and the Department's enterprise support policies clearly reflect that commitment. Our economy is undergoing fundamental change, and while we are no longer a location of choice for basic, low-value-added manufacturing investment, we have developed different competitive strengths and advantages.Manufacturing faces particular challenges, but globalisation is creating significant opportunities for us, particularly in services. Our support packages to both foreign and indigenous companies have helped generate significant employment in the sector. Balanced economic policies have led to the creation of 268,000 more jobs between September-November 2000 and the same period in 2005 according to the CSO's quarterly national household survey. Financial and other business services accounted for 15,300 jobs alone in the year to the fourth quarter of 2005. That represents 17.7% of all new jobs created in that time. Meanwhile, research from the National Competitiveness Council shows that our total share of world services trade has increased remarkably, from 0.5% in 1997 to over 2% in 2004. This is far greater than would be expected for an economy of our size.The Department and its agencies are acutely aware of the imperative to help build firms of both scale and importance in higher-value-added sectors of global trade. Our focus is firmly concentrated on managing that transition with the best possible blend of policies to strengthen both national and firm-level competitiveness. Our response to the challenge is strategic, yet reflects the business needs of companies. The enterprise development agencies are promoting increased levels of investment in research, business-related technological development and innovation across all enterprise sectors. That will assist firms to produce improved, value-added products and services. In the longer term, that will provide more sustainable and higher-quality jobs.Innovations in the support package available to investors, such as changes to the taxation treatment for head office operations and research and development, are helping secure new forms of investment, as well as helping persuade foreign investors to allocate higher-value-added functions to their Irish operations. Those policy innovations clearly demonstrate the high priority that the Government accords to ensuring that Ireland aligns its business supports and competitive characteristics with the requirements of doing business here. They also show that our enterprise policies are both creative and flexible to capture the opportunities presented by globalisation.Following the policy prescriptions contained in the enterprise strategy group that I mandated, Enterprise Ireland was mandated to restructure its operations to support the competitive position of indigenous firms better. The outcome is being realised in Enterprise Ireland's new strategic direction to transform Irish industry, which was launched last year. Enterprise Ireland is developing closer relationships between Irish firms and third level colleges to increase levels of applied research. That will ensure that market-led innovation becomes an integral part of the competitive strategy of individual companies and strengthens Ireland's long-term competitiveness. The agency has also made changes to the organisation of its overseas offices so that market intelligence and new opportunities can be fed more effectively back to its client base. Those initiatives will expand the potential for Irish firms to extend their reach into global markets.

All the employees are temporary staff, and employment at the company reduces at this time of the year. While 75 temporary jobs have been lost, a similar number is usually recruited later in the year for the peak season.The company has confirmed that it is engaging in a study to assess the sourcing of its cosmetic and skin care products in Eastern Europe. No decisions have been made yet, and none is expected in the near future. The company faces ongoing competition from low-cost locations and is strongly focused on maintaining the competitive position of its operation in Nenagh.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	948	I propose to take Questions Nos. 427 to 432, inclusive, and 443 to 446, inclusive, together.IDA Ireland has statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to the mid-west region, except for the Shannon Free Zone, which falls within the remit of Shannon Development. Shannon Development is also responsible for supporting indigenous enterprises in the mid-west region, where it acts as agent for Enterprise Ireland.Responsibility for the provision of industrial property solutions within the mid-west region also lies with Shannon Development, and IDA Ireland works closely with Shannon Development in the promotion and marketing of those tailored property solutions. Initiatives undertaken by Shannon Development include the development of the Tipperary Technology Park in Thurles and the Ennis Information Age Park, two of the network of five such parks in the region. Shannon Development has also acquired a 29-acre site in Roscrea with a view to developing a business park appropriate to the needs of the area.The following tabular statement sets out the number of site visits in the period from 2000 to date in 2006 that were organised by IDA Ireland to locations in the mid-west region, together with the number of visits organised by Shannon Development in the Shannon Free Zone. During that period IDA Ireland organised a total of 147 itineraries, of which six were to Roscrea, five to Nenagh, and one to Thurles. None was recorded to Templemore, Newport or Borrisokane. In the same period, Shannon Development organised a total of 131 visits to the Shannon Free Zone.A central goal for IDA Ireland is the achievement of balanced regional development. The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the achievement of that goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in the linked gateway of Limerick and Shannon and hub locations of Ennis and Tralee to allow foreign direct investment needs to be met. In addition, north Tipperary is actively promoted by IDA Ireland as part of an integrated mid-west region. For IDA Ireland purposes, the mid-west region consists of Counties Clare, Limerick, north Tipperary and north Kerry.IDA Ireland's sectoral emphasis in the mid-west region is on attracting new knowledge-intensive projects in information and communications technology, globally traded businesses, medical technologies and life sciences.Shannon International Airport is a key asset that enhances the attractiveness of the area for FDI, and it continues to play a major role in the in the economic development of the mid-west region. However, the decision regarding where to locate is ultimately up to the individual investor, and clients looking at Ireland are often only willing to consider larger centres that have the scale, infrastructure and services capable of sustaining their investment.Shannon Development, in association with local authorities, is also spearheading the drive to bring high-speed Internet access to the region. Templemore, Nenagh and Roscrea have been scheduled as priority towns for phase 2 of the broadband roll-out programme. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has recently approved funding for metropolitan area networks to be installed in each town, which should assist in attracting FDI and indigenous industry. Newport has also been selected by Shannon Development as part of its eTowns pilot project, which aims to assist the renewal or improvement of smaller communities in multiple locations.I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland and Shannon Development in the mid-west region, together with the ongoing commitment by the Government to regional development, will bear fruit in investment and job creation for the mid-west region.Location2000200120022003200420052006Limerick1714151318192Clare4636310North Tipperary1191000North Kerry3412130Mid West Total2525282222232Year2000200120022003200420052006Number of visits3710192417222

BASIS stands for business access to state information and services. The BASIS project was concerned with encouraging and facilitating the on-line provision of public services, in particular to the business community.The primary initiative undertaken by the BASIS project was the development of the BASIS website, www.basis.ie, which was developed to provide a single point of access to public sector information and services that are relevant to the business community. There was an average of 200,000 visits to the site in each of the last three years, with 2.25 million pages viewed.Other activities undertaken by the BASIS project included the public services broker study which was commissioned by the BASIS project in 2001. This study examined the scope for delivering over the Internet public services to business. In addition, in 2001, the BASIS project procured and managed a joint project that defined a strategic framework for the management of content across the public sector. In addition, in 2002, as part of the development of the public services broker, the BASIS project carried out a feasibility study for candidate e-government services on a number of services identified through the public services broker study.The BASIS project from its inception in 2000 to the end of 2005 cost €4.18 million and was funded through the information society fund. The BASIS project concluded at the end of 2005 with the cessation of funding from the information society. An internal review of the BASIS project, undertaken in 2005, concluded that the project had fully discharged its obligations under the Government's information society action plan.In order to protect the investment made in a valuable resource to business, my Department will continue to maintain and develop the BASIS website. The Department will undertake this year a comprehensive review of the BASIS website to ensure that the service it provides continues to meet the needs of the business community.

The onus is on the customer to prove to the satisfaction of the deciding officer that he or she satisfies the conditions for receipt of payment, including that he or she is genuinely seeking full-time work on a consistent and ongoing basis.A deciding officer disallowed the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned from 21 February 2006 on the grounds that he was not genuinely seeking employment. In reaching this decision, the deciding officer took into account the two letters from employers submitted by the person concerned. However, the deciding officer took the view that he had failed to produce sufficient evidence to show that he is seeking work from employers who are most likely to be in a position to offer employment. It is open to the person concerned to appeal this decision and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 9 March 2006.Under social welfare legislation decisions in respect of claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in relation to decisions on individual claims.The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. From June 2006, an allowance of €120 is payable in respect of qualified children aged from two to 11 years, or €190 in respect of qualified children aged from 12 to 22 years. These rates were increased by €40 in budget 2006 from the previous rates of €80 and €150. Applications for BSCFA may be made between the beginning of June and the end of September each year.Back to school clothing footwear allowances are subject to a means test. They are not paid in cases where the household income exceeds the relevant income limit, regardless of the source of that income. A person may qualify for payment of a BSCFA if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education or training course, and have household income at or below certain specified levels. For example, in the case of a lone parent with one child, the income limit is €14.90 per week.While community employment, CE, is one of the qualifying schemes for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme, a person who has income both from one-parent family payment and community employment will not qualify on means grounds. However, a person in these circumstances is still significantly better off for having taken up a CE place. For example, a lone parent with one child is €182 per week better off on taking up a CE place, equivalent to €9,464 per annum, while a lone parent with two children is €191.30 per week better off, equivalent to more than €9,947 per annum. I recognise that child care expenses, where these are incurred, could reduce that net benefit.Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment. In this regard, a number of positive measures have been introduced in recent years to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These include special means disregards, tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase, and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.In January 2006, I provided for an improvement in the standard means test for BSCFA by increasing the income limits by €50. This is in addition to the budgetary increases on the primary social welfare rates. In budget 2006, I also improved the standard assessment rules governing the rent supplement scheme to ensure that a lone parent who takes up a training or employment opportunity will be financially better off having done so. For example, in 2006, participants on certain employment or training courses, such as a community employment scheme, will have the first €60 per week of additional income disregarded and will have half of any additional income between €60 per week and €90 per week also disregarded. In addition any PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. These arrangements fully support the objective of assisting social welfare recipients, including lone parents, in progressing into employment and becoming financially independent in their own right.

The national steering committee on violence against women is chaired by my colleague the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Frank Fahey, and includes representatives from the Departments of Health and Children, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Education and Science and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.The provision of local authority and voluntary housing and refuges for victims of domestic violence is a matter for my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Although my Department does not have direct responsibility in combating domestic violence, it does, through the Family Support Agency, have a number of schemes in place to support families generally.The Family Support Agency administers the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage, child and bereavement counselling and related services. It is also responsible for the direct provision of the national Family Mediation Service, which is a free, professional and confidential service for couples who have decided to separate and want to negotiate the terms of their separation.The agency is also responsible for the support and development of the network of family resource centres, FRCs, around the country. The aim of the family and community services resource centre programme is to combat disadvantage and improve the function of the family unit. The emphasis in the projects is on the involvement of local communities in developing approaches to tackle the problems faced in those communities and on creating successful partnerships between the voluntary and statutory agencies in the area concerned. Family resource centres involve people from marginalised groups and areas of disadvantage at all levels in the project.Under the family and community services resource centre programme, funding is given to a number of specialist support agencies to provide support and information to individual family resource centres on a number of issues. One such support agency funded under the programme is Women's Aid. In 2005, Women's Aid was awarded €93,800 to provide support and information to FRCs on women's issues and in particular in respect of women and their children who are being physically, emotionally and sexually abused in their own homes.

The Government is already committed to removing the retirement condition associated with the retirement pension so that people will not have to leave work before qualifying for a pension. In budget 2006, I announced the introduction of €100 weekly earnings disregard for recipients of non-contributory pensions which hopefully will encourage older people to work. The Pensions Board in its national pensions review has recommended allowing people to defer claiming the State contributory pension and in return to receive a higher pension when they decide to claim. I am examining how and at what stage it might be practical to introduce arrangements on these lines.However, issues surrounding social welfare payments represent, in my view, only one aspect of the problem. As I indicated at the publication of the national pensions review, we require a change in attitudes in relation to longer working from both employers and employees themselves. Employers should, where appropriate, seek to retain older employees and create the conditions which will make longer working both attractive and feasible for older workers.

This means test has been eased significantly over the years, most notably with the introduction of disregards of spouses' earnings.Following budget 2006, from April 2006, a couple with two children can earn up to €32,925 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance. The same couple will be able to earn up to €54,400 and receive the minimum rate of carer's allowance as well as the free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.The precise information requested by the Deputy is not readily available. However the following may be of assistance. The cost of the abolition of the means test is estimated at €140 million in a full year. It is debatable whether such a proposal could be considered to be the best use of resources. The view of some support organisations is that if this kind of money were available, it would be more beneficial to carers if it were invested in the type of community care services which would support them in their caring role, such as additional respite care facilities, more home helps, public health nurses and other such services.Of the current payments of carer's allowance, 91% are at the maximum rate and 9% at reduced rates. The rate of refusal for the allowance is 22% of all applications that were received in 2005.The reasons for refusal of the allowance are as follows and relate to 2005:%Full-time care not required96649Means exceeded the statutory limit19910Full-time care not being provided19310Carer working for more than 10 hours per week1065Habitual residence condition not satisfied583Other miscellaneous reasons45323Total refused in 20051,975100

Historically, most public servants did not pay full social insurance cover as their occupational pension arrangements were different from people outside the Civil Service and public service. Public servants employed after April 1995, however, pay full rate insurance contributions and their occupational pension arrangements have been adjusted to reflect this.The basic qualifying conditions for contributory pensions have been eased considerably, in recent years, pensions based on pre-1953 insurance have been introduced, and arrangements made to ensure that people with a mixture of insurance at full and modified rates may qualify for pro rata pensions based on the percentage of full rate contributions in their overall insurance record. Measures such as these can only be implemented in a context where people achieve a minimum standard of contributions, both in terms of the number and type of contributions paid.Some 133,000 people are insured in the three main modified insurance classes. In addition, there are some 88,000 public service pensioners, in addition to those from the semi-State sector, who were modified rate contributors during their working lives. Accordingly, proposals to allow Class D contributors to qualify for a state pension would have very costly and long-running implications for the social welfare pension system. There are no plans at present for further easing of the pension entitlement conditions.

The current development programme is an early step towards achieving, inter alia, a comprehensive system which would provide full advice to customers on all entitlements.It will take some years, however, for the Department to be in a position to provide a service as outlined by the Deputy. A range of supporting elements would have to be developed before the type of systems described could be designed.My Department has been engaged, since mid-2000, in the development and implementation of its service delivery modernisation, SDM, programme. SDM is a multi-annual programme of work involving the introduction of new technology and the replacement of legacy computer systems.It comprises business, organisation and technical streams and is designed to be implemented in self-contained and separately procured phases. The work involved includes the redesign of back office systems, business processes, procedures and work practices and the introduction of new organisational structures. The ICT systems put in place for this programme will provide a comprehensive and consistent approach to the treatment of the various scheme rules which exist. This would be a prerequisite for the kind of system envisaged.A second consideration regarding the provision of an interactive service to customers is the issue of security. If a system existed which was able to determine all entitlements for an individual, it would also need to ensure that only properly authorised individuals could access personal data. This is particularly important in the context of all such data being accessible through a single mechanism and is required by law, such as, the Data Protection Act, and, more importantly, is also dictated by customer service considerations.My Department is involved with the cross-departmental standard authentication framework environment, SAFE, programme which is addressing issues such as identity and security of access to public service systems. An early output from this programme will be the issue of a public service card commencing in 2007.Implementation of the SAFE programme will allow for secure registration and subsequent authentication of the people involved and is considered to be a prerequisite for on-line access to personal data. The Reach agency was set up to provide a public service broker, PSB, for use by all public service agencies and their customers, rather than providing dedicated access mechanisms for each agency.The first phase of development, which is now complete, uses services based on the individual's public services identity, PSI, to provide a level of registration or authentication facilities for customers. The PSB provides facilities for its users to interact with public service agencies through a consistent mechanism and will also provide common services such as data validation, payment services and documents of record.My Department is developing the technical infrastructure required to interact with the PSB. The SDM programme will provide the basis for the business services to be made available. Further work will be required to develop these in a manner that meets emerging industry and cross-agency standards.In summary, there is no dedicated interactive system in development to provide full and comprehensive advice to individuals although each of the components of such a system is undergoing major development. It will be some years before all are sufficiently complete to contribute to an overall solution, should it be decided to go in that direction. In any such system, great care and expertise would be needed to ensure that the benefit to an individual would outweigh the significant overhead which would be involved.

The agency administers the scheme of grants to voluntary organisations providing marriage counselling services, marriage preparation courses, child counselling services in respect of parental separation and bereavement counselling and support services on the death of a family member.The group applied for €1,500 for the provision of bereavement support and received a grant of €900 for this purpose. Overall, a total of €8.407 million was allocated in 2005 and some 547 organisations benefited from the scheme.A total of €9.008 million has been made available under the scheme this year. The scheme was advertised in the national and provincial papers on the week commencing 23 January. The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday, 24 February 2006. Some 540 applications have been received and are currently being processed.The group in question has not made an application for funding under the 2006 grants scheme.

These include the services of home helps, public health nurses and home care packages generally, which are a matter for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. In budget 2006, the Tánaiste announced a €150 million package in funding for 2006-07 for home support packages and other community-based services.Supports for carers from my own Department include the carer's allowance, which provides income support to people who are providing certain older people or people with a disability with full-time care and attention and whose incomes fall below a certain limit. Carer's allowance is payable from age 18.The respite care grant, also administered by my Department, is an annual payment for carers who look after certain people in need of full-time care and attention. The payment is made regardless of the carer's means but is subject to certain conditions. The respite care grant is payable from age 16. The value of the grant is €1,200 at June 2006.The long-term care working group was established by the Tánaiste and the Minister for Health and Children and by me in January 2005 to identify the policy options for a financially sustainable system of long-term care. The report of the working group is being considered by the Government.

In this regard all staff engaged in claims processing are concerned with preventing and detecting fraud and abuse.Controls are exercised at both the initial claim stage and at subsequent stages during the claim life-cycle. Claims are reviewed on a regular and targeted basis. However, the frequency with which reviews are carried out varies depending on the payment scheme and the individual's personal circumstances.For example means tested payments are reviewed at certain intervals or when there are indications that changes in circumstances have not been reported to the Department. Those in receipt of illness payments are called for a medical examination by the Department's medical assessors, at a frequency related to their illness or incapacity or at a time recommended by a medical assessor.Customers in receipt of unemployment payments are also checked on an ongoing basis to verify continued compliance with the requirements of being available for and genuinely seeking employment.Some 600 of my Department's staff at local, regional and national level are engaged on a full or part-time basis on work related to the control of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system. About half of these work full-time on control work, while the other half are responsible for routine investigations under the various schemes and for following up cases of suspected fraud where these are discovered. It is estimated that some 60% of the work of general inspectors is on control activity, including claim reviews. The remaining 40% would be devoted to new claim activity — this can also be regarded as within the broad framework of control.A special investigation unit, comprising about 80 staff spread throughout the country is involved in work which is specifically related to the investigation of employers and employees where fraud and abuse is suspected. These officers, some of whom work jointly with inspectors from the Revenue Commissioners, carry out inspections of employers in relation to their PRSI obligations as well as investigating cases where fraud or abuses of the schemes are suspected.Some 312,000 and 324,000 reviews of entitlements were carried out by my Department's staff in 2004 and 2005 respectively. In that period the records of some 12,300 employers were inspected to ensure compliance with the Department's regulations and, in particular, to prevent and detect abuses of the system. In the years 2004 and 2005, control savings of €386 million and €406 million respectively were achieved. In so far as costs are concerned the estimated salary costs in 2004 were in the region of €20.4 million and an additional €1.25 million was spent on travel, subsistence and overtime. The corresponding figures for 2005 are estimated at €21 million and €1.2 million respectively.Some 284 and 271 cases were finalised in the courts in 2004 and 2005 respectively. A total of 291 individuals were fined, 160 in 2004 and 131 in 2005. Fines totalling €140,819 were imposed by the courts in respect of these cases. Recoveries on overpayments amounted to €19.7 million in 2004 and €20.2 million in 2005, however statistics are not maintained in such as manner that they can be attributed to specific cases or individuals.I am committed to ensuring that social welfare payments are available to those who are entitled to them and that they are delivered in an effective and efficient way. I am also determined to ensure that abuse of the system is prevented and is dealt with effectively when detected and I will take whatever steps are necessary to achieve this.

Results for the second year of the survey, 2004, were published by the Central Statistics Office, CSO, on 12 December 2005. The survey results do not break down poverty rates by county, as the survey sample size is too small. The survey does, however, provide a regional breakdown, by Border, midlands and western region and by southern and eastern region, as defined in the nomenclature of territorial units, NUTS 2, classification used by EUROSTAT. The results, broken down by gender and by age group, are provided in the following table 1.When EU-SILC results for 2005 are available the CSO will be examining the possibility of providing a further breakdown of the data by each of the eight regional authorities established under local government legislation. This breakdown would correspond to the EUROSTAT NUTS 3 classification.The report, Mapping Poverty: National, Regional and County Patterns, published last year by the Combat Poverty Agency, does provide some data by local authority area.The report states that sampling factors limit the extent to which the data can be reliably broken down by county and concludes that, while it might be possible to do this, "it would not be sensible to do so because of the wide margin of error associated with the figures". The breakdown of poverty data by local authority area is provided in the following table 2. This data is not fully comparable with the data provided under the EU-SILC survey because of survey differences relating to such issues as how income and consistent poverty are measured.An analysis of the Combat Poverty Agency report shows disparities in the incidence of poverty risk by local authority area, with the highest incidence being recorded in the Border and western regions. Exploring the reasons for such spatial variations, the report found little evidence of a causal relationship between poverty and location per se. It found rather that the main factors determining poverty relate to the socio-economic composition of households, which in turn were influenced by structural factors such as lack of education, low-paid work, unemployment or non-participation in the labour force.The higher percentage levels of poverty in certain regions are also in part explained by the lower proportions of those who are well off in those regions, compared to other mainly urban regions. This is due mainly to the availability of more higher paid jobs in urban regions and currently to a younger working population. The differing levels of house prices between regions are another indicator of these phenomena.The differences in the incidence of poverty between regional and local areas highlights the need for a more regional and local focus in the context of the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion. This focus should result in a more effective use of resources and better outcomes overall. I welcome the fact that social inclusion plans have already been developed by some local authorities, with more in the process of being developed. The local development social inclusion programme is another important element in the development of this approach.Building on the progress already made in this regard, it is my intention that a strong regional and local focus will be a major feature of the next national action plan for 2006 to 2008 due for issue in September next.“At risk of poverty”Consistent PovertyBMW RegionS&E RegionBMW RegionS&E RegionTotal26.117.28.66.2Male24.415.88.25.5Female27.818.58.96.90-14 yrs28.019.112.08.815-64 yrs24.315.48.55.965+ yrs31.325.2*3.1The source of this data was the CSO 2005.

Under his department's rural water programme, grants are available through the county councils for the upgrading and improvement of a quality deficient private group water scheme supply or the improvement of a private individual supply in cases where an alternative public or group scheme supply is not readily available.Under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which is administered on my behalf by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive, an exceptional needs payment may be made to help meet an essential, once-off cost which the applicant is unable to meet out of his or her own resources. There is no automatic entitlement to this payment. Each application is determined by the executive based on the particular circumstances of the case. Exceptional needs payments are subject to a means test. Eligible people would normally be in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment.A person whose water supply is contaminated should contact his or her local authority in the first instance with a view to having the cause of the problem addressed. If a person has an exceptional income need due to the contamination of his or her domestic water supply, he or she should contact his or her local community welfare office if he or she wishes to apply for assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme

The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence or centre of interest is deemed to be other than in this State or the common travel area has no entitlement to certain social welfare payments, including supplementary welfare allowance.The question of what is a person's habitual residence for social welfare purposes is decided in accordance with European Court of Justice case law. The condition is not determined on the basis of citizenship, nationality, immigration status or any other extraneous factors.The Health Service Executive was contacted regarding this case and has advised that the person concerned was refused a rent supplement on the grounds that he did not satisfy the habitual residency condition and accordingly payment of a rent deposit was not considered. However, given his particular situation a once-off exceptional needs payment of €256 was paid by the executive to the person concerned to assist with arrears of his hostel payments. If the person in question is not satisfied with the decision to refuse his claim for rent supplement it is open to him to appeal this decision to the designated appeals officer within the Health Service Executive.

The pensions services office in Sligo administers a number of schemes, including old age contributory and non-contributory pension and retirement pension, and there is a specific lo-call number which may be used to make inquiries about any of the schemes administered from this office.There is currently a total of 16 staff assigned to the dedicated phone banks in the office to deal with inquiries made via the lo-call number. There is a target in place which stipulates that calls should be answered within 30 seconds. Available statistics indicate that these targets are met in general. However, there can be delays at times when the service is particularly busy, for example, after budget announcements and in the run-up to Christmas and similar times of high pressure.The position regarding phone response is kept under ongoing review and as part of the extension of the Department's service delivery modernisation, SDM, programme later this year, further improvements to the telephone service are planned. An additional lo-call number and additional telephone answering staff will be provided for the retirement and old age contributory pension sections, and a team of back-up phone answering staff will be available to provide support when call volumes are very high. The telephone service will continue to be kept under review and appropriate improvements will continue to be made as circumstances permit.

From this the scheme allows up to 20 years spent caring for children or incapacitated adults to be disregarded when a person's social insurance record is being averaged for pension purposes. However, the scheme will not of itself qualify a person for a pension. The standard qualifying conditions, which require a person to enter insurance ten years before pension age, have a minimum of 260 paid contributions and achieve a yearly average of at least ten contributions on his or her record from the time he or she enters insurance until he or she reaches pension age, must also be satisfied.As the Deputy will be aware, the social welfare system comprises two types of pension: contributory pensions based on social insurance contributions and non-contributory pensions, payment of which are subject to a means test. Within that basic structure, the Government is anxious to ensure that as many people as possible can qualify for pensions in their own right.A number of measures have been introduced over the years which make it easier for people to qualify for contributory pensions. These include the reduction in the yearly average number of contributions required for pension purposes from 20 to ten and the introduction of special half-rate pensions based on pre-1953 insurance contributions. Pro rata pensions are also available to allow people with mixed-rate insurance records to receive a payment. This set of measures is of particular benefit to women who may have less than complete social insurance records due to working in the home.There are, of course, those who will not benefit from the home-maker's scheme and who cannot qualify for a pension in their own right. In this regard, the Government is committed to increasing the payment for qualified adults — age 66 or over — to the same level as the personal rate of the old age — non-contributory — pension and to facilitate the direct payment of the allowance to spouses and partners.On the non-contributory pension, in budget 2006 I made changes to the income disregards allowed under the means test. The basic income disregard was increased by €12.40 per week to €20 and I also introduced an earnings disregard of €100 per week. These allowances are doubled in the case of couples and will allow more people to qualify for social welfare pensions.I will continue to look for ways, within the current social welfare structure, in which the needs of older people who are at present outside the social welfare pensions system may be addressed further.

Neither I nor my Department has any function in decisions on individual claims.Under standard supplementary welfare allowance rules, rent supplements are normally calculated to ensure that a person, after the payment of rent, has an income equal to the rate of supplementary welfare allowance appropriate to their family circumstances less a minimum contribution, currently €13, which recipients are required to pay from their own resources. Many recipients pay more than €13 because they are also required, subject to income disregards, to contribute any additional assessable means that they have over and above the appropriate basic supplementary welfare allowance rate towards their accommodation costs.The executive has advised that the person concerned had been awarded a rent supplement payment of €826.90 per month based on her income from her one parent family payment and maintenance. However, on re-examination, the executive now advises that this rate of supplement is incorrect and that the correct rate of rent supplement payable in this case is €904.50 per month. The executive has further advised that this new rate of payment will be payable from the next payment date and arrears due, if any, will issue as soon as possible.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	990	The Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999 to 2004 provide, in accordance with EU directives on driving licences, that a person who holds a driving licence issued by the competent authority of a member state of the European Union or of the European Economic Area may drive any vehicle of the category in respect of which the licence has been granted for the period for which the licence has effect or alternatively on taking up residence in Ireland may exchange that driving licence for an Irish licence.Non-EU citizens who are temporary visitors to Ireland and who hold a national driving licence or an international driving permit may drive here any vehicle of the category in respect of which the licence or permit has been granted for the duration of their visit. In this regard temporary may be regarded as a period not exceeding 12 months. An "international driving permit" means a valid and properly completed international driving permit issued to a visitor under the convention of 1949 by the competent authority of the state in which he or she resides, or by an association duly empowered by such an authority to issue such a permit.Australia, Isle of Man, Japan, Jersey, South Africa, South Korea and Switzerland are recognised states for the purpose of driving licence exchange under the terms of Article 30(7) of the Road Traffic (Licensing of Drivers) Regulations 1999. Under these regulations, persons holding a valid driving licence from a recognised state may exchange their licence for an Irish driving licence when they take up residence here, without the need for a driving test. The testing and licensing regimes in these countries are considered to be equivalent in standard to our system. Other non-EU citizens taking up Irish residence must undergo the driver theory test, obtain a provisional licence and pass the driving test in order to obtain a driving licence.

Last summer I approved a Dublin Transportation Office — DTO — strategy for rail-based park and ride, which envisages facilities at 22 locations on the existing and proposed rail network within the greater Dublin area — GDA.This year, under Transport 21, I have indicated that €5 million in capital funding is being made available for suitable park and ride projects in the GDA. Arrangements for rail-based park and ride funding will also extend to public transport interchange projects. Capital funding for pilot bus-based park and ride projects will also be considered. There will be no revenue support to subsidise operating costs of park and ride facilities.Applications by public bodies for funding for specific park and ride projects will be considered by my Department on a first come, first served basis. They will be evaluated according to their business cases and against the strategic value they offer, as assessed against the DTO strategy.No specific proposals have as yet been received by my Department for implementation of park and ride facilities in County Kildare during 2006.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	993	Section 16 of the Road Transport Act 1999 provides for on the spot fines in lieu of prosecution for offences under the Road Transport Acts and EU drivers hours and working time regulations. The commencement of this section has been the subject of discussions with the Attorney General’s office and the advice now is that a new enabling provision in primary legislation is required to ensure compatibility with current fixed penalty charges legislation. I propose to include such a provision in the new Road Traffic Bill, which is currently being prepared in my Department.This would provide the basis for introduction of the proposed fines system by ministerial regulations. The system will apply to operators and drivers of heavy goods and passenger vehicles where breaches of the legislation are detected. Depending on the nature and extent of the infringements, offenders may be given the option of paying a fixed penalty charge rather than face prosecution through the courts.

The most recent report, now entitled Road Collision Facts, relates to 2004 and is available in the Oireachtas Library and on the NRA website.As I outlined recently on the Committee Stage debate of the Driver Testing and Standards Authority Bill, the Road Safety Authority, as it will now be called, will take on responsibility for road safety research and statistical collection. This will result in a more integrated approach to road safety policy generally, with one agency responsible for road safety research, statistical data, advertising, education and recommendations regarding road safety policy.

Iarnród Éireann operates two fare structures: a Dublin commuter area, which encompasses Balbriggan, Maynooth, Hazelhatch and Kilcoole; and the national network.With the dramatic growth in longer distance commuting, issues have arisen in fare arrangements between the commuter and national areas. These issues are most relevant around the boundary areas of the fare structures. Iarnród Éireann has informed me that it intends undertaking a thorough review of ticketing and fare practices, which will be wide-ranging and will encompass this issue among others.

At present, the applicant is required to sign a label on the application form, which is detached and applied to the licence. In addition, certain applications must be accompanied by medical or eyesight reports and other documentation such as certificates of competency and theory test certificates which are not available on-line. Issues of identity also arise and developments in this area will be subject to advanced features of the public services broker being developed under the Reach initiative which will allow the capture of digital photographs, secure digital signatures, scanned-in eyesight/medical certificates and so forth.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	999	The Government's ports policy statement, launched in January 2005, aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs.One of the key challenges that lie ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.As an initial step in this process, the Department consulted with the commercial ports handling unitised trade, to determine their view of port capacity and how they intended to deal with the projected capacity requirement. Drogheda Port Company responded in this regard with information on its proposal to develop a new port facility at Bremore in north County Dublin.In addition, in September 2005 the Department appointed a firm of consultants expert in this field, Fisher Associates, to invite detailed project submissions from the commercial ports. Fisher Associates has recently received these submissions and will finalise its report over the coming months. I can inform the Deputy that a submission was received from Drogheda Port Company on its Bremore proposal.The purpose of this process is to satisfy the Government that the anticipated capacity requirement to 2014 and beyond can be efficiently and adequately met through the successful advancement and implementation by the port sector of some combination of the key projects. The process is being closely co-ordinated with other relevant Departments through a steering committee that includes representatives of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Finance.

The policy statement reiterated the view that these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, where this is not possible, that sale to the private sector will be considered. In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists consideration will be given to bringing them under the control of a port company.My Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and harbour authorities, having regard to local requirements in each case.Baltimore and Skibbereen Harbour is a candidate for transfer to local authority control. As the harbour is situated in the functional area of Cork County Council, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government requested the council to undertake an overall assessment of the potential of the harbour for transfer. This report has been received and is currently being assessed.The limited resources available in my Department for expenditure on regional harbours are being concentrated on public safety works pending the transfer of the harbours.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	New speed limit structures were introduced in January 2005 under the Road Traffic Act 2004. These included the application of a default speed limit of 80 km/h to rural non-national regional and local roads and a default of 50 km/h to all classes of roads, except motorways, in built-up areas.The Road Traffic Act 2004 empowers county and city councils to make special speed limit by-laws for the purpose of applying a special speed limit in lieu of a default speed limit and empowered the Minister for Transport to issue guidelines for the application of special speed limits. I exercised this power in April 2005 and issued guidelines to road authorities.The county and city councils may review the maximum speed limit that applies to each stretch of non-national road in their area, can determine that the limit be increased or decreased at any particular location and can facilitate that determination through the inclusion of an appropriate provision in by-laws.The review and determination of what speed limit should apply at particular locations on non-national roads in lieu of a default speed limit are matters for the elected members of city and county councils and the Minister for Transport has no statutory power to issue instructions or directions in this regard. I am not satisfied that all local authorities have considered exercising their powers in this area and I recently wrote to every city and county manager in the country seeking a report on the matter.

This includes the provision of reading assistance and voice-over audio with an extended time slot for the test.The test is based on a question bank, which has been developed, inter alia, in consultation with the Association for Children and Adults with Learning Difficulties and the National Adult Literacy Agency. The question bank is available in book format or as a CD which includes voice-over audio.The test standard applies to all candidates and special allowances cannot be made in any particular case regardless of the circumstances.In the case of the practical driving test, where a candidate notifies my Department of the existence of a disability, it is the practice to assign the test to a supervisory driver tester who has more time to conduct the test.

In general, a car should be driven over ramps at a speed and in a manner which does not cause undue discomfort to the occupants, or undue strain on the car. Neither should the car be driven at an unnecessarily slow speed.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1011	The Government Road Safety Strategy 2004-2006 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998 to 2003 period. Achievement of the target would result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target which will require the continued commitment to a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.However, the recent increase in road deaths is a cause of concern and places the challenge of meeting the target set for the end of 2006 into stark focus. As of 21 March, 85 people had lost their lives on our roads this year, compared to 88 at the same date last year.Progress depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas of the strategy.Significant initiatives identified in the strategy that have been realised to date include the introduction of a new system of metric speed limits through the passage of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and the establishment of the new Garda traffic corps. The new speed limits structure featured a reduction in the speed limit in all rural, regional and local roads from 60 mph to 80 km/h, which equates to 50 mph. The establishment of the dedicated traffic corps in 2004 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under a distinct management structure under the command of an assistant commissioner addresses a particular commitment given by the Government. The corps, when it is fully staffed, will provide the basis for the achievement of the significant gains in road safety that emanate from consistent high levels of traffic law enforcement.Other major proposals identified in the strategy such as the plans to establish a system of private sector operation of speed cameras under the auspices of the Garda, the further extension of the operation of the penalty points and fixed charge systems, and the question of the introduction of a more general basis for the carrying out of preliminary roadside alcohol testing of drivers are being advanced.I will bring forward legislation during the current Dáil session for the purpose of extending the basis for which a roadside breath test can be requested and also to provide a statutory basis for the engagement of private sector interests in the operation of a speed camera programme under the direct control and guidance of the Garda. I have also recently announced the extension of the penalty points system from the existing five offences to 35 offences in early April. The emphasis of this extension is on offences that relate to driver behaviour which is the greatest single contributory factor in road collisions.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1012	The Road Traffic Acts establish a range of offences and penalties that can be applied for breaches of legislation. These range from the payment of a fixed charge or an on the spot fine in respect of specified offences in lieu of court proceedings to a fine, imprisonment or driver disqualification on conviction in court.The enforcement of offences established under the Road Traffic Acts is the responsibility of the Garda and, in respect of a limited range of parking and other offences, of traffic wardens or persons authorised by local authorities. I have no direct role in the enforcement of offences.The Road Traffic Acts provide for a range of penalties which consist of maximum financial penalties in respect of all offences and terms of imprisonment in respect of certain offences. Unless a penalty is expressly specified in respect of a particular offence in the Road Traffic Acts, the general penalty applies. This is a maximum fine of €800 for a first offence and a maximum of €1,500 for a second or subsequent offence. Where a third or subsequent offence is committed within any period of 12 consecutive months, the court can impose a maximum fine of €1,500 and-or up to three months imprisonment.The vast majority of the financial penalties which apply under the Road Traffic Acts were revised in 2002, and details of the monetary penalty in respect of each statutory provision are set out in section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. The level of fine that may be imposed in any individual case is at the discretion of the courts. Details of monetary penalties set post-2002 are contained in section 2 of the Road Traffic Act 2003, in sections 18, 19, 23, 30 and 34 of the Road Traffic Act 2004 and in section 138 of the Railway Safety Act 2005.

A number of developments took place following receipt of tenders and the proposals were reviewed in the light of these developments. These developments included developments concerning anti-fraud protection measures, possible developments in e-government and the publication of a draft EU directive on driving licences in October 2003 proposing the issuing of new licences in plastic card format only and allowing the introduction of an optional microchip on the driving licence. Having considered these matters it was decided not to proceed with the tender invitation of 16 June 2003. The EU directive and the specification of a microchip have not yet been agreed. The overall proposal is being reviewed to take account of these developments.

The issue of speed differential between vehicles travelling on a motorway is a factor behind this policy in that these three categories of vehicles are subject to a maximum ordinary speed limit of 80 kph whereas the default maximum speed limit for other vehicles driving on motorways is 120 kph.The term "obstruction" is not defined in article 33. Article 5 of the 1997 regulations, as substituted by Article 5 of the Road Traffic (Traffic and Parking) (Amendment) Regulations 1978, SI No. 274 of 197, provides that the regulations "shall apply save where compliance is not possible as a result of an obstruction to traffic or pedestrians or because of an emergency situation confronting a road user which could not reasonably have been expected or anticipated".

The station will be constructed at a location north of Sheriff Street, adjacent to the east side of the Royal Canal. The station, when operational at end 2007, will cater for additional commuter services on the Maynooth line and, critically, will cater for all services on the proposed Dunboyne spur, due for completion in 2009. The station will be conveniently accessed from the stop at Spencer Dock on the proposed Luas line extension from Connolly Station. The distance from the new station to the nearest stop on the proposed Luas extension, Spencer Dock, is approximately 350 metres. The final stop on the proposed new Luas line will be at the Point Depot, which will be approximately 850 metres from the new Iarnród Éireann station.The Railway Procurement Agency has submitted a railway order application for this Luas extension and I have appointed an inspector to conduct a public inquiry into that application. Given that a major focus of Transport 21 is the integration of services of various modes, I understand that Iarnrod Eireann and the RPS are in discussion to ensure optimum integration between Luas and commuter rail services.

By upgrading the signalling system, the project will deliver additional train paths per direction per hour in the critical city centre area. Funding has already been provided to Irish Rail to establish a project design office and to carry out preliminary planning and design work necessary to progress the project.I understand from Irish Rail that the preliminary design work is under way and I expect to receive proposals on the resignalling project later in 2006. The project is due to be completed in 2009. It is expected that construction on the Docklands station will be completed and open for services by the end of next year.

The Commission for Taxi Regulation has proposed to my Department an amendment to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 to provide for the licensing of such companies by the commission. This proposal is being considered, as well as any amendments to the Taxi Regulation Act 2003, which this may entail.I understand from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment that all companies must comply with the requirements of the Companies Acts 1963 to 2005. Similarly, all companies, including taxi dispatch companies, are subject to any general requirements that exist in regard to tax compliance, insurance and, where appropriate, the licensing of communications equipment.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	I propose to take Questions Nos. 524 to 526, inclusive, together.The framework at European level in regard to compulsory periodic roadworthiness testing of motor vehicles is set down in EU Directive 96/96/EC. The directive specifies the categories of vehicles liable to testing, the minimum frequency of testing of vehicles, the items that have to be tested and the arrangements for testing. The directive requires that a vehicle liable to roadworthiness testing must be tested in the member state in which it is registered and that the proof of passing a roadworthiness test issued by that member state must be recognised in other member states. These provisions are set out in Articles 1 and 3 of the directive. The directive has been implemented in relation to the roadworthiness testing of motor cars in Ireland by means of the Road Traffic (National Car Test) Regulations 2003.The directive does not contain provisions to enable a member state, irrespective of the circumstances involved, to require a vehicle registered in another member state to be made subject to a roadworthiness test in its territory for the purposes of the directive. To do so would be contrary to Internal Market rules for road transport in facilitating the free circulation of vehicles within the EU. However, motor vehicles brought into Ireland from abroad, other than those brought in temporarily by visitors, must be registered with the Revenue Commissioners by the end of the next working day following their arrival in the State. Once a vehicle has been registered by the Revenue Commissioners, it becomes liable to roadworthiness testing in accordance with Irish law.My Department has no record of having received notifications in accordance with Article 3 of Directive 96/96/EC from the most recent accession member states and is not familiar with the precise arrangements in place in those member states for the enforcement of the directive's requirements. However, given that the directive requires member states to ensure vehicles passing roadworthiness tests in their jurisdictions for the purposes of the directive are issued with proof of such status, it is open to a member state to require a driver of a vehicle, regardless of the member state in which it is registered, to produce the proof of roadworthiness for the vehicle to establish its roadworthiness status vis-à-vis the directive’s requirements. There is no evidence available to my Department to suggest that there is a particular problem in compliance with the directive’s requirements by non-Irish EU registered vehicles using Irish roads.An extensive range of requirements must be satisfied to use a motor vehicle in a public place in Ireland regardless of the country of registration of the vehicle. In that regard, all cars are required to comply with statutory requirements relating to the construction, equipment and use of vehicles as set out in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 2002, the Road Traffic (Construction and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 2003 to 2004, and the Road Traffic (Lighting of Vehicles) Regulations 1963 to 1996. The use of a vehicle in contravention of these regulations, regardless of its country of registration, would constitute an offence and leave a person open to prosecution under road traffic law.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1032	Section 18 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 imposes a specific requirement on persons not to use a vehicle liable to roadworthiness testing unless it has a valid test certificate. To assist car owners to comply with this requirement, National Car Testing Service Limited, NCTS, contacts car owners in advance of the test due date for their vehicle and provides them with a provisional NCT test appointment. The offer of a provisional appointment is undertaken by the company as a customer service measure and unless the car owner confirms the appointment within a particular timeframe it is automatically cancelled. Given that the requirement to have a valid test certificate applies in relation to the use of a vehicle and not solely on the age of a vehicle, it is not possible to state accurately the number of vehicles that are required to undergo a NCT in a particular year.Data on the roadworthiness testing status of a vehicle are recorded on the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, which is maintained by the vehicle registration unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Following the issue of a test certificate for a vehicle by NCTS, data in relation to the certificate are transmitted electronically to the vehicle registration unit for inclusion in the file for the vehicle concerned. I understand that the Garda has access to the NVDF for the purposes of enforcement of road traffic law. While there is no systematic transfer of data between NCTS and the Garda, I could see no difficulty in NCTS making available to the Garda data held by the company concerning vehicles were it to request such information for the purposes of enforcing road traffic legislation.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	When the Government reached a decision last May on the company's need for access to equity, it decided that the investment should not come from the Exchequer. The Government's strategic aim for Aer Lingus is to ensure the company has access to sufficient resources over the long term to enable it to compete successfully, to develop its business as market opportunities emerge and also to ensure it has the strength in its balance sheet to withstand the industry downturns and external shocks that are recognised features of the aviation industry. This requires that the company has ongoing access to capital on the same basis as its main competitors.In principle, a State investment in a State company made in accordance with the so-called "market economy investor principle" is capable of surviving a challenge under the European Union's state aid rules. In practice the application of this principle is not straightforward and it cannot be assured that an investment in Aer Lingus could be made in accordance with this principle as and when required. The Commission's guidelines published in 1994 concerning the application of the treaty provisions concerning state aids in the aviation sector states the following in the conclusion of its introduction:"An important element in the Commission's judgement will be the fact that the company has already been granted State aid (see Chapter V). Therefore the Commission will not allow further aid unless under exceptional circumstances, unforeseeable and external to the company. Moreover, given the fact that Article 222 of the Treaty is neutral with regard to property ownership, the Commission cannot impose the privatisation of an airline as a condition of the State aid. However, the participation of private risk sharing capital will be taken into account in the Commission's analysis."It will be recalled that a State investment in the company was made in accordance with the 1993 "Cahill Plan". State investment in Aer Lingus could, therefore, be expected to be the subject of a particularly critical appraisal by the European Commission.In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of 2001 and the ensuing aviation industry downturn, it was clear from contacts with the European Commission that the prospect of approval for a Government investment to support the survival plan was remote, even though it was argued that there were compelling reasons that an investment would satisfy the market economy investor principle. The following points were made in legal advice given by the Attorney General in 2001 on a possible investment in Aer Lingus: no state aid, no matter what its form, may be given to Aer Lingus without prior Commission approval; if the Commission is to be satisfied that an investment by the Government would have been made by a private investor and would therefore not be a state aid, it would be advisable to have a fully reasoned report by a reputable expert on investment in the airline industry supporting such a case; and giving Aer Lingus state aid without Commission approval could lead, in a matter of weeks, to an injunction either by the Commission or by the High Court for repayment of the aid with interest.It is clear the rules relating to state aid are complex and that there are particular issues of approval and susceptibility to legal challenge that do not obtain in private sector investments. Even if a particular investment by the Government in Aer Lingus were to withstand scrutiny, there could be no guarantee that this would always be the case. This absence of certainty on access to funds creates, of itself, a hindrance to effective business planning. In these circumstances, even if competing priorities facilitated Exchequer investment in Aer Lingus, the possibility of an investment being made by the Government as and when needed without raising state aid concerns would be far less certain than would be the case if the company could access investment through the equity markets.

The strategy contains 108 individual actions, under the five pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies. My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, which were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin, and for the work of the ten regional drugs task forces which were established in those areas not covered by a LDTF. More than €125 million has been allocated to the LDTFs to implement their two rounds of local action plans. A further €13.66 million has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects.In addition, approximately €99 million has been allocated to support the work of the young people's facilities and services fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres. The main aim of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse. A sum of €5 million has been allocated to enable the RDTFs to kick start the implementation of their regional plans and I envisage that this sum will rise incrementally over the coming years to an annual allocation of more than €12 million.The Deputy will be pleased to know that the current year's allocation available to my Department for expenditure on drugs issues is €43 million, which represents a substantial 37% increase on the 2005 initial allocation and a huge increase of 61% on the 2004 figure. Tackling the drug problem is a key Government priority and appropriate resources will continue to be allocated for that purpose.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	The national advisory committee on drugs and the drug and alcohol information and research unit, Northern Ireland, commissioned the first drug prevalence survey, the purpose of which was to establish the population prevalence of drug use on the island of Ireland, in 2002-03. This study surveyed more than 8,000 people aged between 15 and 64 in Ireland and Northern Ireland between October 2002 and April 2003 and examined the prevalence of a number of drugs.Expressions of interest from potential tenderers have been sought for a second population drug prevalence survey. It is intended that the drug prevalence study fieldwork will be carried out from late 2006 to mid-2007. Preliminary analysis will be carried out in the months following, with a first report of national prevalence figures and trends expected in late 2007. As we have the baseline information in place from the first survey, the findings of this survey should prove very informative, giving valuable information on trends that can feed into drugs policy formulation going forward.I am confident the existing framework can facilitate the recognition and tackling of growth in the use of illegal drugs. The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 addresses the problem of drug misuse across a number of pillars — supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research — and implementation of the strategy across a range of Departments and agencies is co-ordinated by my Department. The mid-term review of the national drugs strategy was published in June 2005. This report was the culmination of a comprehensive review, which included extensive consultation with Departments and agencies, the community and voluntary sectors and the public. I am pleased the review steering group found that the current aims and objectives of the drugs strategy are fundamentally sound.There have been encouraging signs of progress over the past few years — be it in the areas of drug seizures, the expansion of treatment services, prevention programmes in schools or the establishment of the regional drugs task forces. While not underestimating the scale of the problem, I am confident that we will continue to make progress through a process of co-operation and partnership.

Through the CLÁR programme, my Department continues to address depopulation, as well as the decline and lack of services in rural areas. The programme funds or co-funds, together with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These investments support physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures and reflect the priorities identified by the communities. In 2005, expenditure under the programme amounted to €13.443 million.I am considering a review of the CLÁR areas. In this regard, I have commissioned a further analysis based on the 2002 population census data to assist me in examining this matter. Until the review is complete and the results analysed, I cannot say what, if any, expansion will be made to the programme. My Department also funds a range of other programmes including the Leader programme, the rural social scheme and Gaeltacht and island schemes, which address rural depopulation in a general way through key interventions and supports. Information on these programmes is available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.The rural settlement policy framework set out in the national spatial strategy aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing published by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, provide a more detailed framework for planners, based on the national spatial strategy's comments on rural housing policy. The policy framework provided by these initiatives addresses many of my concerns on rural housing and complements my Department's strategic vision for rural communities.

This compensation, which will be incorporated in the existing single payment scheme, is worth approximately €123 million to Irish beet growers over the next seven years.The agreement also provides for compensation by way of a restructuring scheme in the event of a decision to cease sugar production. Under this scheme, a restructuring fund becomes available for the economic, social and environmental costs of restructuring of the sugar industry including factory closure and renunciation of quota. In Ireland's case, this would be worth up to €145 million. The fund is subject to the submission of a detailed restructuring plan for the industry. The agreement provides that at least 10% of the restructuring fund shall be reserved for sugar beet growers and machinery contractors. That proportion may be increased by member states after consultation of interested parties, provided that an economically sound balance between the elements of the restructuring plan is ensured.The reform agreement also provides for diversification funds, which would be worth almost €44 million to Irish growers in the event that sugar beet production completely ceases.

A single payment application was received on 16 May 2005. The person named did not declare any hectares on his application form. Under the relevant EU legislation, in order to draw down payment in respect of single payment entitlements, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions.However, the submission of the application form means that the person named has activated his entitlements and these will not be surrendered to the national reserve. If the person named is actively farming and declares sufficient lands on his 2006 single payment application, he will be in a position to claim full entitlements for this year.

Payment under the single payment scheme will issue shortly, following processing of this documentation.While the entitlements established by the person named were established under the old herd number, the 2005 SPS application submitted by him was under the new herd number, thus the necessity for an administrative transfer of the entitlements from the old to the new herd number.I am anxious that farmers are given every opportunity to activate their entitlements, hence the letter referred to by the Deputy, which suggested that entitlement holders who appeared not to have submitted an application under the 2005 single payment scheme might forfeit those entitlements to the national reserve. In this specific case, the transfer referred to above will resolve the situation and, therefore, the entitlements in question will not be lost to the national reserve by the person named.

There are a number of e-services available to clients at present which can be accessed via the Department website at www.agriculture.gov.ie.
IMap/SPS provides access, from 2001 onwards, once the applications are fully processed, to the single payment scheme or area aid scheme information, including: summary application details, parcel details and arable payment inquiry; document inquiry showing scanned images of area aid correspondence with the Department, all of which may be printed; colour mapping for land parcels, which also may be printed; and payment details.AIM provides access to the animal identification and movement system, including: calf birth registration facility, which allows for registration of calf births on-line; herd profile inquiry, which gives details of animals in the herd on CMMS, as well as movements in and out of the herd; and a compliance certificate facility, which allows for on-line application for CMMS compliance certificates, which are required for certain animal movements.Future developments currently being examined by officials of my Department include facilities to allow farmers apply on-line for the single payment scheme and to allow farmers to check the ten-month end date for individual parcels, on-line. It is expected that this latter facility will be available shortly, while it is hoped that the on-line application facility will be available for the 2007 scheme.I strongly encourage clients of my Department to register on the web site, www.agriculture.gov.ie, for existing and future services by clicking on the e-services icon and following the simple instructions. Farmers can also contact the e-services helpdesk, lo-call number 1890 252 118, to register over the phone or to obtain a paper application. Applicants are provided with a personal access code, PAC, and password, for secure interaction with the Department. Once a client has registered for e-services, he or she will have access to all new facilities introduced by the Department that are applicable to his or her enterprise. As well as providing on-line facilities, the Department will also make facilities available using mobile phone technology in the future, as part of our ongoing commitment to the improvement of our customer services.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1052	My Department completed the roll out of a new animal health computer system in February 2005. The system is operational in all of the Department's district veterinary offices, relevant laboratories and headquarters.This new computer system is an essential element in supporting the Department's various animal health and welfare activities and brings the benefits of modern technology to the administration of the Department's various programmes. The system is principally being used for the management of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes at present — the Department carries out some 9 million TB tests and some 5 million brucellosis tests annually. Subsequent phases of the system will see it extended to deal with other bovine health programmes as well as disease programmes in pigs, sheep and poultry sectors. It has recently been extended to facilitate the creation of a national database of all keepers of domestic poultry and captive birds as part of the Department's response to the threat of an outbreak of avian influenza. Further enhancements will be made to the system on a modular basis.The system provides on-line access to the Department's database for private veterinary practitioners in the context of the disease eradication schemes and allows the Department and practitioners to exchange data electronically. The system has proved to be very successful. It is actively used by more than 900 private veterinary practitioners in approximately 400 practices throughout the country. These practitioners account for about 95% of all testing conducted under the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes.The cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, complements the AHCS in relation to TB and brucellosis testing by providing a list of the numbers and details of cattle in bovine herds. The CMMS is also used to systematically identify cattle to be traced and tested for BSE purposes, to assist in veterinary certification for third country markets and as an integral part of the antemortem process at factories and for pre-clearance of live exports.In keeping with the e-Government strategy of facilitating better citizen access and interaction with the public service it is proposed at a later stage to allow farmers electronic access to information on this system relating to their herds. The Deputy will be aware that farmers can view details of their bovine herd on-line via the animal identification and movement, AIM, system by logging on to the Department's website, www.agriculture.gov.ie/es and accessing e-services, the electronic service of the Department. The on-line herd profile inquiry facility will allow farmers to view on-line details of their cattle herd profiles as well as movements into and out of herds. The facility to register calf births on-line through the Department’s website is also available. Farmers may also complete applications on-line for compliance certificates for farm to farm sales.The Department also supplies herd profiles to farmers on a regular basis which enable them to ensure that notifications to the database are up-to-date.

Processing of these applications is continuing and the intention is to make allocations to successful applicants at the earliest opportunity. My Department will be in touch with individual applicants as soon as their applications are fully processed. Formal letters setting out my Department's decision will be issued.The person named submitted an application for consideration of circumstances under the force majeure measure of the single payment scheme on 29 October 2004. Having been notified that the circumstances outlined by him did not satisfy the criteria for force majeure, exceptional circumstances, under Article 40 of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003, the person named submitted an appeal to the single payment appeals committee.Following a full examination of the circumstances outlined in the appeal, the single payment appeals committee made a recommendation and a letter issued to the person named on 1 December 2005. The findings of the appeals committee were that the original decision taken by my Department should be upheld. The decisions of the single payment unit and the single payment appeals committee were based on the fact that the TB depopulation predated the reference years by such a period as to have allowed the person named time to restock before the commencement of the reference period.However, following these decisions my Department received additional information and medical evidence from the person named regarding the circumstances of this case. This information is currently being examined and a full response will issue shortly.

The table shows the two most common approaches to examining farm income: operating surplus — which measures aggregate farm income at national level and family farm income — which provides an estimate of average income per farm. Given dependence on weather, market performance and a broad range of other factors, farm incomes fluctuate from year to year. However, direct payments have provided a stabilising effect.YearOperating Surplus (€m) (Source: CSO)Family Farm Income €/farm (Source: NFS)19952,43614,23619962,48613,86619972,29714,04219982,29313,44219992,01011,08820002,22413,49920012,24915,84020022,09214,91720032,15314,76520042,22515,55720052,765
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1056	My Department's function in the transport of livestock by sea is to approve vessels based on statutory requirements regarding the protection of animal welfare. The actual provision of such services is a commercial matter.Approval for the carriage of livestock on roll-on roll-off vessels is considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the characteristics of the individual vessel, whereas there are specific statutory requirements which apply across the board where dedicated livestock vessels are concerned. Over the years, my Department has approved a number of dedicated and roll-on roll-off vessels and works closely with applicant companies for approval to ensure that the conditions aboard such vessels are consistent with national and EU animal welfare requirements. Indeed, a vessel currently approved by my Department for the carriage of livestock was inspected last week for the carriage of two additional livestock units and underwent a successful trial voyage.The live export trade provides a valuable outlet for categories of younger animals and a degree of competition, thereby sustaining prices. My Department will continue to discharge its responsibilities in the live trade by ensuring that any such applications are dealt with in a thorough, professional and efficient manner and that our animal health status continues to allow producers to have access to markets in the EU and elsewhere.The Government's consistent position on live exports has been that they provide a vital and legitimate market outlet for the livestock sector. The role of the Government in the promotion and preservation of any commercial trade is to create an environment in which it can be carried on in an economic and sustainable manner and which allows it to make the maximum possible contribution to the national economy. In the case of live exports, the preservation of the animal health status of the country, the international reputation of its veterinary certification services and the existence and application of a framework, which ensures that good standards and welfare considerations are taken into account, are all key elements. In each of these areas, our record is exemplary. Ultimately, the transport of live animals is a commercial matter and there are sufficient numbers of approved vessels to provide a service if the commercial demand exists.

This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers on a number of occasions. While the person named established 19.25 entitlements, the single payment scheme application form received on 13 May 2005 declared 19.19 forage hectares. Payment amounting to €382.15 that issued on 1 December 2005 was, therefore, based on 19.19 hectares.The person named was ineligible for payment under the 2005 disadvantaged areas scheme as a check on the animals on the holding showed that the minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare was not satisfied.

An application under the 2005 single payment scheme was received from the registered herd owner on 11 May 2005.Under EU legislation, in order to draw down his or her full single payment, an applicant must declare an eligible hectare to accompany each entitlement. This requirement was set out clearly in the documentation supplied to farmers.While the registered herd owner had established 23.42 entitlements during the reference period, a total of 16.13 eligible hectares were declared on the single payment application submitted. The payment, which issued on 1 December 2005, was calculated on the basis of the declared area. Under the disadvantaged area scheme, an advance payment issued on 23 September 2005 and the balancing payment issued on 17 November 2005.The registered herd owner submitted an application for an allocation of entitlements from the single payment scheme national reserve under category B. Category B caters for farmers who, between 1 January 2000 and 19 October 2003, made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under livestock premia and-or arable aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000 to 2002. Investments can include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and-or ewe quota or other investments.The position is that over 23,000 applications for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve were received when account is taken of farmers who applied under more than one category.

Following processing of this application, including the medical circumstances outlined, force majeure was granted and the reference year 2002 was omitted from the calculation of the single payment. However, this measure would only be applied where it proved beneficial to the value of the entitlements. In this case the omission of the year 2002 from the calculation did not prove beneficial.The person named held a suckler cow quota of ten units during the reference years 2000-2002 and also in the earlier reference period 1997-1999. Full payment issued in respect of this quota during both reference periods.

However, following recalculation of his stocking density, it was reduced to less than 1.4 livestock units per hectare. This recalculation arose due to the withdrawal of ewe premium, which meant that the applicant was entitled to the extensification premium higher rate of €80 per animal. A payment of €120 issued on 26 May 2005 in respect of the three suckler cows applied on. An additional payment of €120 also issued on 8 July 2005 in respect of the difference between the low and the high rate of extensification premium.A total of 35 animals were applied for under the 2004 special beef premium scheme. However, following the imposition of the quota cut in respect of the overshoot of the 2004 beef quota, the number payable was adjusted to 27.9 animals. A payment of €1,055.60 issued to the person named on 26 May 2005. A further payment amounting to €1,176.40 in respect of the difference between the low and high rate of extensification premium for the 27.9 special beef premium animals will issue shortly.

The administrations have traditionally shared information at local and national levels on disease control and surveillance issues and have worked together to combat illegal movements of animals and animal products. The foot and mouth disease emergency of 2001 is a testament to the extent of co-operation and consultation that exists at official, ministerial and political levels. Likewise, both administrations are co-operating on measures relating to avian influenza.The establishment of the North-South Ministerial Council offered an opportunity to build on existing co-operation arrangements and provided a framework for the development of an all-island animal health policy.The main objectives of the council are to foster co-operation and to devise a common, unified animal health strategy for the island as a whole. This involves the convergence of animal health policies and the development of joint strategies for dealing with animal diseases. The ultimate objectives are to establish a common import regime and equivalent internal arrangements with a view to achieving free movement of animals and animal products within the island.The programme of work mandated by the NSMC to agree a common animal health and welfare strategy for the island has been taken forward by nine working groups at official level. The remit of these groups includes TB and brucellosis, TSEs, BSE and scrapie, veterinary medicines, other zoonoses and animal diseases, disease surveillance, animal welfare, import and export of live animals and animal products, animal identification, traceability and cross-Border aspects of fraud.These working groups meet regularly and their work has focused on three main themes: common or equivalent controls at points of entry to the island; convergence of internal animal health policies; and development of joint strategies for the control of animal disease.The main achievements to date are the development of a co-ordinated and complementary approach towards import policies and portal controls at points of entry to the island, the convergence of policies in regard to animal identification and scrapie and the strengthening of co-ordination and co-operation between both administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE and cross-Border fraud. These groups continue to report progress in exchange of information and in implementation of initiatives aimed at policy convergence and the development of a common unified strategy for the island as a whole.It must also be recognised that the achievement of such an all-island animal health strategy involves complex dialogue and negotiation over a range of areas between the Irish, Northern Irish and British authorities. Ultimately, the agreement of the European Union will be required.In addition, there has been a significant deepening and strengthening of co-operation, information exchange and ongoing co-ordination between the two administrations on a variety of issues such as FMD, BSE, avian influenza and cross-Border fraud while the farm animal welfare advisory council includes representation from the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, DARD. The DARD was also represented at a recent meeting of the avian influenza advisory group and will also be represented at future meetings of the group which indicates the collaborative approach taken by Dublin and Belfast to challenges ahead. On cross-Border fraud, the two administrations have worked together successfully in a number of joint enforcement actions and ongoing exchanges of expertise and information are taking place.In relation to the recent decision at EU level to lift the BSE ban on exports from the United Kingdom, meetings have already taken place between our two administrations to ensure that procedures are in place in good time to avoid any potential difficulties that may arise when trade from Northern Ireland resumes. It is expected that the decision will come into effect in six to eight weeks.

Approval has been given for expenditure of a further €225,000 for the period from 2005 to 2007 for this research programme. The programme, which is drawn up in close collaboration with the Federation of Irish Beekeepers Associations, is aimed at devising an integrated management strategy involving the use of chemical and biotechnical methods and the deployment of varroa resistant bees. The programme is 50% co-funded by the EU. No funding is provided to individual beekeepers.My Department has also given financial support towards updating the Teagasc booklet entitled, The Varroa Mite in Honeybees. This publication provides useful reference material for beekeepers on varroa detection, monitoring, control and treatment.

In December, the Minister made regulations giving legal effect to Ireland's national action programme under the nitrates directive. These regulations were finalised following difficult negotiations between the European Commission and officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Department of Agriculture and Food. In these discussions, both Departments made use of the advice provided by Teagasc. It was the Commission, however, which determined the final content of the regulations.In January, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced a short de facto deferral of Part 3 of the regulations, which covers nutrient management. This was to allow Teagasc to submit revised advice in relation to phosphorus limits.A detailed Teagasc submission, covering phosphorus as well as other aspects of the regulations, has recently been received and is being examined by both Departments. To advance consideration of the submission, the Teagasc document has been forwarded to the European Commission. Officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, my own Department and Teagasc will meet with the Commission on the matter tomorrow. The Commission's agreement will be required for any amendments that may be proposed to the regulations. The Commission is open to arguments that are scientifically robust.A central issue arising from the nitrates directive is the need to secure a derogation which will allow certain farmers to operate, under appropriate conditions and controls, up to a level of 250 kg of organic nitrogen per hectare. The proposal was given an initial presentation to the EU nitrates committee in December and further scientific data has been supplied to the Commission following bilateral discussions. The proposal will need to be discussed again at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. Securing this derogation is vital for the most productive dairy farmers in particular and it is important that the position on the regulations is clarified at an early date so that the negotiations on the derogation can proceed.I am working with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to bring matters to a quick conclusion so that Ireland can meet its obligations under the nitrates directive while also safeguarding the future of commercial farming in Ireland and the interests of Irish farmers in general.

New forests established within the first Kyoto commitment period, from 2008-2012, will also contribute to the total sequestration capacity.The best current estimate of total sequestration capacity over this period amounts on average to 10.3 million tonnes of CO2. Of this some 8.1 million tonnes is accounted for by private forests and 2.2 million tonnes by public forests.The potential of different tree species to sequester or trap carbon dioxide from the atmosphere depends mainly on their rate of growth. Some conifer species establish rapidly and over the first ten years will begin to sequester considerable amounts of carbon. Others, including some broadleafs, are slower to establish and do not make the same positive contribution over the first ten years or so. After that time, however, they will also begin to trap similar amounts of carbon dioxide. As trees reach maturity over a period of decades, there is little difference in the total amounts of carbon dioxide sequestered when all species are compared.

When completed, the broadly-based strategy will include objectives and actions which further advance the progress already made by women towards greater gender equality in many sectors, such as increased labour market participation and narrowing the gender pay gap, and address the significant gaps which still exist in others, such as social inclusion, participation in decision making at the highest levels and in representative politics.It will also take into consideration recommendations and requirements laid down by the European Union, the Council of Europe and the United Nations to advance gender equality and overcome discrimination. The relevant critical areas of concern included in the Beijing platform for action will also be addressed in the strategy, as appropriate.Work on the far-reaching new national women's strategy is well advanced. Its development is being overseen by an interdepartmental committee of senior officials, under the chairmanship of my Department, and is the subject of an external consultation process. I am hopeful that the draft national women's strategy will be finalised and submitted to the Government later this year.Violence against women is one of the areas being addressed in the national women's strategy. In addition, the national steering committee on violence against women, chaired by Deputy Frank Fahey, Minister of State in my Department, has commissioned a new and more detailed strategic action plan specifically on the subject of violence against women. This dedicated strategic action plan will underpin the ongoing multi-disciplinary work to combat this violence. It is expected that the plan will be published later this year.

It is also possible to order official copies of these folios, filed plans and other Land Registry records on-line through the electronic access service, by post or through attendance at the public offices.I am also informed that contracts to digitise the existing paper map record and to build a new computer system for storing, maintaining and processing the new digital maps were awarded in June 2005. The development, testing and implementation of the new computerised digital mapping system is now nearing completion and the projected activation date is 28 April 2006. At that stage, customers of the Land Registry who subscribe to the office's electronic access service will, for the first time, be able to view the Land Registry maps for the entire country on-line and conduct electronic inspections and associated index inquiries. Access will also be provided for customers who visit the public offices operated by the Land Registry.I am further informed that this project also includes a programme to digitise each of the registered boundaries of the estimated 2.4 million parcels of land registered in the Land Registry. I understand that this work is already well underway and the first county, County Westmeath, is expected to be completed by 28 April 2006.

This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána during that period.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the number of gardaí, all ranks, stationed in the Carlow-Kildare division as at 31 December 1997, 2000 and 2002-2005, inclusively, is as set out in the following table.199720002002200320042005

This represents an increase of 50, or 18%, in the number of Garda personnel assigned to the Carlow-Kildare division over that period.In addition, the division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.Garda management states that it is the responsibility of each divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division at levels, on a priority basis, in accordance with the requirements of different areas in the division. The allocation of such resources throughout the division is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval, in October 2004, for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the college of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and, in this context, the needs of the Carlow-Kildare division will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda divisions throughout the country.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1105	The Garda authorities inform me that the accompanying table provides the total number of headline offences, by group, recorded and detected in the Garda division of Cork city for the years 2000 to 2005 inclusive.The introduction of the PULSE computer system by the Garda Síochána in 1999 has led to more complete and comprehensive recording of crimes reported than was previously the case. Consequently, the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years.It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE. The first full year captured is 2002 and is a more accurate base year to use.It is important to note that offences in the homicide group are wider than the offences of murder and manslaughter.

However, the numbers of cases in which proceedings commenced for the offences of speed limitation devices not conforming and speed limitation devices not in use in each of the years 2002 to 2006 are set out in the following table.YearProceedings commenced2002252003172004232005382006*8*To 19 March.I am also informed that the European Communities (Installation and Use of Speed Limitation Devices in Motor Vehicles) Regulations 2005 came into force on 23 December  2005. Breaches of these regulations are dealt with as part of general law enforcement by the Garda Síochána and are also targeted by multi-agency checkpoints carried out by the Garda Síochána in conjunction with the Department of Transport, the Health and Safety Authority and the Revenue Commissioners.Statistics are not compiled in such a way as to distinguish between prosecutions initiated in accordance with this legislation and with the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1993. The amount of time it would take to compile such information would entail the disproportionate use of Garda time and resources and could not be justified.

The investigation was completed in 1994 and concluded that there was no evidence to support the necessary ingredients for the prosecution of the offence of forgery in this jurisdiction. A further complaint was made in 1997. Following a review of the original evidence, and in view of the fact that no further evidence was produced, it was decided that there was no evidence of a criminal offence in this jurisdiction.Following further correspondence from the person referred to by the Deputy, a comprehensive review of the matter was conducted by the Garda authorities in 2003. The investigation file was submitted to the law officers, who directed no prosecution in the matter.As the Deputy will be aware I have no role in the investigation or prosecution of cases. This is a long standing principle of our system of justice. The role of the Garda Síochána is to investigate alleged offences, to gather whatever evidence may be available and to submit a report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The question of whether or not a particular person should be prosecuted and for what criminal offence is the responsibility of the director. The Director of Public Prosecutions, who is independent in the performance of his functions, makes his decision on the basis of the Garda findings viewed against the background of common and/or statute law. In the circumstances, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the case.

This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochana during that period.The personnel strength, all ranks, of the Crumlin, Tallaght, Terenure and Rathfarnham Garda stations as at 28 February 2006 was as set out in the table below.StationStrengthCrumlin84Tallaght167Terenure96Rathfarnham70The stations referred to by the Deputy form part of the Dublin metropolitan region south division. The personnel strength, all ranks, of that division as at 31 December 1997 and 28 February 2006, was 471 and 552, respectively. This represents an increase of 81 or 17% in the number of Garda personnel assigned to the division over that period.The division's resources are further augmented by a number of Garda national units such as the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the Criminal Assets Bureau and other specialised units.Garda management states that it is the responsibility of each divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division at levels, on a priority basis, in accordance with the requirements of different areas in the division. The allocation of such resources throughout the division is determined by a number of factors including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána, in line with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.The Garda Commissioner will draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and, in this context, the needs of the Garda stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1109	On 22 November last year, following Government approval, I published my proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour, including provision for anti-social behaviour orders, on my Department's website. In so far as anti-social behaviour by children is concerned, my colleague, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister of State with special responsibility for children obtained Government approval on 13 December 2005 for separate provisions relating to children as part of a package of measures concerning juvenile justice issues. These proposals are also on the Department's website.I intend to introduce these proposals by way of Committee Stage amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is currently before the House. Work on the drafting of these proposals as formal amendments to the Criminal Justice Bill is progressing in the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I expect that work to be completed shortly. This will clear the way for Committee Stage to begin. I hope to proceed quickly thereafter to enactment of the Bill.My proposals to deal with anti-social behaviour arise from the growing concerns in our communities about anti-social behaviour and the extent to which the quality of life of law-abiding citizens can be adversely affected by the behaviour of a minority. In formulating my proposals, I am conscious of the concerns that have been voiced by individuals and groups regarding, in particular, the application of anti-social behaviour orders in the United Kingdom, including their application to children. Accordingly, my proposals do not follow the UK model in every respect. For example, in the United Kingdom an anti-social behaviour order must apply for a minimum of two years, whereas my proposals provide for a maximum duration of two years. With regard to children, separate provisions fully integrated into the Children Act 2001, and thereby attracting all of the protections of that Act, are proposed.Since the proposals were published late last year my Department has received two submissions from groups, namely, Mental Health Ireland and the Irish Human Rights Commission. These submissions are currently being examined by my officials.

The reception and integration agency has responsibility for the accommodation of asylum seekers and the co-ordination of service provision. The agency has developed a child protection policy which is in line with the Children First national child protection guidelines. A policy is also in place for all agency personnel. Both policies have been implemented since 16 January 2006.Asylum seekers living in accommodation not provided by the reception and integration agency are subject to the same child protection procedures as any other members of the community. Family support is provided through the Health Service Executive, and referral procedures are the same as for the indigenous population.With regard to the appointment of case-workers and related matters mentioned in the Deputy's question, these are issues for the Health Service Executive and my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children will provide further information on them.

A subcommittee of the national steering committee, made up of representatives from the above Departments, as well as other Departments with a role in this field, has examined the funding and co-ordination arrangements for the sector generally and its report will be considered by the Departments concerned. The allocation of resources will remain a matter for each Department, in the context of its own Estimates process.My Department chairs and provides the secretariat to the national steering committee on violence against women. The committee's remit is to provide a forum for the co-ordination of responses to violence against women and to develop a strategy and action plan, which will build on the work achieved to date and chart progress for the future.The membership of the national steering committee comprises representatives of the five Government Departments and the key State bodies with a role in the area of violence against women and representatives of the relevant non-governmental organisations. The preparation of the new strategy has involved extensive consultation with interested parties as well as an evaluation of the working methods and structures of the steering committee, with a view to further enhancing its effectiveness and laying down a work plan for the future. The strategic plan should be completed this year and it is expected to include a long-term strategy to raise awareness of violence against women.In addition to ensuring the necessary responses from the civil and criminal justice system, my Department is also responsible for preventative and awareness measures, including a number of intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence. Last year the Department funded the evaluation of two such perpetrator programmes and the recommendations of the evaluation are currently being implemented.

Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person was informed by letter dated 17 January 2006 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and afforded her three options in accordance with section 3(3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of a deportation order or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.Her case was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations received on her behalf for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 27 February 2006 I refused temporary leave to remain and instead signed a deportation order in respect of her. Notice of this order was served by registered post, requiring her to present herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, on 9 March 2006 in order to make travel arrangements for her deportation from the State. The person failed to present as required and was classified as evading her deportation. The effect of the deportation order is that she must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.The person is awaiting deportation following a comprehensive examination of her asylum claim and of her application to remain temporarily in the State. Further representations for temporary leave to remain in the State, dated 6 March 2006, were received from the legal representatives of the person concerned. These representations were considered pursuant to the provisions of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, following which it was decided that the contents were not such as to warrant the revocation of the deportation order. The decision to deport therefore remains unchanged.The enforcement of the deportation order is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

No such circumstances have been put forward by the Deputy in respect of the application of the person concerned.

Before any place or part thereof may be used as a day centre, the principal probation and welfare officer shall inspect it and if he or she considers that the place is suitable for such use, certify in writing accordingly.A court may order that a child shall attend at a specified day centre for the purpose of participating in an occupation or activity, or receiving instruction, which is suitable and beneficial for him or her. The child may participate in any such occupation or activity, or receive any such instruction, under supervision outside the day centre.The project in question was a community-based, day assessment centre which offered an assessment service to young people from Finglas, Ballymun and surrounding areas. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, through the probation and welfare service, commenced funding the project on 1 January 2004. During 2004 the project received current funding of €400,000 and it received a further grant of €300,000 in 2005. It was anticipated that the project would become a pilot day centre as provided for under the Children Act 2001. To this end, the Department agreed to fund the project on condition,  inter alia, that the project would be a pilot for day centres, provided for under the Children Act 2001; referrals to the project would be from the courts; and the project would work to its full capacity, that is, five young people in attendance at any given time.Unfortunately, since January 2004 until its closure in December 2005, the project only dealt with six referrals of young people who were before the courts. The board of management recognised this was an unsustainable position and at a meeting held on 2 December 2005 the board concluded the project was no longer viable and the company would cease trading on 8 December 2005.

Consequently the statistics provided for 1997 are not comparable to statistics provided for 2000 and subsequent years.Any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population. The figures provided for 2000 and 2001 are incomplete due to the phased implementation of PULSE. The first full year captured is 2002 and is a more accurate base year to use. Offences in the homicide group are wider than the offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion.I am pleased to see the Garda policing plan for 2006, under the heading Policy Reviews 2006, includes a commitment to assessing causes of the rise in crimes of burglary in 2005. This work has commenced with a view to reversing the current upward trend and identifying strategies to target this significant issue. It is intended to mount special operations in particular problem areas.2005*20042003200220012000Rec.Det.Rec.Det.Rec.Det.Rec.Det.Rec.Det.Rec.Det.Homicide75857512126632Assault22813428518325215134723423217312164Sexual Offences75356844156120270221128968869Arson4567386094987715505Drugs353352286284271271326326217217163163Theft5,8582,8696,3243,0627,2203,4677,7423,7595,9962,8765,8222,896Burglary1,1362841,0682531,1192451,2813851,2173991,118482Robbery338126297109333119394141433153363139Fraud2688818395182126275160116837555Other7751139998670987052371812Total8,3853,9508,7314,1429,6864,58310,7945,3168,4744,0557,8213,887* Figures provided for 2005 are provisional, operational and liable to change.I am pleased to note that since I took up office the number of headline offences recorded has significantly dropped year on year from 10,794 in 2002 to 8,385 in 2005.

No formal appeal of this decision or request for additional funding has been received from the group since that decision.Each grant application and the level of funding required and made available to groups is carefully assessed against the objectives of the programme. Pobal, formerly known as Area Development Management Limited, which administers the programme, is in dialogue with the group and is awaiting further information from it in order to progress its application in line with the level of capital grant assistance approved.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1135	The issue of the level of payment and collection of fines is kept constantly under review. The legislation governing the penalty points and fixed charge system is set out in the Road Traffic Acts 2002 and 2004, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Transport. If payment is not made within 28 days of the date of issue of the fixed charge notice the level of the charge increases by 50%. If payment is not received within a further 28 days a summons issues for the offence for which the fixed charge notice was originally issued. In circumstances where a person elects to go to court instead of paying the fixed charge, and is convicted, the penalties available to the court are set out in section 102(a), (b) and (c) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 as amended by section 23 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. They include in the case of a first offence, a fine not exceeding €800; in the case of a second offence under that section or subsection, or of a third or subsequent such offence other than an offence referred to in the next paragraph, to a fine not exceeding €1,5000, and in the case of a third or subsequent offence under that section or subsection which is the third or subsequent such offence in any period of 12 consecutive months to a fine not exceeding €1,500 and or three months imprisonment.The fixed charge processing system, FCPS, was rolled out nationwide with effect from 2 February 2006 having been operating effectively in the Dublin metropolitan region, parts of counties Louth and Meath and Cork city since January 2005. From 3 April the FCPS will handle an expanded range of fixed charge offences which attract penalty points, and additionally current fines for on-the-spot offences will be converted to fixed charge offences. Full integration of the FCPS with the Garda PULSE system is planned for mid-April. The payment collection service for fixed charges will be provided by An Post, and this is being rolled out on a phased basis. By 3 April this service will be operational in all 109 Garda districts, removing the need to pay these fines at the relevant Garda district headquarters.These changes are designed to streamline administration and will significantly increase Garda time for operational duties.

I am aware of the hurt and trauma involved for family members and relatives in tragic death situations, especially suicide. I am also mindful that a proper public investigation must be seen to take place in order to reassure the public as to the cause of death in all cases of reportable death.The coroners review group, which reported in 2000, did not recommend that any particular category of inquest should be held other than in public, which has always been the position in the State. I am aware that it is the practice of coroners to be especially sensitive in so far as is possible, to the needs of families in the handling of all inquests and particularly so where suicide may be in question.I am not in possession of statistics for the waiting time for inquests. The conduct of inquests is strictly a matter for the coroner concerned and I am conscious that there may be many variables which might affect the timing of the inquest. However, when the coroners service is established under the new legislation, it will be in a position to gather and provide a wide range of information of benefit to the public. It will be required to report annually on all aspects of the work of the coroner.The Bill will replace the Coroners Act 1962 with considerable updating and it will reform the coroner service. It will implement recommendations contained in the report of the coroners review group and take into account recent judgments of our own courts and of the European Court of Human Rights.Details of the proposed new Coroners Bill are available on the website of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The upgrade of the PULSE system, which arises from the natural life-cycle of IT equipment, is now nearing completion. As a result of this work, the PULSE platform has been significantly strengthened and major improvements in response times have been recorded. PULSE is now a robust platform that has suffered no unplanned downtime.The Garda authorities also inform me that items of interest inquiries on PULSE have increased by 23% over the last 12 months. The next phase of work will address the replacement of printers across all networked stations. PULSE is now available in 231 Garda locations nationwide including all major city stations and divisional and district headquarters. This represents a significant increase over 2005 figures as an additional 50 Garda stations were networked during 2005.It was never the intention that all 703 Garda stations be directly linked to PULSE. Many of these stations are occupied for only a few hours per day and in some cases a few hours per week. The Garda authorities inform me that it is planned to extend the network further during 2006. The processes and procedures are in place to assist gardaí in non-networked stations to get access to PULSE. The processes and procedures cover both data entry access or inquiry access to information on the PULSE system.A major new initiative involving the manner in which data is input to PULSE is underway with the set-up of the new PULSE data entry centre at Castlebar, County Mayo. The centre, staffed by civilian personnel, allows for gardaí at the scene of incidents to report such incidents by mobile telephone to call takers at the centre. This obviates the need for gardaí to return to their stations to report incidents. The system is in operation in the southern region and is planned to be extended nationwide.These new procedures will benefit all gardaí, particularly those from non-networked stations. I am confident the measures outlined above as well as the set-up of the call centre at Castlebar will ensure gardaí will have access to the requisite information in the most efficient and effective manner possible.The costs requested by the Deputy are being finalised by the Garda authorities and I will forward them directly to the Deputy as soon as possible.

Any estimation would be purely speculative.However, every effort is made by the Garda Síochána to combat the illegal importation, sale and possession of firearms through intelligence led operations and activities. Operation Anvil, launched in May 2005, and aimed at those involved in gun crime of any kind, is one of the most intensive special policing operations ever undertaken in the State. It is intelligence-driven and has significant levels of Garda resources. The Garda Síochána is receiving resources this year to continue Operation Anvil as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms. I have asked the Commissioner to extend it to Garda divisions outside Dublin.Operation Anvil contributed to the increase of 16% in the detection of possession of firearms in 2005. Up to 19 February 2006, Operation Anvil resulted in over 1,600 arrests, including 23 for murder, over 13,200 searches, including 360 searches for firearms that resulted in 359 firearms seized or recovered, and the recovery of property with a value of €5.7 million.In November 2005 an additional 50 personnel from the uniform service in the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR, were transferred to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations. These officers are dealing exclusively with criminals involved in gun crime in the DMR through Operation Anvil.Due to my concerns about firearms in general and to ensure public safety and security, I propose to bring forward a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925-2000 in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the Dáil. Included in these new proposals will be measures which will create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle, and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest.The proposals also include provisions to require all persons, wishing to legally hold a firearm, to satisfy the Garda that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm; allow the Minister to deem certain firearms as restricted by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. In future, any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will have to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner. The Bill will also introduce new offences concerning the modification of firearms such as sawing off a shotgun and increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts. I also intend to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties, and minimum mandatory sentences, are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and enable the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.

On attestation, the starting pay for the first year in the Garda Síochána is €23,952, excluding allowances.Garda pay, including the Garda training rate of pay, is indexed by national pay agreements. For the first 62 weeks of Garda training, pay is not part of the superannuation scheme but is taxable and subject to PRSI. Additional increments are payable to a garda who holds the following qualifications on appointment and has successfully completed two years Garda service: (i) one additional increment in respect of at least one grade B and two grade C in three subjects, which must include mathematics and English or Irish, at honours level in the established leaving certificate examination or leaving certificate vocational programme; or (ii) three additional increments in respect of a diploma or degree from a third level education institution. The degree-diploma must be full time, of two-four years duration, and be awarded by a third level institution recognised by HETAC or a recognised Irish statutory authority.There are no plans to introduce premia for people who are moving into the Garda from established jobs.

In replies to recent parliamentary questions I have outlined, in detail, current trends in asylum seeker numbers, i.e., a fall in the number of new applications, together with a fall in the number of families seeking asylum, and the consequent implications for the RIA. As a demand-driven organisation, it is incumbent on the RIA to respond to changing demands.In the case of this centre, the RIA considered it to be suitable for possible reclassification from family to single person accommodation. As part of the reclassification of the centre, the RIA intended to relocate its families to other centres where they could benefit from special facilities for children and young people, including pre-school facilities. For a number of reasons, the RIA has agreed that the families with school-going children who currently reside at the centre should be allowed to remain there at least until the end of the current school year. The RIA has recently allocated a total of 17 males to the centre.The centre has operated as an accommodation centre since December 2003 and has been well run, without incident, by its owners and their staff throughout this time. The RIA has in its accommodation portfolio 16 male-only centres and no significant issues have arisen at these locations. Single male centres have, in the past, operated in small villages where residents of the centres helped in a voluntary capacity with various community activities such as the annual clean up for tidy towns competitions.The RIA is very much aware of the concerns and fears expressed by some residents in the town, through various fora, about the placement of male asylum seekers in the centre. The RIA does appreciate the degree of anxiety or unease that some local residents may feel if a centre profile is changed from women, children and small babies to single persons. It is the RIA's experience that, over time, such feelings dissipate as local residents come to know the individuals concerned and as their practical experience of the centre operation allays their initial concerns.

In accordance with the Dublin II regulations, and to uphold the integrity of the asylum and immigration processes in the State, it is entirely appropriate that the person concerned should be returned to Belgium to have her asylum claim determined there. However, as the Deputy is no doubt aware, the person concerned is in receipt of hospital treatment and, as such, her case is being treated in the most sympathetic and compassionate way possible. To this end, I understand from the Garda National Immigration Bureau that it does not propose to effect her transfer to Belgium until she is discharged from hospital.In relation to the Deputy's suggestion that the asylum claim of the person concerned should more appropriately be dealt with by this State given the possible availability of family support, the fact remains that the person concerned previously claimed asylum in Belgium and as such, the provisions of the Dublin II regulations apply to her case, i.e. that she should be transferred to Belgium to have her asylum claim determined there. As a result, it is my intention that this transfer will be effected in due course.

The central authority for child abduction operates in my Department for the purposes of the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction. The purpose of the convention is to facilitate the return of children who have been wrongfully removed from the contracting state where they are habitually resident to another contracting state.Where a child under the age of 16 is wrongfully removed from the State in breach of guardianship or custody rights, the person whose rights have been breached can make an application under the Hague Convention. The usual course of action for the central authority in the receiving state is to secure the return of the child either voluntarily or by initiating court proceedings. The terms of the convention require that the wrongfully removed child be returned to the country of its habitual residence except where the court in the country to which the child was removed determines that one of the limited and exceptional circumstances set out in the convention applies.The Irish central authority, in this case as in all others it deals with, is keeping the applicant fully informed of developments as they occur. I am informed by the Garda authorities that a full investigation is under way by members of the Garda Síochána into certain aspects of the matters raised.

The project was informed of this by letter from my Department on 2 January 2006. A first instalment of €35,000 also issued to the project on that date.The grant allocation is provisional and it may be revised following examination by my Department of the project's audited accounts for 2005 and projected expenditure for 2006. In accordance with the Garda youth diversion project guidelines, each project is required to submit each year its audited accounts and annual report for the previous year to my Department for consideration. The annual report should include a breakdown of projected expenditure and a work plan for the current year. The 2006 deadline for receipt of this information was 28 February.A budget of €6.6 million has been provided for the Garda youth diversion projects and local drugs task force projects in 2006. This represents an increase of 21% on last year's budgetary allocation. It is my intention to increase the financial allocation to each existing project this year by 2% and to apply the balance to supporting the expansion of Garda youth diversion projects over the next two years. I have asked the Garda Commissioner to bring forward proposals for further projects. My target is that there will be 100 schemes established nationwide before the end of 2007.My Department has recently received correspondence from the community relations section of the Garda Síochána in relation to a request for funding from the NICKOL project. Every effort is made to meet the projected expenditure needs of each project within the limits of the resources I have secured.

A claimed right to reside in Ireland based solely on the birth of a child in Ireland had come to be used as a method of attempting to circumvent normal immigration controls. In order to address these concerns, a referendum was held in June 2004 to amend the citizenship provisions in the Constitution which was overwhelmingly carried. This allowed the Oireachtas to deal with the issue of citizenship for children of non-national parents and the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 was enacted.There were also concerns as to the knock-on consequences of granting permission to remain to the parents of Irish-born children and the extent to which family reunification was being used to bring other family members into the State. Following the enactment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004, I introduced the IBC/05 scheme which facilitated the non-national parents of Irish-born children who wished to remain in this State. Almost 17,000 people were granted permission to remain in Ireland under the terms of this scheme. All those who availed of the IBC/05 scheme have signed a declaration indicating their understanding that permission to remain granted under the IBC/05 scheme would not extend to any entitlement to be joined by family members from abroad.The general policy of the Government is not to grant family reunification to persons who have permission to remain in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child. However, any such applications are examined on a case-by-case basis. The Government has no plans to change this policy for the future.

The central element of the agreement is the replacement of overtime with a new additional hours system which is broadly based on the concept of annualised hours.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have reversed the unacceptable trend of spiralling overtime costs which has been a feature of our prisons operations for many years. As a result of my determination to tackle this unsustainable dependence on overtime to run our prisons there was a reduction in the overtime bill of some €13.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003.The Deputy will appreciate that it takes time and a great deal of effort to roll out such a major programme of change. The agreement provides for implementation of the new additional hours arrangements and the elimination of overtime working across the service within six months of the date of acceptance, i.e., by 18 February 2006. These new working arrangements were successfully rolled out in the various prisons and places of detention in three phases, with the final group of prisons "going live" on 11 February 2006.As regards the extent to which the new additional hours contracts have impacted on the delivery of service and on the efficiency of services since they were introduced, progress is being made, even though the new arrangements have only been in place for a short period of time. As regards the issue of longer lock up times, I can confirm that standard out of cell times across prisons have been maintained and there are no plans to introduce longer lock up times for prisoners generally or for high risk prisoners in the context of the new arrangements.

This has fallen over the last three years from €84,750 in 2002 to €83,800 in 2004 as set out below. The reduction in cost is due to the strict budget management, and in particular overtime management. In this regard, I am pleased to inform the Deputy that I have reversed the unacceptable trend of spiralling overtime costs which has been a feature of our prisons operations for many years. As a result of my determination to tackle this unsustainable dependence on overtime to run our prisons there was a reduction in the overtime bill of some €13.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003.Prison/Place of Detention200220032004Arbour Hill71,55073,60070,400Castlerea72,10075,25070,000Cork71,05072,35075,000Cloverhill72,40083,30076,100Curragh72,40070,100Prison closedFort Mitchel100,10096,050Prison closedDóchasIncluded in MountjoyIncluded in Mountjoy82,800Limerick86,45090,20073,000Loughan House62,85067,70063,900Midlands72,85077,30075,900Mountjoy95,90097,90091,800Portlaoise206,700232,100225,200Shanganagh Castle169,450Prison closedPrison closedShelton Abbey84,85080,10082,000St. Patrick’s85,55082,30079,800Training Unit63,60071,80072,300Wheatfield72,35075,80071,300Overall84,75087,95083,800

Rigorous standard setting and external review mechanisms have been responsible for the transformation of areas such as prison hygiene and catering standards in recent years, to the point where prison kitchens are consistent recipients of national awards. Health care standards are in place since 2004 and it is intended that the first audit will take place in 2006. In the period 2006-08, the intention is to build on these successes by extending minimum standards and measurement systems into other areas of prisoner care. This will be driven by a more broadly based care standards framework which is being developed.These standards and service levels will be supported by the introduction of information technology that will provide key management information which will inform improvements in service levels and standards. A work training database that records prisoner participation in pre-vocational and vocational training was introduced in 2005.

This represents an increase of 1,743, or 16.3%, in the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána during that period.I have been further informed by the Garda authorities that the personnel strength of Clonmel, Carrick-On-Suir, Tipperary, Cahir, Fethard and Cashel Garda stations as at 31 December 1997 and as at 20 March 2006 was as set out in the following table:Station31/12/9720/03/06No. of Gardaí per 1,000 Population*Clonmel38422.08Carrick-On-Suir16162.19Tipperary31293.62Cahir22295.65Fethard320.51Cashel12142.78* The number of gardaí per 1,000 population is calculated using the official 2002 census figures as supplied by the Central Statistics Office and the official strength of the named Garda stations as at 20 March 2006.Garda management states that it is the responsibility of each divisional officer to allocate personnel within his or her division at levels on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas in the division. The allocation of such resources throughout the division is determined by a number of factors, including demographics, administrative functions, crime trends and other operational policing needs.I am pleased to point out to the Deputy that during the period concerned the number of gardaí across the six stations increased by over 8%. Garda management further states that Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.The timescale for achieving the target strength of 14,000 members of the Garda Síochána in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government remains as when I announced the Government approval in October 2004 for my proposals to achieve this objective. The phased increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 will lead to a combined strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. This project is fully on target and will be achieved.As part of the accelerated recruitment campaign to facilitate this record expansion, 1,125 Garda recruits were inducted to the Garda College during 2005. The college will induct a further 1,100 recruits this year and again in 2007, by way of intakes to the Garda College of approximately 275 recruits every quarter. The first incremental increase of newly attested gardaí under the programme of accelerated recruitment took place on 15 March 2006.The Garda Commissioner will be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and in this context, the needs of the Garda stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1177	I am informed by the Garda authorities that the following table shows the number of headline offences by group recorded and detected in the Garda districts of Cahir, Clonmel and Tipperary town for the years 2004 and 2005. I understand that Cashel is included in the Cahir Garda district, and that Fethard and Carrick-on-Suir are included in the Clonmel Garda district.It should be borne in mind that any interpretation of the crime figures should factor in the increase in our population in the past ten years. In 1995, with a population of almost 3.6 million people, there were 29 crimes per 1,000 of the population. In 2005, with a population of over 4.1 million, there were 24.6 crimes per 1,000 of the population, a reduction of 4.4 crimes per 1,000 of the population.It is important to note that offences in the homicide group are wider than the offences of murder and manslaughter. The homicide group of headline offences also includes the offences of attempted murder, murder threats, infanticide, abortion and procuring or assisting in an abortion.I am pleased to see that the Garda policing plan 2006, under the heading, Policy Reviews 2006, includes a commitment to assessing causes of the rise in crimes of burglary in 2005. This work has commenced with a view to reversing the current upward trend and identifying strategies to target this significant issue.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1178	Before dealing with the specifics of the question, I should briefly explain the workings of the Dublin II Regulation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003). This regulation is intended to prevent the phenomenon of "asylum shopping" across Europe and sets out criteria for determining which member state is responsible for examining an asylum application where applications have been lodged in more than one state. At the same time it guarantees applicants that one state will process their application, thereby preventing the creation of "refugees in orbit", a situation which had pertained in Europe prior to the introduction in 1995 of its predecessor, namely, the Dublin Convention. Under the Dublin Convention, and now the Dublin II Regulation, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner can, on the basis of the relevant criteria, request another state to accept responsibility for an asylum application and have it processed in that other state.The persons concerned, a mother and child, made an asylum claim in Ireland on 8 November 2005. Following investigation, it was determined by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner that, pursuant to the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, France was the appropriate state to process their applications as they had already made asylum claims there on 11 June 2004, albeit under different names and dates of birth. The persons concerned were offered an opportunity to appeal the determination of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, to the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal which they duly did on 19 January 2006 through their legal representatives. The Refugee Appeals Tribunal upheld the determination of the ORAC, i.e. that the persons concerned should have their asylum claims examined in France and the persons concerned were formally notified of this decision by letter dated 21 February 2006. The persons concerned were kept informed of developments throughout the course of their asylum applications in Ireland and were made aware as soon as it was possible to do so that their cases came under the terms of the Dublin II Regulation.France accepted responsibility for the cases of the persons concerned with the consequence that transfer orders were signed in respect of them on 10 January 2006. These orders issued to the persons concerned on 16 January 2006, requiring them to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Monday 23 January 2006. They failed to present as required and, as such, are classified as having evaded their transfers. Consequently the adult involved is now liable to arrest and detention. The persons concerned should present themselves to the Garda Síochana without further delay so that travel arrangements can be made to effect their transfer to France.In accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulation, France, not Ireland, is responsible for examining the asylum claims of the persons concerned. As a result, it is not my intention to examine their asylum claims here, nor is it my intention to grant the persons concerned any period of leave to reside here. Given that the persons concerned lodged their initial asylum claims in France, it is entirely appropriate that the persons concerned be transferred to that state.

The person concerned has now lodged an application with the immigration division of my Department to remain in the State.It is important to emphasise that persons permitted to enter the State as visitors do not have an automatic entitlement to remain here thereafter. The permission to remain was granted in respect of the person concerned strictly on the grounds that she and her dependants cannot have access to State funds, services or benefits. They cannot, therefore, have an expectation, having been permitted to enter as visitors, to avail of State benefits and services which includes attending State funded schools.It follows that the child of an individual in the State on a self-sufficiency basis is not entitled to attend a public-non-fee paying school. Should such an individual wish to enroll their child in the schooling system they would have to do this through a fee-paying school or fee-paying institution.The immigration division of my Department is still awaiting a reply to the request for documentation as referred to by the Deputy.

This application was refused and the person in question was notified of the decision in writing on 18 July 2005.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	The person concerned, together with one child, arrived in the State on 2 January 2005. It is understood that she gave birth to a second child on the day of her arrival in the State. The person concerned, on behalf of herself and her two dependent children, applied for asylum on 6 January 2005. Her asylum application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.The person concerned was informed by letter dated 23 September 2005, that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of her and her children and afforded them three options in accordance with section 3 (3)(b)(ii) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of deportation orders or to submit, within 15 working days, representations to the Minister, in writing, setting out the reasons why they should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.In determining whether to make a deportation order or grant temporary leave to remain in the State, I must have regard for the eleven factors set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended). These factors include an examination of the common good and any humanitarian considerations. In addition to the eleven factors contained in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, I must also have regard for section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 on the prohibition of refoulement.
The case of the persons concerned was examined under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, prohibition of refoulement. Consideration was given to all representations received on their behalf for temporary leave to remain in the State. On 3 March 2006 I refused temporary leave to remain in the State and instead signed deportation orders in respect of the persons concerned. Notice of these orders was served by registered post requiring the persons concerned to present themselves to the Garda National Immigration Bureau, GNIB, on 13 March 2006, in order to make arrangements for their removal from the State. The persons concerned presented as required and were given a further presentation date of 16 March 2006. The persons concerned failed to present as required on that date and are now classified as evading their deportation. They should present themselves to the GNIB without delay. The effect of the deportation orders is that the persons concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State.In addition to the asylum application, the person concerned also submitted an application for permission to remain in the State on the basis of her parentage of an Irish-born child born in the State before 1 January 2005, under the revised arrangements I announced on 15 January 2005. However, following the citizenship referendum of 2004 and the subsequent Immigration and Citizenship (Amendment) Act 2004, which came into effect on 1 January 2005, a child born in Ireland after 1 January 2005 is not entitled to Irish citizenship solely by virtue of being born in Ireland. The person concerned therefore did not qualify for residency under the revised arrangements referred to because the child in question was born in the State after 1 January 2005. The person concerned was notified of the decision to refuse her application by letter dated 7 October 2005.The safety of returning a person, or  refoulement, as it is referred to, is fully considered in every case when deciding whether to make a deportation order. This means that a person shall not be expelled from the State or returned in any manner whatsoever to a state where, in my opinion, the life or freedom of that person would be threatened on account of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. My Department uses extensive country of origin information drawn from different independent sources, including United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR, in evaluating the safety of making returns to countries of origin, including Nigeria as in this case.I am satisfied that applications for asylum and leave to remain in the State of the persons concerned, together with all refoulement issues, have been comprehensively and fairly considered and, as such, it is my intention that their deportation from the State should proceed. The enforcement of the deportation orders is now an operational matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.

The commission is entirely independent in its decision-making and examines each application on its merits. The commission received an application from the Missing in Ireland Support Service for €71,600 to establish, staff and operate a helpline for missing persons. After careful consideration of the application the commission decided to offer funding of €25,000; however, this offer was rejected by the Missing in Ireland Support Service. It should be borne in mind in this context that the commission is charged with funding support services for victims of crime, and that, while some persons who are missing are crime victims, most are not.Other than the request to the independent commission for funding, no request for funding has been made by the Missing in Ireland Support Service to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as such. It remains open to the Missing in Ireland Support Service to make an application to the Department for assistance if it so wishes. Any such application will be carefully considered on its merits.

To counteract the use of drugs in the area, the Garda K district drugs unit carries out searches on a regular basis in the area on those suspected of being involved in drug activity. Also, Operation Colt has been set up specifically to target the sale, supply and use of drugs in licensed premises. A number of successful detections and prosecutions have been made through these initiatives.I am also informed by the Garda authorities that the SNAP, Say No And Phone, campaign was launched in the Finglas area in March 2005. This is an anti-drugs initiative that encourages members of the community with information relating to drugs activity to telephone a confidential Garda hotline. This information is appraised and acted upon where appropriate. The SNAP campaign has already resulted in a significant number of successful seizures of controlled drugs.There are a number of initiatives in place to target house break-ins in the Finglas area. Crime prevention advice in this regard is given to local residents and senior citizens groups. There is a regular analysis of trends involving such crime with active patrolling of any areas affected. Technical examinations are carried out of all crime scenes with a view to identifying culprits and initiating proceedings.I am further informed by the Garda authorities that the Finglas patrol car, Finglas detective unit, the K district drugs unit, the public order van, the divisional crime task force and divisional traffic unit all assist on an ongoing basis in counteracting the use of drugs and house break-ins in the Finglas area.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1193	Section 38 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides a legislative basis for the operation of CCTV systems in public places for the purposes of crime prevention and crime detection by the Garda Síochána and community-based groups. It does not apply to persons operating CCTV cameras on their premises for the purposes of protecting persons or property on the premises or environs.Officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are examining a possible amendment to the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997 to make it an offence to video record or photograph persons without their knowledge in any place that a person could reasonably expect privacy. I will bring any proposals in this regard to the Government in the normal way.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1194	In order to ensure public safety and security, I propose to introduce a wide range of amendments to the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2000 in the context of the Criminal Justice Bill 2004, which is before the Dáil.Included in these new proposals will be measures which will create mandatory minimum sentences, of between five and ten years, for certain firearms offences, including possession of a firearm in suspicious circumstances, possession of a firearm with criminal intent, possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or cause serious injury to property, possession of a firearm while hijacking a vehicle and use or production of a firearm to resist arrest. Provision will be made to require all persons, wishing to hold a firearm legally, to satisfy the Garda that they have provided secure accommodation for the firearm. The Minister will be allowed to deem certain firearms as "restricted" by reference to specific criteria, including the calibre, action type and muzzle energy of the firearm. In future, any person wishing to obtain a certificate for such a firearm will need to apply directly to the Garda Commissioner. New offences will be introduced concerning the modification of firearms such as "sawing off" a shotgun. It is proposed to increase fines and penalties generally for offences under the Firearms Acts.I also intend to introduce a statutory basis for an amnesty during which firearms may be surrendered to the Garda Síochána before new penalties, and minimum mandatory sentences, are introduced. This will enable those in possession of firearms, who are not in compliance with the legal requirements, to regularise their position, and thus enable the Garda Síochána to concentrate on more serious offenders.Every effort is made by the Garda Síochána to combat the illegal importation, sale and possession of firearms through intelligence-led operations and activities. Operation Anvil, launched in May last year and aimed at those involved in gun crime of any kind, is one of the most intensive special policing operations ever undertaken in the State. It is intelligence-driven and has significant levels of Garda resources. The Garda Síochána is receiving resources this year to continue Operation Anvil as long as it is deemed necessary in operational policing terms and I have asked the Commissioner to extend it to Garda divisions outside Dublin.Operation Anvil contributed to the increase of 16% in the detection of possession of firearms in 2005. Up to 19 February 2006, Operation Anvil resulted in more than 1,600 arrests, including 23 for murder, more than 13,200 searches, including 360 searches for firearms that resulted in 359 firearms seized or recovered, and the recovery of property with a value of €5.7 million.The Garda Síochána this year has the highest level of resources in its history —€1,290 million, an increase of €146 million, 13%, on 2005. The provision for Garda overtime in 2006 is €83.5 million — an increase of €23 million on the allocation for 2005. This increase will greatly assist the planned deployment of a visible policing service in a flexible, effective and targeted response to criminal activity and to crime prevention, including gun crimes. The €83.5 million in overtime will yield 2.725 million extra hours of policing by uniformed and special units throughout the State.I take great satisfaction in the Government's decision of October 2004 to approve the recruitment of 2,000 additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force to 14,000. As a result there will be a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into front-line, operational, high-visibility policing.

In this regard, the preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for all children, including children with autism, is through the primary and post-primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, special classes or special schools.The Department of Education and Science also supports an eclectic approach in regard to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available, for example, treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, TEACH, applied behavioural analysis, ABA, and picture exchange communication system, PECS. In this regard, it should be noted that none of the early intervention and pre-school resources sanctioned for St. Catherine's is classified by the Department of Education and Science as dedicated ABA classes.The National Council for Special Education has today advised the school that a third pre-school/early intervention class for children with autistic spectrum disorders is being sanctioned with immediate effect.

The network is managed by the Department of Finance and has been in existence since the late 1970s. Membership of the network incurs obligations and costs and is voluntary. It is a matter for each public sector organisation to decide whether it wishes to join.I understand that the company referred to by the Deputy is not a member of the network and has notified the Department of Finance that it does not wish to join the network. There is no provision for a transfer of service between network members and a public sector body which is outside the network.

Various options were also explored for the delivery of accommodation for the school. The Department of Education and Science advised the school authorities that a new school adjacent to the existing school on the east side would best meet the accommodation needs of the school.A stage 2 submission based on this option was recently received in the Department of Education and Science and is under review. When this review is completed my officials will be in further contact with the school authorities regarding the next steps involved in progressing this project.A decision on which school building projects will advance to tender and construction will be considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-09.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1201	DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the new action plan for educational inclusion, provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated school support programme, SSP. The school support programme will bring together and build upon a number of existing interventions in schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage. The new action plan is being introduced on a phased basis, starting during the current school year. It will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million on full implementation. In addition, supports will continue to be provided for schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.The process of identifying primary and second level schools for participation in the new school support programme under DEIS has been completed. This process was managed by the Educational Research Centre, ERC, on behalf of the Department of Education and Science and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the inspectorate. In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was achieved.The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict achievement and these variables were then used to identify schools for participation in the school support programme. The variables involved were: unemployment; local authority accommodation; lone parenthood; Travellers; large families with five or more children; and pupils eligible for free books.In the case of second level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with centrally held data from the post-primary pupils and State Examinations Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the school support programme were as follows: medical card data for junior certificate candidates, including junior certificate school programme candidates; junior certificate retention rates by school; junior certificate examination results aggregated to school level, expressed as an OPS — overall performance scale — score. This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which he or she performed best; and leaving certificate retention rates by school.As a result of the identification process, 840 schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme. These comprise 640 primary schools — 320 urban or town schools and 320 rural schools — and 200 second level schools. Letters of invitation were issued to all 840 schools in late February with a request to complete and return an acceptance form by 10 March 2006. The finalised list of schools participating in SSP will be published on the Department of Education and Science's website shortly.

The commission's inquiry is ongoing and will include consideration of deaths which occurred in institutions to the extent that this is relevant to the inquiry. The commission's investigation committee has the power to direct any person to discover documents it deems are required in order to carry out its inquiry and relevant documentation held by the Department of Education and Science on the abuse or neglect of children in industrial and reformatory schools was forwarded to the commission in compliance with a discovery order from the commission in June 2003.The issue of exhuming bodies is covered by the Coroners Act 1962 and a body may only be exhumed on foot of an exhumation order made by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in accordance with section 47(1) of the Act.

At the request of the Department of Education and Science, the authority represents Ireland in an international network of centres known as ENIC/NARIC, European National Information Centre/National Academic Recognition Information Centre, and NRP, National Reference Point, which promote the recognition of international awards.The authority provides a service to advise applicants regarding the comparability of their award in Ireland, for employment purposes or to undertake further study in this country. It also acts as a first point of contact for persons seeking admission to the regulated professions. To avail of the recognition service, the applicant completes an application form and forwards copies of their award documentation. The authority, in collaboration with relevant national stakeholders, particularly the Further Education and Training Awards Council and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council, and with the assistance of its international network partners, processes the application and upon completion, the applicant is provided with a statement which comments on their award and its comparability in Ireland. The service is advisory in nature, it continues to be a matter for an employer, outside of the regulated professions, or a learning institution to decide on whom to employ or admit.Further information regarding the recognition service is provided on the authority's website on the recognition of international qualifications at www.qualificationsrecognition.ie. Prospective applicants are welcome to contact the authority for further information at any time.For entry to a regulated profession, professional recognition is determined by a designated competent authority and generally made on a case-by-case basis. In this particular case, the competent authority is the Honourable Society of Kings Inns. I have been advised by that society that in line with EU directives on mutual recognition of professional qualifications, foreign qualified lawyers are required to undertake the qualified lawyers transfer test, QLTT, which enables lawyers qualified in certain countries to qualify as a lawyer in this jurisdiction. Lawyers eligible to sit the QLTT are those who are qualified under the terms of EU directives or those who are qualified in a country which is subject to a reciprocal recognition agreement with Ireland. There is no such reciprocal agreement in place with the Bar Council in the home country of the applicant in this case and, therefore, the applicant may be required to undertake the full training regime required of Irish graduates seeking to be admitted as barristers.

While many sections of the Act have already commenced, the remaining sections relate mainly to the statutory assessment and education plan process for which the Act provides. These cannot come into effect without the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, having an opportunity to present an implementation report to the Department of Education and Science which it must do before 1 October 2006. On 21 October 2005, the NCSE published a call for submissions in the national media on the implementation of the Act. The closing date for submissions was 13 January 2006.I understand that the NCSE has recently commissioned Dr. Eileen Winter at Queen's University, Belfast to undertake research on its behalf on the resource requirements needed to implement assessments as identified in the EPSEN Act. Results from the study will inform the production of the implementation report which will detail how the council will implement the Act. The research is due to be completed in June this year.The Government is committed to ensuring that the EPSEN Act is fully implemented.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1206	Devolving funding to school management authorities allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.The two devolved schemes, the small schools scheme and the permanent accommodation scheme, were originally introduced on a pilot basis. Due to the positive feedback from schools they were extended to cover more schools in the past two years.The schemes are not structured on the basis that the Department funding must be supplemented by local fundraising. However, they allow a school to supplement the funding from local resources if it so wishes. The critical element is that with devolved authority the school must set the scope of works to match the funding allocated. The Department does not define the precise works to be carried out. A school can make choices within the budget allocated.Setting the scope of works is the critical first step. Clearly where a school has a known level of resources apart from the Department funding or knows its capacity to raise additional resources, it is open to that school to extend the scope of works to include additional facilities. However, if the scope of works is not set appropriately from the outset based on the budget available, there is a risk that the school will be faced with a funding gap when the project is at construction.The choices to be made within these devolved schemes rest with the school and that is the cornerstone of any policy of devolution. The school authority knows the budget and must decide what it is capable of building with that budget. The time to identify a problem is at the outset before entering any contract. Schools can raise with the Department of Education and Science any site-specific problems or unusual planning stipulations that impose additional costs and these will be examined. Otherwise schools must reduce the scope of intended works so as to remain within budget. A school is not required to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and instead can opt to be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating.The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased each year and many schools are anxious to be included. In order to maintain this momentum I have invited 210 schools to participate in these schemes in 2006. These schools have been invited to attend information meetings held by officials from the Department of Education and Science in Tullamore on 20 and 21 March. Following the meetings the schools have the opportunity to decide whether to become involved in the process.I have increased funding for the schemes this year by an average of 20% for permanent accommodation scheme and by an average of 10% for the small schools scheme. These increases follow on from increases of up to 25% in 2005.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1207	Since the establishment of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, in 1999, the number of NEPS psychologists has increased from 43 to 122. The Public Appointments Service recently concluded a new recruitment competition for the appointment of educational psychologists to NEPS. Regional panels have been established to allow the Department of Education and Science give greater priority in filling vacancies to areas with the greatest need. The Department is in the process of recruiting a further nine psychologists.All primary and post-primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service or through the scheme for commissioning psychological assessments, SCPA, full details of which are available on the Department of Education and Science's website.In common with many other psychological services, NEPS operates a staged model of service to schools, whereby an initial referral usually leads to a consultation and provision of advice for teachers and parents on appropriate teaching and management strategies. Progress is kept under review and only those children who fail to respond to these interventions will need to see a psychologist. This allows psychologists to offer early appointments to children who are in urgent need of support and early advice to teachers in respect to those children whose needs are perhaps less pressing but who still need additional help in school.The system of assessment and provision for children with special educational needs is kept under constant review by the Department of Education and Science. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Education and Science has introduced a general allocation model of additional resources to all primary schools for children in the "high incidence" category of special educational needs as set out in the Department of Education and Science's circular Sp Ed 02/05. This is expected to lead to a reduction in the number of referrals of children for psychological assessment for the purpose of accessing additional resources.The National Council for Special Education is preparing a plan for the implementation of the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. That plan will address many issues arising from the Act, including that of assessment needs, and will involve consultation with the National Educational Psychological Service of the Department of Education and Science. The plan is expected by October 2006 and will be considered at that time.

Some 35 guidance projects were funded in 2005. The service offers information, advice and guidance to help people make the best possible choices for learning. The National Centre for Guidance in Education oversees the service. The Qualifax database complements the work of the emerging adult education guidance service by providing free of charge a coherent national information base that may be self-accessed by learners and providers, guidance services, as well as many other actors situated across the education system.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1210	Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the action plan for education inclusion that I launched in May 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, in the next two years, the Department of Education and Science will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases. However, the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Circular 0023/2006 outlining the revised staffing schedule for the 2006-07 school year is available on the Department of Education and Science website. Hard copies of the circular have been issued to all primary schools.The terms of the current staffing arrangements for primary schools make provision for additional posts, referred to as developing school posts, to be assigned to schools on the basis of projected enrolments for the next school year. Under these arrangements, a developing school post may be sanctioned provisionally where the projected enrolment at 30 September of the school year in question equals or exceeds a specified figure. If the specified figure is not achieved on 30 September, sanction for the post is withdrawn.The mainstream staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2006-07 school year will be a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 242 pupils on 30 September 2005. The school will also have two learning support-resource teacher posts.It is open to the board of management of a primary school to submit an appeal, under certain criteria, to the primary staffing appeal board. The board adjudicates on appeals on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools and operates independently of the Minister and the Department of Education and Science. The board's decisions are final. The criteria under which an appeal can be made have been revised and are set out in Primary Circular 0024/2006, which is available on the Department of Education and Science's website.

The discussions involve representatives from the Departments of Education and Science and Finance, the managerial authorities of schools and the teacher unions.In the context of those discussions a transitional agreement has been reached which provides that:those fixed term employees with more than 4 years successive teaching service as at 1st September, 2005 and who are deemed to be qualified shall receive contracts of indefinite duration unless the employer can demonstrate: That a post will not be viable within a reasonable period and where such a ground was set out as an objective ground in writing in the previous contract. Or That the person is covering for a post holder on an approved scheme of leave of absence. The foregoing exclusions shall not apply where the person has not received a written contract setting out objective grounds since September 2001.

These will be progressed by way of the appointment of a design team under the Department of Education and Science's capital programme for 2006. Unlike projects being progressed by way of one of the devolved initiatives, a precise amount of funding is not allocated to schools whose building projects are being progressed under the traditional method.The next step in the process is that a technical inspection of the school building will be undertaken by the Department of Education and Science and officials will be in contact with the school authorities in the near future in order to confirm a suitable date for this visit. It is not possible at this point to indicate when the architectural planning process will be completed. There are five stages in this process and the timeframe for completing these stages is contingent on various factors, including any unexpected issues that may arise, the period of time for the granting of planning permission, and obtaining a fire certificate, etc. Progression of projects to tender and construction stage is then considered on completion of the architectural planning process.

The priority skill needs of the economy are being identified on an ongoing basis through the expert group and relevant education and training provision is assessed in light of its recommendations.Discover Science and Engineering, DSE, is a national marketing and awareness campaign that aims to increase interest in science, technology, innovation and engineering among students, teachers and members of the public. Its mission is to contribute to Ireland's continued growth and development as a society that has an active and informed interest and involvement in science, engineering and technology. Its overall objectives are to increase the numbers of students studying the physical sciences, promote a positive attitude to careers in science, engineering and technology and to foster a greater understanding of science and its value to Irish society.The DSE programme was developed in response to a key recommendation of the task force on the physical sciences. This called for a co-ordinated effort to increase interest in science and encourage young people to consider science as a viable career option. DSE was launched in October 2003. It brings together many science, engineering, technology and innovation awareness activities that were previously managed by different bodies, public and private. DSE aims to build and expand on these activities and to deliver a more focused strategic and quantifiable awareness campaign. It is managed by Forfás on behalf of the office of science and technology at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.I am including for the Deputy's information a table giving the statistics available for both these disciplines in the university sector.YearGraduates19901,20219911,26619921,27719931,29519941,47519951,31819961,15419971,25319981,29119991,36720001,36820011,38720021,26520031,294The following additional table details the reclassification of some engineering graduates as computing and IT graduates.YearGraduates19964711997476199851519995432000631200189120021,00920031,124This new category consists of students pursuing courses in computer science and information technology.

The school has recently requested that some further works be done. The Department of Education and Science's technical staff has examined this request and sought further information from the school management. On receipt of this information the matter will be considered further and the school management will be kept informed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1221	Under the terms of the Education Act 1998, it is a function of the board of management of each school to publish the policy of the school relating to participation by students with special educational needs, including students who are exceptionally able. The measures the school take in this regard are required to be stated in the school plan. It is the duty of the board of management to ensure that appropriate education services are made available to such students.The revised primary curriculum, which has been supplied to every primary teacher, recognises the importance of developing the full potential of the child and caters for pupil diversity, including meeting the needs of exceptionally able pupils. In recent years, new syllabi and curricula have been devised for second level schools. These have been designed in such a way that the differing needs of a wide range of pupil ability can be catered for by their teachers. Part of the National Centre for Curriculum and Assessment's, NCCA, work programme for this year is the development of curriculum guidelines for exceptionally able pupils.While content is outlined in the curricula at both levels, process is also heavily emphasised. Enabling children to learn how to learn is stressed and facilitated. The development of language skills, investigatory and problem solving skills, higher order thinking skills and working individually and as a member of a group are all encouraged at both levels. While the use of information and communication technologies and the use of class and school libraries are of benefit in project work with all pupils, they have a special importance for pupils who are exceptionally able.Of particular significance at second level are the international Olympiads in the science subjects, information technology and mathematics, in which the exceptionally able and highest achieving pupils compete. There is also an increase in the number of teachers who are adopting approaches to teaching thinking skills such as de Bono's programme, Feuerstein's instrumental enrichment and Lipman's philosophy for children.In general, schools at both primary and second level attempt to use strategies such as curriculum differentiation, curriculum enrichment and acceleration to facilitate the development of pupils who are exceptionally able. In addition, the Department of Education and Science provides annual funding to the Centre for Talented Youth at Dublin City University to support its work in delivering programmes, which are designed specifically for exceptionally able children of first and second level age. This year's grant is €95,000.There are no proposals to allocate additional resources to schools to cater for gifted children.

Amendments, which have been made in the meantime, have been notified to the relevant school authorities by circular letters issued by the Department of Education and Science. The Department has been considering the matter of preparing a revised version of the rules. However, because of other more pressing and urgent work which requires to be undertaken, it has not been possible to prioritise the preparation of revised rules.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1223	Major improvements in school staffing have been made in recent years with the hiring of more than 5,000 additional primary teachers. This represents the largest increase in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education. Today there is one teacher for every 17 children, the lowest pupil-teacher ratio in the history of the State.Aside from decreasing average class size, the unprecedented increase in school staffing in recent years has also greatly improved the services provided for children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas. Under DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, the action plan for education inclusion that I launched in May 2005, there will be a reduction in class sizes to 24:1 at senior level and 20:1 at junior level in the 180 primary schools serving communities with the highest concentrations of disadvantage. With more than 600 extra resource teachers put in place in this school year, children with special needs are getting more support than ever before. It should be acknowledged how much progress has been made in this area in recent years.Recently I announced that I have secured sufficient funding to provide even smaller classes in our primary schools in the next school year, and the Minister for Finance has committed to a further reduction in class size in the following year. Accordingly, over the next two years, the Department of Education and Science will put 500 extra teachers into primary schools to reduce class size and to tackle disadvantage.The staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year. The actual number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is issued annually to all primary schools. The general rule is that the schedule provides at least one classroom teacher for every 29 pupils in the school. Schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios, with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases. However, the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 29 children in the school. Next year this is being reduced to 28 children per classroom teacher and in 2007-08 it will be reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher. Circular 0023/2006 outlining the revised staffing schedule for the 2006-07 school year is available on the Department of Education and Science website. Hard copies of the circular have been issued to all primary schools.In speaking about staffing in our schools, we have consistently said that priority would be given in the first instance to children in disadvantaged schools and those with special needs, which we have done. Now, in line with the Government commitment, mainstream class sizes are also being reduced.

For planning purposes, the country was divided into geographic districts, each with several primary schools feeding into a post-primary centre with one or more post-primary schools. It was intended that the defined districts would facilitate the orderly planning of school provision and accommodation needs and the provision of a national school transport service, enabling children from remote areas to get to their nearest school. I do not propose a general nationwide review of catchment boundaries. While the service has been developed over the years to take account of linguistic and denominational considerations in school choice, it was never intended that such choice would be unlimited. It is clear that the cost of operating such a scheme would be unsustainable, especially in the context of competing demands, including the major safety programme that the Department of Education and Science is implementing at present. A review of catchment boundaries may be appropriate if, for example, a new post-primary school is established in an area where previously there was none or, conversely, if a "sole provider" school closes due to declining enrolment. While it is reasonable for parents to exercise educational choice, expectation as to the extent to which that choice can be facilitated must be tempered with realism. To revise boundaries to provide school transport for pupils to their school of choice would not be appropriate.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1225	The post-primary school to which the Deputy refers is heavily oversubscribed as a result of the enrolment of a significant number of pupils from outside its catchment area. The cumulative effect of such enrolment over a number of years impacts negatively on pupils from within a catchment area who are entitled to a place in a school. This invariably impacts negatively on the school or schools to which such pupils should rightly attend and in which considerable capital investment has been made for this purpose. It is a matter for school authorities, in the context of their enrolment policies, to limit enrolment to within their catchment areas to ensure that such situations do not arise. As a once-off exceptional measure, the Department of Education and Science decided that a number of named pupils from outside the catchment area to which the Deputy refers would be allowed to enrol in the post primary school in question for the 2005-06 school year. This decision was taken because the pupils concerned had an expectation that they would be enrolling in the school and did not have sufficient notice to secure alternative placements. It was made clear to the school authority in July 2005 that the arrangement would apply for the 2005-06 school year only. It was made equally clear that the arrangement did not create a precedent and that it would not be repeated in subsequent years.The primary schools to which the Deputy refers are within the Kilmuckridge, Carnew and Arklow catchment areas, which have a total of five post-primary schools between them. An examination of enrolment trends in the schools has been carried out by the Department's school planning section for the purposes of ensuring there is sufficient accommodation to cater for demand for pupil places. The examination revealed that enrolments in all five schools have dropped, in some cases quite dramatically, in the past ten years. I am satisfied that there are adequate places for the enrolment of the pupils in schools in their own post-primary centres. I am satisfied that adequate notice has been given to the particular post-primary school concerned to ensure it implements an appropriate enrolment policy for the 2006-07 school year in the best interests of its pupils. Indeed, confirmation has been received from the school that it is effecting such an enrolment policy. In such circumstances, the Department's position on this matter remains unchanged.

The architectural element of the project is being dealt with by a departmental architect and the remaining design team members have been appointed. The school authorities wrote to the Department of Education and Science in December 2005 requesting amendments to the brief which consists of a 16-classroom generic repeat design. The amendments have been agreed by departmental officials and the school authorities. A meeting took place with the school authorities on 1 March last to brief them on the up-to-date position. A meeting has been arranged in the Department to brief the design team on the scope and extent of the proposed new school building project. Following the design team meeting, the Department will make further contact with the school authorities about the next step involved in progressing the project.

#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1233	A meeting on the McIver report, involving officials from the Department of Education and Science and representatives of the management — IVEA — and staff sides — TUI — was held at 10 p.m. on 11 October 2005. A further meeting was held on 24 November 2005 with representatives of the TUI and departmental officials. No future dates for meetings have been agreed between the sides. The Government's commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is very significant. The McIver report contains 21 overarching recommendations, incorporating 91 sub-recommendations. It has been estimated, in consultation with management and staff interests, that the recommendations for staffing would involve the creation of at least 800 new posts at a cost of over €48 million. This level of additional provision cannot be considered in isolation from other areas of education. In their consideration of the future needs of the PLC sector, departmental officials have been examining, inter alia, the non-teaching educational tasks particular to PLC teachers, the demands on the management side and the challenges presented by the variation in size of the more than 200 PLC providers. When their deliberations have been completed, further discussion with the management and union side will be necessary.The Government's support for this important sector is clear from the fact that it has increased the number of PLC places by 60% since 1996-97. The number of PLC places approved for 2005-06 represents an increase of more than 1,600 on the number for 2004-05. The number of approved places in the sector now stands at 30,188. The Government's support for the sector is evident not only in the expansion of approved places and teachers but also in the introduction of maintenance grants for students with effect from September 1998. Tuition fees for PLC courses are waived. The PLC maintenance grant scheme operates on the same basis as the higher education scheme. There were nearly 8,000 PLC grant holders in 2005 and they received some £23 million in direct support. PLC students are included in the calculation of non-pay budgets issued to schools in respect of running costs. A supplemental non-pay grant towards running costs specifically for PLC schools is also payable. This amounted to €5.5 million in 2005. It is evident that the Government's commitment to the sector, by reference to the resources applied in teachers' pay, non-pay running costs, student support and certification costs, is significant.

The school to which the Deputy refers is not among the primary schools which have been selected for participation in the new programme. However, the school is among the schools receiving additional resources under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing concentrated disadvantage. It will retain these supports in the 2006-07 school year. The efficacy of the supports will be kept under review. As provision is made under the new programme for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed. This support will be based on the results of the new identification process. The arrangements which will apply in this regard will be notified to schools early in the autumn.

Having made inquiries of the commission about the matter raised by the Deputy, I have been advised of certain matters which I will outline.The revision of draft marking schemes is a normal part of the process which applies to every subject. Following the examinations each year, the chief examiner and his or her advising team prepare a draft marking scheme for each subject. A meeting of the relevant examiners is convened and the draft marking scheme is explained and discussed at a marking conference. The effectiveness of the marking scheme is tested by putting it into action on a random sample of candidates' work. When this process has been completed, the final marking scheme is prepared. Changes may be made to the draft scheme in light of feedback from examiners, advice from advising-senior examiners or in the light of certain trends associated with the spread of the grades.The review of the marking scheme that applies to every subject after the initial sampling is a normal part of the marking process. This is one of the ways to ensure quality control, ensuring that there is uniformity in the scheme and among the various markers.In the case of higher level Irish in the 2005 leaving certificate, the review of the draft marking scheme highlighted the need for a number of changes. A diagnostic test was carried out on some exam scripts before a final decision was taken about the definitive marking scheme. All examiners had 50 scripts marked at this stage and many had more than that number completed. The final marking scheme was applied to all candidates, requiring the remarking of the scripts marked earlier and the examiners were paid the standard fee for this in line with normal practice. Marks were awarded on the basis of the criteria in the final marking scheme.The leaving certificate examination operates in a transparent manner that is to the fore of international practice. Marking schemes are published and candidates are given an opportunity to view their scripts before deciding whether to appeal their grades. There is provision for a comprehensive appeals process. Some 0.9% of candidates scored grades E, F or NG in higher level Irish in the 2005 leaving certificate. That compares with figures of 0.6% in 2004, 1.4% in 2003 and 0.7% in 2002.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1239	The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not readily available. Earlier this month, I announced details of funding being allocated this year to 210 schools, including four schools in Carlow and Wicklow, to enable them to undertake extension or refurbishment works under the Department of Education and Science's small schools and permanent accommodation devolved schemes. As part of a major expansion of the schemes, I am providing over €73 million to the schools so they can make progress quickly to deal with their building needs. The €73 million package covers a variety of school projects. Some 135 primary schools which will benefit under the small schools scheme. Funding of over €54 million, which is twice that allocated in 2005 and four times the 2004 amount, is being allocated under this scheme. The number of schools being invited to participate in the scheme has increased by 40% and the rate of funding for individual schools is being increased on average by 20%. Grants under the scheme now range from €275,000 to €820,000 depending on school size and the type of works involved. The small schools scheme, which is aimed at primary schools of up to four teachers where enrolment numbers are stable, aims to address accommodation requirements over the next decade. Over €19 million is being provided to 75 schools under the permanent accommodation scheme so they can deliver additional small scale permanent classroom accommodation. All other applications for capital funding will be continue to be considered for progress by the Department in the context of the school building and modernisation programme.

The 1978-79 employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools scheme, under which the Department meets the full costs of salaries, is being phased out as posts become vacant and no new posts are created. The scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme that is referred to as the ancillary services grant, which provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme is flexible as it gives boards of management discretion in the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided.The school referred to by the Deputy receives secretarial grant assistance under the ancillary services scheme. The standard rate of grant per pupil under the scheme, which was increased from €102 in 2002 to €133 in 2005, is being further increased to €139 this year. The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school subject to a minimum grant of €8,340 in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant of €69,500 in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, provided the school in question does not already have caretaking or secretarial services under an existing departmental scheme.If a school already has caretaking or secretarial services under an existing scheme, the rate of grant payable is €69.50 per pupil and the minimum and maximum grants payable are €4,170 and €34,750 respectively. The school to which the Deputy refers has the services of a full-time caretaker under the 1978-79 scheme. Accordingly, the rate of grant to be paid to the school this year under the ancillary services scheme is €69.50 per pupil. There is no provision for the allocation of school secretaries under the DEIS scheme.

As part of its remit the board is responsible for the collection and analysis of school attendance data. Officials from the Department and Science have asked the board to collate the information requested by the Deputy about the level of absenteeism in specific geographical areas. When that information has been received in the Department, I will arrange to have it conveyed to the Deputy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1243	The legal representatives of the trustees of the school in question have written to the Department of Education and Science seeking to have the property in question divested from the existing school lease. The Deputy will appreciate that the Department must ensure that the closure of any school does not have long-term implications for accommodation in an area.Particular cognisance must be taken of potential difficulties in urban areas, as in this instance, in acquiring alternative accommodation to meet outstanding or newly emerging needs. In the circumstances, before taking a decision in this matter, the Department's school planning section is carrying out a review of the area to determine its educational requirements in the medium to long term. This extensive review will take into account current and future demographics, planned housing developments and the likely demand for diversity in provision in the future. When the review has been completed, a decision will be communicated directly to the trustees involved.

The press releases in question, which were important to update Deputies on developments in my area of responsibility, have been made available on the website of the Department of Education and Science as part of the normal duties of a member of staff of my office. No additional salary cost was, therefore, involved.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1246	The running costs of primary schools are met by the Department of Education and Science's scheme of capitation grants, which is intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years, from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005. It was further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997. Local authority service charges and other charges which are payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of the Department of Education and Science. It is a matter for local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. If it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from the Department. It would not be feasible for the Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water charges.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1247	Funding is provided to primary and secondary schools by means of per capita grants, which afford schools considerable flexibility in the use of resources to cater for the needs of pupils. The running costs of primary schools are met by the Department of Education and Science’s scheme of capitation grants, which is intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools. The standard rate of capitation grant has been increased substantially in recent years, from €57.14 per pupil in 1997 to €133.58 with effect from 1 January 2005. It was further increased by €12 per pupil with effect from 1 January 2006, bringing the standard rate to €145.58. This represents an increase of almost 155% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 1997.At second level, the standard per capita grant which stood at €256 per pupil in the 2001-02 school year has been increased by a further €12 to €298 per pupil from January 2006. Under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools will benefit from the further significant increases. The grant that was increased for secondary schools from €131 per pupil in January 2005 to €145 per pupil has been increased by a further €14 per pupil to €159 per pupil from January 2006. These grants are in addition to the per capita funding of up to €40,000 per school that is provided by the Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils receives annual grants of up to €270,000 towards general expenses and support services as against annual grants of up to €237,000 in 2002.Local authority service charges and other charges which are payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of the Department of Education and Science. It is a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. If it is decided that schools are liable for such charges, the cost would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from the Department. It would not be feasible for the Department to introduce specific schemes whereby grant assistance would be provided to schools in respect of individual charges such as water charges.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	The Department of Education and Science's school planning section is in receipt of an application for major capital funding from the school to which the Deputy refers. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects. Progress on the proposed works is being considered in the context of the post-2006 school building and modernisation programme. No trilateral consultations between the school, the Department and Kilkenny County Council in respect of the school are under way. However, the Department is feeding into all local authority area development plans to establish the long-term educational needs of areas where schools are located.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1249	The Department of Education and Science's school planning section is aware of the need to provide a long-term accommodation solution to meet the needs of the school to which the Deputy refers. It is understood that the children attending the school come from a wide catchment area. With that in mind, the appropriate location for the school is under consideration in the Department. The site acquisition procedures will be commenced when that has been determined. The delivery of the building project will then be considered in the context of the post-2006 school building and modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1250	I recently announced details of 210 schools which will receive funding for extension and refurbishment works under devolved schemes to enable them to undertake works to address growing accommodation needs. The Deputy will be pleased to hear that the school he refers to has been included in the list of schools to be offered funding under the permanent accommodation scheme.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1251	The Department of Education and Science is anxious that all children, including children with autistic spectrum disorders, receive a form of education that is appropriate to their needs. The preferred approach to the provision of appropriate education for all children, including children with autism, is through the primary and post-primary school network, whether through placement in mainstream classes, special classes or special schools. The Department supports an eclectic approach to the education of children with autism where a range of teaching methods are available, including treatment and education of autistic and related communication handicapped children, applied behavioural analysis and picture exchange communication system. It should be noted that none of the early intervention pre-school resources sanctioned to St. Catherine's special school are classified as dedicated applied behavioural analysis classes. A fully constituted board of management has been established in St. Catherine's special school. The Deputy will appreciate the importance of all schools complying with the requirements of the Education Acts. The Department did not ask the school to establish a post-primary applied behavioural analysis facility.The National Council for Special Education advised the school today that a third pre-school early intervention class for children with autistic spectrum disorders is being sanctioned with immediate effect. There have been ongoing discussions with the school authorities about this application. The discussions included the National Council for Special Education and the National Educational Psychological Service. The Deputy has suggested that changes in procedures governing sanction of resources for pupils with special needs were not communicated to St. Catherine's special school. All schools, including special schools, were advised in this regard in circular Sp. Ed. 01/05. The Department supports the training and professional development of staff working with children with special educational needs through the special education support service. St. Catherine's special school applied to the service to fund the salary costs of two people working in the school, which was not in their remit.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1252	In accordance with the terms of circular 25/00, which outlines the provisions relating to the recognition of teacher qualifications in national schools, provisional or restricted recognition has been granted to the person in question. Notification to that effect issued to the person in question on 15 March 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1253	The Department of Education and Science is considering a report from the National Council for Special Education regarding the application in question. The Department's officials will notify all relevant parties when a decision on the application has been made.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1254	The most up-to-date costings on extending free fees to part-time students were compiled in 2002 by the task force on lifelong learning, which estimated at the time that the cost of extending free fees to part-time students in State-aided third level institutions and in Oscail and distance learning options in other third level colleges would be approximately €32.122 million per annum. I have no plans to extend the free tuition fees schemes to include part-time students. All students, mature or otherwise, who are first-time undergraduates and who hold EU nationality or official refugee status and have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course are eligible for free fees.Section 473A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provides for tax relief on tuition fees at the standard rate in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education, including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in EU and non-EU member states. Further details and IT 31 application forms for claiming tax relief on tuition fees are available from the Revenue Commissioners.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1255	A copy of a document, Parents' Response on their Concerns about Kilkenny City Vocational School, has been forwarded to the Department of Education and Science. I assume this is the report to which the Deputy refers. While there is no specific reference to the report in the terms of reference of the inquiry I have established, the terms of reference are broad enough to allow the inquiry officer to consider all aspects of the matter, including the views of the parents' association. All documentation in the Department's possession, including the document furnished by the parents' association, has been made available to the inquiry officer. I understand that the inquiry officer intends to meet representatives of the parents' association in the course of his inquiry.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1256	Teacher allocations for second level schools are approved by the Department of Education and Science on an annual basis, in accordance with generally applied rules based on recognised pupil enrolments on 30 September of the preceding school year. School management authorities are required to organise their curricula, teaching timetables and subject options with regard to the needs of pupils, within the limits of approved teacher allocations.The rules for allocating teaching posts provide that if a school management authority is unable to meet essential curricular commitments, the Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. The Department recently received an application from the school for curricular concessions, including an application for 11 hours per week of technology, woodwork and graphics and 11 hours per week of ICT for the 2006-07 school year. The application is under consideration at present and a decision will be notified to the school in due course.

Grants amounting to €18.8 million were initially provided to VECs for adult literacy in 2005. When additional funding became available during the year, the provision was increased to €19.9 million and the provision for 2006 is €19.9 million. The grants paid to VECs for the back to education programme in 2005 amounted to €11.82 million and €13.6 million has been provided in 2006.

The application has been assessed and the long-term projected staffing on which the accommodation needs will be based has been determined. The project is being considered for progression in the context of the 2006-10 school building and modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1259	Some 320 rural primary schools have been invited to participate in the new school support programme under the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools programme. The Department of Education and Science is considering the arrangements to be made for the clustering of the 320 rural schools under the school support programme and other rural schools retaining their entitlements under previous programmes for 2006-07. Schools will be notified of the proposed arrangements in due course.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1260	Under the new action plan for educational inclusion, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, 640 primary schools — 320 urban schools and 320 rural schools — and 200 second level schools have been selected to participate in the school support programme, which will bring together and build on existing interventions for schools and school communities with a concentrated level of disadvantage. Letters of invitation to participate in the support programme issued to these schools on 24 February last.The 320 urban primary schools involved in the support programme have been categorised into two bands: band 1 includes the first 180 urban primary schools identified for inclusion in the programme; and band 2 includes the next 140 such schools. Early childhood education provision is a key element of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools. It is intended to concentrate actions on children aged three or over who have not yet been enrolled in school but will attend the 180 schools in band 1.The school to which the Deputy refers qualifies for inclusion in band 1 of the support programme. Actions relating to early childhood education will build on existing provision and will be developed on a phased basis over the five-year implementation period of the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools action plan. The Department will work with other Departments and agencies to complement and add value to existing child care programmes in disadvantaged communities, with a view to ensuring that the overall care and education needs of the children concerned are met in an integrated manner.In December 2005, the Office of the Minister for Children was established to maximise the co-ordination of policies for children and young people. The office will have a range of functions which were previously under the aegis of the Departments of Health and Children, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science. A new early years education policy unit has been established in the Department of Health and Children and will be located within the Office of the Minister for Children. The unit will oversee the preparation of plans for the phased implementation of the early childhood education dimension of Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools in the targeted school communities, starting in the next school year. It will be pursued within an overall strategic policy framework developed by the Office of the Minister for Children.

Local authorities have the power to decide on road safety measures outside schools and should ensure that measures are in place to protect the safety of local schoolchildren. It is open to the boards of management of schools to apply for funding under the Department of Education and Science's summer works scheme if safety measures are required within school boundaries.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1262	The school referred to by the Deputy was among the 43 schools which I listed in March 2005 as being ready to start architectural planning. The Department of Education and Science wrote to the school authorities on 27 June 2005 appointing a design team for the proposed building project and giving approval to proceed with a stage 1-2 submission — outline sketch scheme with costings. When the submission has been received by the Department, its officials will review the project and contact the school authorities about the next steps involved in progressing the project.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1263	I assume the Deputy's question relates to special needs assistants. I have forwarded a copy of the current special needs assistant pay scales and conditions for the Deputy's information. The details are available on the Department's website, www.education.ie. The current rates of salary have been introduced following the implementation of section 14.2 of the mid-term review of part 2 of Sustaining Progress, in accordance with which an increase of 1.5% was paid with effect from 1 December 2005. Future payments under Sustaining Progress depend, in the case of each organisation and grade, on verification of continued co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change, maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by the agreement.Since 1 January 2005, the National Council for Special Education, through its network of locally based special education needs organisers, is responsible for processing applications for additional special educational needs resources. The Department has not undertaken any studies of the potential to develop the role of special needs assistants. The role is essentially a care one and educational input is delivered by teaching staff.Three colleges of education — St. Angela's College in Sligo, Mary Immaculate College in Limerick and Church of Ireland College in Rathmines, in conjunction with the education centre network, have formulated and delivered officially recognised training courses for serving special needs assistants. It is the Department's policy to keep all programmes under review, including those offered to special needs assistants. The Department, in conjunction with the special education support service, will shortly commence this process with the aim of further developing training in this area.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1264	The information requested by the Deputy is outlined in the following table.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1265	My Department funds three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for third level education students in respect of attendance on approved courses in approved third level institutions and one maintenance grant scheme in respect of students attending approved post-leaving certificate courses in approved PLC centres: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees' scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees; and the maintenance grant scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses.The candidate to whom the Deputy refers is attending a post-leaving certificate course. Under the terms of the maintenance grants scheme for post-leaving certificate courses 2005, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2005-06 academic year. Candidates are ineligible if they already hold a FETAC level 5 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 2 qualification, a FETAC level 6 qualification, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA level 3 qualification, or a third level qualification at level 6 or higher. However, notwithstanding this condition, candidates who already hold a qualification no higher than FETAC level 5, formerly known as a FETAC, NCVA, level 2 qualification, and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.My Department understands that the candidate referred to by the Deputy has previously pursued an approved PLC course at FETAC level 5. However she did not attain the terminal qualification on completing the course. In the circumstances she may not be deemed as progressing under the terms of the PLC scheme, and is therefore ineligible for funding under the relevant maintenance grant scheme.

The NEWB is the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. Accordingly, the Department has requested the NEWB to arrange to have this matter investigated and to respond directly to the Deputy.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1267	The fund for students with disabilities, which is ESF-aided, was introduced in 1994. It provides funding to students with disabilities attending courses in Irish and UK third level institutions and, since 1998, in post-leaving certificate centres. This fund is administered by the National Office for Equity of Access to Higher Education, national office.The purpose of the fund is to provide students with serious physical and-or sensory disabilities with grant assistance towards the cost of special equipment, special materials and technological aids, targeted transport services, personal assistants and sign language interpreters. To be considered eligible for the fund an applicant must meet the prescribed criteria.Applications for assistance are made by the individual students through the disability-access officer of a third level institution on registration. Decisions on applications are taken by the national office and verified by an independent panel comprising representatives of agencies and individuals who have experience of working with people with disabilities.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1268	The children to whom the Deputy refers attend three different schools. Two are attending primary schools and the eldest child is in attendance at a post-primary school.Each school receives psychological support from the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS. I understand one child will be the subject of consultation shortly between the principal and the psychologist assigned to that school. Another child will be assessed by the HSE and the outcome of that assessment will influence any further involvement by NEPS.The child who is attending post-primary school has not been prioritised by the school principal for referral to NEPS. However, the psychologist assigned to that school will consult shortly with the principal and relevant teachers concerning the educational needs of this student.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1270	My Department is not aware of any problems which have arisen in regard to the vetting of persons engaged on after-school programmes. If the Deputy has a particular case in mind, I will arrange to have the matter examined if he submits the relevant information to my Department. It is the responsibility of the authorities of the school concerned to ensure that appropriate insurance cover is in place in respect of after-school activities.All schools under the school completion programme are covered by an additional central insurance policy which includes employer's liability, public liability, employment practice liability and professional indemnity. This covers all aspects such as after school-holiday time activities. This is in addition to each school's own insurance cover.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1271	The school to which the Deputy refers is scheduled to open in September 2006. When fully occupied, the school will operate as a two-stream 16-classroom school. Normally, a new school only enrols junior infants in its first year of operation to enable it to develop incrementally. This incremental development ensures that a shortage of accommodation at the school is avoided by an over-enrolment in the early stages and crucially, that the enrolments and staffing levels in other schools in the area, where older pupils would inevitably be drawn, are not adversely affected.As an exceptional matter in the case in question, however, a decision has been taken to allow the school to enrol both junior and senior infants in September 2006. My Department is liaising with the management authority of the school in this regard. This decision was made because of the type of facilities which the school is providing.My Department is otherwise satisfied that, in accordance with its remit, the totality of the primary accommodation available in the area provides sufficient places to cater for all those seeking places.

This arrangement is within the school transport scheme guidelines.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1273	My Department provides a range of supports to second level school management to enable schools to cater for pupils with special educational needs. The supports in question include remedial and resource teaching support, special needs assistant support and funding for the purchase of specialised equipment.The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has been established as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2005. Since 1 January 2005, the NCSE through local special educational needs organisers, SENOs, is responsible for processing resource applications for children with special educational needs. The level of teaching and special needs assistant support for special educational needs is determined by the SENO in accordance with my Department's resourcing policy for special educational needs.In situations where schools have over quota posts, my Department routinely requires that these posts be utilised to meet new and emerging needs within such schools, including those of pupils who have special educational needs, where appropriate. In the case of the school in question, my Department decided that the teaching hours recommended by the SENO should be met from within the school's existing resources, which included 2.19 surplus teaching posts. An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation. The school in question appealed this decision to the independent appeals committee. The appeals committee decided that no further allocation was warranted. This committee operates independently of my Department and its decisions are final.The funding arrangements made by my Department for second level schools reflect the different management and ownership arrangements for vocational schools and community colleges, and voluntary secondary schools. Financial allocations for vocational schools and community colleges are made to VECs as part of a block grant, which also covers VEC head office overheads and other activities apart from the second level programme. Voluntary secondary schools are funded on a per capita grant basis which affords schools considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils.At the core of funding arrangements at second level is reliance upon capitation as the principal determinant of funding. This is in my view, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific cost items such as that referred to by the Deputy.Significant improvements have been made in the level of funding to secondary schools. The standard per capita grant which stood at €256 per pupil in the school year 2001-02 has been increased to €298 per pupil from January 2006. Under the school services support fund initiative, secondary schools will also benefit from the further significant increases. This grant was increased for secondary schools from €131 per pupil in January 2005 to €159 per pupil from January 2006. In addition, up to €40,000 per school is provided by my Department to secondary schools towards secretarial and caretaking services. A secondary school with 500 pupils receives annual grants of up to €270,000 towards general expenses and support services.These significant increases in the funding of secondary schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of the schools.

These escorts are specifically engaged to cater for children with special educational needs whose care requirements are such as to necessitate continuous support. Over 600 escorts are employed. These escorts provide a very valuable service for children with special needs who require assistance.My Department is not aware of school bus services being withdrawn due to the lack of escorts. If the Deputy has any particular case in mind my Department will have it investigated.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1277	As the Deputy is aware from my previous responses on this issue, my Department is committed to funding the provision of PE, general purpose and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the school building and modernisation programme. This is being addressed in the context of available resources and the published criteria for prioritising school building projects.The provision of PE halls at post-primary level is considered an integral part of the design stage for any major refurbishment programme of existing school buildings, providing always that the site is of sufficient size, or where a new school on a greenfield site is being built.All applications received in the Department are banded in accordance with the prioritisation criteria put in place following consultation with the education partners. The PE hall project at the school referred to by the Deputy has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria and the project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10. The project is not suitable for delivery under the summer works scheme or under any of the recently announced devolved schemes.

A decision will then be made on best to meet the school's current and emerging accommodation needs.The project is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1280	My Department is in receipt of an application for capital funding towards the accommodation needs of the school referred to by the Deputy.I understand that the school authority is in the process of acquiring additional land adjacent to the existing site in order to facilitate any development required. My officials are in the process of assessing the school's likely long-term projected staffing in order to determine the school's accommodation needs into the future. Factors to be considered include current and projected enrolment, demographic trends in the area, and the likely impact of recent and proposed housing developments. When this has been finalised, a decision will be taken on how best to meet the school's current and future accommodation needs. The project will then be considered for progression in the context of the 2006-10 school building and modernisation programme.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1281	The primary school to which the Deputy refers has accepted an invitation to participate in the new school support programme, SSP, under DEIS, Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools. Officials from my Department will contact the school authority directly to discuss the learning support-resource teacher staffing for the coming school year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1282	The information sought is not readily available in the format requested by the Deputy as the costs involved for individual schools are site specific. However, if the Deputy wishes to request details on a specific school or schools, my officials will provide the required information.The expenditure on prefabricated buildings by my Department represents less than 5% of the total expenditure on school buildings, €1.6 billion, over the five-year period in question.The demand for additional accommodation in schools has risen significantly in recent years mainly due to the rapid expansion in teacher numbers, particularly in the area of special needs, the growth in the school-going population in rapidly developing areas and the demands to cater for diversity through the recognition of new gaelscoileanna and Educate Together schools.The current focus within my Department is to empower schools to resolve their accommodation needs, wherever possible by way of permanent accommodation. In order to reduce the amount of temporary accommodation at primary level a new initiative was launched in 2003. The purpose of this initiative is to allow primary schools to undertake a permanent solution to their classroom accommodation needs and to achieve the best value for money. The feedback from the 20 schools in that pilot initiative was very positive and the initiative was expanded considerably in subsequent years to the extent that 75 schools have been invited to participate in the 2006 scheme. As a result of this initiative the amount spent on the purchase of prefabricated buildings in 2004, for example, was just half of what had been spent in 2003.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1283	As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, which was established recently, and which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs' supports. My officials have been advised by the NCSE that the matter has been referred to the local special educational needs organiser, SENO, for attention. I understand that the SENO will make direct contact with the school authorities to discuss the matter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1284	Whole-school evaluation, WSE, was introduced in the school year 2003-04 as a new model of inspection designed to monitor and assess the quality and effectiveness of educational provision in schools and centres for education. The evaluation procedure covers five main areas of a school's work: quality of school management; quality of school planning; quality of curriculum provision; quality of learning and teaching; and quality of support for students. A whole-school evaluation involves meetings of the inspection team with the board of management, the parents' association, and the teaching staff. During the evaluation phase, inspectors visit classrooms, observe teaching and learning, and conduct interviews with the principal and the in-school management team to gather information about the work of the school.WSE contributes to school improvement through identifying, evaluating, affirming and supporting good practice in schools. The findings and recommendations of a WSE are presented both orally and in a written report for the school community. While the recommendations contained in inspection reports generally relate to the five areas evaluated under the WSE procedure, the issues identified are individual to each school and take account of school context factors. Where areas of concern are identified, the board and the school are advised on the steps that should be taken to remedy matters.The inspectorate has published a guide to whole school evaluation for primary and post-primary schools and these guides are available on the Department's website. As the Deputy will be aware, I have recently put in place arrangements for the publication of school inspection reports that arise from the general inspection programme for schools. The new provision in regard to public access to certain types of inspection reports, including WSE reports, applies to inspections commenced after 6 February 2006.The Deputy's question relates to WSE reports on schools in County Tipperary completed since 2000. I can confirm that since the introduction of WSE in 2003-04, 11 such evaluations have been conducted in County Tipperary; three in 2004 and eight in 2005. All of these evaluations have been in primary schools. There are six WSE inspections currently in process in primary schools and four WSE inspections currently in process in post-primary schools in County Tipperary. The regulations do not allow for publication of reports of any inspections conducted prior to 6 February 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1285	I can confirm for the Deputy that disadvantaged schools that satisfied my Department's criteria for additional staffing under the urban dimension of the Giving Children an Even Break scheme, which helps schools with high levels of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds, availed of a preferential pupil-teacher ratio of 80:1 under the general allocation system.The general allocation system is intended to cater for children with high-incidence special educational needs and those with learning support needs. The system was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1286	The Deputy is aware that my Department is reviewing the arrangements applying under the various national education initiatives following the implementation of the seconded teachers arbitration award. This review is considering the position of the person concerned and I expect that this review will be completed shortly.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1287	As I advised the Deputy in my response to Parliamentary Question No. 501 of 7 March, the person in question should make contact with the relevant special educational needs organiser, SENO, who can assist her in accessing an appropriate educational placement for her child. As the Deputy is aware, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, is now operational. A specific function of the NCSE, through its network of local SENOs, is to identify appropriate educational placements for all children with special educational needs, including children with autism. The SENO is a focal point of contact for parents and schools. Contact with the relevant SENO can be made by contacting the NCSE at 046 9486400 or alternatively by accessing the NCSE website at www.ncse.ie. My Department is continuing to fund a home tuition grant to the family concerned pending the provision of an educational placement.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1288	The building project for the school referred to by the Deputy is at an early stage of architectural planning.My Department's officials wrote to the school authorities in September 2005 advising them that they should now proceed to prepare and submit a stage 2 submission, outline sketch scheme. The school authorities had expected to have the submission with my Department by the end of November 2005 but this has been revised to the end of March 2006. As the board of management is the client for this project, responsibility for ensuring that this timeframe is maintained lies with it. Further progression of the project can be made when the stage 2 submission is received.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1289	The school referred to by the Deputy made an application to my Department for extra accommodation for next September under my Department's additional accommodation scheme 2006.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the application has been successful and officials in the school planning section of my Department will be in contact with the school authorities shortly in regard to this matter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1290	I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the school in question was authorised to proceed to stages 4-5 — planning permission-fire certification, bill of quantities-tender documentation — of architectural planning on 14 March 2006. Building projects are examined within my Department in order of priority.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1291	I propose to take Questions Nos. 811 and 828 together.Following examination of the contract documents for the purchase of a site for the school in question, the Chief State Solicitor's office has raised a number of queries. These queries are now being addressed.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1292	In January of this year, I announced details of 62 projects which were being given the go-ahead to proceed with major works such as new school building projects, extensions or refurbishment. The first step for these schools is the appointment of an architectural team that will design and plan the works.As a result of changes to the EU directive for the appointment of consultants, effective from 31 January 2006, the school building section has had to revise its guidance documents in regard to the appointment of design team consultants.This exercise will be completed shortly and the roll-out of advertisements seeking design team consultants for individual school building projects will follow on immediately thereafter.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1293	Under the traditional method of procuring school buildings, design team procedures comprise nine stages. During the early stages of architectural planning of projects, stages 1 to 3, the design and planning of the project is developed from the assessment of site suitability through to the detailed design. Stages 1, 2 and 3 are combined for many projects.The more advanced stages of architectural planning, stages 4 and 5, involve the obtaining of planning permission and the preparation of pre-tender documents. Stages 4 and 5 are combined for the vast bulk of projects. Stages 6 to 9 relate to the procurement of tenders, the placing of contracts, the commencement of construction and post-contract cost control.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that my Department has moved towards greater devolution of the management and delivery of large-scale school building projects to school authorities. The main advantage is that my Department will be in a position to respond more quickly to building needs, having regard to the level of funding available. The processes involved will also reduce the number of stages through which a project must proceed in architectural planning. Chief among new initiatives in this area is the small schools scheme — 135 primary schools will benefit under the scheme this year alone. Funding of over €54 million is being allocated to the schools concerned — double the amount allocated in 2005 and four times the 2004 amount. The number of schools being invited to participate in the scheme has increased by 40% and the rate of funding for individual schools is being increased, on average, by 20%. Grants under the scheme now range from €275,000 to €820,000 depending on school size and the type of works involved. The small schools scheme, which is aimed at primary schools of up to four teachers where enrolment numbers are stable, will address accommodation requirements over the next decade.Over €19 million is being provided to 75 schools this year under the permanent accommodation scheme so that they can deliver additional small scale permanent classroom accommodation.Some 740 schools will spend €78 million on refurbishment works under the summer works scheme in 2006. Since the scheme commenced three years ago, almost 2,000 projects have been carried out in schools at an overall cost in excess of €179 million.A devolved grant scheme for minor works is also provided. The primary responsibility for health and safety in school buildings rests with school management authorities. Approximately €18 million in respect of all primary schools is issued each year under this devolved grant. Each primary school gets a standard rate of €3,809 together with rate of €12.70 per pupil.Apart from devolved initiatives, the school building section of my Department also uses the design and build approach to deliver new buildings as expeditiously as possible. An example of this approach is the delivery of a new 16-classroom primary school in Lucan. The total time taken to complete the project, including design time, was 13 months. The design and build approach will now be piloted at post-primary level with the development of an 800 pupil school in Dublin 15.Standard-generic designs have also been developed by the building unit of my Department for eight and 16-classroom schools. It is expected that use of these designs, wherever possible, will yield substantial savings in terms of design team fees as well as reducing the time taken to bring projects to completion.In addition to these developments, I will be providing 23 new post-primary schools and four new primary schools under a major expansion of the Government's public private partnership programme from 2006-09. The projects targeted for delivery involve new schools in rapidly developing areas, replacements for existing schools and new accommodation for schools formed by the amalgamation of existing schools. The first schools bundle under this programme will go to the market in the first half of 2006.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1294	The school to which the Deputy refers applied for an external environment project under the summer works scheme 2006, SWS. As the Deputy was previously informed, the school planning section of my Department also had on hand at that time an application for additional accommodation from the management authority of the school. This proposed building project was being considered under another scheme. In light of this, the school's summer works scheme application was deemed unsuccessful as it was considered poor value for money to undertake external environment works prior to a proposed building project. The management authority of the school appealed this decision.In the meantime, the school was included on a list which I published recently of 135 primary schools which are being invited to participate in the small schools scheme, SSS, this year. Funding of over €54 million is allocated to this scheme which is aimed at primary schools of up to four teachers and where enrolment numbers are stable to address their accommodation requirements over the next decade. Grants under the scheme range from €275,000 to €820,000 depending on school size and the type of works involved.My Department will await the outcome of its invitation to the school to participate in the SSS before processing the SWS appeal which will become redundant in the event of the former funding being accepted.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1295	The school planning section of my Department has received an application for major capital funding from the management authorities of the school to which the Deputy refers. The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale projects. Progress on the proposed works is being considered in the context of the school building and modernisation programme from 2006 onwards.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1296	The school in question has been invited to participate in the 2006 permanent accommodation scheme. This scheme is intended to provide a permanent long-term solution to a school's accommodation needs, as opposed to the provision of temporary accommodation. It devolves a guaranteed level of funding to school management authorities and allows them to have control of their projects, assists in moving projects more quickly to tender and construction and can also deliver better value for money.The permanent accommodation scheme together with the small schools scheme was originally introduced on a pilot basis. The feedback has in general been very positive, the number of schools participating has increased year-on-year and many schools are anxious to be included.In order to maintain this momentum I have invited 210 schools to participate in these schemes in 2006. These schools have been invited to attend information meetings held by officials from my Department in Tullamore on 20 and 21 March. A school does not have to accept the invitation to participate in a devolved scheme and can instead be considered for inclusion in the mainstream school building programme in line with the project's priority band rating.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1297	I can confirm that an inspection of the school to which the Deputy refers was conducted in the school year 2001-02 as part of the regular programme of school inspections conducted during that year. As the Deputy may be aware, I signed the Education Act 1998 (Publication of Inspection Reports on Schools and Centres for Education) Regulations 2006 and placed these regulations before the Oireachtas in February 2006. The document, Publication of School Inspection Reports: Guidelines, published on 30 January 2006, is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie. The guidelines state that publication procedures will apply to all inspections commenced on or after 6 February 2006.The regulations do not allow for publication of reports of any inspections conducted prior to 6 February 2006. The inspection reports when finalised will be placed on my Department's website.I also wish to advise the Deputy that with regard to the provision of educational reports for a particular child, it is suggested that these matters are raised directly with the school authorities concerned.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1298	Teacher allocations to second level schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments, my Department will consider applications for additional short-term support. An independent appeals mechanism is available to school authorities who wish to appeal the adequacy of their teacher allocation.In the 2005-06 school year, the school in question applied for a concessionary allocation and was allocated 7.22 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. The school was notified of this allocation on 10 May 2005 and was advised that, in the event of it not being satisfied with this allocation, it could appeal in writing to the independent appeals committee. An appeal was submitted by the school and the independent appeals committee decided to award an additional .82 whole-time equivalent teaching posts. The total teaching staff allocation to the school for the 2005-06 school year is 68.10 whole-time equivalent teacher posts. Based on a enrolment of 790 pupils, this level of allocation leaves the school with an actual pupil teacher ratio of 11.6:1.The closing date for applications for additional short-term support for the 2006-07 school year was 3 March 2006. My Department received an application for concessionary hours from the school in question on 16 March 2006 for a total of 156.40 hours for the 2006-07 school year. My Department will be in contact with the school authorities regarding this application shortly.

Once this is finalised, the project will be considered for progression in the context of the school building and modernisation programme 2006-10.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1300	The establishment of a behaviour support team is at the core of many of the recommendations of School Matters — The Report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools. When launching the report on 14 March, I announced that I would be taking immediate steps to establish such a team. The role of this team will span the spectrum from diagnosis of school problems to assistance with remediation. I want the team to be staffed by practitioners of the highest calibre with real on-the-ground experience and the capacity to work collaboratively with those schools experiencing significant discipline problems. My Department will shortly advertise and recruit staff for this team, with the intention that it will be fully operating in the next school year.The behaviour support team will work with schools having significant discipline problems. The task force report supports this focused approach and, to this end, the team will be based regionally. The report also recommends an increase in the staffing of the national educational psychological service, NEPS. Additional psychologists will be recruited by NEPS in order to assign members of that service to work exclusively with the behaviour support team. Other support teams, such as the leadership development for school and the second level support service, will collaborate with the behaviour support team in addressing the causes of behavioural difficulties in some schools. Student behaviour is not a stand-alone issue and cannot be solved in a stand-alone way.When established, the behaviour support team will invite applications from schools experiencing significant discipline problems. Following an initial screening, the team will choose schools for participation in the first phase of its activity. The first step in schools seeking support is one of themselves identifying the existence of a serious discipline problem. The behaviour support team will engage intensively in the school over a period of time, to identify at school level, those measures and changes which need to be put in place in order to bring about real and sustained improvement in student behaviour. The behaviour support team will work, in the first instance, with schools experiencing the most severe discipline problems. Up to 50 schools may be involved in the early phases of the team's work.

No change in this regard is contemplated.Periodic interest by the private sector has been expressed during the past decade or so regarding the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit. Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel, it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993.

The levy has led to a dramatic reduction in use of plastic bags with a consequent positive environmental benefit. Plastic shopping bags accounted for 5% of litter arisings prior to the introduction of the levy, but for just 0.22% of litter arisings in 2004.It is evident that the plastic bag levy continues to have a positive effect on our environment. I am anxious that it should continue to do so and in this context I will keep all aspects of the levy, including the level of the tax, under review.

It is not feasible to provide these at the site currently. If opportunities were to arise to overcome this problem through the acquisition of land, my Department would examine these in conjunction with the Office of Public Works.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1314	My Department has commissioned a research study into apartment size and space standards to inform a review being undertaken of the Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Residential Density, published in 1999. The research study is examining, inter alia, the adequacy of current internal space provision in apartments and will recommend internal space standards relating to overall minimum floor areas for one-bedroom, two-bedroom, three-bedroom apartments and also minimum areas for individual room types, including bedrooms, kitchens, living rooms and dining rooms. The study will also recommend standards regarding internal storage space and external storage space — for example, bicycle shed, waste bins — as well as private open space — balconies, patios, etc. It is my intention to publish proposals on this aspect of the review of the residential density guidelines by the end of May. I am arranging for a copy of the terms of reference for the study to be sent to the Deputy.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1315	I propose to take Questions Nos. 837 and 868 together.In law, preparation of the register of electors is a matter for each local registration authority. It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the co-operation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register. I share the concerns that have been expressed on the quality of the register. Comparison between the results of census 2002 and the register indicates a difference of up to 300,000.My Department wrote to registration authorities on 14 July 2005 and requested them to take all necessary steps to secure significant improvement in the quality of the register. A national awareness campaign was conducted in November 2005 associated with the work on preparation of the register under way at that stage. Also in November 2005, my Department completed work on new and updated guidance for registration authorities on preparing and maintaining the register. The aim of the guidance is to secure significant improvement in the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the register by setting out clearly the legal requirements in this complex area, and identifying best practice for registration authorities in their work on the register.The draft guidance has been circulated for comment to all registration authorities and returning officers and to the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government which, in December 2005, discussed it. Following this consultation process, my Department is finalising the guidance. However, in view of the importance of securing improvements in the register, registration authorities have also been asked to proceed to implement the draft guidance with immediate effect.As regards funding, local authorities meet their general expenditure, including in relation to the register, from a variety of sources such as commercial rates, rents, fees, charges for services, and general purpose grants from the local government fund. In 2006, I allocated general purpose grants to local authorities totalling €875 million, an increase of €57 million, or 7%, over the amount provided last year.As regards census 2006, information published by the CSO at electoral division level should assist registration authorities in compiling the register for their areas. Separate and distinct policy and legislative contexts apply to the carrying out of a census by the CSO and the compilation of the register by registration authorities. It has not been established that it is feasible to link the two processes at the operational level and there are no proposals to do so. I will continue to keep these important issues under close review.

During this phase the system is being closely monitored and users' experiences will feed into the further phases of the rollout, the delivery of user training and the implementation of future system enhancements. Further staff training and rollout of the system is expected over the course of 2006.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1320	I propose to take Questions Nos. 842 and 844 together.As stated in the reply to Question No. 282 of 16 February, the Local Government Computer Services Board, LGCSB, has been commissioned to develop an integrated housing project on behalf of local authorities and my Department.A two-phase approach has been adopted for the implementation of the project. An interim package, Housing Operations Made Easy, HOME, based on a product developed by Kerry County Council, is currently being rolled out to all local authorities, with the exception of Dublin City Council which, due to the scale of its operations, is implementing and financing the development of a system to meet its own needs.Greater reliance on external ICT consultancy support is envisaged in relation to the final phase of the integrated housing system and the LGCSB is now engaged in public procurement for this purpose. The project has not yet been completed and due to its complexity and scale the final phase of the project will take some time to complete.As regards the availability of facilities to apply for local authority housing on-line, various on-line services are available in local authorities including downloading of applications and limited on-line application services. For instance, facilities exist for on-line housing applications in Westmeath County Council, whereby applications may be completed on-line and are then processed in the same way as other applications received. In the absence of on-line citizen authentication services, supporting documentation such as proof of identity, income details, etc., must still be submitted in the traditional way. Also, while it is intended to incorporate an on-line housing application facility in the integrated housing system in the future, my Department has strongly advised local authorities to interview housing applicants when they apply for housing in order to advise them on their housing options and to facilitate them in applying for the housing option most appropriate to their circumstances.

It is their duty to determine the detailed arrangements to be adhered to in the preparation of the register.I understand that, while authorities increasingly make available an on-line register search facility and the relevant forms can be downloaded from registration authority websites, authorities do not provide for direct on-line registration as such systems may not give the necessary assurance to support entry of an individual on the register.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1323	As stated in the reply to Question No. 245 of 2 March 2006, peat extraction below ten hectares in area is exempt development except where it could have significant effects on the environment. The threshold has been set at a level that ensures that the vast majority of sub-threshold peat extractions will not have a significant effect on the environment. However, the planning code recognises that a particular project below this threshold could have significant effects on the environment because of the nature of the project, its location or other particular circumstances. The criteria for determining whether a development would or would not be likely to have significant effects on the environment are set out in Schedule 7 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. As part of their general planning enforcement functions, planning authorities will continue to overview sub-threshold peat extractions in relation to these criteria.A person proposing to carry out peat extraction and who, having regard to the provisions of Schedule 7 of the 2001 regulations, requires guidance as to whether the extraction in question would have significant effects on the environment should consult the appropriate planning authority. If desired, a person may seek a declaration under section 5 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 from the planning authority on the question of whether a development is, or is not, exempted development. The declaration must be issued within four weeks and may be referred to An Bord Pleanála for review.As also outlined in the reply referred to above, peat extraction within peatland areas that have been afforded protection either as special areas of conservation, SACs, of natural heritage areas, NHAs, are subject to a separate control system.

Grants totalling €542,938 were paid to Louth County Council from 1999 to 2005 in respect of improvement works on the R178, and in 2006 a grant of €300,000 was allocated to Louth County Council under the strategic non-national roads scheme of grants for improvement works on the R178 at Ballykelly-Essexford — Redbog.In 2005, my Department sought applications from road authorities for funding under the 2006 EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme. While Monaghan County Council's application included a request for funding of €200,000 in respect of improvement works to the R178 Carrickmacross-Dundalk road, the council listed the proposal as its lowest priority in a prioritised list of 17 schemes submitted and it was not possible to prioritise the project for funding in 2006. Fourteen of the 17 schemes submitted by the council received an allocation from my Department in 2006. No application for funding has been received in my Department for the Essexford Bridge section of the R178 Carrickmacross-Dundalk road.My Department will again be seeking applications under the EU co-financed specific improvements grant scheme later this year and it will be open to Monaghan and Louth County Councils to submit applications for consideration for funding under this scheme in 2007.

The income eligibility for a single income household was increased from €36,800 to €40,000 and from €90,000 to €100,000 for a two-income household. The maximum loan that can be advanced by local authorities for the acquisition or construction of a house has been increased to €185,000. I have no proposals to increase these limits further but will continue to keep them under review.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1326	It is not proposed to reintroduce a generally available house improvement grant scheme. However, there are a number of targeted options currently available to assist vulnerable groups such as lower-income households and elderly persons to secure necessary improvement works to their houses. These include the local authority house improvement loan scheme, the disabled persons and essential repairs grant scheme, the improvement works in lieu of the local authority housing scheme and the task force on special housing aid for the elderly.The recently launched Housing Policy Framework — Building Sustainable Communities will ensure that specific strategies meet the housing of all those with special needs. Some of these strategies are already in place, while others need updating to include specific targets within the action plans. The voluntary and co-operative housing sector has a particular role in this regard. The disabled person's grant and essential repairs grant have been reviewed and will be reformed to improve equity and targeting.

However, Clare County Council is currently reviewing the scheme, including the extent of the catchments to be served and the treatment capacities in each location, with a view to devising proposals that represent more reasonable value for the required Exchequer investment. The same funding principles apply generally throughout the country.The council's revised proposals will be examined as quickly as possible on receipt in my Department with a view to the scheme being advanced to construction stage.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1329	I propose to take Questions Nos. 852 and 853 together.Housing statistics, including annual completions for the past five years, are published in the housing statistics bulletins which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on the Department's website. My Department does not have a definitive breakdown of house completions either by type of purchaser or whether they were second or holiday homes or intended for renting. However, with the unprecedented demand for housing, fuelled mainly by rapid economic growth and demographic changes, it is clear that there has been significant activity over this period by investors and owners of second properties. This is to be expected in a growing economy and can offer gains in terms of the supply of private rented accommodation, tourist accommodation or revitalisation of areas.My Department is currently compiling the output figures for social housing for 2005 on the basis of returns from local authorities. These figures will be published in due course in the Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletin 2005 and on the Department's website at www.environ.ie. Based on returns to date, I expect an increase in the overall number of units delivered under social housing programmes in 2005 when compared with 2004.The Government's response to housing need cannot be judged based on the percentage of new social housings units built as a percentage of the overall supply. First, the growth in overall output of housing in Ireland over the past decade has been unprecedented and this in itself is providing greater choice and access to housing for our growing population. The year 2005 represented a further record year, with nearly 81,000 new homes completed.Second, we now have in place a broad range of targeted measures to meet the needs of lower income groups. In addition to building new homes, local authorities also purchase some second-hand homes for social housing applicants, vacancies arise in the stock and a range of affordable housing schemes are also available. The rolling out of the rental accommodation scheme is further expanding the options available.The record levels of housing output and increased investment in social and affordable housing measures are demonstrated by the positive impacts of which can be seen in the 10% decrease in waiting lists for local authority housing over the period 2002 to 2005.In December 2005, the Government launched Housing Policy Framework — Building Sustainable Communities, which sets out its vision for housing policy over the coming years. The framework envisages a substantial increase in investment involving €4 billion in Exchequer capital between 2006 and 2008, which will allow for some 50,000 households to be assisted over the coming three years. We will also be implementing a programme of reforms particularly focused on improving the quality of the social housing environment.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1330	Each year, my Department undertakes an advertising campaign to coincide with the publication of the draft register of electors to encourage electors to check the draft and ensure that they are correctly registered. Over recent years, the advertising campaign has included elements specifically targeted at young people.Electoral law has been amended on an ongoing basis to make voting more accessible to young people. Under the Electoral Act 1992, students who live away from home while attending college have the choice of being registered at their home address or their student residential address. The Electoral Act 1997 provides that students pursuing a course of study on a full-time basis at an educational institution in the State, who are registered at, but living away from, home and cannot attend their polling station, may apply for entry in the postal voters list. In addition, under the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001, the grounds for making application for entry in the supplement to the register were widened to allow a person who reaches 18 years of age on or before polling day to apply for entry in the supplement to the register. Previously, the cut-off point was the closing date for the supplement.In accordance with electoral law, a person must be 18 years of age in order to vote. This is consistent with the position in most countries, including the EU member states. While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals at present to reduce the voting age in Ireland.

My Department's involvement with the scheme relates primarily to the provision of funds for individual projects. The administration of the scheme, and the certification that particular projects comply with the terms of the scheme, are the responsibility of the appropriate local authority.Persons who are victims of domestic violence and are not able to afford their own accommodation may apply for local authority housing. It is a matter for individual local authorities to assess eligibility for local authority housing in accordance with their scheme of letting priorities.

RAS is designed to cater for the accommodation needs of certain persons in receipt of rent supplement, normally for more than 18 months and who have a long-term housing need. Since persons on a back-to-work allowance scheme keep their current social welfare rent supplement payment on a tapered withdrawal basis over a four year period, they are normally considered to be progressing towards a situation where they can meet their own needs, including housing needs. However, if such persons can demonstrate a long-term housing need they may be considered for a range of housing supports, including RAS.

The figures provided show monthly discharges and cover a total of 30 different radionuclides.The data available to the institute show that the level of discharges of some radionuclides has remained constant, others show an increase and others show a reduction. Significantly, there has been a marked reduction in recent years in discharges of Technetium-99. Discharges of Technetium-99, which is a radionuclide with a very long half-life, have been a matter of concern not just to Ireland but also to some of the Nordic countries, notably Norway.Radioactive discharges from Sellafield are authorised, within prescribed limits, by the UK Environment Agency. The annual discharge authorisation limit in respect of Technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield was reduced in October 2004 by the agency from 90 terabecquerels per annum to 20 terabecquerels. I understand this will be further reduced shortly to ten terabecquerels per annum.The Irish Government regards discharges from Sellafield into the Irish Sea as totally unacceptable. The Government, in accordance with the commitment in the agreed programme for Government, has taken significant steps to bring about the reduction of radioactive discharges from Sellafield as well as the ultimate closure of the plant. This policy objective has been advanced through direct contact with the UK, both at ministerial and official level, through action within multilateral environmental agreements, in particular the OSPAR Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic, and through legal actions under the OSPAR convention itself as well as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.The adoption in 1998 of the OSPAR strategy with regard to radioactive substances by the contracting parties to the OSPAR convention, which include Ireland and the UK, was a recognition of the concerns expressed by a number of OSPAR contracting parties, notably Ireland and some Nordic countries, about radioactive discharges to the marine environment. The objective of this strategy is that by the year 2020, discharges of radioactive substances to the marine environment are reduced, by way of progressive and substantial reductions, to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels arising from such discharges, are close to zero.The first of a number of periodic evaluation reports on progress towards achievement of the objectives of the strategy is currently being prepared by OSPAR for consideration at the next OSPAR Commission meeting, which will take place at end of June 2006.While the UK Government has stressed that it is committed to implementing the OSPAR strategy, Ireland will remain actively involved in the OSPAR process to ensure that the strategy is fully implemented by all contracting parties in a manner consistent with the aims of the strategy and within the 2020 timeframe.

Enforcement of the registration provisions, including prosecution, where appropriate, is the statutory responsibility of the Private Residential Tenancies Board. I am not aware that deficiencies are evident in powers available to the board in that regard. The duties of the Private Residential Tenancies Board include that of reviewing the operation of the Act and making recommendations to the Minister for amendments, as appropriate. I will consider any such recommendations as well as any relevant suggestions from other sources that may be received, following an adequate period of experience of the operation of the legislation. There are no proposals to amend the registration fee provisions in the Residential Tenancies Act.The composite fee referred to in the question is available to a landlord registering a number of tenancies within a single building within the applicable time limit. In practice this concession is available only in the immediate aftermath of the coming into operation of Part 7 of the 2004 Act or on first letting of the dwellings within a building. Once the first year has elapsed, the composite fee will not be applicable unless all of the tenants of the dwellings remain permanently in occupation for each four-year tenancy cycle or they all leave at the one time and all the replacement tenancies commence within a period of less than one month.The Residential Tenancies Act does not impose any fines on landlords who provide incomplete information in their registration applications but a double fee applies for late registration, that is, after the tenancy has existed for more than one month, and the PRTB has no discretion in this regard. However, I understand that if an incomplete application is received by the PRTB within the specified time limit, it will return the form to the landlord to insert the missing data. Provided this is completed and returned to the board, payment of the late fee will not be required in those circumstances.The statutory obligations applying to tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act require that no act or omission on their part should cause landlords to be in breach of their statutory requirements. Failure to provide the necessary registration data or to sign the registration application form are grounds for the termination of the tenancy by the landlord. The double fee encourages voluntary compliance by landlords with the registration requirement, as also does the fact that access to the PRTB's dispute resolution service is not available to landlords of unregistered tenancies. Compliance generally will, I expect, also be facilitated by the linkage in the 2006 Finance Act between registration and eligibility for deductibility of interest.

Enforcement of the regulations is a function of local authorities, which have powers under the 1992 Act to enter and inspect at all reasonable times a house to which the regulations apply. Where an authority finds an incidence of non-compliance with a provision of the regulations it serves a notice on the landlord requiring specified works to be undertaken. Contravention of the regulations constitutes an offence and such offences are prosecuted by the local authorities. The penalties applying to convictions were increased in 2004 to a fine of up to €3,000 or imprisonment for a term of up to six months or both. The penalty applying to conviction for a continuing offence was increased to €250 per day at that time.

The policy framework, which provides among other things for the metering of the non-domestic sector, was agreed by Government in 1998.It is a requirement of water pricing policy that the cost of providing water services to the non-domestic sector should be fully recovered by local authorities by means of a meter based volumetric charge. While current arrangements for schools may, in common with many other non-domestic users, be based on fixed water services charges local authorities are moving towards the metering of all non-domestic water use. This will provide a transparent and equitable cost recovery mechanism for water services which should incentivise all non-domestic users including schools to conserve their use of water.Interdepartmental discussions have not been taking place on this matter.

The NRA assesses applications for grant assistance under the non-national roads scheme on behalf of the Department. The criteria for grant approval are based on accident data, inspection of sites, locations showing demonstrable hazard and discussions between the local authority and the NRA. Applications were invited from local authorities in 2005 for consideration for grant assistance in 2006 under this scheme. In 2006, the Department has allocated over €3.5 million to local authorities in respect of low-cost safety improvement works on non-national roads.Local authorities may also use discretionary improvement and block grants, which are allocated to county councils and urban authorities respectively, to fund such works. In 2006, discretionary improvement and block grant allocations to local authorities total almost €40 million. The prioritisation of works to be funded from these grants is a matter for each local authority.The appointment of school wardens is a matter for local authorities under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2004.

In effect, the scheme offers home ownership in a number of steps to purchasers who cannot afford full outright ownership in the traditional way.The statutory provisions underpinning the scheme provide, inter alia, that responsibility for management and control of a house leased by way of shared ownership shall not lie with the housing authority. Accordingly, owners of apartments bought by way of shared ownership, in multi-unit structures to which management company arrangements apply would, in common with the other owners of units, have to hold membership of the management company and pay the appropriate charges including, agreed maintenance charges.

These regulations give legal effect to the action programme and provide for compliance by Ireland with the terms of the judgment of the European Court of Justice delivered in March 2004 which held that Ireland was non-compliant with the nitrates directive. The action programme and regulations were prepared jointly by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food, in consultation with Teagasc, and involved an extensive consultation process with farming organisations and other interested parties. The regulations generally came into effect on 1 February 2006 with specific provisions coming into effect on a phased basis up to 2008.Part 3 of the regulations deals with nutrient management planning and is based on long-standing Teagasc advice. Subsequent to the making of the regulations, Teagasc indicated that it may be possible to review part of this advice in a way which could improve their effectiveness. My Department secured agreement with the European Commission that there was merit in allowing time for this advice to be elaborated and, accordingly, I announced a brief de facto deferral of the implementation of Part 3.I received a copy of the Teagasc advice as regards phosphorus and nitrogen limits on Friday 3 March 2006 and this is being considered carefully by both Departments. However, details of key research cited by Teagasc in support of their new advice and which were sought by my Department and the Department of Agriculture and Food have yet to be received. In order to advance urgent consideration of the issues involved officials from my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and Teagasc will meet with representatives of the European Commission on the matter tomorrow; the Commission has already been provided with a copy of the Teagasc advice of 3 March. In principle, I am open to considering proposals for the more effective operation of all regulations under my control.Any new formulation in the present case will however have to respect the environmental requirements associated with the nitrates directive and will require the agreement of the European Commission.The Government's approach at all stages has been to identify efficient and least-cost solutions to implementing the environmental requirements of the nitrates directive. Advice and assistance is being made available to all farmers to facilitate them in adapting to the new regime; this includes new tax reliefs now being introduced together with improved grants schemes.Ireland is now seeking a derogation from 170 kg to 250 kg organic nitrogen per hectare with the Commission for the benefit in particular to 10,000 dairy farmers. This process commenced formally at the EU nitrates committee meeting on 12 December 2005, when an outline of Ireland's proposal was presented. Following detailed discussions between officials of my Department, the Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission, a detailed scientific argument in support of the proposal was finalised and submitted to the Commission on 9 February 2006. The scientific case in support of the derogation was prepared by the Department of Agriculture and Food in consultation with Teagasc and my Department.The derogation proposal will need to be considered at future meetings of the nitrates committee before approval can be obtained. While the objective had been to secure agreement on a derogation by mid-2006, at present these discussions are in abeyance pending finalisation of the issues arising from the latest Teagasc advice.

This proposal is under consideration in the context of the 2006 fire services capital programme, which has not yet been finalised, having regard to the existing facilities, the level of activity, the proximity of other fire stations, the fire authority's priorities and the competing demands of other fire authorities for the available funding.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1365	Section 142 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that a decision regarding representation by members of a local authority at a conference is a reserved function for the local elected members alone, subject to the council being satisfied that attendance is justified by reference to the benefits likely to accrue, the general interests of its administrative area and the local community, and the total cost involved.The legislation requires that any member who attends such an event should submit a summary of the proceedings to the next ordinary meeting of the local authority. This provides a mechanism for the council to be informed of the proceedings of the conference by those members representing them at the event. It is a matter for each local authority to ensure that it complies with these requirements. Material recently supplied by city and county councils to my Department indicates that most local authorities have established reporting arrangements consistent with the above requirement.

In a situation, for example, of a serious infestation of poison-resistant rats or mice, the licensing of the use of such traps by professionals under strict conditions might however have to be considered in the absence of any effective alternative means of control.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1367	In order to be able to vote at elections and referenda in this jurisdiction, a person's name must be entered in the register of electors for a constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides.Postal voting is provided for in respect of certain categories of person as specified in electoral law. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting by wholetime members of the Defence Forces, members of the Garda, and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. Subsequent legislation enacted by the Oireachtas has extended postal voting to other categories: electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or a physical disability — the Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996; electors whose occupation, service or employment make it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day — in these cases, the law provides for completion of the necessary voting documentation at a Garda station (the Electoral Act 1997); full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State — the Electoral Act 1997; and certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency where they reside — the Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001.While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements along the lines referred to in the question.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1370	The Building Control Bill 2005 assigns a limited role only to the registration body, RIAI. First, the basic registration eligibility criteria are specified in the Bill and will not be determined by the registration body. Second, key decisions on admission of individual applicants to the register of architects will not be made by the registration body, but by an admission board and technical assessment board.There will also be the safeguard of the right of appeal against refusal of registration to an appeals board and, ultimately, to the High Court. Finally, the Bill provides that a majority of the members of the various boards will be lay persons, non-architects, under the chairmanship of a retired judge or a lawyer.Having regard to the above, it is not proposed to accept the suggestions of the Competition Authority to amend the provisions of the Building Control Bill 2005 in relation to registration arrangements. However, the authority has proposed a number of other detailed amendments of the Bill which I will take into account on Committee Stage.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1371	My Department maintains close ongoing contact with the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, regarding progress on the implementation generally of the provisions of the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. However, statutory responsibility for the registration of tenancies and the provision of information relating to this and other aspects of the private rented sector rests with the PRTB under the Act. Requests for information relating to the PRTB's functions may appropriately be directed to the board at Canal House, Canal Road, Ranelagh, Dublin 6.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1372	I propose to take Questions Nos. 903 and 904 together.The operation of fire services and fire safety in Ireland is governed by the Fire Services Acts 1981 and 2003 and by regulations made under those Acts. The legislation applies to all buildings except single domestic dwellings. The fire services legislation places a duty of care on persons in control of premises to take all reasonable measures to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises and to ensure as far as reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire.In addition, the legislation places a duty on every person on the premises to conduct himself or herself in such a way as to ensure that as far as is reasonably practicable any person on the premises is not exposed to danger from fire as a consequence of any act or omission by him or her.My Department has produced a number of fire safety guidance documents to assist owners and occupiers of premises in meeting their statutory responsibilities. These include the code of practice for the management of fire safety in places of assembly, the code of practice for safety at indoor concerts and the code of practice for fire safety of furnishings and fittings in places of assembly. These codes deal, inter alia, with matters such as maximum attendance numbers and types of seating.Building regulations under the Building Control Act, 1990 set out the requirements, including fire safety requirements, to be met in the design and construction of new buildings and in carrying out material alterations to existing buildings. The regulations require that buildings be designed and constructed in a manner that provides adequate means of escape in case of fire to a place of safety outside the building, which is capable of being safely and effectively used. Under the Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations 1985, the person in control of a premises must ensure that all escape routes to a place of safety are kept unobstructed and immediately available for use; the locking of exits and blocking of escape routes from places of assembly is a specific offence.It is a function of the District Court when considering licensing applications under various enactments to determine maximum numbers in respect of premises. Under section 24 of the Fire Services Act 1981, fire authorities are notice parties to the applications for such licences and may appear, be heard and adduce evidence in respect of an application. The fire services legislation gives extensive advisory, inspection and enforcement powers to the local fire authorities. Occupant capacity issues and maximum numbers permitted on the premises are reviewed as part of inspections, including during performance inspections, of licensed premises undertaken by fire authority inspectors under the Fire Services Acts. An inspector may, in addition to his or her advisory and inspection powers, serve a closure notice with immediate effect where he or she is of the opinion that a premises poses a serious or immediate risk to the safety of persons on or in the premises. These measures are in addition to the powers of the Garda Síochána and other public authorities under other legislative codes.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1377	Part 17 of the Local Government Act 2001 provides that qualified electors of a town having a population of at least 7,500 as ascertained at the last preceding census and not having a town council may make a proposal for the establishment of such a council. Under the relevant provisions of the Act, a proposal to establish a town council, and the timing of any such proposal, is a matter for the local community in the first instance, with a decision on such a proposal being a reserved function of the relevant county council, following a public consultation process. I am considering the steps necessary to commence the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act and I have initiated consultation with local government interests in regard to the creation of new town councils and their prospective functional responsibilities under the Act.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2006-03-21 00:00:00	Prelude	1378	While vehicle registration is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners, information on the number of imported used vehicles licensed for the first time for the years 2000 to 2004 inclusive is published by my Department as Table 19 of the annual Irish Bulletin of Vehicle and Driver Statistics 2004 which is available in the Oireachtas Library. The number for the year 2005 is 61,350 vehicles.
