          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_12">I welcome Ms Kathleen Doyle, the taxi regulator, and Mr. Bernard Feeney of Goodbody Economic Consultants.  I also welcome the delegates from the Committee on Regional Development of the Northern Ireland Assembly who are in the Visitors Gallery.  We are delighted to have our friends from Northern Ireland at this meeting.  I understand they have had a productive day in Dublin thus far.  We look forward to their presentation later in the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I propose that we begin with a short presentation by Ms Doyle and Mr. Feeney, after which there will be a question and answer session.  Members received the comprehensive document submitted by Ms Doyle.  Therefore, I ask that she merely provide a short summary of it.  In keeping with our scrutiny and oversight role, I ask that she provide the details of the tender process for this contract, as well as the details of any previous contracts awarded to Goodbody Economic Consultants.  We would also like to know the identities of the other tenderers, the prices they offered, the reasons the contract was awarded to Goodbody Economic Consultants and the details of any previous contracts offered in regard to the taxi industry.  If Ms Doyle cannot provide all of this information today, I ask that she do so as soon as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">I invite Ms Doyle to make a short presentation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Ms Kathleen Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_15">I thank the Chairman for inviting me to attend this meeting, together with Mr. Feeney, to discuss the economic review of the small public service vehicle industry.  The Commission for Taxi Regulation engaged Goodbody Economic Consultants to conduct a review of the trends shaping the general environment in which the industry operated and an assessment of the economic impact of the liberalisation of the sector.  Copies of the independent review which was published on 9 March have been circulated, together with a presentation of the key findings of the review.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">I will briefly outline the scope of the review and the methodology used.  The review focused, in particular, on supply and demand issues and industry earnings.  As part of this, there was an extensive review of commission publications and statistical information.  Extensive face-to-face consultations were undertaken with key stakeholders.  Data collection was conducted through a series of surveys, with research into international experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">One of the key findings of the review is that consumer demand has increased, with a minimum of 100 million trips being taken in 2008, placing an estimated value of €1.5 billion on the industry.  The volume of cab trips has increased by 25% since the last economic review was undertaken in 2005.  Small public service vehicles, including taxis, hackneys and limousines, are used more than other modes of public transport such as buses and trains.  Although there is increased business use, social and recreational trips remain the main reason for using cabs.  Nationally, 63% of trips are now arranged by telephone, while 37% are arranged on the street.  The majority are taken between Thursday and Saturday, which reflects the predominantly recreational usage.  While the review found that people with disabilities continued to have problems accessing services, overall trends show greater use of and confidence in the sector among the general public.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The review found there had been a significant increase in supply since the liberalisation of the market.  For example, many second drivers of taxis, known as "cosies", have purchased their own licences.  Between 2000 to 2003, significant numbers of hackneys transferred to taxis.  There was lower growth in supply in the industry between 2004 and 2008 and a sharp decline in the number of new entrants since mid-2008.  The limousine sector is growing, while the hackney service continues to be prominent in non-urban areas.  Some 8.7 million work shifts were undertaken by the industry in 2008.  Supply peaked between Thursday and Saturday but was less peaked than demand.  The exit rate in the industry is not high.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">As I mentioned, the report identified a deficiency in supply for people with disabilities, with wheelchair accessible licences accounting for only 6% of the overall fleet.  Usage among this sector is low compared with that of the general population.  This low usage is probably a function of both availability and affordability issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">It has been difficult to ascertain precise data on the earnings of full-time drivers because of varying working hours and the fact that data received from drivers and consumers differed in terms of the average fare paid.  While drivers stated the average fare was approximately €9, household surveys indicate it is approximately €15.  The report found that drivers had to work longer hours to achieve their income targets, with some earning below the average industrial wage.  The driving down of incumbent drivers' earnings is a normal effect of competition, but the review found that earnings were not collapsing.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Full-time drivers work, on average, 52 hours a week, with 25% working in excess of 60 hours and 11.2% working more than 70 hours.  The part-time service provides a valuable contribution at peak time, with some 54% of part-time drivers offering service at peak times compared with 36% of full-time drivers.  Part-time service is necessary as certain parts of the country could be deprived of a service without it.  The commission can consider the capability of the taximeter for recording hours worked and drivers' earnings in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">As for dispatch operators, more than 400 such operators are registered with the commission nationally, with 40% of cabs affiliated to them.  An increased number of business users use them.  The figures increased from 50% in 2005 to 60% in 2008 and 90% of businesses are satisfied with the services provided.  However, wheelchair users still encounter difficulties in accessing services from dispatch operators.  Moreover, the review notes that increased affiliation to such operators could reduce external congestion costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">In respect of congestion, there are 13,200 cabs versus 470,000 private cars in Dublin.  Cabs, therefore, contribute approximately 9% of car kilometres in Dublin, whereas private cars contribute 91%.  While cabs contribute to congestion, they also can reduce it during peak times when drivers leave cars at home and use SPSV services.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">From an international perspective, New York usually is the entity compared with Ireland.  However, it has a restricted market resulting in poor quality service, long waiting times and high levels of dissatisfaction.  Therefore, we have used Washington DC which is more similar to Dublin in that there are no quantitative restrictions on entry, raised standards and a similar number of cabs per thousand of population.  Other countries also have adopted regulatory models close to the Irish model, including Austria, Netherlands and Japan, and half of the local authorities in the United Kingdom.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">As for the regulatory environment, the OECD and the World Bank support the approach to regulation adopted in Ireland with an emphasis on quality regulation combined with entry deregulation.  Moreover, the current regulatory structure is supported by the economic review.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">In respect of the impact of liberalisation, consumer use continues to grow, which is of benefit to consumers in terms of reduced waiting times and satisfaction with the quality of service provided.  However, increased competition is making it difficult for drivers who had enjoyed low levels of competition prior to liberalisation.  The market now is highly competitive and drivers work longer hours to achieve income targets.  Enforcement activities have indicated low levels of non-compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">As for a possible moratorium, the review shows the decision as to what is an appropriate level of cabs should be left to the market.  Current exit levels are not high and the rate of entry is in decline and, therefore, is not a reason for a moratorium.  Congestion is not a reason for a moratorium, as peak demand at night time demonstrates the SPSV supply contributes to reduced congestion.  The review also states the reduction in drivers' income is insufficient to justify a moratorium.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The commission proposes to take a number of next steps which are set out in the presentation before members.  They include the consideration of fast-tracking of new vehicle and driver standards for incumbent licence holders.  Details of the recommendations were advertised in national newspapers last Monday inviting submissions from all interested parties to give submissions to the Commission for Taxi Regulation by 5 May, after which the commission will evaluate all the submissions received and seek advice from the advisory council before making any further changes or introducing new reforms.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">As I stated, Ms Doyle has covered much of the detail contained in the report and I do not propose to repeat it.  However, I will emphasise a couple of points.  First, the methodology we embraced involved substantial data collection, including household surveys and surveys of business users, cab operators and people with disabilities, as well as an extensive consultation process involving various stakeholders, in particular those representing cab operators.  In addition — this probably will address the issue raised — I wish to emphasise that it is an economic review in the sense that it examines the issues that arise regarding the operation of the cab industry from the perspective of the impact of such factors or issues on the operation of the cab market.  It considered all these matters and asked how the issues that had arisen were affecting the efficient operation of the cab market and drew conclusions on that basis.  That perspective underpinned our approach to the assignment.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">I will add a little on the issue of a moratorium.  We considered it from a number of angles, most notably by considering the extent to which there might be excess supply in the marketplace and whether this might justify the introduction of a moratorium.  Essentially, the conclusion to which we came in this regard was that if it could be proved there was a high turnover within the cab industry in the sense of large numbers of operators entering and exiting the industry within a short time, such substantial churning within the industry would be an indication that there was excessive supply.  This would be a <i>prima facie</i> case for doing something or intervening in the context of a moratorium.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Will Mr. Feeney repeat what he said in respect of churning?  He should explain what it is.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Bernard Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_45">This issue arises because one of the various arguments made on the question of a moratorium is that the cab industry is oversupplied.  Consequently, from our perspective, it was important to try to define what oversupply meant.  From an economic perspective, oversupply occurs when people enter the cab market with a view to achieving an anticipated level of earnings, find they are unable to so do and exit within a short period.  As a result, the process of churning arises, which would maintain supply in a marketplace at a higher level than would be appropriate or correct.  If such churning were found to occur, one could state the market was oversupplied and at least one would have a basis for coming to the conclusion that perhaps there should be some restriction on numbers or, alternatively, that some other way of reducing them should be introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">This is how we define oversupply in the market.  When we examined the data, we found that at least in the period to date, this element of churning had not proved to be excessive.  In other words, we do not see large numbers exiting from the marketplace.  In addition, in recent times we have found that the numbers entering the cab industry are in decline.  On that basis — this is the only evidence we have — we concluded that the market was beginning to stabilise in some fashion, that excessive churning was not taking place and that, therefore, one could not state the market was oversupplied.  As a result, we drew the conclusions that we did, although we noted in our report that a situation could arise in which churning could become more excessive.  In other words, if economic circumstances continue to deteriorate and as a result, there is an influx of new entrants into the cab market in the coming year, such entrants might find they cannot make a living within the industry or meet their anticipated earnings and might leave the industry within a short period and this churning process would develop.  We recommended to the commission that it should monitor the situation closely and put in place a formal system of assessing the rate of entry to and exit from the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">I put it to Ms Doyle and Mr. Feeney that the committee's examination of the question on the moratorium did not relate to taxi drivers' income alone.  Rather, it related to standards of service and the chaos in the industry.  Using any objective criteria, Mr. Feeney has got this wrong.  His report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_58">Precise data on cab drivers' earnings are difficult to obtain.  However, comparison of estimated earnings over time indicates that full-time Dublin taxi drivers experienced a reduction in nominal earnings in the period 2005 to 2008.  This reduction has been mitigated to a degree by the fares increase granted in late 2008, resulting in a net reduction of approximately 5 per cent in gross earnings for this category.  It is clear, therefore, that drivers' earnings are not collapsing as some industry sources would suggest.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">This is a ridiculous finding.  Is Mr. Feeney telling the committee that, between 2005 and 2008, Dublin taxi drivers experienced an income reduction of only 5%?  He should answer this question first.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The report's methodology involved face-to-face consultations with key stakeholders, including national and regional industry representatives, and the completion of questionnaires by small public service vehicle, SPSV, drivers.  When did the 5% figure arise during those interviews?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_30">
          <from>Mr. Bernard Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_61">Let me explain the basis for the earnings calculations.  We have undertaken or been involved in such studies since 1998, when we undertook similar studies for Dublin Corporation.  In that time, we have attempted to establish the earnings of cab operators by using various methodologies.  I remember one instance in which we issued log books to drivers and asked them to fill in the details of their trips, earnings and so on, but we received little response.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">We have learned that it is best to survey cab operators directly, either on a face-to-face basis or via postal survey, to try to get details from them in terms of their number of trips, working hours, average fares and so on and to build estimates accordingly.  This was our approach in our 2005 review.  A prime consideration during the current review was that we ensure consistency of methodology with the 2005 review, as this would give us an idea of the relative movements in earnings and recognise that any earnings estimates would be subject to the statistical errors associated with surveys.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">The earnings figure was derived from our methodology.  We sent approximately 2,800 questionnaires to cab drivers and received 512 replies.  We analysed what they told us about their operations to arrive at an estimate of their earnings.  We concluded that, as reported, their annual gross earnings amounted to approximately €33,000 each.  Taking operational costs into account, full-time cab operators' net earnings amounted to €16,000 or €17,000.  Our study found that hourly net earnings are low because drivers operate an average of 52 hours per week, as Ms Doyle stated.  This is an increase on the 2005 estimate.  Their hourly earnings are below the average industrial wages of manufacturing workers or other groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_64">Using the same methodology, a comparison of the 2005 and 2008 figures showed that, prior to the fare increase, drivers' nominal earnings had decreased by approximately 13%.  Given the fare increase's impact, we surmised that the difference could be reduced to 5%.  We also found that the number of hours worked had increased by an approximate average of 10%.</p>

Considering the earnings reported to our study and their distribution, there is a difference between individual cab drivers.  Some reported low earnings.  For example, a significant number reported gross earnings of less than €20,000.  Others reported earnings of greater than €40,000.  There is a variation.</p>

          <p eId="para_69">Before I hand over to Deputy O'Dowd, the methodology described in the report is like reading the front of <i>The Beano</i>.  Mr. Feeney has no idea about drivers’ incomes.  The driver of any cab into which one gets will tell one that he or she is earning below the minimum wage.  They cannot all be fooling us.  I have been in five or six cabs in recent weeks, the drivers of which told me that they earned €50 over eight or nine hours.  The report’s finding is ludicrous and every cab driver in this city and throughout the country is hopping mad about it.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">I defend Mr. Feeney's right to put his profession on the line at this meeting and to supply this report.  I accept his professional comments and disagree profoundly with the Chairman's choice of adjectives, which were unfair and unprofessional.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">I wish to address a different question and to home in on the core issue.  Churning involves people leaving the industry.  The problem lies in that there is nowhere for them to go.  According to Mr. Feeney's report, were I a cab driver, my wages would undoubtedly be decreasing.  We all know that this is the case.  The market is contracting.  In terms of public transport usage, the number of Luas trips has decreased by more than 1 million in the past year.  Journeys on the Luas and Dublin Bus have declined significantly so it is a fact that taxi drivers are in the same position.  I will not go into the point that self-employed people return different things but the point is that their standards of living are dropping.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The report states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_73">The present regulatory system has worked well and should be retained.  There is an insufficient justification at present for an adjustment to the regulatory structure through the introduction of a moratorium.</p>

I respect the professionalism and integrity of Mr. Feeney and I accept what he is saying.  Since that time, when Mr. Feeney finished preparing the report, the situation has changed radically.  While I have problems with a blank moratorium because of the issues such as the number of cabs adapted for people with disabilities and I have a problem with saying that if 100,000 people become unemployed, none of them can become taxi drivers, we must address the fundamental issue for change in some form of moratorium, although I do not want to use that term.  It must be made more difficult.  These taxi drivers cannot go anywhere else.  Anywhere they go in Dublin or in Drogheda there are lines of taxis and no one is using them.</p>
          <p eId="para_77">As a committee, we must take on board what is in the report but because of the changed economic circumstances, we must re-examine the conclusions.  I accept the integrity of what Mr. Feeney is saying but things have changed since then.</p>

That commonality has been embraced by regulation across a number of sectors in Ireland.  It applies to taxis, telecoms and electricity.  There is a well-founded and established view of how the market works, how it should work and what regulators are doing to improve the efficiency of the market.  This is found in textbooks that deal with microeconomics that are taught in all universities.</p>

          <p eId="para_80">Mr. Feeney states that he received responses on earnings from 500 people.  In recent weeks 3,000 to 4,000 appeared at one time in front of the Dáil.  These are family men and women with small families who tell us a difficult tale of their struggles to earn any kind of living in the current market place with 27,000 licences.  I met more than 500 taxi drivers and have walked around town with them.  I have listened to the serious situation of these families.  Did Mr. Feeney take into account the human side of this?  This market is operated by real people.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">Regarding earnings, did Mr. Feeney discount the entry costs and the fact that so many drivers are part-time and a significant number of drivers have a full-time second job?

When we survey individuals about their incomes there is a tendency to understate incomes.  That is true of most of our experience.  When cab drivers report earnings we tend to think they may be on the low side.  Having said that, I do not deny what the Deputy states, that earnings are low.  The kernel of the matter is that if one were to introduce a moratorium on the basis of those earnings, it would amount to the State intervening to maintain the incomes of a particular group of workers.  One must then ask the question that if for cab drivers, why not for road operators, bus drivers and so on?</p>

          <p eId="para_97">The idea of a moratorium as it emerged from this committee was to try to bring order to the industry.  The earnings of cab drivers comprise only one small but significant part of that.  When we first received a report from the regulator she told us about a number of initiatives that were to be undertaken by her office that have not been possible owing to the inability to come up with the money, the shortage of manpower, the fact that there are only nine regulators and the fact that the Garda Síochána was supposed to hand over the testing process, which was a farce.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">The group from Northern Ireland told the clerk to the committee that when they asked for a cab from Connolly Station to Buswells Hotel.  The cab driver did not know where Buswells Hotel was nor how to get to it.  This chaos is in the industry and the regulator's inability to deal with it effectively is the main reason this committee suggested a moratorium, although it is not yet agreed.  The moratorium would enable the regulator to put some order on the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_99">I have a brief question on the hours.  A damning conclusion of the report is that one quarter of all drivers are working more than 60 hours.  An astonishing proportion of those drivers with a second job are working 70 hours and upwards.  They do a full-time job and then work an extra 20 or 30 hours.  To what extent was this factored in on the economic side?  We have the EU working time directive.  Did either of the witnesses run this situation past the Health and Safety Authority?  Does the regulator consider it has any implications for service quality and for the basic working conditions of taxi workers?</p>

          <p eId="para_100">Deputy Broughan raised many of the issues I want to discuss.  We seem to be stating that we will stay as we are and that we cannot do anything about this business.  Many people will become unemployed and the first thing a high percentage of these people will go for is a taxi.  To give an example, I met a civil servant who has a good pension and who is driving a taxi.  He told me he goes out only when it suits him.  We have an artificial type of service because a large number of people who work in the taxi business are not dependent on it for a living.  This creates a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">On Deputy Broughan's point that drivers do not know where they are going, a high percentage of them use sat-nav.  I think these should be banned in taxis because they do not always give one the shortest route from A to B.  Many fraudulent people work in the industry and very little is being done about this.  The only way to sort this out is to introduce a moratorium to get a handle on it but this is not happening.  It is unfair to people.  The old type of a taxi driver who worked hard for a living and who has been there for many years is being squeezed out of the business by people who are not dependent on it for a living.  This is the bottom line.  As Deputy Broughan stated, we must take into account people's livelihoods.  We cannot make it so difficult that it is not worth one's while working.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">There are other issues with regard to taxi ranks, such as the one on Amiens Street which I passed this morning.  Every morning, the street is jammed up by taxis and it is only a matter of time before a serious accident occurs in the area.  There is not enough room for the amount of taxis on the road.  We receive reports to beat the band but we do not seem to be making progress.  What are the witnesses terms of reference for these reports and what do they cost?</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_103">I welcome the witnesses to the meeting.  We have discussed this matter at great length over a number of weeks and months.  Naturally, I accept the level of professionalism Mr. Feeney has put into this report and I am not in a position to question his findings because I do not have the professional knowledge.  We will work on that basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">I would be the last person to want to interfere with open competition and I have always stated this.  Somehow or other the message of what this committee wanted to do seems to have been diluted or twisted.  To my knowledge nobody here wants to interfere with open competition in the market.  It would be bad.  It was bad before the liberalisation programme but now, based on the people I meet and the evidence I can gather, so many families depend on income from taxis that over the past six months it has fallen asunder.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">The fanciful term "churning" was used.  Many more people would exit the industry if they had somewhere else to go but they do not.  There is nowhere to go.  They have paid their money and established themselves and it is their job to ferry commuters to where they want to go.  They work extraordinarily long hours.  I saw comments made by taxi drivers and many of them disagree with this.  However, a number of fundamental points show that they work in a very poorly paying industry.  This is the bottom line of the document.  It reminds me of the dairy farmers and how their incomes have tumbled.  Something must be done about this industry as it must be done about the dairy sector.  What can be done is another matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">I see nothing but great sense in implementing a moratorium, and a term of three years has been mentioned.  All we are speaking about is slowing down the system and having no newcomers for three years.  This will provide the regulator, Ms Doyle, with an opportunity to do all that she told us had to be done on the last occasion she was before the committee, with which I agree.  I will not go through the raft of measures that the regulator's office must take and which Ms Doyle agreed she must do.  Whatever the reason for not having done them surely there will be a better chance of implementing them over the next three years without an intake of newcomers into the industry.  I hope a moratorium is introduced and that the mechanism used will automatically remove it after three years and that there would be no danger that a Minister or committee would even dream of extending it.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The taxi industry is very unsettled and does not know where is its future.  It has been particularly badly hit by the downturn of the past six months.  All one needs to do is mention the average of 52 hours per week which Mr. Feeney found people had to work for €40,000 gross income which would leave one with a net income of €16,000 or €20,000 after everything has been paid.  This is a very poor return for their labour.  It makes great sense that, provided all the other measures mentioned by my colleagues and by the regulator at a previous meeting are taken, a cap on numbers is put in place for three years, with not an hour of an extension, to let us see whether the business can be streamlined and provide the people in the industry with an opportunity to make a reasonable living and at the same time ensure that at all times the public has the best possible taxi service.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bernard Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_109">Ms Doyle would be better placed to address some of the issues raised.  With regard to the implications for safety of the extensive hours that cab drivers work, one has a negative gut feeling that they are excessive.  At present, legislation on the working time directive does not impact on self-employed operators so it cannot be relied on to make a change and reduce the hours.  Therefore, one must examine other measures.  In our report we state firmly that the key is not so much whether a particular driver has another job but the number of hours worked and whether they should be restricted.  The report explores some means by which restrictions might be placed on working hours.  It would be difficult to establish and monitor the working hours of drivers.  It would not be an easy or inexpensive thing to do in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">We were unable to find evidence that long working hours were having an impact on road safety.  One would anticipate, for example, that higher insurance premiums for cab drivers would reflect the safety implications of their operations but that was not the case.  Evidence from the UK suggests no particular contrast between regulated and deregulated authorities in terms of the impact of extended working hours on safety.  Although one may be uneasy about the hours worked from a safety perspective, there is no clear empirical evidence to support the suggestion that cab operators are unsafe in that regard.  We recommend in our report that a closer investigation be made over time to establish whether safety implications arise and, if so, the methods that can be put in place to address them but we have no solutions at this juncture.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">In regard to earnings in the industry and the fact that earnings are declining and may decline even further in the future, we must recognise from an economic perspective that while incumbent drivers may experience a dilution of their earnings, those entering the industry gain in terms of enhancing their incomes.  A balance must be sought in any analysis on this issue.  If entrants to the industry do not remain in it very long and they are entering irrationally, this indicates that the market is not working properly and, as an economist giving advice on this area, I would have to consider a moratorium if it could be proved that the element of churning was quite substantial.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Questions were also raised about a moratorium to give time to introduce other reforms to the industry but this is outside my area of responsibility.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_62">
          <from>Ms Kathleen Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_113">I would like to address the issue of working hours and the question of whether we are in contact with the Health and Safety Authority.  I can confirm to members that we have corresponded with the Health and Safety Authority, the Road Safety Authority and the Garda Síochána in regard to working hours for drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Mr Feeney has advised us that the working time directive does not apply to self-employed small public service vehicle operators.  However, I sought the views of the aforementioned organisations regarding the length of time that taxi drivers are working and the fact that some may be working in full-time jobs before going on to drive or may be driving at night before going to work the following morning.  The opinion of the Health and Safety Authority is that drivers are responsible for putting a risk assessment in place because as self-employed drivers, their cars are places of work.  They must put such risk assessments in place for both themselves as drivers and for the passengers they carry.  If they are in full-time employment, they also have responsibilities to their employers to undertake a risk assessment and to inform the employer of any risks that may impact on their job.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">The Road Safety Authority expressed concerns about driver fatigue and felt that adequate rest times should be observed before somebody in full-time employment began driving a taxi, especially during evening hours.  It took the view that a driver has a personal responsibility for ensuring he or she is fit and alert before beginning work.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The Garda Síochána pointed out that rules and regulations were formerly in place requiring applicants for small public service vehicle driver licences to undertake that they were available to provide a service over 40 hours per week.  That condition was removed by the then Minister for Public Enterprise in 1998 owing to the fact that people wanted to provide part-time services, especially in rural areas where 20 hours per week might comprise an adequate service.  A regulation was subsequently put in place prohibiting drivers from driving more than 11 hours per day over any three consecutive days.  However, this regulation is difficult for gardaí to monitor because there is nothing in the vehicle to indicate the number of hours driven.  We intend to examine the capability of taxi meters in this regard.  We are in discussions with Legal Metrology Services, which is responsible for the sealing of taxi meters, and we understand that meters are capable of recording working hours and industrial earnings.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">Does Mr. Feeney mean to say that he carried out a survey without giving respondents an opportunity to make submissions in person?  He has taken for granted that what the respondents submitted on paper was the true position.  It is unacceptable in any walk of life that one can carry out a survey, even if it is merely an opinion poll, without seeking verification.  This report has been thrown together at enormous expense.  I have no doubt we will hear more about its cost.  It is totally out of line to base a survey on what is submitted by individuals without verifying their responses.  Did Mr. Feeney seek meter readings to verify, for example, the number of hours worked or fares carried per day?  Did he get anything from them other than a document full of ticked question boxes?</p>

If we ask individuals to tell us how much they earn and we receive this information in a written response, why should we ask them again about their incomes?  I have to assume that they have had an opportunity to tell me the truth as they saw it.  This issue does not arise in surveys whatsoever.  I do not see the sense in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">We tried to verify our information in various ways including, for example, seeking information from consumers on the trips they take and the fares they pay to build up estimates on earnings.  We have tried in the past to persuade cab drivers to operate a log system in which they would record day to day the number of trips they make and the fares they receive but we have discovered this is not practicable because of a lack of response on the part of drivers.  We are anxious to get the best information possible but it is a universal experience that income information is the most difficult question to ask people in surveys and questionnaires.</p>

A justification has been put forward for a moratorium on licence issuing within this industry.  I made this point in the last meeting we had on this topic.  I find it very difficult to justify any policy with an objective to protect the income of people within that industry.  Like everybody else around this table, I am rapidly dealing with the consequences of people who are unemployed.  To say to somebody who has just lost his or her job that there is no opportunity to enter a particular industry because there is a need to protect the income of people within the industry is something with which I struggle.  I emphasise that point, which I made publicly the last time we discussed the matter.  It is relevant to this debate because all the discussion we have had up to this point regarding this report has been about saying that the need to justify a moratorium is to protect the income of people in the industry.

          <p eId="para_157">With regard to the objective for the kind of market we want to have operating here, we have seen the consequences of that kind of market operation in other parts of our economy.  With the kind of deregulation I believe is being advocated here, we have seen the consequences of it within housing and banking sectors.  There is no adequate regulation in place in that regard.  We must learn from that in the discussion we are having here.  The approach of light-touch regulation and so on is not working.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">If we are looking at a justification for reducing the number of people who can enter into the industry, I would consider whether the revenue levels within that industry will be sufficient to justify and fund the standards of service we hope for in the industry in future.  If we are to say the average income per hour within the industry is approximately €11, it would suggest that the money will not be in the industry to fund the kinds of quality improvements we are seeking.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">I have indicated that I would have some difficulty with the idea of a moratorium but I would be in favour of giving the regulator the power to determine how many people should be operating within the industry.  The outcome of this is maybe to indicate that there should be a moratorium or that fewer people should enter the industry than in the past.  If there is to be a regulator, it should have the ability to determine who is playing within that industry.  I struggle with a position where we have a regulator without that power.</p>

          <p eId="para_160">I thank the witnesses for coming in today.  My initial response to the report was that a normal industry and market was being assessed, although the market is shrinking very fast.  I know this was done two years ago.  The report does not seem to allow for the fact that this industry has many individuals operating their own businesses.  It is not like looking at another industry in the country.  At the moment we have far too many people in it and we have asked for a moratorium in this committee and to look at uniformity of standards and quality of service.  We must also consider how so many people are trying to eke out a living as they are having difficulty reaching normal income targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">The suggestion in the report that 51% of part-time drivers offer a service at peak time is worrying.  These people either have other employment or are retired and augment their income.  That these people are doing this work is very worrying, with only 36% of our full-time drivers doing weekend work.  I know Ms Doyle was asked about this earlier.  I am still not satisfied that anything will be done about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Ms Doyle indicated that the drivers must clock up the number of hours that they work and report to their other employer if they do more than a certain number of hours.  Stronger action must be seen to be taken on this as it is leaving many of our full-time drivers in a very bad position.  People are not leaving the industry because they have nothing else to do and people going into this industry are not sitting down, looking at the market and carrying out commercial research.

          <p eId="para_163">I welcome Ms Doyle and Mr. Feeney.  I appreciate that they have a difficult job to do.  In this committee we are trying to reach a fair and equitable solution which provides enough taxis for the public while ensuring there is some market there for everybody.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">We have failed in the provision of wheelchair-accessible taxis.  In 2000, 21% of taxis in this city were wheelchair-accessible, but that number is now only 5%.  In the UK, 52% of taxis are wheelchair accessible.  We might send a message to the Government.  The programme for Government aims for 100% wheelchair accessibility among taxis, which is clearly not achievable, and the six major disability groups are quite happy with 20%.  We should immediately consult the Minister fro Transport regarding subsidies for the purchase of accessible taxis and have a realistic goal, for once, of 20%.  Representatives of the major disability groups appeared before the committee a few weeks ago and I compliment them on their report.  They were quite happy with 20% and that is what we need to aim for.  The target of 100% in the programme for Government should be slashed to 20%.  In rural areas there is an absence of alternative transport, and fewer wheelchair-accessible taxis or hackneys is a major disadvantage in those areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">There are obviously major discrepancies between the driver data, which gives a number of 16,150, and the household survey, which gives a figure of 40,350.  That represents a difference of nearly 25,000.  I will not call it a black economy but there is something happening there.  I have seen in the Netherlands and other countries the use of taxi meters to record working hours.  This has been going on for 25 years.  In the Netherlands every taxi driver gives a written receipt.  The only way we can clarify the inequity is to have written receipts.  What do the witnesses propose?  Have they met the taxi drivers in this regard?  We will never find out what taxi drivers are earning from their data or from household data.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">There have been major improvements in the past ten years in the number and quality of taxis.  We must work together to resolve these difficulties.  However, we are in a very difficult market.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">It is Mr. Feeney's first time to appear before the committee and there is no question about his integrity, which we respect.  This is nothing personal with regard to himself or Ms Doyle.  We have the height of respect for both of them.  However, I do not accept the accuracy of the findings in this report.  This committee wants competition in the taxi industry.  It is critically important.  We also want good standards, which means that the people in the industry earn at least a minimum wage.  We have obtained legal advice as to the avoidability of a moratorium and it is a matter for the Minister, not the regulator.  The idea of the moratorium is to enable the regulator to bring about the standards and control in the industry which we are satisfied, from the evidence we have been given, does not exist at the moment.  At the last meeting we presented false licences.  It was confirmed by members of the Cork Taxi Drivers Association that they were able to have their licences photocopied and laminated, after which they could do anything they wanted with them.  They were presented as a test in Cork and of course they passed because they look authentic.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Will the witnesses confirm that in addition to the 27,000 taxi plates in existence, there are 46,000 PSV licences?  Will they inform us how many applicants are waiting for a test for a PSV licence?  I could not get a reply to this in a recent Dáil parliamentary question.</p>

          <p eId="para_170">Yes.  On that basis, I put it to Mr. Feeney that his findings about churning cannot be regarded as accurate.  There could be five different drivers on one taxi.  It appears this is one of the things that is happening.  We have been given evidence by the taxi driver associations that there is an illegal trade in taxi licences.  There are ads about this every day in the <i>Evening Herald</i> and other newspapers.  Because only nine inspectors are employed by the taxi regulator for the whole country, it is impossible to trace the illegal activity that is going on.  The Garda sees this as a responsibility it lost some time ago with the establishment of the taxi regulator.  When this committee first raised this issue with the Garda, it was not a big issue for them.  The responsibility that used to be that of the Garda has been taken over by the regulator, who has not been given the resources for proper policing.  This, again, is part of the reason this committee has come up with the suggestion for a moratorium for a specific period of time.  By the way, our legislative proposals can be lifted at any time if necessary.  In this way the taxi regulator would have an opportunity to bring order to the business.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_171">To reiterate what the Chairman is saying, what people want is a taxi market in which the workers can earn a decent living and put bread on the table.  Was Mr. Feeney asked to evaluate the regulator in any way?  It seems to the workers in the industry that there has been a complete failure of regulation.  Many of them, on their demonstrations over the past three or four months, have compared this to the failure of financial regulation.  We had a disastrous Financial Regulator which did not do its business, and this led to the country being faced with near economic collapse and has placed us in a dangerous situation.  In a similar way, there has been no taxi regulation whatsoever for the past four years.  I welcome Ms Doyle to the committee, but she is always telling us things she is going to do — something will be done next year, later this year, in 2011 or even in 2012, for vehicle standards.  It is always in the future.  I am not saying this is necessarily her fault.  When was anybody stopped by the nine inspectors?  Not many people are stopped by the Garda Síochána generally so how can we expect nine people to invigilate 30,000 others?  It seems ludicrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I had the privilege, following representations from the Chairman's home city of Galway, of watching Galway taxi drivers doing their business a few Friday nights ago at 10.30 p.m. or 11.30 p.m., and seeing the problems they illustrated for the Chairman at first hand.  They are saying there is no regulation.  That is another way of looking at it — we do not have regulation of any kind.  That is the problem.  Calling it light-touch regulation is a joke.  It is non-touch regulation in financial circles and it seems to be the same in taxi circles.  We want a well regulated sector that gives people a fair and decent living.  Is that too much to ask?  That is why I go back to the economic principles.  Mr. Feeney and I have similar backgrounds but we do not agree on the principles.  That is the problem with this report.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bernard Feeney</from>
          <p eId="para_173">With regard to the last point about our role <i>vis-à-vis</i> the regulator and so on, we were asked to assess whether the quality of service had deteriorated as a result of liberalisation, and one of the findings of our report was that consumers are generally happy with the quality of service as well as the quantity.  We looked at that aspect of regulation from the consumer’s point of view.  We are also concerned with some other aspects and wonder if there is a level playing field with regard to the operation of the market, and between groups of taxi drivers.  We are concerned about compliance with the regulations because the level playing field would not be level if large numbers of individuals were getting away with non-compliance.  From these two points of view we looked at other aspects of the regulatory system but it was not our job to assess the role or impact of the regulator <i>per se</i>.  I reiterate that.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">The Chairman asked whether there are large numbers of drivers operating with one vehicle with the result that many more people are in the trade than indicated by the number of vehicle licences.  In our consultations with the different interests, this point was not made forcefully to us but we know it occurs.  In the old days of cosying, that was the prevalent mode.  There is no hard and fast data on this but we gleaned from market intelligence that while it is not a substantial issue it may be on the rise.  I agree with the Chairman that when considering the issue of journeys, one would have to look at drivers as well as vehicles in order to try to——</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_113">
          <from>Ms Kathleen Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_180">That is the figure for the number of licensed drivers but it does not necessarily mean they are operating.  I shall give an example.  When we rolled out, on a country-wide basis, identification cards to be placed on dashboards and smart cards to be carried, the take up was not anywhere near 46,000.  There were approximately 42,000 drivers at the time of roll-out, in the year before last.  The take-up then was in the high 20,000s which indicated to us that although people might have a small public service vehicle, PSV, driver licence they might not necessarily operate in the industry.  Many people undertake that particular programme in order to add it to their CV but they may not use it.  The take-up of the driver licence ID system for all the vehicles, which can be seen clearly in all vehicles, was in the high 20,000s which indicated that approximately 15,000 people did not acquire the cards but have a licence nevertheless.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">It will be interesting to see what occurs, next time round, when they come to renew their licence because they will have to undertake the new skills development programme to be rolled out by the commission.  That will put another onus on them, having to do another test before they can renew their licence.  That will indicate who intends to operate in the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_186">One would expect that if they apply for a PSV licence they intend to operate in the industry. There is very strong evidence from the taxi driver associations that there is a problem because significant numbers of cars are being driven by several drivers.  That is where some of the illegal activity is occurring.  The associations claim there is no proper control over that.  The illegal activity is almost wholesale in that situation and is very difficult to control.  As Deputy Broughan stated, when the regulator's investigator arrives in Galway, half the taxis disappear from the rank because they hear an enforcement officer is around.  They are hardly going home for their tea.</p>

However, given all the circumstances and all the aspirations of the regulator — we appreciate her desire to get these things done — would it not make good sense to put a stop to the numbers to enable her to introduce some control?  This is not in any way to deal with competition in a negative way.  As far as I am concerned, competition does not exist anymore, because there are so many people.  If a further 1,400 are waiting to do tests, would it not be sensible to propose that until the new test and new standards are introduced — and I strongly recommend to the regulator that the new test should involve an interview — that, at least, we would put a stop to the chaotic situation which exists?  Will the delegation consider this following today's meeting?</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It is with no disrespect that I say to Mr. Feeney that I cannot accept the conclusions made in the report.  He should go away and reconsider them in view of what he has heard today from every member and in view of the situation that exists in the taxi industry now where people cannot earn a minimum wage.  It is very difficult to expect them to adhere to the higher standards to which we all wish them to adhere.  We will finish with this.  If the delegation wishes to make a final comment that is fine.  As far as the committee is concerned we are at one in saying that the work we have done in the past two years has led to very different conclusions to those in the Goodbody report or some of the other initiatives we have heard from the consultants.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_220">I welcome the delegation.  We are especially pleased to have the delegation before the committee on its first visit to Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann.  I will call Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA, chairperson of the Northern Ireland Regional Development Committee, presently to speak.  The Joint Committee on Transport is very keen to have as much co-operation with the committee from Northern Ireland as possible.  There is much to be gained in co-ordinating transport policy as much as possible in the two parts of the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">We welcome the fact that the delegation has taken the opportunity to see some of our success stories in Dublin, especially in regard to the quality bus corridors.  We congratulate the delegation on the initiatives with regard to the busways.  We are somewhat sore about the fact that the delegation stole one of our top people, namely, Mr. Ciarán de Burca from the national bus corridor office, but I assure the delegation it is very lucky to have him.  He is an excellent person in respect of the job he does.  We wish the delegation well in the development of the Belfast busways.  I invite Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA, to introduce the members of the delegation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_152">
          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I am accompanied by Mr. Brian Wilson of the Green Party, Mr. Willie Clarke of Sinn Féin and Mr. John Dallat of the SDLP.  I am the chairman of the Northern Ireland Regional Transport Committee and am from the Ulster Unionist Party.  I thank the chairman for the invitation to attend today.  I realise the presentation has been distributed.  Members of the committee will be glad to hear that I have no intention of going through it sheet by sheet.  However, I wish to raise and identify some issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">I wish to focus on the committee's ongoing work and its priorities.  Members will be pleased to hear about any work the Joint Committee on Transport is doing in these areas and any experiences and lessons it has to share on these topics.  Rapid transit for Belfast is a topic the committee has considered in some detail.  We have considered the Department's strategic outline case and we are moving towards an outline business case and the detailed design stage.  Several route options have been identified in Belfast, including east way, west way and Titanic quarter, with potential links to Queen's University Belfast and the hospitals in the vicinity.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">At this stage the recommendation is for a bus-based rapid transit system.  The committee has seen some examples of bus-based systems in Amsterdam, Utrecht and Eindhoven last year.  We understand the Chairman has a keen interest in the subject and that rapid transit pilots are being considered for a number of cities in Ireland.  My committee may be interested to hear the chairman's views on those issues.  We have started work on a new inquiry into sustainable transport which will examine balancing the environment and the social and economic sustainability of transport.  Given the importance of transport related emissions to the overall level of carbon emissions, the committee is very keen to progress this vital issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The committee held a stakeholder engagement event in February 2009 and the engagement report will inform the committee's terms of reference.  The main areas of interest are achieving a sustainable economy, living within environmental limits, ensuring a strong, healthy and just society, and the usefulness and achievability of existing commitments and targets.  We anticipate issuing a public call for evidence before the summer recess with a view to taking evidence at the beginning of the new session in September 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Public transport reform is also of interest to the committee.  The proposals for reform, which include bus and rail public transport services, involve moving to a three-tier system.  The top tier would comprise the Government, responsible for broad policy, including legislation and regulations.  The middle tier would be responsible for designing and managing services and securing their provision.  The third tier would comprise transport operators.  The key elements driving the need for reform include a clearer delineation of roles and responsibilities split between designers and operators, the need for a lead client to specify and manage contracts, EU regulation, pressures to deliver improved efficiency and ensure value for money, and the desirability of moving to a model of revenue funding for services instead of capital funding to enhance accountability and transparency, which the committee believes is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Proposals are currently at the outline business case stage and we anticipate moving to detailed business case stage before the summer recess.  The committee has also been working with the Department on the development of the ten-year review of the regional development strategy since last year.  We are keen to see a revised regional development review that benefits all parts of the region, helps reduce our carbon footprint, maximises the potential of our cities, towns, villages and rural communities, strengthens Belfast as the economic driver of the region and reinforces Derry as the gateway city of the north west and improves connections within the region, Northern Ireland's neighbours and the rest of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">The review of the regional development strategy is feeding into the review of the regional transportation strategy, which is at a very early stage, and the committee is looking forward to working on this issue.  It is also aware that work is ongoing, through the British-Irish Council, on draft collaborative spatial planning frameworks examining common needs and better targeting of infrastructure investment.  In addition, it is working with the Department on the development of legislation in the areas of ports policy and roads.  The committee also engages in quarterly scrutiny of departmental performance against its budget and programme for Government targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">One of the key issues for it is the issue of the reform of water and sewerage services.  At present we are in the middle of an inquiry into the management of risk in the water company and are considering draft ministerial guidance on social and environmental issues as part of the regulatory price control for 2010-2012.  As this is outside the remit of the committee, I will not expand any further on this topic.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to meet with the committee and I look forward to working together for the betterment of all of the people who live on the island.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">I thank Mr. Cobain.  Why did the delegation decide to go for a bus rapid transport in Belfast, as opposed to light rail?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_154">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_231">I welcome our colleagues from the North.  It is very important the delegation came here and it is very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">I live in County Louth and the contact between it and Newry and County Down is very strong.  I welcome the comments on the spatial strategy and planning for the common needs, through the British-Irish Council.  It is very important because what happens north of the Border and in the South on that economic corridor is terribly important.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">I have one serious complaint to make and I know the delegation will have the same one for me.  It concerns speeding and penalty points.  It is a transport and road safety issue for us.  The problem is the penalty points system in the North is different from the one in the South, as the one in the South is different to that in the North.  Northern drivers are coming to the South, many of whom are driving at very high speeds, as are Southern drivers going North.  It is a really serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">I know the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and the other Ministers are dealing with this issue but it has not been sorted out yet.  Can we find common ground?  We may not be able to do that today but if we can, we should ensure there is safer driving north and south of the Border.  We could achieve that through common enforcement and penalty points and follow the issue through.  It applies equally to those of us going north of the Border.  Does the delegation have any views on that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_155">
          <from>Mr. John Dallat, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_235">While the Republic has its own Road Safety Authority which, I understand, has more than 300 employees, road safety is dispersed across at least five Government Departments in the North.  The primary responsibility is with the Department of the Environment.  The Minister is Mr. Sammy Wilson.  The Department for Regional Development has responsibility for road signage, design of motorways and things like that.  The Department of Education is also heavily involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">It is dispersed and there are probably different views on how to bring the issue forward.  Speaking personally, I would like to see an authority in the North similar to the RSA so that those issues could be seriously addressed.  I understand there are discussions going on as we speak.  All of us want to see an end to the people who jump the Border one way or the other and cause deaths on the road.  It is our primary aim, given that more people have been killed on the roads than through the Troubles over the years.</p>

          <p eId="para_237">I welcome the delegation.  To come back to the issue of traffic in Belfast, the last number of times I drove through it there was no shortage of cars.  At the time of the evening I was there, no more than Dublin, one could do with rationalising it to some degree.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">When the delegation talk about bus rapid transport, is it intended to trap commuters who come into Belfast every morning to work?  Will a park and ride facility be set up, whereby commuters are taken off the main arterial roads into the city, with the main bus lanes being used to bring them to work?  Is that the idea?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_239">There are a number of different issues.  The committee has experienced some of these in Dublin.  The main issue is whether we can get the political drive to do it because it will be a very controversial issue.  The first thing we must do is take a large volume of cars out of the city centre.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_158">

          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_241">We can do that through a park and ride system.  We can also do it through the planning service.  Parking in Belfast is quite cheap and people are encourage to come in.  We need to work along with that.  We need to provide buses.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_242">I assume for business reasons people are encouraged to come and park in the centre of the city.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_243">All of these things are a balance.  There is no sense in us spending large amounts of money on rapid transit if it is not rapid transit.  We need clear political direction on this because it will be very controversial in the city centre.  We need park and ride facilities, we need to discourage people from coming into the city centre and we need to ensure we have clear lanes for rapid transit.  That will mean restricting the amount of lanes available for cars in the city centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">We assume early on this will cause a lot of friction between car drivers and the committee of the Assembly.  However, we need to drive rapid transit forward and we need to introduce it as quickly as possible.  As a committee, we are determined to do that.  I know the Minister is determined to introduce it.</p>

          <p eId="para_247">I welcome the delegation and the opportunity to exchange views.  In the delegation's suggestions for rapid bus transport, it states the desirability of moving to a model of revenue funding for services instead of capital funding.  In other words, the revenue derived from bus fares will replace fleets and upgrades.  Is that what the statement means?  Why did the delegation come to that conclusion?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_248">Over the past 30 years there has been very little money spent on public transport in Northern Ireland.  Over the last number of years we have invested quite heavily in public transport and the number of people using the public transport system has risen quite substantially.  We know we must go further and that many people would want to use public transport, provided it is clean, efficient and on time.  We think rapid transit is one way of providing that, along with the significant investment we are making in railways.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">There is another way to encourage people on to public transport.  There is a substantial financial pool we can use to subsidise the transport systems in Northern Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Kennedy</from>
          <p eId="para_250">Is Mr. Cobain saying that funding for new buses should come from an increase in fares rather than from the government, which is the traditional source?</p>

          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_251">Eventually.  In the first instance it requires substantial Government investment, which we are making, to ensure that we have something to compete with motor cars.  Our priority is to take cars off the road and we cannot do that until we have an alternative, which is public transport.  The public transport we have now is not an alternative to driving a car.</p>

          <from>Mr. Fred Cobain, MLA</from>
          <p eId="para_253">Public transport is an issue for everyone in Northern Ireland because we have not invested sufficiently in it for 30 years.  We have paid substantial sums for new trains but because the track is not sufficient they run at ten miles an hour.  That is the sort of silly thing we need to overcome.  We can only do that by further investment which will encourage more people to use public transport.</p>

It was a good and enjoyable meeting.  As a follow-up a year ago we had a public relations exercise in Drogheda or Dundalk on co-operation in the Border counties where most of the road deaths take place.  We have made no progress on the fact that penalty points received by Northern drivers in the Republic and <i>vice versa</i> are not implemented.  Both ends of the island have come a long way from having some of the worst road safety records in Europe to the point that the Republic is in fourth place.  We must be serious about implementing penalty points because while drink driving has come under control, speeding has not.  The map we saw at the last meeting showed that most deaths occur in the Border area.  If we do not take this seriously with funding as it is now we will go back from fourth to 24th. </p>

Derry city is the fourth largest city on the island and Conor Murphy is on record, with the Minister for Transport, Deputy Noel Dempsey, as stating that if a feasibility study is done and if there is proof that it satisfies the cost benefit analysis he will lend his support to a light rail system from Derry city, servicing the suburbs which extend into east Inishowen as far as Manorcunningham and Letterkenny.  Will Mr. Cobain and his committee lend their weight to this possibility?  We have already targeted moneys to carry out the feasibility study, without putting pressure on any organisation that intends to provide it.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">Integrating main bus links with rural populations is a major problem in the North, particularly to break down social exclusion and to combat rural poverty.  We are examining what we can do and I am sure the members of this committee have been through the same process, particularly in respect of concessionary fares for older citizens and citizens with disabilities.  How do we link them to the main bus routes and what work have members of the committee done on that problem?</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_265">We have done a fair bit.  I come from County Galway where the rural transport initiative was introduced in half of the county and is being extended to almost all of the county.  Mr. Clarke has put his finger on the problem.  It is difficult to get an integrated approach.  The initiative operates on the basis that the person who needs the service telephones a provider because there could not be a bus passing up and down townlands unless there was someone to use it.  That part apparently works alright.  The people who run it say that they do not want to go all the way to the local town to enable someone draw a pension or attend a social outing, but they try to link with the main bus routes going to the towns and cities.  They want the small bus to be ready, waiting for the person to get off the mainline bus and bring him or her home.  That might seem simple but it is difficult to operate and slow to set up but it is beginning to work.</p>

It works well for social inclusion of older people, bringing them to the nearest town to collect their pensions, do their shopping or attend social outings such as going to the cinema where other people provide free coffee and so on, but it is difficult to link up with the existing bus services on a main road.  I have worked on local rural transport to organise bringing people to railway and bus stations and it does not work.  It is difficult to get the cohesion among the customers to bring them to the same place at the same time, assuming that they all want to go on the same train.  It is very expensive and has broken down and failed at many railway stations.</p>
