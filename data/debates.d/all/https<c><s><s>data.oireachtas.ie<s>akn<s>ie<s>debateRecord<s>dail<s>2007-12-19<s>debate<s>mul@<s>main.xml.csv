#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	0	One of the hallmarks of the Government has been inconsistency and confusion.  One of the national newspapers refers today to the latest U-turn in respect of water charges for schools as being a Pontius Pilate programme that has turned into a water pilot programme.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Following the confusing statement put up by the Minister for Education and Science on her departmental website, the Taoiseach should clear up a few simple matters for Members.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach conceded that it was his intention to introduce a flat rate of payment for water usage in schools.  He stated that he intended to introduce a transition period.  Can the Taoiseach explain the basis on which the size of schools will determine the flat rate?  Will it be based on usage of water or on a per capita attendance at schools?Does the transition period only apply until the end of 2009?  Given that the Government negotiated a derogation to the framework water directive in the first instance, will schools be obliged to pay for water they receive from 2010, on the basis of either an allocation given free and a charge applying thereafter or a continuation of the flat rate?  I refer to schools that have received bills this week, many of which have received bills for water and sewerage charges combined.  When the Taoiseach says that such schools should hold those bills, what is the position in respect of the discharge of such charges?  In other words, will they be obliged to pay charges at all or will they be obliged to pay an element of them in a flat rate?  Alternatively, can they dispose of them in the wastepaper bin?Twenty minutes before the Taoiseach made his comments in the House yesterday, officials of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government were saying that it would be completely impractical to introduce a flat rate charge for water in schools and that it would be impossible.  The Taoiseach either showed leadership or desperation and I am unsure which.  People are very confused about the outcome of his statements and he should clear up this issue for me.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	3	Under the heading, "Improved Funding for our Schools", the education section of the programme for Government contains the following commitment:  "We will ... examine the provision of waste and water allowances to school, with charges becoming effective after these agreed allowances are exceeded."  The Minister has explained repeatedly that because of the framework water directive, the Government would work out this commitment between the Departments and would implement it.  This is the first time in my memory of implementing programmes for Government that implementing a measure is considered to be a U-turn.  This is extraordinary.

The length of that period has not yet been decided.  While it can be up to the end of 2009, the Government must decide on its length.  As I noted yesterday, schools should monitor water usage and institute repairs and conservation measures during this period.  There already is support for so doing.  The Government also has sought advice from the Attorney General's office regarding the long-term options.I refer to Deputy Kenny's question regarding the payment to schools of flat rate charges.  This would be proportionate to school size as happens at present.  I examined the schedule of local authority charges on Monday or yesterday morning.  While such local authority charges differ nationwide, school size is what is used.I refer to the intentions of the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science.  There are a number of issues, some of which were raised in the meeting yesterday of the Joint Committee on Education and Science.  Some were raised by the Minister and others have been sent in from schools in recent weeks.  The Government's intention is to draw up a single comprehensive statement and release it after Christmas.

The schools and parents want to know the detail because the Taoiseach's latest statement does not add to their store of knowledge about their position.   Must schools that received bills of between €500 and €10,000 hold on to those bills or dump them?  Will they be paying a flat charge from 1 January?  If so, how is it to be computed on the basis of school size?  What will the flat charge be for a 40-pupil country school in Caherciveen as opposed to one in Kildare that is bursting at the seams?  Will the Department of Education and Science negotiate with the local authority between now and the end of January on the flat rate?  Will schools that have already paid their bills receive a refund over and above the flat rate the Taoiseach intends to introduce for the transition period?  This refund could be used for many facilities in those schools.Given that the framework directive requires the use of financial incentives so individuals, from pupils to adults, can understand the importance of water conservation, with which concept they generally agree, what system will be introduced by the Government from 2010?  Will the flat rate be abolished and will a generous allowance be given to every school above which a charge will apply?  Can we take it that all these questions will be dealt with when the House resumes at the end of January 2008?In the past six months, we have had leadership by the worst Government in the past 40 years.  It has lurched from crisis to crisis, including those involving provisional licences, cancer scares, the inability to publish reports and the acceptance of huge pay increases by the Government.  As the Taoiseach might say, we are not going to play "smokes and daggers" with this.  There have been climbdowns every day.  I heard the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy John McGuinness, say an hour ago that he does U-turns every day and the Government is quite prepared to do U-turns every day.  The signs are that this is the case.

It is appropriate and necessary for conserving water as a national resource and it was agreed with the European Union in 2003.  In a number of areas, there is a phase-in period and an implementation period.  If the measure were just implemented on a usage basis in all schools, they would have very large bills and this is why we included a clause in the programme for Government on how we would work to introduce a system with a flat rate and how, at the same time, work to ensure the conservation of water.  Even if it were possible to have a flat rate for everybody — one cannot because local authorities have different bases for charging — there would be no incentive for schools to conserve water.  There are pilot schemes in many schools and these have shown how much water the schools can conserve.  This is good and proper.We cannot just have a flat rate after 2010, whereby one would have one's bill paid, regardless of the amount of water one uses and even if one takes no interest in conservation.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I am just answering Deputy Kenny's questions.  We are endeavouring to ascertain, with the local authorities, the basis on which we can operate.  Let me give an example.  On the basis of information supplied by the authorities — they did not all supply it — the combined charge for water and waste water services across local authorities varied from 0.99 cent/cu.m. to 2.62 cent/cu.m. and the average was 1.74 cent/cu.m.  A school in Caherciveen could have a very low cost and an understanding with the local authorities.  Most of the 4,000 schools in the Republic have quite low charges.  Some of the schools that have had high costs this year accrued them because of remedial work or leaks.  One school that had a bill of €6,000, spent €500 on repairs and thereby reduced its bill to just over €1,000.  There is a variety of reasons and we must work out a fair system.It seems to us that the fairest system involves a flat rate attached to which there would be some kind of incentive to conserve water.  Some schools admitted in their letters that their water supplies are left on for the entire summer, thus increasing their bills.  This issue is not too difficult to resolve, as teachers point out themselves.  I heard a teacher state this morning that his school is twinned with a school in France, but he did not say that all the citizens in France pay a very expensive domestic water charge.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	70	——let me draw attention the case of people whose needs have been overlooked in recent years and who do not exercise a great deal of political clout because they do not have a vote.  I refer to approximately 6,000 asylum seekers who are in receipt of direct provision.  This is the arrangement whereby the State pays for their board and lodgings.  They are not permitted to work or claim social welfare benefits in the normal way while their asylum claims are being processed.  As we know, processing can take considerable time.When the system of direct provision was introduced in 1999, a payment was introduced to cover the incidental expenses asylum seekers might have, including the cost of bus fares, additional food and Christmas gifts.  It is a weekly payment that amounts to €19.10 for adults and €9.60 for children.   The problem is that the payment has not been increased since 1999.  It still stands at €19.10.  It is not a great bounty and one would not go wild on it.  I need not remind the Taoiseach the number of times that he and the rest of us have seen increases in our salaries since 1999.  Would he consider, at this time of the year, bringing that €19.10 into line with the movement in incomes over the period of time since 1999?  It is very regrettable that this small allowance has not been increased in that period of time.  The number of people involved is declining because the number of asylum applications is on the way down.  The Government could make a generous gesture at this time of the year.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	71	It is correct to say that the allowance has not been increased.  The Minister informs me that he has been in discussions with the groups about that particular issue.  However, the cost to the State has increased.  Modern accommodation has been purchased with taxpayers' money and the State has often had to pay high capital costs towards such direct provision.  Services, ancillary facilities and staff are also provided.  While the cost of this allowance has not increased since 1999, the cost to the State in providing these facilities has been enormous in the past eight or nine years.Our asylum system compares to the best in the world in terms of its fairness, decision making and support services for asylum seekers, including access to the necessary legal and medical services.  We have reduced the waiting time for people who are on refugee application determination since the late 1990s.  The number of asylum applications increased dramatically between 1998 and 2002.  It is now declining, as Deputy Gilmore pointed out.  Last year, there were almost 4,500 applications, which was the lowest in a number of years.  In April, the figure was down to just under 300, the lowest monthly figure for eight or nine years.  However, the cost to the State of providing accommodation and services is high.  I am not involved in the details of the Minister's meeting, but we must operate a fair system.  It is not an open door system.  We treat asylum seekers in a very fair way in this country.  Within his limits, the Minister always takes this matter into consideration.  The kind of accommodation we are purchasing and the direct provision is very good, notwithstanding the fact that the payment has not been increased.

Some of the cost to the State associated with the asylum process was not very prudent expenditure on the part of the State.  Hotels were bought that were never used.  If we want to go down the road of what it has cost the State, a different argument can be made.The fairness or otherwise of our system is not the issue I am raising.  This is a small amount of money; €19 per week covers people's bus fares and other incidental expenses, such as whether they want to buy their children a gift for Christmas.  I am disappointed at the Scrooge-like response of the Taoiseach this morning.  I did not honestly expect that there would be resistance to it.  This issue has been overlooked and the payment has been stuck at that level since 1999.  These people have no political clout as they do not have a vote and, therefore, they are not exerting political influence.  Many of them have come here from very trying situations in their own countries, perhaps fleeing latter-day Herods.  They are not allowed to work here and they simply have to sit there while their asylum cases are being processed.  Some of the processing can take a very long period of time.I ask the Taoiseach to look at this issue generously.  It is not a substantial amount of money and it will not involve a significant cost to the State.  It will only bring the €19 payment up to what it would have been in real terms in 1999.  It is not an outrageous demand and it could be readily agreed to.  I ask the Taoiseach and his Government to agree to it before Christmas.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	73	It is a matter for the Minister in terms of what he can or cannot do.  He has been in discussions.  I am not getting into that, but I do not believe that there will be any changes, to be frank.  We have considerable guidelines that we have followed under both the UN and with our own policies.  We have been fair and generous with direct provision in this country.  We have not taken the routes of other countries as we do not agree with them.  Direct provision is a costly system and we operate that rather than direct payments.  There is a substantial cost involved.  If we took the opposite route, direct payments would be made rather than give direct provision and €19.  We provide accommodation and food and we have substantially improved direct provision each year over the past few years.  I am not doing the budget for the Department, but that is the principle.Our asylum system compares to the best in the world in terms of fairness, support and back-up services.  We do not have to make any apology in that regard.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	75	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.I attended the second EU-Africa Summit in Lisbon on 8 December, accompanied by the Minister of State with responsibility for overseas development, Deputy Michael Kitt.  The overall aim of the summit was to strengthen the partnership with Africa and to mark a new phase in EU-Africa relations.  I think it broadly achieved that aim.  The leaders adopted a joint EU-Africa strategy and action plan which commits Europe and Africa to developing closer political dialogue and to work together to address common global challenges, including climate change, energy and migration.The Minister of State, who has special responsibility for overseas aid, addressed the summit during the Sunday session under the theme of  trade, infrastructure and development.  The Minister of State referred to the millennium development goals as the framework of Ireland's overseas aid programme and the excellent progress we have made in striving towards the millennium development goals target by 2012, and he encouraged other summit participants to increase their efforts in this regard.  He outlined the key priorities of Ireland's aid programme including health, education and the fight against HIV and AIDS, and how Africa is central to it.  The Minister stressed the need for coherence between aid, trade, environmental, agricultural, migration and security policies and he also emphasised the importance of human rights and good governance in the overall promotion of African development.  During the summit, I met briefly with President Mbeki of South Africa and discussed my forthcoming visit there next January.I travelled to Lisbon to attend the signing ceremony of the reform treaty on 13 December.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  The Reform Treaty will provide the Union with the means to meet the challenges facing it in a fast changing world.  It will allow Europe to do more for our people in the years ahead.  Ireland has been a beneficiary of EU integration and the Union is crucial to our future well-being.  That is why a more effective EU is in Ireland's best interests.  It is why the ratification of the reform treaty will be a priority for Ireland.I attended the European Council on 14 December in Brussels, accompanied by the Ministers for Foreign Affairs and European Affairs.  As I will make a statement to the House on the Council later today, I will now give only a summary account of its proceedings.  The European Council welcomed the signature of the reform treaty on 13 December, thereby signalling that the Union will have a stable institutional framework for the foreseeable future.  The European Council also agreed to establish a reflection group which will help the Union in identifying and examining the challenges and opportunities it will face some 15 to 20 years from now.  The Council also adopted a declaration on globalisation.Otherwise, discussions at the European Council focused on three areas — freedom, security and justice; economic, social and environmental issues; and external relations, including the issue of Kosovo.  While at the European Council in Brussels, I had a bilateral meeting with British Prime Minister, Mr. Gordon Brown.  Our discussions focused on Northern Ireland, where we agreed on the need to continue to work closely together, as well as on current EU issues.On official visits abroad in 2008, I will attend all the European Councils during the year.  I propose, along with appropriate Ministers, to visit South Africa and Tanzania from 14 to 18 January 2008.  The primary focus will be to visit Irish Aid programmes and supported projects operating in these countries and to see at first hand how Ireland's official aid programme is helping to combat disease, hunger and poverty in African communities.  In South Africa, I will also lead a trade mission of up to 50 Irish companies to further develop business links with Ireland.In addition, I propose to attend the fifth summit of the Heads of State and Government of Latin America, the Caribbean and the European Union in Lima, Peru on 16 May 2008.  I also propose to attend the EU-Asia Summit which will be held in Beijing, China in October 2008.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Taoiseach will have a busy and varied series of visits next year.  During the European-Africa Lisbon Summit, was the Taoiseach able to contribute when Mr. Robert Mugabe was present?  We had an argument about this before the Taoiseach went out there.  Some felt it might have been better if he did not attend, while others on the Government side argued that it was an opportunity to give Mr. Mugabe a clear message by speaking out in his presence.  I saw only the Taoiseach's contribution on television from some hallway where he made the point about the 14,000% inflation rate.  Did he deliver his comments to the gathering when Mr. Mugabe was present?Does the Taoiseach agree that we are reaching a point where we, and the Taoiseach in particular, should be able to fix a date for the EU reform treaty referendum, either alone or with the referendum on children's rights?  Anti-European campaigns in various forms are already beginning and the people of this country have to be as well-informed as possible in view of the fact that 500,000 million people are watching them and that the future of the populations of Europe depend greatly on the decision to be made by them.Does the Taoiseach have a view on how we can have a positive impact on the tinder box that is Kosovo, with its impending declaration of independence?  From the discussions around the table at which I sat this will be difficult and sensitive.  Whatever decision is made, we do not want Serbia and Kosovo to repeat the situation in Macedonia, which might severely disrupt Europe's opportunity for peace and harmony.  The Taoiseach is aware of the importance of that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Deputy Kenny probably knows it was decided at the European Council that rather than letting Mr. Mugabe take over the summit, we would make one trenchant statement, delivered by the Chancellor of Germany, Ms Angela Merkel.  She did that well, and thereafter we kept to the business of Africa, rather than allowing the summit to degenerate into everyone from Europe having a cut, and the Africans having a cut back.  It worked out well and he did not get the same level of attention he got at the last summit.  We had not had a summit for seven years because of that issue but it was well handled and we moved on to the important business of the considerable interests between Africa and Europe.  It is unfortunate that issue is there, but when one takes 60 or 70 countries there will always be issues.  To Ms Merkel's credit she made the statement trenchantly and effectively.We need to get our tactics right on the date of the reform treaty referendum.  We do not need to make up our minds over the next few days, but we will have to decide so that we can focus our campaign on the period necessary.  There is considerable difference of opinion on whether we should have the two referenda together or on separate days, and that is across many of the pro-European groups outside this House.  I have listened to their views extensively and we will have to come to a conclusion early in the new year.  As Deputy Kenny said, this is a major issue for the country and our standing.Rather than looking at the need for a referendum in the negative, we should look at it as a positive, although I am not sure it is a good thing for the distant future that any time there has to be any change we need a referendum.  From 1987 to date, every time there has been a change we have always needed a referendum.  It has always been that way during my time and Deputy Kenny's time here, but whether it is right forever more is another question.  Looking at the judgment of 1987 and the Attorney General's recent judgment on this as I interpret it, to change a single line of the European Treaty, which is a bulky document, would require a referendum.  Whether that is the greatest thing for this country over the next, 20, 30 or 40 years is a matter for debate.  There is no argument on whether we should have a referendum on the reform treaty, and we should gladly face into it.  This time there are many changes and it is a different position.  There is no doubt on that.Maybe the people on the streets in Mayo or Dublin are not getting themselves in knots over Kosovo, but around Europe they are.  Yesterday's lunch meeting went on for three hours.  Deputy Kenny and I have seen that this will be the major international issue in the early months of 2008.  We discussed the report from the contact group of the Kosovo troika on the conclusion of the status talks that have gone on for a few years.  The troika was thanked for its efforts and regretted that a solution, which is required for regional stability, could not be found.  That is a disappointment.  Mr. Martti Ahtisaari, a former president of Finland, worked hard on that in this group, but it is a difficult issue, as we both saw in the various discussions.  The Council discussed at length the position to be adopted by the EU in the aftermath of the conclusions of the troika process.  There was a strong emphasis on the importance of a unified EU approach — that is why the meeting went on so long — and for the EU to make clear its willingness to take the lead internationally and to help them manage and resolve the European problem.  This country made the point that we are ready to play our full part.  We have remained committed to playing an active and positive role in Kosovo.  We have been in there from the start, with our soldiers and some very good gardaí and other personnel on the administrative side charged with the task of trying to set up an administration.  There has been a substantial and enhanced Irish commitment to a KFOR military presence all the way through from 1999.  The gardaí are highly thought of in the job they do, which is very much at the administrative end.I agree with the Deputy it is clear that the absence of a new resolution raises many difficulties.  It would not be helpful for anyone to speculate at this stage on the question of recognition.  When the Troika process is formally concluded the matter will first be referred to the UN Security Council for discussion, early in the new year.  It would not be wise to predict the timing and sequence of events thereafter, but regardless of the outcome, I believe that the European Union cannot and will not shirk its responsibility to deal with the challenges that this difficult process may yet present.  We obviously have to be very careful.  I stressed the other day that we must continue to talk not just about Kosovo, but Serbia and how we maintain relations with that country and with the wider Balkan region.  It is an extremely difficult, tense and important issue for everybody, particularly the large number of countries directly concerned.  What surprised me the other day was the number of countries involved and the strength of their views.  Some of these countries do not normally express strong views, but this major issue was the exception.  It is inevitable that for the first quarter of 2008 it will be a regular news item.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I want to make one observation in that regard.  I share the Taoiseach's view that the fundamental issue arises, in one sense, from the Helsinki Accord where borders cannot be changed without consent.  The question for Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and his counterparts is to determine how best Serbia may be helped if a declaration is made.  In one sense, it is international politics, but with Russia playing games with the European Union over Serbia and while the Troika is determining where to go as regards Kosovo, the US Government is declaring its formula for a declaration of independence.  In an EU sense it is a collective challenge for the leaders of the member states.  I hope that reason prevails and that what emerges is a demonstration of collective strength from the European Union in the interests of the peoples of both Serbia and Kosovo.  It certainly will not be easy to get a resolution to this situation.As regards Irish Aid, I commend Government progress in reaching the targeted commitment of 0.7% of GNP in respect of aid for developing countries.  There has been much comment along the lines of corruption being endemic in African countries.  I have noted the strident comments by John O'Shea on a number of occasions as he warned against spending money in developing countries where dictators or corrupt regimes apply.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on this and is he happy that the taxpayer gets full value for the moneys we pay into this?  Everybody has a human principle of wanting to help others and it is only right and proper that the Government, on behalf of the people, should be fully assured that the best results are achieved for the money being spent by the taxpayer.  Does the Taoiseach have a view on whether we should continue with the current format of involving with some of those regimes in Africa, payment through NGOs and whatever, and does he intend to visit any of the areas concerned to see the value on the ground that is being achieved for what we spend?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I have discussed this issue a number of times with John O'Shea of GOAL and other agencies.  I have discussed it with Mr. O'Shea more than anyone else and I have great regard for his efforts and commitment.  Anyone who meets him will appreciate that.  He has a particular issue with Uganda.  We note that and the people involved in it.  On the whole Irish Aid programme, the senior official who heads the initiative outside Ireland has vast experience in working with the United Nations.  We take these issues very seriously.One advantage for Ireland — I take nothing for granted and we always have to be careful — is that our aid is untied, which means it is directly targeted towards individual programmes.  We are getting the aid directly to the people on the ground, both religious and missionaries from times past and increasingly NGOs in current times.   Much of our aid goes, too, from UN organisations, in which case the control is not as direct.  However, I am assured that every consideration and effort is made.  Nonetheless, we are dealing with difficult enough regimes and positions.  The budget now is very large and the section is growing.  These issues are debated in a committee of the Houses and there is more focus on this area.  Because of the substantial amounts of money involved, the position is not like it was ten years ago so we have to watch the situation carefully.  As regards Irish Aid, we have a good reputation.  I very much favour those programmes where we can intervene directly through our people on the ground.  I am not saying there is anything wrong with the manner in which aid is distributed through the UN agencies, but we do not have direct control and involvement.Direct involvement means people on the ground and that is not always possible.  The €9 million initiative is one programme that is very much Irish orientated.  People are out there all year making plans in that regard.  That is not the only one and there are other programmes involving people on the ground, which we can control because of the presence of Irish committees.  I prefer that model because control is not moved away from us.  The entire aid programme is something we are very conscious of because the moneys and resources involved are very substantial.  It is difficult to keep a direct handle on it, but every effort is being made to do that.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	80	To re-emphasise the point Deputy Kenny made, in the Government's efforts to reach the 0.7% of GNP target, it is vitally important we do not lose sight of the fact that the money gets to where it should, particularly to the programme countries.  A mechanism must be put in place.  The Taoiseach indicated that perhaps it is difficult to keep track of expenditure in the absence of people on the ground.  I noted advertisements recently for professionals in that area.  Any moneys spent on project managers and accounting for aid expenditure is well spent.I want to take up a few matters relating to the legal status of Kosovo and I appreciate that the Taoiseach is reluctant to outline the Government position in this regard.  He indicated, however, that Europe is aware of its responsibilities in the area.  If there is a unilateral declaration of independence in Kosovo, has he legal advice on UN Resolution 1244?  Will that resolution be void and are there implications for Irish personnel in the area?  If so, we will have to face reality as regards the commitment of Europe to the area, as the Taoiseach has outlined.  If, as appears most likely, there is no resolution because of a Russian veto, we shall not  be able to make a contribution in the area notwithstanding what we have done and continue to do there.  I am sure the Taoiseach, in his quieter moments, questions the so-called triple lock policy.Another issue I want to raise is the reform treaty.  I note the European Court of Justice yesterday made a decision in a case brought by Britain, which was joined by Ireland to the effect that we would have no input into the shape of justice or home affairs matters. Perhaps the Taoiseach does not have advice on this judgment.  Does he have any regrets about the fact that we opted out of the justice and home affairs aspect of the reform treaty?  Are the implications of this decision more far-reaching than he thought at the time?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Deputy Timmins and I would be of the same view on the first matter he raised.  We face difficult decisions in the absence of a new resolution.  It raised complex legal and political issues for the individual and collective consideration not only of us but a large number of member states.  I hope to be able to maintain a presence in KFOR to contribute members of the Garda Síochána to any security and defence policy mission and support the future economic development of Kosovo.  This is where I would be coming from.  We will have to deal with the issue.  There is no doubt that it raises problems but we should be working on them and not be diverted by any of these issues.  We should follow the process which is back in the UN framework on the basis of the report of the contact group.  We should do all we can to ensure we play a role in it.Having listened to President Tassos Papadopoulos, the Greek Prime Minister and others, it is clear member states have many difficulties with this.  It is not an easy issue to hold unity on and they are not the only two who have difficulties.  The weeks ahead could be a difficult enough period with the Serbian election finished and what Kosovo does.  It is clear what Kosovo is intent on doing and it will create a difficult period.  I am clear in my mind that we should maintain our presence there.  We should work to do so and try to achieve that.With regard to our influence and the JHA, in deciding to opt out of the JHA opt-in opt-out arrangement we were very conscious to preserve our influence within the Union.  We have succeeded totally in doing that.  We made a strong declaration affirming our commitment to working with partners to combat cross-border crime and our intention to participate in future measures.  We have taken a very different position from the British and it has been seen that way.  It does not create any difficulty for us.  In three years we can review the situation.The declaration makes it plain that our decision on the JHA was taken reluctantly.  It does not stem from any inhibition about closer EU co-operation, particularly police co-operation.  We made clear our intention to keep the arrangement under active review and to consider this in a few years.  We have not got into any difficulties about the European Court of Justice.  The British were unwilling to commit to giving the European Court of Justice a role in JHA matters.  We take the opposite view and we have no such reservations.  We will also differentiate ourselves by making a strong political statement of our intention to participate to the maximum extent possible in JHA proposals, specifying in particular the area of police co-operation.  The British would not make that declaration and we are not aware of any intention on their part to do so.

Is it the case that as part of the strategy of the President of the Commission, José Manuel Barroso, to progress a common tax base he shelved this proposal until after Ireland's EU reform treaty referendum?  Will the Taoiseach tell the House whether the proposition has been shelved?  Is he aware this is only a temporary arrangement until after we have our referendum?  What is the Government's position with regard to the common tax base proposal?Does the Taoiseach still intend to invite the President, Mr. Barroso, to be an active campaigner in his pursuit of a "Yes" vote in the EU reform treaty referendum campaign during the course of 2008?  Given Mr. Barroso's outlook and penchant, does the Taoiseach see him as someone with whom he has common cause in this area?With regard to the water framework directive, did the Government support the introduction of the water framework directive in 2000?  Did it seek exceptions for schools and other not-for-profit public services from the directive?  The Lisbon treaty will give 105 new competencies to the European Union and a further 68 areas will move from consensus decision making within the European council to majority voting.  Given the Government's inability to secure the national interest in the instance of the water issue in our schools, what is the position with regard to such measures in the future?  Does the Taoiseach share the concern of many citizens with regard to the new powers being vested in the European Union and in the Council whereby we will have matters foisted upon us without the opportunity of veto?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	83	José Manuel Barroso is very much of my view on the taxation issue.  As Prime Minister and Minister and now Commissioner he has always been very supportive of my views on this issue.  There is no ceasing of work on this.  What is going on is that in the Commission, here and in other member states work is continuing in advance of any legislative proposal being brought forward.  The work being done now is of a purely technical nature and to date there has been no substantive political level discussion or endorsement of it.  We have no difficulty with that ongoing work to try to come to a technical understanding of what happens.I do not believe the common consolidated corporate tax base, CCCTB, is the type of grand project that will ever progress into a policy area.  Our view on this is that there is preparatory work to get an understanding of what is happening across 27 member states.  I have no difficulty with that.  If it moves back, as has happened a lot over the past 20 years, to some individual countries bringing this to a harmonised tax base, that is a different issue.  I do not see that difficulty now and I do not think it would be supported.My position on this has remained as it was since 1992.  I would be the best-known member of the present European Council for my views against this.  To be frank, one does not have to state them too much as they are well known now and there are plenty of supporters.  They can go ahead with their technical work all they like and we will co-operate with it.  Deputy Ó Caoláin's question was whether this would turn into a tax harmonisation issue.  I do not think it will and if I did, I would not support it.  We still have our own protections.  Tax sovereignty is an area over which we have a veto.  I do not see it coming to that in the foreseeable future and I am talking about years ahead not to mind the short term.One of the great things about the treaty is that for the next 20 or 30 years it is now agreed it must be 55% of member states and 65% of population in favour of any proposal.  The double majority system was a major success in ensuring for the long-term that small and medium sized member states would not be rolled over on issues, as they have never been in the European Union.  The double majority voting mechanism is a huge stride.  With respect, those like Deputy Ó Caoláin who have concerns that this might happen some day should be the first to go out canvassing to make sure it does not happen.

Perhaps he will offer some clarification.  There is no question that the ceding of tax sovereignty would have very serious consequences for the State.  While the Taoiseach indicated he and Commission President, Mr. Barroso, shared a broad outlook on this issue, that is not my understanding of Mr. Barroso's stance on the common tax base proposal.  Is it not the case that the shelving of this issue is related to the upcoming referendum?  Did the Taoiseach play a role in having this particular proposition shelved until after the treaty referendum?  Did he and the Government seek to have it shelved because they are anxious as to its impact in terms of Irish voter thinking regarding the EU reform treaty proposition, which is a constitution by any other name?The Government states that the European water framework directive is forcing the Departments of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science to levy schools with a water charge.  While the Taoiseach's intervention yesterday is welcome and the action he intends to take has been broadly welcomed across the sector, clarity is nonetheless required on this matter.  I asked the Taoiseach whether the Government supported the introduction of the water framework directive in 2000 or sought to have schools and other not-for-profit public facilities and services excluded from the directive.  I would like to know the factual position regarding the Government's record on both these matters.  As regards the absence of clarity, this was a train that was always going to hit us, as it did recently.  I ask the Taoiseach to provide clarity on the questions I posed on the common tax base and water framework directive.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I will be very clear on the first question.  The Deputy keeps saying the ongoing work on the CCCTB system has been shelved.  It has not been shelved and technical work is ongoing.  Will this turn into a legislative proposal to bring in tax harmonisation?  I do not believe it will and I do not believe President Barroso wants to do that.  If it was tried, the Deputy knows the issue could not be in safer hands because I have successfully opposed such measures on four occasions since 1992.  Will efforts be made to re-introduce it under another guise?  They probably will but we will oppose it again.  I do not want the Deputy to worry about CCCTB over the Christmas holidays.  He should not be concerned.On the water framework directive, we have operated on the basis that we would not introduce new exemptions while we retained our exemption for domestic households.  Our position in various discussions since 1999 has been to exempt residential users and charge all other users.  The Deputy will be aware that the European Union takes the view that everybody should pay for quality water.  The Government is investing more than €1 billion per annum in improving water quality and supply.  An enormous amount of resources have and will be put into this area in the previous development plan and the current plan, which covers a period of seven or eight years.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	90	I have a couple of questions arising from the summit.  While it may not be significant in terms of the content of the outcome, people are puzzled about the reason the summit was held in two venues, with the signing taking place in Lisbon after which everybody headed off to Brussels for the summit meeting.  Why could everything not be done in one venue?With regard to the treaty referendum, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution has recommended that there should be a period of 60 days between the enactment of a referendum Bill and the holding of the referendum.  Is it the Taoiseach's intention to stick with this 60-day requirement for the reform treaty?  If so, what timetable does he envisage in the new year leading up to the referendum?  While I appreciate that the treaty signing and so on has been completed, I am concerned that discussions have still not taken place between the Government and main Opposition parties supporting the treaty to discuss preparations for the referendum.A European Union police and civil administration mission for Kosovo has been proposed.  Would this lead to an increase in the Irish commitment and participation in Kosovo in terms of gardaí and civilians?Yesterday, on the Order of Business, I asked about the implications of the Laval case, on which the European Court of Justice issued its decision yesterday, for pay and conditions of employment in this State and our industrial relations system.  I also asked that the issue be discussed in the House at an early date.  Has consideration been given to my request, given that it is desirable that the House discuss the implications of the Laval case and the extent to which the inclusion of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the new treaty will influence future European Court of Justice decisions in areas protecting workers' rights well in advance of the referendum on the reform treaty?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	91	I will deal with the Deputy's final question first.  As he stated, the judgment in the Laval case was issued only yesterday and we will need time to study and consider the ramifications, if any, for Ireland.  Unlike Sweden, Ireland has a statutory minimum wage and it is illegal to pay anyone below the minimum wage, which currently stands at €8.65.  Ireland, because of its industrial relations framework and social partnership model, also has registered employment agreements which are binding.  The position here is, therefore, different from that in Sweden.Under Towards 2016, the ten-year framework agreed last year between the social partners and Government, new legislation, the employment law compliance Bill, will be introduced.  We have already established the National Employment Rights Authority whose chief executive is Ger Deering.  Some 60 labour inspectors have been recruited and 30 inspectors interviewed.  By October this year, more than 3,000 workplace inspections had been carried out, which is double the figure for 2006.  The Government will not tolerate abuse of workers and we are committed to building a statutory framework to prevent any possible displacement of workers.  The Laval judgment will have to be considered very carefully by the social partners and I hope this will be done.  If debate in the House is required, we will examine that matter at a later date.I was speaking with the officials this morning on this issue.  They have already commenced their judgment on it.  We have a very different position from Sweden because we have the statutory minimum wage and the registered agreements.In regard to Kosovo, if the UN mandate issue was sorted out it could well be that more people will be required.  We have been in there and have played a very good role from the start, including the Garda.  The new group will try to deal with the administrative side.  There are some 17,000 soldiers there but some day they will have to move towards setting up a structured society.  The Garda has been doing a good job in that area and is well respected there.  Hopefully the position will not get out of control.  It is obvious there will be considerable tensions in the new year.  In the EU, it is important to keep close to Serbia as well and try to avoid any heightening of tensions in so far as that is possible.It would have been better if the meetings in Lisbon and Brussels had been in one place or the other.  That was not possible as Lisbon wanted the treaty signed and Brussels wanted its European Council meeting and the rest of us had to travel.  That is how it is.  That is because Brussels was not prepared on this occasion to let up on its mandatory position on the Council meetings being held in Brussels, which was agreed many years ago.  That was for obvious reasons but it is not an ideal way of having to arrange a diary.  We did make that point and we were not the only country who made it but there was no agreement between Portugal and Belgium.  Belgium had its election the same time as we did but still has not formed a Government.  This would not have helped to form it either.  I think the Deputy asked another question.

I understand from reports that the Taoiseach put forward the name of Pat Cox for chair of that group but that it was not a runner because Felipe González, the ex prime minister of Spain was successful in achieving the chair.  I am somewhat disappointed that no soundings were made of the Opposition parties in regard to an agreed candidate for membership of what will be a very important body because its function will be to look at the issues and challenges facing the EU up to 2030.  Can the Taoiseach tell us the reason he did not consult with the Opposition parties and whether, at this point, there is any prospect of Pat Cox becoming a member of that group?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	95	Perhaps I can correct Deputy Costello.  We never put forward the name of Pat Cox as chair of the group.  We put forward the name of Pat Cox as a member of the committee.  We were asked in September for somebody with competent and qualified European experience.  We did not think there was anybody who was better qualified in that regard, having just been the past president of European Parliament.  Pat Cox never lobbied or looked for the position of chair.  As a matter of fact, he did not seek membership either but we approached him.  In the last week when there were differences between various groups about Felipe González and Vaire Vike-Freiberga, the former president of Latvia, they started to look at other names.  One of the names that was mentioned was Pat Cox.  That is where it came from.  Pat Cox was in the United States and was not in any way involved in that issue.  We have continued with what we set out to do which was to put forward the name of Pat Cox as a member of the committee.  We will continue to lobby for that.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	97	We remain hopeful.  He is eminently qualified and of current times to be in this position.  That is not to take from any of the others but, to be frank, I am not a big supporter of going back 20 years when one wants to move 20 years forward.  To me that sounds strange that if one wants to plan Europe for 2030 one goes back to someone who was around in 1980.  Sometimes people make strange decisions.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I have no objection to No. 6 which is the appointment of the chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission, Justice Matthew P. Smith.  I wish to object to No. 7 and I shall explain why.  Last Wednesday I had a phone call from the Tánaiste in respect of the proposal to make an appointment of an ordinary member to the Standards in Public Office Commission.  I accept fully the Tánaiste's word that he inadvertently or did not appreciate the need for consultation with members of the Opposition in respect of this appointment.  I accept that fully and I accept that it is his right to make a nomination.  I wish to make the following points.  Obviously when this was the end of tenure of a member of the Opposition, former Deputy and Minister, Liam Kavanagh of the Labour Party, it should have been clear that there should have been consultation about it.  The Tánaiste made an offer to rotate these positions after six years given that the tenure is a six-year term.  That is four years before the end of the world, according to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

There was no consultation, just a direct approach and nomination.I have nothing against the former Minister, Mr. Michael Smith, with whom I served in the House for many years.  However, he has only recently left office and would have served with all the members of the current Government.  While there is no implication that Mr. Smith has ever done anything wrong — I do not remotely suggest this — he is listed as a person who will give evidence at the Mahon tribunal.I do not want to divide the House on the issue.  I would prefer if the Taoiseach went ahead with the appointment of Mr. Justice Smith as chairperson of the commission and deferred the appointment of an ordinary member until such time as there is proper consultation between the Government and Opposition to find how we can work out an agreed personality.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	109	I agree with the comments made by Deputy Kenny.  I raised this issue last week and tabled an amendment to the Government motion today in the terms Deputy Kenny has outlined, namely, that we would proceed with the reappointment of Mr. Justice Smith as chairperson of the Standards in Public Office Commission and that the appointment of the ordinary member would be deferred to allow for consultation and discussion between the parties in the House.  The Ceann Comhairle has ruled that the amendment is inadmissible for the reasons he outlined in a letter to me, which I accept.There is no issue with regard to Mr. Michael Smith's suitability or otherwise for appointment.  The issue is that this is an appointment that is made following a resolution of the House and there should be consultation between the parties on that matter.  As Deputy Kenny pointed out, the Tánaiste made an offer during the week that he would appoint a member of the Opposition to this position when it arises again in six years' time.

It should not be done in this way as there should have been consultation.  If we want to avoid a division on the issue, the Taoiseach should accept the proposal being made by Deputy Kenny and myself that we would defer No. 7, discuss the problem and try to work out some resolution.The appointment of the ordinary member should be done by agreement of the House.  It is not like an appointment to an ordinary State board in the ordinary way.  This is the body that oversees ethics and standards legislation.  It is not desirable that there should be a political row over the appointment.  Therefore, the best way to proceed is to deal with No. 6 and reappoint the chairperson, and then let us discuss the appointment of the ordinary member and see what can be done to resolve the matter.

My issue is a different one.  On reading the Order of Business with regard to statements on the European Council, the Taoiseach clearly referred to "the main spokespersons for the Fine Gael Party, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin".  My issue with the Taoiseach and Tánaiste is that in any of these consultation matters, there is an onus to consult all of the political parties and to include Sinn Féin.It is not just a matter of deliberations with Fine Gael and the Labour Party, irrespective of numbers, nor are they the sole representatives of Opposition voices in this Chamber.  Our democracy will be measured by the way the smaller parties are treated by the larger blocs.  It is imperative, and as a matter of practice into the future I make the point, that we are here to play our part in deliberations, consultations and decision-making.  I would appreciate it if the Government would accord us the same courtesy on this matter and on all other relevant matters into the future.

They have made their point with regard to consultation and they have accepted the bona fides of the Tánaiste in talking to the Opposition about what happened.  Mr. Liam Kavanagh, who is a former Member of the House and Minister, was appointed six or seven years ago and did a very good job in this regard.  We are now putting forward another former Minister and Member of the House and we hope he will do a good job also.  While we accept the point made, we must proceed with the appointment.

This was impossible to do a while ago but I would like to refer to a number of features of the scheme.  First, a new category is being introduced comprising low income families, which are just above the family income supplement threshold.  A payment of €45 per week will be provided but I am not sure how that was evaluated or whether it will make a meaningful contribution for parents in that category.  Second, the Minister of State issued a press release yesterday but the details of the scheme were not circulated and they have not been adopted by the House.  Will the Taoiseach indicate when that will happen?  Third, the Government stated clearly it wanted to evaluate the scheme.  The Department has extensive information on incomes and other questions answered by parents.  In order that every Member and every party and none would be fully acquainted with the scheme, 95% of which was proposed by Deputy Shatter on behalf of the Fine Gael Party some time ago, is it the Taoiseach's intention to publish the evaluation so that all Members will be fully briefed on the extent of the changes, the details and the recommendations in this regard?

That is the latest date for the return of the House since 2002.  For instance, in 2004 the Dáil returned on 20 January.  The tradition of the House not returning until the end of January goes back to when the budget was announced at the end of that month and the logic at the time was the Government needed the month of January to prepare the budget.  Clearly that does not apply anymore and there is no justification for the Dáil not returning until the end of January.  There is a strong case for it returning earlier next year.For example, because of the way St. Patrick's Day and Easter fall next year, there will only be 20 days in the next session.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated that Bills will be published before the next session.  The A list contains 13 Bills that are due to be published before the beginning of the next session and, presumably, they will have to be taken in that 20-day period.  This follows a year in which we have sat for only 76 days.  Even allowing for the election, that is probably a record low in the history of the House.  The Labour Party is opposed to the adjournment of the Dáil until 30 January 2008.

Having heard the Taoiseach's response, there are still concerns about the enhanced proposition relating to the community child care subvention scheme.  I welcome the expansion by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, of the various tiers and the supports under same.

The key issue is if the threshold is too low, it will simply not make sufficient difference and many people will continue to suffer in 2008.  I ask the Minister of State, the Taoiseach and the Government to listen to those who are lobbying for improvements in this area.

The Taoiseach, on 6 November, and the Minister for Health and Children, on 7 November, promised us that we would have the Ann O'Doherty report by the end of November.

The press release by the Minister of State, Deputy Brendan Smith, as reported in today's newspapers, is completely ambiguous regarding parents who seek child care services.  The implication is that parents on low incomes will receive €45 a week, but that will only happen if they have a preschool place.  In my constituency, 200 children are on waiting lists for places.

Long-standing Members of the House are aware that the House only functions due to the dedication, commitment and hard work of the many people who work behind the scenes.  This is our only opportunity in the year to thank them for that.  On behalf of Members on the Government benches, Members of the House and the leaders of other parties, I thank everybody who works with the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, and the people who work in the Houses of the Oireachtas, including the ushers, restaurant staff and the gardaí and Army personnel who are based here. We very much appreciate their courtesy, kindness and help throughout the year and the long hours they work.  I wish our colleagues in the Press Gallery every seasonal joy.  They do a good job reporting proceedings in the House and I hope they, their families and friends have a good Christmas.Most of all, I wish all Members of this House — Deputy Kenny and his party, Deputy Gilmore and his party, Deputy Ó Caoláin and his party, the Independent Members and all my colleagues — and Members of the Upper House a very happy and peaceful Christmas.  I hope they enjoy a good break.  Everybody has worked hard in their respective positions in 2007 so I hope they get a rest over the Christmas.  It is a time for family and friends.

We have had difficulties and arguments in the House over the past few months, but the nature of politics is confrontational.  We have a job to do, or try to do, as has the Taoiseach.  I wish the Taoiseach, his family, the members of his party and all their families the season's compliments and good health and fortune for 2008.  I extend the same wishes to Deputy Gilmore and congratulate him on settling into his role as Leader of the Labour Party.  I also extend them to Deputy Ó Caoláin, whose party's numbers are reduced this year, and congratulate him on his recovery to good health.  In that context, I hope Deputy Tony Gregory, who is ill at present, will make a full recovery.  I wish everybody who serves this House, including the gardaí, ushers and staff who work in the kitchens and elsewhere, well.I save my words about the Ceann Comhairle for last.

As a Deputy of long service, since the first time he sat in the Chair, from which he emerged faster than Carl Lewis ever left the blocks, he has shown an ability to understand the frustrations and difficulties experienced by Members.  I wish him well in his endeavours in the area of Dáil reform so that we can make this House and its politics more relevant to the people of this country long after everybody who is currently serving has departed.  The platforms we build now will have to cater for the generations that follow.  Ba mhaith mo bhuíochas a ghlacadh leat, a Cheann Comhairle, agus guím rath Dé ar do chuid oibre.  Nollaig shona do gach éinne ó gach páirtí — Baill den Fhreasúra agus Baill den Rialtas — agus iad siúd atá ag obair sa Teach.

I join Deputy Kenny in sending to Deputy Gregory our good wishes and hopes of a speedy recovery.I wish the Ceann Comhairle and the Leas-Cheann Comhairle the best for Christmas.  I agree with Deputy Kenny that we are entering the Christmas recess without rancour.  There is a sense of goodwill around the House which I do not doubt is due to the calming influence of the Ceann Comhairle on our proceedings.  Long may that continue.I especially express my appreciation to the staff of the Houses.  I wish them a happy Christmas.  We are able to do our work because of the dedication, courtesy, friendship and help shown by staff at all levels, including senior officials who help and administer the House, the restaurant staff, ushers and members of the Garda and the Defence Forces.  I also wish a happy Christmas to the members of the press who cover our work.  Given the long rest ahead of us, I do not doubt we will return at the end of January recovered and ready for battle.

I extend Christmas greetings to the Taoiseach, his colleagues in Government, the component parties and Independent members of the Government.I extend the season's greetings to Deputy Kenny and the Fine Gael Party.  I hope I did not note any glee on the part of Deputy Kenny in mentioning that we have depleted numbers on this occasion.  It is something with which I and my colleagues are coping remarkably well and I am confident it is only a temporary inconvenience.  I extend greetings of the season to Deputy Gilmore and the members of the Labour Party and to the Independent Deputies.  I join in the good wishes to Deputy Tony Gregory and wish him a speedy return to full health.I also extend greetings of this special season to the Superintendent, Paul Conway, the Clerk of the Dáil, Kieran Coughlan, and their respective staffs at all levels throughout this institution.  I concur with the remarks about the great assistance and support given by all who serve within this institution.  It is the unsung aspect of what happens on this site for those of us who are in the public eye and those who are not.  The latter make a huge contribution.  It is appropriate, then, that I extend my greetings not only to elected Members but to the support staff of the elected Members of all parties, who are the basis of much of the work done for which we are only the public wrapping.I extend good wishes to the members of the press.  Although they are not in the Press Gallery at present, I am sure they are listening.  To those who give Sinn Féin fair play, to those who mention us occasionally and to those who ignore us habitually, I extend good wishes and hope they will all employ fair play in 2008.  Nollaig shona dhíobh uilig.

We do not often get an opportunity to acknowledge how much they do so I thank each and every one of them for their unfailing courtesy and the professional commitment they have shown throughout the year.  I sincerely thank the members of the media and the political correspondents who report for newspapers, radio and television.  They have an important role to play in the interest of democracy by informing the wider public on the Parliament and how it works.  I acknowledge the hard work of the security forces in the House in ensuring everything runs smoothly.I do not know whether I have proven the old Irish adage "Tús maith, leath na hoibre", but I am grateful to Deputies for their kind sentiments.  Guím Nollaig shona agus athbhliain faoi mhaise oraibh go léir.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Before turning to the European Council, I wish to inform the House that I attended the formal ceremony to sign the reform treaty in Lisbon on 13 December.  I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche.  The Minister and I signed the treaty on behalf of Ireland.The signing of the treaty is an important stage in ensuring that our Union focuses on the real challenges confronting us.  The treaty is designed to equip the Union to manage 21st century challenges which are increasingly global in nature, such as globalisation, climate change, energy supply and cross-border crime.  At the same time, it rationalises the EU's institutional framework so that it functions in a fair, efficient and effective manner.  It also brings into force the Charter of Fundamental Rights to reflect the Union's values and underpin the rights of individuals across the Union.  The intention is for the treaty to be ratified by all member states so that it can enter into force on 1 January 2009.Consequently, as Members are aware, the treaty will be put to the people in a referendum next year.I wish to repeat my welcome for the Opposition's willingness to work together with the Government towards the treaty's ratification.  In that vein, I look forward to discussing the referendum with the leaders of the Opposition shortly.  I know that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, have already met some of them in this regard.I attended the European Council in Brussels on 14 December, again accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  On this occasion, the Council was also joined for a short period by representatives of the social partners to discuss the social agenda and social partnership at EU level.  As is normal, we had an exchange of views with the President of the European Parliament, Hans-Gert Pöttering who stressed the importance of the EU reform treaty for Europe.  President Pöttering is of the view that the European Parliament is a big winner in the EU reform treaty, principally because of the extension of co-decision.We received a presentation from the Commission President, José Manuel Barroso, on the issue of migration, following the recent publication of the Commission's communication on immigration, Towards a Common Migration Policy.  This is primarily concerned with migration from outside the European Union.  While most of the recent immigration to Ireland has been from within the European Union following the enlargement from 15 member states to 27, the Government also is highly interested in the question of migration from further afield.In his intervention, President Barroso stressed the need for member states to work together to deal with migration flows, which are likely to increase in coming years and which are of significant concern to citizens.  He stated that migration can contribute to offsetting some of the consequences of Europe's population aging and stressed the need for consistency between policy areas such as employment, social security, social housing and housing policy in general.  His general message on migration was that the issues are too important to be neglected.  The Council welcomed the historic enlargement of the Schengen area to include nine new member states.  From Friday, internal borders, with the exception of air travel, will be lifted for the nine new members.  Moreover, the air borders will be lifted at the end of March.The Council adopted a lengthy series of conclusions on freedom, security and justice, economic, social and environmental issues, as well as external relations.  We noted developments on migration, strengthening police and judicial co-operation and improving civil law co-operation.  The Council welcomed the recent presentation by the Commission of its Single Market review.  A well functioning Single Market is hugely important to an open economy such as Ireland's.  The Commission's review has identified a number of possible initiatives to improve the functioning of the market.  Much of the work arising from the review will be addressed in greater detail in the lead-up to the European Council next spring.The Council also welcomed the Commission's report on the renewed Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs.  The Lisbon strategy now is generally accepted to be delivering more effectively as the European economies do better.  The next phase of the Lisbon strategy also is likely to be discussed in more detail in spring.Within the general area of competitiveness, the Council noted two developments that merit particular mention in the House.  After difficult negotiations, agreement has been reached on the Galileo project, which is intended to deliver a global satellite navigation infrastructure by 2013.  The Council welcomed the setting up of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, which should improve our return on research expenditure.While the European Council was meeting in Brussels, the extremely important negotiations in Bali were in progress.  Appropriately, the Council took the opportunity of underlining again the urgent need for a global, comprehensive and effective post-Kyoto agreement by 2009.  Since then, agreement has been reached at Bali.  The agreement has been welcomed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, as a major step towards an international deal on tackling climate change.  I also welcome the agreement reached and in particular the recognition that all countries must play a role in tackling climate change.  Climate change is an immense challenge for the world and I am pleased that Europe has been leading the efforts to secure a global agreement.Together with climate change, globalisation is throwing up some of the most important challenges and opportunities of this century.  The Council adopted a declaration on globalisation that highlighted the need for the Union to work for an equitable and sustainable framework for the distribution of the benefits of globalisation.  The declaration emphasised a number of important themes, including the delivery of the Lisbon strategy, fulfilling the Union's commitments on climate change and energy, improved operation of the financial markets, trade liberalisation and intellectual property protection, taking responsibility for global security and stability, migration policy and development, which includes Europe's commitments under the millennium development goals.Overall, the declaration takes a balanced and positive approach to globalisation, which is welcome.  One is confronted too often with the negative consequences of globalisation without acknowledgement of the many potential benefits and opportunities that arise, such as job creation and foreign direct investment.On this occasion, the Council devoted a large proportion of its time to consideration of external relations issues.  While there was some discussion of Iran, most of the focus was on Kosovo and consequently, also on Serbia.  At Ireland's initiative, the Council also highlighted the issue of Burma where the situation continues to be very serious.  There is a continuing need to remind the Burmese military regime that the international community is engaged actively on this issue.As for Kosovo, we discussed the report from the Contact Group troika on the conclusion and failure of the Kosovo status talks.  The European Council thanked the troika for its efforts and regretted that the parties had not been able to find agreement on a common way forward.  The issue will now revert to the UN, where it will be discussed by the UN Security Council, beginning on 19 December.  The Council considered the position to be adopted by the EU and underlined the need to move forward towards a Kosovo settlement, which is required for regional stability.There was strong emphasis on the importance of a unified European Union approach and for the European Union to make clear its willingness to take the lead internationally in helping to manage and resolve this European problem, including by means of the planned European Security and Defence Policy, ESDP, rule of law mission and a contribution to an international civilian office as part of the future international presence in Kosovo.  Ireland is ready to play its part and remains committed to playing an active and positive role, including through its substantial commitment to the KFOR military presence, as well as participation by the Garda in the planned ESDP mission.The European Council agreed to establish a reflection group to reflect on the future of the EU over the period 15 to 20 years ahead, that is, from 2020 to 2030.  The group will not deal with institutional issues or cut across the EU reform treaty in any way.  The Government believes the group can make a useful contribution to ensuring the turning of our minds to emerging challenges and opportunities in good time and in that sense ensure that we prepare earlier for them.  Under the Presidency's guidance, the Council agreed to nominate former Spanish Prime Minister, Felipe Gonzalez, to chair the group and nominated two vice-chairs, namely, the former Latvian President Vike-Freiberga and Jorma Ollila, the chairman of Nokia.The Government has suggested Mr. Pat Cox as someone who is excellently suited to the work of the group.  While it is likely to be some time before the group's membership is finalised, I of course would be pleased were he to feature among the eventual members.  The remaining membership of the group is not expected to be finalised until well into 2008 and it will report by the end of 2010.The Council conducted its business efficiently.  There is a very clear sense now that the signature of the EU reform treaty will allow Europe to move on from a long internal discussion to concentrate on meeting the real and developing challenges in a fast changing world, including migration, international crime and trafficking, climate change, energy security, international trade, development issues and issues of peace and stability.As the European Council concluded last Friday, ratification of the EU reform treaty will put an end to institutional reform for the foreseeable future.  The focus now in that regard will be for each member state to get on with the process of ratification according to its domestic procedures.  I note that Hungary has already ratified the treaty.  In Ireland, an extensive information campaign on the detail and implications of the treaty will be rolled out in the coming months.  I look forward to engaging with the public when they are given the opportunity to consider the EU reform treaty next year.  Its approval will be in the interests of the public, Ireland and Europe.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	209	This single greatest challenge facing Ireland next year is that in many ways, the future of 500 million people will depend on a decision by the Irish people.  From my perspective, it is absolutely imperative that those Members who support this treaty will ensure that the people are given the best level of information that they understand in order that they can make that decision.  I wish well in his endeavours the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  Fine Gael will support strongly the EU reform treaty and will campaign publicly on it.I note that Hungary has ratified the treaty.  I met Prime Minister Tusk of Poland, who has brought a completely changed attitude towards the European Union since his election.  He made it very clear at the European People's Party group meeting that in future Poland will be in the progressive mould for the development of Europe.  I recognise that the signing of the treaty last week in Lisbon is a very important milestone and I regret that Prime Minister Brown was not on time.  At the EPP meeting, somebody asked what had happened to British punctuality.  Perhaps it suffers from globalisation but I am not sure.  In any event, the lack of punctuality only reinforces the view that Britain only wants to be a sideline member of a Union that will be so important in the times ahead.International relations regarding Kosovo will be absolutely critical.  It is important to be wise about these matters and doing nothing is not wise.  We must wait to see whether proceeding as proposed is wise but it appears from my reflections on dealing with interested parties that the Serbs will under no circumstances accept a diktat like the one proposed.  Nobody wants to see Serbia annexed to Russia.  The leadership of the European Union must make it perfectly clear that EU assistance for the Serbian people in the event of a declaration of independence for Kosovo will be mainstreamed rapidly.  Otherwise other countries in the region will regard the development as a precedent for similar declarations.  If the Helsinki Accord is breached and borders are changed without consent, it will cause quite a problem.It is necessary to consider the circumstances in which we will find ourselves in the coming years.  The European Council has reflected on certain issues in this regard and four of them are fundamental.  Competitiveness in the global economy is one.  China and India are likely to account for 50% of the world's GDP by 2060.  This is an enormous proportion.  The two countries accounted for the same proportion in 1820.  When one considers the scale of the challenge that faces all other countries in the face of this phenomenal rise, Europe, with its 500 million people, must get its act together.  This means moving to the forefront of technological development.Demography and immigration are the next serious problems.  The world has a birth rate of 21 per 1,000 of the population and the United States has a rate of 14 per 1,000.  In Europe there are ten per 1,000.  Increasing the European rate from ten per 1,000 to 11 per 1,000 will at least stabilise the European population.  If we do not do so, we will face very serious levels of immigration.  EPP leaders are stating no country on its own could withstand the pressure if the population of Africa doubled in the next 25 years and 10% of the young males decided to emigrate.  There needs to be a well-thought out European response that is fair on individual nations and immigrants.The issues of terrorism and security also arise.  Terrorists are now being recruited through cyber-mobilisation.  The Government is conscious of this and I hope it will deal with it.Energy and the environment comprise another issue that must be borne in mind.  I commend the Government on creating an Oireachtas Committee on Climate Change and Energy Security.  It is important and we could lead by example in this regard.  The Chairman of the committee, Deputy Barrett, stated every Department should be able to set out its programme of work for playing our part in reducing carbon dioxide emissions.  This is fundamental to demonstrating that one can lead from the front and that, as a small country, we have a genuine opportunity to make a real impact.The reform treaty has now been signed and it behoves us to have it ratified by the public.  For our part, we will contribute in any way we can to ensuring the people are given as much information as possible to allow them to make their decision, which I hope will be positive.
#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-party	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-dob	unknown-#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	210	It is important to remember the origins of the reform treaty.  The process began some years ago with the Convention on the Future of Europe.  Deputies Roche, Bruton and Gormley participated and the proceedings lasted a long time.  The convention took on board the views of many people before it formulated its proposal for the EU constitution, which ultimately evolved into the reform treaty.  Like Deputy Kenny, I welcome the reform treaty's ratification by Hungary.It is good that Ireland is to have a referendum.  There will certainly be considerable focus on us.  The former Latvian President, Dr. Vaira Vike-Freiberga, was speaking at the National Forum on Europe last week and mentioned how Latvia has adopted a very pragmatic approach.  The treaty is not having a negative impact in that country and is regarded as necessary to making the institutions of the European Union more efficient.One downside of the welcome referendum in Ireland is that there will be a very strong "No" campaign by people who always begin by advocating openness and truthfulness and talking about deals behind closed doors but then proceed to circulate misinformation left, right and centre.  I find it slightly amusing that they always use the preamble that Ireland has not done too badly out of Europe but that the forthcoming treaty is the one that will finish it off.  The same rhetoric is trotted out each time.  It is stated we lost our sovereignty in 1973, and again after the Maastricht and Nice treaties, and that we are now to lose it again.  It is quite amazing how they air these views, often unchallenged by sections of the media.  As well as analysing what the proponents of the treaty stand for, it is important to analyse what those against it stand for and their various supporting arguments over recent years.I agree with most commentators that the reform treaty document is very bulky.  It is divided into several parts.  The Preamble and Article 1 deal with the changes to the Treaty on European Union and Article 2 deals with changes to the treaty establishing the European Community.  These are accompanied by final provisions, protocols and the declarations.  I was going to bring the document to the Chamber but it was almost too heavy to carry.  Had I known Deputy Durkan was coming, I would have got him to carry it down.  He is a strong man from the west of Ireland and has picked potatoes and all that goes with it.It is very important that the document be user-friendly.  The Government is considering addressing this.  We have covered many of the provisions of the reform treaty, including the concept of the President of the European Council and the troika of countries operating together for the various defined periods.  Continuity is certainly needed.  The difficulty with the European Presidency is that each country that has held it has had its own agenda.  Very often they made changes and veered in a certain direction.  There will now be a little more continuity.One area that will probably cause difficulty is the establishment of a High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.  Declaration 13 deals with this issue.  It is important to read it into the record because the opponents of the treaty will try to dress it up in acrid colours:The Conference underlines that the provisions in the Treaty on European Union covering the Common Foreign and Security Policy, including the creation of the office of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy and the establishment of an External Action Service, do not affect the responsibilities of the Member States, as they currently exist, for the formulation and conduct of their foreign policy nor of their national representation in third countries and international organisations.The Conference also recalls that the provisions governing the Common Security and Defence Policy do not prejudice the specific character of the security and defence policy of the Member States.It stresses that the EU and its Member States will remain bound by the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and, in particular, by the primary responsibility of the Security Council and of its Members for the maintenance of international peace and security.This sets out the position on the issue very clearly.  There is also a role for national parliaments in this regard.  The scrutiny period recommended in the proposed constitution was for six weeks, but the reform treaty has extended this to eight weeks, which is welcome.  If the national parliament votes on an issue, a quarter of all members is needed for freedom, security and justice issues and a third is needed for other issues to refer the issue back to the EU, which must give a reasoned opinion if it decides that it will not change its policy.  For the first time ever, there is a correct procedure laid out on how a country may opt out of the EU if it so wishes.  Double majority voting will also make things clearer.I am sure that members of the Government are familiar with the recent EU barometer, which stated that 57% of the population distrusts the Government, whereas only 23% distrusts the Union, which is an interesting statistic.  Support for the EU is at a high at 74% and there is recognition by 87% that we have benefitted from Europe in the past.  However, there is a concern among six out of ten people that their voice is not heard in Europe.  That is not strictly true, but the perception is out there.  It is based on the gap between Europe and the public, and is something we must work on.  That is why the Forum on Europe was set up, as well as the European affairs committee.  The forum is doing a very extensive tour of the country to bring the message of what the reform treaty is about in a non-partisan manner.  I encourage people to try to visit that forum.The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, alluded this week to the tendency of everyone in this country to blame Brussels.  The national Parliament blames Brussels, while local authorities blame the Government.  We are always blaming somebody, but the buck stops somewhere.  We can always say "No".Deputy Kenny spoke about Kosovo.  By the time the Dáil returns in the new year, I feel this issue will have evolved.  There will almost certainly be a declaration of independence.  The north-western section of Kosovo, which is dominated by Serbians, may look to secede to Serbia.  We must be very conscious of the desire of Serbia not to see an independent Kosovo, notwithstanding the fact that the situation cannot stay as it is.  There is the potential——

I hope that we, as an integral part of the EU, can give our imprimatur when the referendum is called.  I hope that the naysayers will not get a disproportionate amount of time and accommodation from everybody.  There seems to be a notion developing that everybody who says “No” should get more time and have greater credence attributed to them.  I hope that will not be the case.Deputy Timmins referred to the notion of blaming Europe for everything that goes wrong.  When negotiating in the Council or in the Commission, we are in charge of our destiny.  There is no sense in blaming everybody else.  We go in there open handed, with no restrictions.  We can negotiate as it suits ourselves, albeit with the agreement of the rest.  To opt out from that is to do no justice to ourselves or to anybody else.  I am sick and tired of listening to people complaining about the treachery of the fisheries policy and the agricultural policy.  That is a matter for ourselves and we can adjust it ourselves.  We go into negotiations and we are responsible for them.As Chairman of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, I and my colleagues will be making a constructive effort in the course of the referendum that will take place and we hope that it will be a vehicle whereby the Minister, his officials and the country benefit from the debate that follows.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the EU Council meeting in Brussels.  It was quite a busy weekend, as the EU institutions came together on 12 December to proclaim the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  That is a very important body of rights and is incorporated in the reform treaty.  It is unfortunate that Britain has chosen to opt out from the legally binding charter, but it is extremely important that we have opted in and that it is part of what we will be voting for in the referendum.  This was followed by the signing of the treaty on 13 December and the Council meeting on 14 December.The reform treaty was the major issue addressed by the Heads of Government in Lisbon and in Brussels.  My party will be strongly supporting the referendum that will take place in 2008.  We will certainly be doing our best for a "Yes" vote on the treaty.  It was good to see in the European poll in today's newspapers that at least 87% of people in Ireland are well disposed to Europe and that they feel that Ireland has benefitted from the EU.  Nevertheless, there was a sizeable minority who felt that Ireland had very little say in decisions being made in Brussels.  That is the major downside of the equation.  It seems to be a stubborn issue that in spite of all the talk of eliminating the democratic deficit and making Europe more accountable, establishing the Forum on Europe, the Joint Committee on EU Scrutiny and the Joint Committee on European Affairs, the citizens of this country are still not convinced that Europe is close to them.  That is the challenge that could become an issue at the heart of the referendum debate.  How do we convince people that not only can they see benefits, but they are also participants in the manner in which these benefits come about and that they have a major say in decision making?  The treaty has considerable provisions that will advance that situation.The Lisbon treaty provides the EU with a stable and lasting institutional framework, so that the Union will be able to concentrate fully on addressing the concrete challenges ahead, including globalisation and climate change.  These are the major issues of the day and the Heads of Government were strong in their espousal of the position on globalisation.  A fine document was produced on climate change, humanitarian aid and so on.  We will be thrashing out all of these issues over the next few months.The Taoiseach also said he would be inviting the German Chancellor, Ms Angela Merkel to Ireland during the course of the referendum and that she had already accepted the invitation.  He also said he would be inviting the French President, Mr. Nicolas Sarkozy, to come to Ireland.  We have already heard on the grapevine that Mr. Le Pen is likely to come here as well.  An organisation has been established on the "No" side called Libertas, which will fight the treaty.  In a recent press conference, members of this organisation stated that the Minister for Foreign Affairs had signed a blank cheque when signing the reform treaty.  These are the types of situations that will arise and the conflicting forces on either side.  It would be useful to get a clear idea as quickly as possible on when the referendum will take place, whether it will be accompanied by a referendum on children, when the enabling legislation is likely to come before the House, when the referendum commission is likely to be established and when documentation is likely to be distributed throughout the country.  This information should be made publicly available as quickly as possible.One of the major areas addressed by the European Council was that of freedom, security and justice, and I was impressed by the issues raised.  The European Council welcomed the enlargement of the Schengen area to include the new member states and the abolition of the border controls.  It also welcomed the establishment of the annual European day against the death penalty on 10 October.  That is welcome, considering we had problems with Poland, which have been eliminated.  It will be auspicious to have an annual death penalty abolition day.  The major area addressed under this heading was the emphasis on the importance of developing as quickly as possible a comprehensive European migration policy and a common immigration policy by 2008 and the need for progress on a common European asylum system for implementation in 2010.  These issues are of major concern to Ireland, as well as to all the other countries in Europe.Yesterday I received some replies to parliamentary questions on asylum seekers from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  On the day we signed the European reform treaty 6,636 asylum seekers were in direct provision accommodation in Ireland receiving a miserable €19.10 per week stipend and waiting for their applications to be processed.  Some 2,990 of those, 45% of the total, have been asylum seekers for a minimum of 12 months.  The application procedures are too long and cumbersome in Ireland.  It is hoped that with an EU-wide approach the information will be more available and streamlined and that we can speed up the process of dealing with the cases.  If we adopt an EU-wide approach and a common European asylum system, we must be careful to conform to the international conventions and law and ensure the system is not reduced to being a response to the pressing needs of the most hard-pressed member states.  We have seen some of that in the recent past.Ireland needs to establish the link between migration, immigration and asylum seeking and overseas development policies.  That area should be emphasised.  It is disturbing that the Irish Government distanced itself from proposals on sanctions against employers of illegally staying Third World nationals.  I would have thought we would be to the forefront of pursuing anybody who breaks the law by employing people whom they are not entitled to employ.  We should be prepared to go ahead with the European position on this issue, but we have not been.My main concern is on the opt-out clauses.  In today's The Irish Times Mr. Jamie Smyth wrote that the opt-out ruling will erode Irish influence on EU justice and border laws.  That affects the entire Schengen area, as presented in the decision by the European Court of Justice when the British Government in particular, without opting into the full Schengen system, sought to have a say in the establishment of standards and the drafting of regulations on security features and biometrics in passports.  Because we are not party to the Schengen Agreement, will we find ourselves without a role, or with only a discretionary role in any of the legislative proposals on border control, police co-operation and cross-border crime, including all the important police and judicial activity on that?We need urgent clarification on this from the Government.  New asylum seeking and migration policies were decided with great alacrity on 14 December by the Heads of State and will become part of a uniform European approach, which will ensure some badly needed cohesion on the issue.  Will we be in difficulties in terms of input because we are not sure if we will be part of the end product of the proposals that will be drawn up?  Will input into the drafting process be denied to us?  This is a major issue that needs clarification as quickly as possible.Many concerns were expressed that Eurojust and Europol are not operating effectively.  Heads of State felt Europol should be established on a more effective basis by the middle of 2008.  It has always been my concern that while we pay lip service to police co-operation and all the police forces do, in practice it is not as effective as it should be.  We have put in place the European arrest warrant to enable a more holistic approach to dealing with criminals crossing borders.  However, we do not exercise the powers we have.  Until we exercise those powers regarding other countries and have Europe-wide co-operation in doing so, I am not sure we will make much progress in dealing with the major issues that affect us, namely, guns and drugs that are imported and exported in Europe.On the economic, social and environmental issues, again the European Council spoke about progress on the Lisbon strategy for growth and jobs and the new three-year cycle.  However, in practice Europe seems to have been lagging the Lisbon Agenda across the board compared with the new superpowers, China and India, and the United States.  In the key areas of job creation and research and development, Europe is behind, as is Ireland.  We have not met our targets.  While Ireland's assessment report is generally good on a number of issues related to education, research and innovation, we are far behind in these key areas that are central to building the economies of the future.Issues such as agency workers must be sorted.  We have taken a poor position on that, denying rights to which agency workers should be entitled, and therefore we cannot get a European directive on the issue.  Tax harmonisation must be clarified.  Some good work has been done by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on Brazilian beef and Europe is taking up a position, which it should have done before.  The UN Millennium Declaration on globalisation, to my mind, is a fine holistic document.  It gives a very good overview on how globaiisation can have a human face in terms of progress and as regards retaining the social and human agenda, all the time.  I hope we have the reform treaty before us in the not too distant future and that there will be a "Yes" vote.

Ar dtús báire by mhaith liom a rá nár aontaigh mé leis an dTaoiseach nuair a dúirt sé gur fháiltigh sé go raibh an Freasúra chun obair le chéile chun an conradh seo a glacadh.  Mar cuid den Freasúra, níl muidne i bhfábhar an conradh seo, ní bheidh muid ag obair leis an Rialtas agus táimid chun cur ina gcoinne go tréan.  An tseachtain seo caite ag an gComhairle Eorpach san bPortaingéal, shínigh cinnirí ón Aontas Eorpach an chonradh Lisbóin.  Níl aon pioc difriúil idir é seo agus an bhunreacht a dhiúltaigh pobail na Fraince agus na hÍsiltíre dhá bliain ó shin.  Ba chóir go mbeimid ag meabhrú arís agus arís eile ar an "gcon-trick" siúd laistigh den Chomhairle Eorpach agus an gComisiún atá a tharraingt ar phobal na hÉireann agus ar phobal an Aontais Eorpaigh.Is trua gur in Éirinn amháin a mbeidh reifreann agus is léiriú é sin ar an eagla atá ag cinnirí na dtíortha eile san Aontas Eorpach roimh an dteist daonlathach.  Ba chóir go mbeadh sé seo curtha os comhair an phobail, gur féidir le pobail na tíortha eile ráiteas eigin a dhéanamh — go nglacfaidh siad leis, nó nach nglacfaidh.The Lisbon treaty is not in Ireland's interests.  It involves a massive transfer of power to the EU.  It significantly accelerates the militarisation of the EU and advances an economic agenda based on the race to the bottom for wages and workers' rights.  No amount of bluster from the Government benches will disguise the enormity of what is at stake when the people cast their votes next year in the referendum.Proponents of the Lisbon treaty are already relying on tired old tactics, scaremongering on how other EU states will react if we reject this undemocratic treaty.  They have failed so far to engage in serious debate.  The public squabbling between the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Mary Hanafin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, this week about water charges shows how little they understand about the consequences of the decisions taken at EU level.  It shows how little they understand about the consequences of previous treaties, to which they encouraged, or berated, as in the case of the Nice treaty, the public to sign up in the past.  It is not good enough for the Government to be yes-men and women and to allow other EU leaders to dictate what happens in this country.  That is what is happening with this treaty.I notice the Taoiseach has invited the German Chancellor and the President of the European Commission to give him a dig-out on the referendum.  I should like the Taoiseach to give a message to the Presidents, Prime Ministers and Chancellors who signed up to this treaty to the effect that if they want to be involved in referendums, they should organise one in their individual jurisdictions.  If not, they should let the Irish people get on with their debate and decide for themselves as a sovereign people.  The need for Ireland to have its place at the EU table is obvious.  Many benefits have come about from membership of the EU.  Sinn Féin has supported EU measures that are in Ireland's interests, such as agriculture, the environment and equality.  We welcome, as we did in the past, EU support for the peace process and for the development of infrastructure on this island.However, everything has not been good and the relationship has not always benefited the Irish people.  The debate during the past week illustrates this to some extent, with the obligation on schools to allocate scarce resources to the payment of water bills, and this is not good.  The sacking of Irish Ferries workers was not good, the inability of the Government to deal with the problem of Brazilian beef not good, neither was the shutting down of the Irish sugar beet industry.  The privatisation of Telecom Éireann and Aer Lingus was not good.  The proposal to liberalise the postal service is not good, the engagement of Irish troops in EU battle groups is not good and the proposed economic partnership agreements with developing countries are not good.  Fortunately, African leaders told their EU counterparts as much, during the recent EU-Africa summit.  The financial incentives to EU companies to relocate to low-wage low-cost economies outside the Common Market is not good, and is definitely of no use to the Irish economy for the future.Tá an liathróid in ár gcúirt san gcás seo agus má ligeann muidne don chonradh Lisbóin rith, beidh níos mó de na fadhbanna atá léirithe agam ag teacht amach anseo.  Tá na hathruithe is substaintiúla do na hinstitiúidí agus na bealaíreachtúla agus bealaí gnó den Aontas Eorpach laistigh de chonradh Lisbóin.  Tá an aistriú is mó do cumhachtaí na baill stáit ins an gComhairle Eorpach go dtí seo ann chomh maith, agus by chóir go mbeimid ag cur ina choinne dá réir.Despite claims of making the EU more democratic and more efficient, the Lisbon treaty will move political power further away from ordinary citizens, offering only cosmetic increases in powers to parliaments in member states and to the European Parliament.  One of the most dramatic consequences will be that the EU will become a single legal entity for the first time.  This means that it will be able to act in the international arena in the same way as a state.  It will be entitled to a seat at the United Nations, to incorporate existing international treaties and statutes into its law, to negotiate treaties and trade agreements directly with other states, to form a diplomatic corps, appoint a public prosecutor and, through the new posts of president of the EU and high representative for foreign affairs and security policy, to speak on the international stage on behalf of all 27 member states.As an Irish republican who supports neutrality and Ireland's long history of peacekeeping on the international stage, I fundamentally oppose such a move.  The State should not be dragged into the resource wars of the 21st century.  I do not see how a single entity, a high representative of foreign affairs and security policy, can represent imperialistic militaristic interests and the interests of a neutral State such as ours.  It cannot and will not.Ní féidir an dá thrá a fhreastal agus ar a laghad, léirigh Fine Gael go bhfuil siadsan sásta seasamh suas agus a léiriú go bhfuil siad ag fáil réidh leis an neodracht.  Níl an Rialtas seo sásta é sin a rá lom amach, agus ba chóir go mbeadh sé de misneach acu é sin a rá agus a thabhairt le fios don phobal nuair a mbíonn daoine ag caitheamh a gcuid vótaí.As I said, the Lisbon treaty involves a substantial transfer of powers from member states to the Union, but it is worth noting that not a single power has been returned to member states.  To make matters worse, the composition of the European Commission will change, removing member states' automatic entitlement to a seat at the Commission table and changing the procedures that will see their voting powers halved.  The Lisbon treaty gives 105 new competencies to the European Union and a further 58 areas which will move from consensus decision-making at the European Council to majority voting.  Among the areas where the EU will have control are immigration, Structural Funds, judicial and police co-operation, economic policy, guidelines for eurozone members and initiatives of the new Foreign Minister.  Major concerns are raised about the scale and range of this proposed transfer of power.In order to make a comparison, let us examine previous treaties.  The Treaty of Nice included a loss of veto in 46 areas, in the Amsterdam treaty it was 24 areas, the Maastricht treaty had 30 areas and the Single European Act had 12 areas.  The original Treaty of Rome, the EU's foundation treaty, only contained a transfer in 38 areas.  Possibly more significant and troubling than the large-scale transfer of powers is the inclusion of eight passerelle clauses in the Lisbon treaty.  These clauses represent one of the most undemocratic elements of the treaty and will allow for decision making in the council to be altered from unanimity to qualified majority voting in matters such as common foreign and security policy and judicial co-operation in criminal matters without recourse to parliaments and referenda.The referendum next year could be our last chance to vote on the direction of the European Union.  This is extremely worrying considering the European Commission does not hide its ambition to control matters relating to corporation tax and many other issues.  Powers contained in both the Nice and Lisbon treaties could assist it to do so and the weakening of our influence as a result of this treaty would make it even more difficult for any future Government to resist it, if it wished to do so.So far, the Government has failed miserably in any attempt to ensure Ireland's interests are best represented in Europe, as can be seen by the debacle of schools' water charges.  Perhaps President Barroso would like to campaign on the issues mentioned when he comes here to tell us we should vote in favour of the treaty.While parliaments in member states are to be given new powers, these are extremely limited and insignificant in comparison with the powers transferred to the European Council and Commission.  The European Parliament will not have the power to initiate legislation nor to amend it.  Instead what is proposed is what is deceptively called co-decision.  This is a cumbersome and lengthy procedure of bargaining between the European Parliament, the Commission and the Council and is unlikely to have any serious impact.The first way for parliaments and member states to intervene is through the yellow card procedure.  In this case, one third of parliaments in member states must reject the proposal to get the Commission to reconsider its position.  However, the Commission does not have to take this advice.  It can take whatever decision it wants.The second procedure is even more complicated and will require a majority of parliaments in the member states to object to a legislative proposal on the grounds that it contravenes the principle of subsidiarity.  This will only succeed if it also has the backing of the European Parliament and the European Council.In reality, these are cosmetic gestures which will have little or no impact on the development of the European Union and they have the potential to be a bureaucratic mess.  All of this copperfastens the dominance of the largest states and removes our ability to democratically reject laws which are not in our interest.Side by side with this in the treaty is the outworking of the EU's military ambition.  The desire of the EU leaders to be global players acting in concert with NATO is clearly set out in the treaty.  The treaty also requires member states to progressively improve military capabilities.  This will have a financial cost at a time when our public services are crying out for investment.  Do we really want our tax revenue to be compulsorily spent in such a manner?The erosion of neutrality and militarisation of foreign and defence policies is clear for all to see through the use of Shannon Airport by US troops on their way to occupy Iraq as well as through the ill-conceived French-inspired EU mission to prop up the regime of one of its clients in a former French colony.  The Government position is clear.  It did not even get an article in the treaty explicitly recognising the rights of neutral states.  Creidim go bhfuil an bhuairt céanna ar thromlach an phobail faoi na nithe atá luaite agam.  Creidim chomh maith nach bhfuil fios na gcúrsaí  ag na páirtithe a chreideann gur féidir leo an conradh seo a bhrú ar an ghnáth pobal.Irish beef farmers know only too well why their sector is under pressure.  The people in the west and south know it was the privatisation of Aer Lingus which caused the withdrawal of Shannon services.  Irish Ferry workers know why they lost their jobs.  This time the debate will not be about the past.  It will be about the impact of the EU on people's livelihoods, their mortgages and the safety of their children in an increasingly militarised world.  The people of this country need to do what is in the interest of the country.  I believe this will mean the rejection of the Lisbon treaty.

Has the Minister had an opportunity to assess the decision of the European Court of Justice on the Schengen regulation which was struck down?  This was with regard to a British position which was supported by Ireland.  What are its implications for the future formulation of policy on border controls and a common asylum policy?  Will Ireland be able to influence the outcome of an upcoming major decision of the Council on migration and asylum?  Have the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs received a legal opinion on the implications of this?Will the extra powers being devolved to domestic parliaments with regard to co-decision making mean they will have extra time for scrutiny and extra powers to seek to amend, refer back or reject Commission proposals?  Rejection by one third of parliaments under one procedure or 50% under another will be required.  While these powers are important in providing an extra democratic dimension to the domestic parliaments of member states, they do not seem to contain an in-built mechanism for implementation.  How will the member states relate to each other and communicate?  If Ireland is not happy with proposed legislation——

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	222	The judgment referred to was delivered only yesterday and it will take time to have it analysed.  Under the reform treaty, we have the capability of opting in and it is our desire to do so as often as possible.  From an initial analysis of the judgment, the reform treaty may well strengthen our position in terms of our ability to opt in.We would only be excluded at the behest of all the other member states and it would be highly unusual for states to gang up on Ireland or the United Kingdom.  While the judgment needs to be examined, the Government's initial view is that it is yet another reason to vote in favour of the reform treaty as it copperfastens our discretion on whether we participate.  We decided it was preferable to be able to opt in or out of measures as we saw fit due to the significant differences between the common law judicial system operating in criminal law in Ireland and the UK and the continental system which operates in most other member states.The Deputy is correct that national parliaments will have significant additional input as they must receive EU proposals at the same time as such proposals are circulated to member state governments.  This will provide them with an opportunity to have sight of proposals at a much earlier date than heretofore and will allow them to exert greater influence in terms of the type of opinions they will be able to give on specific proposals made by the European Commission.The yellow card procedure is an important new dimension in that it gives national parliaments a greater opportunity to offer strong views on proposals.  The democratic landscape has shifted dramatically.  The President of the European Parliament is on record as stating that the competence of national parliaments and the European Parliament, which was virtually nil when he was first elected many years ago, has significantly improved.  The reform treaty gives national parliaments much greater input in terms of giving their views on Commission proposals.

The Government will establish a referendum commission shortly after the legislation is published.  The Government approved the drafting of the legislation at yesterday's Cabinet meeting.  It has not yet been decided whether to hold the referendum on the same day as the referendum on the constitutional amendment on children.  The Taoiseach has repeatedly stated that he has an open mind on this issue.  Much will depend on the work of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.While a decision has not yet been made on the future of Kosovo, people see which way the wind is blowing.  The Government will be required to make a decision on recognition or non-recognition if Kosovo declares independence and is studying intently the legal basis upon which KFOR might continue.  Ireland is also involved in a new ESDP mission with Garda participation.  The Taoiseach and I have both indicated that we are willing, in principle, to continue to sustain Kosovo, which is a tinderbox.  In the months ahead and depending on what might take place at political level, it will be important that the international community maintains its presence.  We await a solid legal opinion from the Attorney General.  We have a number of weeks to obtain it.

Prior to that, he referred to the establishment of a reflection group which, it appears, will be akin to a rolling EU convention.  I would like to know more about the intentions and purpose of this group in light of the statement that the reform treaty will be the be all and end all of major institutional change at EU level.  What will be the composition and remit of the reflection group?  Apart from the individuals to whom the Taoiseach referred, who else will be involved in the group?The Taoiseach also referred to a Council decision on the Galileo project on satellite navigation.  What are the costs of the project and what will be Ireland's financial contribution to it?  What will the system involve?  I understood there were sufficient satellites, even if these are under the control of the United States and other countries.The Lisbon treaty states that all member states must improve their military capabilities.  Has an analysis been done on the additional costs this will entail for member states or the European Union as a whole?
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	227	I thank the Deputy for his questions.  The horizon of the reflection group is from 2020 to 2030.  It is not designed to examine the institutional framework of the European Union or the financial perspectives but to examine what type of challenges face the European Union as a whole.  These include issues such as sustainable development, climate change, energy security and how to address some of the transnational problems that will confront us in the years ahead.  This is the purpose of the reflection group.The Deputy referred to the Taoiseach's statement that there would be no further institutional change for the foreseeable future.  This view forms part of the conclusions of all member states which agreed that the reform treaty will, as its title suggests, reform the institutions in a manner that takes into account the increase in the number of member states to 27.  We have had this debate previously.  Some people argue that the European Union is not as cohesive as they would like.  This is primarily due to the need to strike a balance between member states' national interests and the interests of the Union as a whole.  The fact is that in Europe we have had the experience of having no wars on this continent for the longest period in history.  That is probably one of the strongest views as to why we should continue to be part of the EU and be a good member of it.The Deputy asked about the membership of the reflection group.  Three persons were chosen, one for the chair and two for the vice chair.  It was agreed that the rest of the membership will be decided in conjunction with the member states in the second half of the year.  There is no rush on this — it is to report to Council in July 2010.  As the horizon is from 2020 to 2030, there is plenty of time for them to start the deliberations.  It is a good exercise but it will not change anything we do dramatically.  One of its functions is to look at the key challenges that affect us on a cross-border basis.In regard to military capabilities, I heard what the Deputy said in regard to Chad.  While some of us would have somewhat similar views on the issue of colonisation, the fact is we are where we are.  It is incumbent on us as a developed nation to be part of an international effort to help those people survive.  Having visited Chad over one month ago, where I saw the sheer difficulties under which people live because of war, which is not of their making, it is important for us, on a humanitarian basis, to protect them.  We should be part of an international effort to make it possible for those people to survive.Having spent a number of years at the EU table, it is vitally important, whether it is a natural or a man made disaster, that we as a group respond and respond well.  That is why Ireland, thankfully, is leading the position on Chad.  In regard to cost, I do not have the figures available but I suggest the Deputy tables a question to the line Minister on that issue.  He will be able to provide some information in regard to other member states also, based on their discussions at EU level.

Was there any discussion among the Heads of States as to whether it would be desirable to have any incursion from Heads of States or parliamentary groupings or whatever into Ireland in the course of the referendum?  The Taoiseach is reported to have invited Angela Merkel and, perhaps, Nicolas Sarkozy.  Can the Minister give us some flavour of the views on whether Ireland is likely to become a conflict arena on this referendum or whether we will be left to our own devices to make our own decision?The two critical areas are Kosovo and Chad in relation to external affairs.  I am inclined to agree with Deputy Timmins that Kosovo could quickly move towards independence and that the EU would be seen to support that on the basis of the decision it took at the Council meeting.  That will give rise to a straightforward conflict with Serbia and Russia and we must consider the broader implications.  In regard to Chad, may we have some clarification as to whether the mission is going ahead in January?  It would appear the logistical problems have been resolved, but that they could only be resolved by going outside the EU.  It seems the EU does not have the logistical ability to conduct missions on which it makes decisions.  Did the EU discuss that matter or did the Heads of State discuss it in terms of their ability to carry out missions on which it makes decisions?  I am in favour of the Chad mission.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank the Deputy.  In regard to the referendum — Deputy Ó Snodaigh said there should be an EU wide referendum — to be honest, my party and the Government would be very much against a Europe wide referendum because, in effect, that would mean that a small country like Ireland might have one view and the wider view would prevail.  In effect, it would be detrimental to the interests of small nations.Deputy Costello asked about EU leaders coming to Ireland.  Obviously a number of them are conscious of the fact that this is the only country holding a referendum.  Many expressed surprise as to why we are having a referendum on the basis that Denmark made a decision which, in its parliament, got unanimous agreement even from some people who would normally be anti-EU agreements.  There was not in any shape or form a substantial transfer of sovereignty to the EU and, therefore, they did not require a referendum.  We had to explain to them the constitutional and legal constraints in regard to the necessity to have a referendum.  It has been the strong view of the Government, of which I have been a member for a number of years, that any time we did have an issue like this we should always err on the side of caution and put it to the people.  The Attorney General has already confirmed that there is a necessity for a referendum, based on the Crotty decision.The Taoiseach invited Angela Merkel to come to Ireland.  It is her turn to come to Ireland and she has expressed a desire to come.  I believe it will be a bilateral meeting as it has more to do with our relationship on that basis with Germany, but her views on the treaty may well be part of that if she comes before the referendum takes place.In regard to Kosovo, we are coming close to the end game.  The Troika which held meetings for approximately 120 days could not square two diametrically opposed views between Serbia and Kosovo.  I was in Kosovo four or five weeks ago.  The Kosovars are firmly of the view that they will get independence in some shape or form.  We have to deal with the reality of that and manage it as best we can in order to protect the citizens and ensure there is no conflagration, as there was not too long ago, but also on the basis of handing out to a country such as Serbia and Bosnia-Herzgovinia, and a number of others countries in that region because this is a regional problem, the prospect of entry into the EU in the long term.  In other words, this has to be dealt with under the umbrella of the European perspective and that is the only way this issue will be sorted.

It raises fundamental questions about the Competition Act, which will have to be revisited.One issue to which the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, referred yesterday was the fact the Competition Authority took a view that self-employed actors and freelance journalists were undertakings within the meaning of the Competition Act.  I understand this decision was more or less forced on SIPTU under the threat that its offices would be visited by the Competition Authority and that SIPTU is not in agreement with this definition.  I understand several rulings of the Labour Court upheld this decision.  The Minister of State responsible for this area should clarify what the Minister of State said yesterday.As one involved in some documentary-making, I can understand the relevance of having set charges.  When one is calculating the budget for a documentary, the exact costs would be known rather than one having to negotiate separately with individuals.  I can see merit in a consideration of this part of the Competition Act.In the short time available to me, I wish to refer to the problem faced by pharmacists throughout the length and breadth of the country.  From discussions I have had with a number of pharmacists in my constituency, it is definite that pharmacies will close if the HSE position is not changed.  Pharmacists are quite open about revealing their account books and showing that if matters change to their disadvantage, staff will lose their jobs, pharmacies will close and pharmacists will seek employment in bigger pharmacy units.  It is important that this matter is resolved.As pointed out yesterday, the union is prepared to go to the table without any preconditions or predetermined outcomes, and it hopes that the HSE would do likewise.  I call on the HSE to agree to this.  The union has proposed that talks on a new pharmacy contract under an independent chairperson should commence immediately.  The purpose of these talks would be to reach agreement on all aspects of the contract, including an appropriate pricing structure for the delivery of pharmacy services.  This had previously been agreed with the HSE at a meeting in November.When agreement is reached on an appropriate pricing structure, the matter could then be referred to the proposed new arbitration system, which the Minister for Health and Children referred to in the Dáil on 21 November.  It is hoped that such a body or system will provide an independent and fair assessment of all the issues involved and could then make recommendations to the HSE on pharmacists' remuneration.There is no indication that the HSE is prepared to proceed on this basis.  This affects not only the pharmacists in question, but also those who depend on pharmacists for vital services.  If the medical card scheme becomes unviable, what will happen to all those dependent on medicines dispensed by pharmacists?The amount of money pharmacists are getting is minuscule when compared to the overall health budget, but their role is vital given that many pharmacists operate in place of a doctor, and a good pharmacist can be very much part of primary health care.  If we lose this expertise in many parts of rural and urban Ireland, where there is a great dependency on medical cards, the whole system will be affected.This matter must be resolved as soon as possible.  The union has been more than accommodating in the effort to find a solution.

I congratulate Deputy Higgins and the Labour Party on bringing forward this Private Members' Bill.  We may not vote for it due to our legal opinion, but we will not vote against it.  Our key point is that the Bill is timely, particularly with regard to pharmacists.The Government and the HSE are completely out of touch.  If I was to point to a system where there is no waiting list and no distinction between public and private, one would think it was a great system.  That is the system pharmacists are providing.  The HSE gave a commitment in November that it would enter into an independent process but it has reneged on this in a very underhand way.  It came out publicly to state it would agree to an independent system but that it wanted the pharmacists to agree to a pricing structure before they entered an independent process.  It is a joke.  The problem is that there is no commitment from the HSE or the Government to resolve this issue.The Health Act 1970 was introduced to replace a system, whereby those on medical cards were dealt with by doctors who dispensed medicines.  That system was replaced so that dispensing was carried out by pharmacists, who have provided a very good system to date, but it appears the HSE is intent on dismantling this system.Many are not aware that pharmacists make a 17% gross profit through the general medical scheme, GMS, which is not a phenomenal return.  Furthermore, the areas that will be affected will be those where the GMS forms a large part of the pharmacist's business, such as vulnerable rural areas and urban areas of high population.  This will force the closure of family-run, community pharmacies.  While the big multiples will come into the market, pharmacies in local towns will no longer exist.The Government must honour its commitment and bring forward an independent chairperson who will sit down with the HSE and the IPU to devise a system for a pricing structure.  This should then go to an independent arbitration body which will recommend a pricing structure to the HSE.I find one point amazing.  The HSE and the Government propose to enter into contracts with individual pharmacies, which will create a chaotic system at the least.  The IPU has done a good job up to this, as has the IMO with regard to the GMS, which was an efficient system.Competition law was brought forward to allow the consumer to have choice.

On a practical level, why would the HSE, with the Minister's approval, enter into negotiations that will create a bureaucratic nightmare and make the HSE worse than it already is?  The delivery of service on the ground will be a disaster and pharmacies will be destroyed.Many young pharmacists have set up or bought into pharmacies, and have borrowed to the hilt to do so.  There are many family-run pharmacies which provide a fantastic services for communities.  As a matter of urgency, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, must force the HSE, particularly Professor Brendan Drumm, to honour his commitment to set up this independent process and sit down with the IPU.  The IPU will consider introducing cost reductions but the Government needs to move.  We do not want a situation where it abdicates its responsibilities to patients on the ground and pharmacists nationally.

I listened carefully to his contribution last night which was delivered with the usual passion and commitment that we have grown used to hearing from him.  In the context of the Government's response and having examined what the Bill entails, it is complex in terms of an overall solution.  The question is whether there is a resolve to address all the issues concerned, particularly as regards section 4.  Deputy Higgins referred to social partnership.  All parties involved must come to the table, which brings me to his point about the commitment given by the Taoiseach in March 2006.  It was given in good faith.  The action that should have followed would have drawn the various parties together, including the Department concerned, to examine the issues and determine a solution in the context of our legislation and EU law.  I am aware that there is an ongoing review of the 2002 Act, which should be at the centre in examining the issues raised.  Deputies are demanding action, which should be taken as quickly as possible in consultation with all the stakeholders involved.Other speakers have, rightly, focused on pharmacies.  Section 4 was never intended to drive anyone in the opposite direction, to seek legal advice which is often one step beyond common sense.  A common-sense approach such as that outlined by Deputy O'Donnell should be pursued by the HSE.

Nobody should be excluded because we are all stakeholders in finding a solution.  We are all aware of the serious investment made by pharmacies as regards business transacted and the valuable service delivered to local communities.  In addition, there has been ongoing development of pharmacies, as there is a need to continue to invest heavily in them.  We must also acknowledge that over 300 pharmacies have been created and extra staff have been employed because of competition in the sector.  In that way, people get good value for money from such outlets.  While remembering all this, the HSE, as the authority which will engage with pharmacies, needs, with the Government, to bring about the required solution.

The uncertainty and doubt should be taken out of the equation.  Whatever pressure can be brought to bear by way of this debate which was facilitated by bringing the Bill before the House, if applied properly, will encourage the HSE to see that there is almost cross-political support for some form of initiative to create the vehicle to deliver a solution to the problem.  In that context, many people who have their prescriptions filled at pharmacies are being encouraged to raise the issue because there is doubt about the overall problem.

Equity is a different issue but we must understand the complexities and try to focus on the intent of the Bill because activity does not replace action which is required.I do not subscribe to the remark made to the effect that what Deputy Higgins was proposing was outside the law.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I endorse the comments of the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness.  In the debate on competition law nobody envisaged that the law would be applied in this manner.  That is why it is so important to review the Competition Act.  To this end the Select Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has adopted that goal as probably the major element of its work programme for 2008, given the detailed work that will have to be considered.  When something like this occurs that has not been envisaged, it shows the complexity of legislative matters.  Competition law generally is changing so much because we must manage the interests of competition, while protecting consumer rights.  I look forward to considering these matters in the context of the forthcoming review.I join previous speakers in commenting on the Pharmacies Act.  I remember the morning when Professor Drumm appeared with 20 HSE advisers.  He had a very cool and calm persona the whole way through, in spite of everything that was thrown at him.  He remained confident but when Deputy Higgins and I inquired about the IPU, that cool and calm persona disappeared.  The flashes of anger apparent that day were extraordinary in the light of other issues ongoing at the time concerning cancer services.  The attitude of the HSE has been incredibly frustrating, particularly with regard to its management of the IPU-pharmacy issue.  It has consistently provided us with misleading information on the make-up of the GMS scheme and the impact of changes to it, particularly with regard to community and rural pharmacists.  We were led to believe the GMS scheme would account for 40% of the average pharmacy's turnover when, in fact, for many in rural and disadvantaged areas, it accounts for a minimum of 80% to 85%.As regards this specific issue, we were advised by the HSE that the illegal issue had arisen in the context of a legal opinion sought by one of the wholesalers.  Some five weeks ago I asked the HSE's parliamentary affairs division what companies had sought that information and what wholesalers had provided it, but I have yet to receive a response.  Even the HSE's update that Members received last week was incendiary in terms of its tone and content.  It was not the kind of letter someone who was serious about negotiation would have publicly distributed.  I very much regret that it was done.I understand there are proposals, according to which the HSE intends to remove wholesalers from the chain and encourage pharmacists to deal directly with manufacturers.  That is a bizarre system because in most retail systems a wholesaler is involved.  Unless we are going to adopt a Dell or Ryanair approach to medicine, that is not the way to go.  Wholesalers are providing an excellent service which is particularly suited to community and rural pharmacies.  To remove them from the equation would reduce the level of service available to pharmacies and patients.I endorse the remarks made by the Minister of State.  It is ironic that competition law has been mentioned in the discussion on pharmacies, but it is good that we have finally been able to raise the issue in the Chamber.  It has been well debated at the Joint Committee on Health and Children, at our own parliamentary party meetings and within other political parties.The Shipsey process should be allowed to grow.  I ask the Minister of State to encourage the HSE to give that process time to grow.  The IPU is willing to engage with it.  Earlier the HSE lawyers agreed a programme under the Shipsey process but when they went back, HSE management completely disowned the agreement reached by its own lawyers.  That does not instil much confidence in the HSE's approach.  I call on the HSE to approach the negotiations with a new willingness to try to reach a deal.  Everybody agrees that we need to review and reform the pharmacy, GMS and drug payments schemes.  Pharmacists, the HSE and Members of the House agreed that was so but the manner in which it is being done is akin to taking a sledgehammer to a nut.  We cannot allow that to happen, given that pharmacists form such an important part of the health service.  I hope that in the coming days before Christmas the HSE will respond to the latest initiative from the IPU in the spirit intended — it was communicated to us yesterday — otherwise the issue will be back before the House with more amendments and debates, while patients suffer.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I generally agree with Deputy Calleary's comments on pharmacists and I take issue with the HSE's approach to negotiations in that regard.  I encourage the executive's representatives to use the Shipsey process to best advantage.  However, the Bill is not entirely relevant to that process.  As Deputy Calleary said in another context, the Bill is like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut.  It is a naive attempt to apply the hard fought for rights and privileges of trade unions to associations of self-employed professionals.  It is an extraordinary stance for the Labour Party to take but it is not unprecedented.  Its stance on the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act last July would have had a similar effect and it resulted from similar professional lobbying.A professional body is capable of being an association of undertakings within the meaning of Article 81 and section 4 of the Competition Act.  As such, the rules and decisions of professional bodies are subject to competition law.  A trade union of workers is not capable of being an association of undertakings.  However, professional bodies are also aware that not every agreement they enter into or decision or concerted practice necessarily infringes competition law, which has never applied to workers.  Workers do not come within the definition of "undertakings and competition policies" and, therefore, trade unions can never be described as "associations of undertakings".  Does the Labour Party believe self-employed solicitors or pharmacists, who may be significant employers themselves, should be given the same rights and privileges as trade unions?  The party was not established for this and I do not believe in it.Section 2 would allow any group of professionals, including solicitors — I am one myself — to fix prices between themselves, restrict supplies and do anything they wish, which ultimately would be anti-consumer.  It is an extraordinary provision to propose in legislation when we are trying all the time to reduce professional costs to consumers, reduce inflation and make Ireland a competitive country.  The section is of no benefit to trade unions and would give professional employers an advantage over their employees who are often also their customers.Section 3 is also extraordinary.  It proposes to bring the Members of the Dáil into the process of negotiating with professional bodies when the State enters into contracts.  This is unreal and, as legislators, we should have no direct role in this area.  It would not achieve best value for taxpayers.  I do not agree with the HSE's approach to its negotiations with the pharmacists nor do I agree with the Competition Authority's heavy handed approach to the IPU, which is a complete waste of resources.  The authority's staff should pursue genuine cartels and price fixing, which, unfortunately, exist throughout society, despite the best efforts of the Government and the authority.  However, that does not mean trade union protections should automatically be given to employers or self-employed professionals.  Best value for money must be achieved on behalf of the taxpayer and, therefore, permitting professionals to band together on price would not achieve this end.  However, I agree there are anomalies, which can be dealt with in the near future on the completion of the review of the Competition Act.  I include non-PAYE contract workers such as some, but not all, actors and journalists in that regard.

We often disagree on various issues but some of his comments made sense.  I also read the European case law to which Deputy Michael D. Higgins referred in his contribution on the Internet earlier and I cannot for the life of me see its relevance to competition policy, competition law and its implications for self-employed professionals.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate and I apologise for my inability to attend yesterday evening.As the House will be aware, the main objective of competition policy is to prevent and remove distortions of competition resulting from the actions of companies or public authorities, thus enabling markets to function effectively.  A regulatory framework that upholds effective competition increases the competitiveness of industry and induces firms to innovate and enhance their efficiency and thus enables them to compete more efficiently in home and international markets.  Competition reduces price differentials and avoids waste of resources.  A dynamic business environment that ensures competition sets incentives to innovate and foster productivity growth.  Effective competition in "home markets" also prepares companies to compete internationally.  A competitive economy not only ensures the optimal functioning of the European market and the growth and competitiveness of European industry, it also creates benefits for consumers and society as a whole.  Consumer welfare is at the heart of competition policy.The Bill arises from an investigation conducted by the Competition Authority between March 2003 and June 2004 regarding possible price fixing among self-employed actors and advertising agencies.  In this case, the authority found that an agreement between Irish Actors Equity SIPTU, on behalf of the actors, and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland, on behalf of advertising agencies, was in breach of competition law in that it provided for both specific fees for services rendered and various other terms and conditions.  In August 2004, the authority published its decision and the acknowledgement and undertakings made to it by both Irish Actors Equity SIPTU and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland in which both parties agreed not to fix fees and to comply with the provisions of the Competition Act 2002.The authority's investigation centred on section 4 of the Competition Act, which prohibits anti-competitive agreements, decisions and concerted practices.  Section 4 applies when "undertakings" are engaged in arrangements which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State.  Section 4(1) states:Subject to the provisions of this section, all agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings and concerted practices which have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition in trade in any goods or services in the State are prohibited and void, including in particular, without prejudice to the generality of this subsection, those which (a) directly or indirectly fix purchase or selling prices or any other trading conditions . . .Section 3 of the Act defines an "undertaking" as "a person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service".  This definition has been in use in Irish competition law for some time and is supported by EU case law.  To establish a breach of section 4, the authority must demonstrate that there is an agreement, decision or concerted practice; that the parties to that agreement, decision or concerted practice are undertakings; and that the object or effect of the agreement, decision or concerted practice is to prevent, restrict or distort competition.In this case, the parties did not dispute the existence of an agreement.  The agreement was contained in a document entitled 2002 Agreement on Minimum Fees Effective from 1 October 2002.  The institute did not contest that it was an association of undertakings and that its members were undertakings in their own right.  The issue the Competition Authority then considered was whether actors were "undertakings" and whether Irish Actors Equity was an "association of undertakings" for the purposes of the Act.  It was a question of whether the actors in question were self-employed independent contractors, who are subject to the Act, or employees, who are generally not subject to the Act.  The authority considered this issue to be particularly important in this case where the trade union has both employed persons and self-employed independent contractors as members.  The authority stated in its decision that, while it was perfectly legal for a trade union to represent employees in collective bargaining with their employers, its trade union mantle could not exempt its conduct when it acts as a trade association for self-employed independent contractors.The authority also stated that if one were to take an inflexible approach and find that all trade union members were exempt from the Act, the protections afforded to consumers by the Oireachtas in enacting the Competition Act could easily be bypassed in that associations of independent pharmacists, publicans and barristers, to name but a few, could obtain sanctuary for their members by adding "union" to their name and obtaining a negotiating licence.  It is important to understand that the authority carefully considered a number of factors before reaching its decision.On the question of whether actors are "undertakings" within the meaning of the Competition Act, as a starting point, the Competition Authority considered whether the Revenue Commissioners treated actors as employees subject to PAYE or as independent contractors.  The authority's investigation revealed that the vast majority of actors in the State are not treated as PAYE employees.  It also considered other factors, such as the following: actors providing advertising services generally are not obliged to work for a single advertising agency, as they may work for several at the same time; such actors generally do not receive the benefits one usually associates with a contract for labour.  For example, they generally do not receive holiday pay, health insurance, maternity leave etc.; such actors do not generally have employment security; such actors are free to accept or decline specific work as they see fit; and actors generally are not thought of as employees of a particular agency.In light of these factors the Competition Authority took the view that actors are independent contractors and, therefore, are "undertakings" subject to the Competition Act.  However, the authority acknowledged that there may be some actors who have genuine contracts of service and who are therefore employees, as is the case with some musicians.  However, its investigation revealed that the vast majority of actors providing advertising services under the agreement that it examined were independent contractors and, therefore, undertakings.  Having found the actors to be undertakings, it followed that Irish Actors Equity in this case was an association of undertakings and subject to the Competition Act.The Competition Authority may enforce competition law by seeking appropriate civil remedy in the High Court or by recommending the prosecution of a criminal action by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Generally, the authority pursues a criminal prosecution only where there is clear evidence that parties are in breach of the more serious hard-core provisions of the Act.Although the authority's investigation revealed an element of price-fixing, it elected, in this instance, to pursue civil relief.  However, prior to the commencement of proceedings, the parties expressed their willingness to address the authority's competition concerns and signed undertakings.  As I said earlier, these undertakings are appended to the authority's decision, which is published on its website.  The authority also acknowledges the right of Irish Actors Equity to represent employed actors in collective bargaining with employers.  It is clear that the Competition Authority carefully considered many factors in arriving at its decision in this case.  In exercising its statutory functions, which this House bestowed on it, the authority did not lightly arrive at its decision.The explanatory memorandum accompanying the Bill states that if the Competition Act 2002 applied with full force and effect to trade unions and their members, then trade unions would revert to their old common law status as unlawful "combinations" and trade union leaders would be prosecuted as parties to a criminal conspiracy.I would like to refer to the laws governing freedom of association and trade union regulation.  The law relating to trade unions falls into two distinct phases — statutes enacted mainly between 1871 and 1906 in order to secure trade union freedom and remove trade unions and their activities from the operation of the law; and statutes enacted since 1940 which sought to introduce a measure of public regulation of trade unions.  Also, the Constitution of Ireland, which came into force in 1937, has had an important impact on industrial relations law and practice.  A significant body of case law has developed in regard to the freedom of association guaranteed in the Constitution, as it applies to the activities of trade unions.  The principal statutes governing the activities of trade unions in Ireland are the Trade Union Act 1871, the Conspiracy and Protection of Property Act 1875, the Trade Union Acts 1941, 1971, and 1975 and the Industrial Relations Acts 1990 to 2004.Trade unions in Ireland derive their legal status largely from the Trade Union Act 1871, which provided a measure of protection for bona fide union activities and removed the taint of illegality from them.  The 1871 Act also introduced a system of voluntary registration for trade unions.  Unions could register with the Registrar of Friendly Societies but in order to do so they were required to have written rules setting out their objectives, benefits and so on.  Registration confers certain powers and advantages on unions, which are not enjoyed by unregistered unions.The relevant provision in the Irish Constitution in regard to freedom of association is Article 40.6.1°, which guarantees liberty for the exercise, subject to public order and morality, of "the right of citizens to form associations and unions".  However, laws may be enacted for the regulation and control in the public interest of the exercise of that right.  Article 40.6.2° provides that laws regulating the manner in which the right of forming associations and unions may be exercised shall contain no political, religious or class discrimination.The constitutional guarantee of the freedom of association has been considered in a number of precedent-setting legal cases, which have had an important bearing on the conduct of industrial relations in Ireland.  The courts have established the principle that a freedom or right to associate necessarily implied a correlative right not to join any trade union or a particular trade union.Trade union legislation enacted since 1940, in contrast to earlier legislation, sought to introduce some regulation of trade unions by the State, principally in the form of a system of licensing of unions.  The negotiation licence requirement sought to introduce some degree of regulation into a situation, where there was a large number of unions, many of them small, a considerable degree of union rivalry, which resulted in difficult inter-union disputes, and a tendency for disaffected groups of members to form breakaway unions.  These measures, which were fully supported by the wider trade union movement, were designed to facilitate effective and stable trade union structures and promote more orderly industrial relations.The Trade Union Act 1941 made it obligatory for any body of persons wishing to engage in collective bargaining to hold a negotiation licence.  Various conditions apply to the holding of such a licence.  Once a trade union satisfies all the conditions, the Minister of the day will grant it a negotiation licence.The legalisation of the activities of trade unions by the Trade Disputes Act 1906 gave trade unions general immunity from action in tort against them.  Under the Irish common law of tort, employers would otherwise have a right to sue trade unions for loss or damages arising from trade union activities.  For persons acting, in the words of the Act, "in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute" it gave immunity from liability for the torts of conspiracy to injure, inducement of the breach of a contract of employment and interference with the trade, business or employment of another.  It also legalised peaceful picketing in industrial dispute situations.  The Act did not confer a positive right to strike or to organise industrial action; it merely immunised against civil liability.  Later the Trade Union Act 1941 restricted most of the immunities to trade unions holding negotiation licences and the members and officials of those unions.  The 1906 Act was repealed by the Industrial Relations Act 1990, but its main provisions were re-enacted.The Trade Union Act 1941 sets out restrictions for the carrying on of negotiations for the fixing of wages and so forth.  The proposed Competition (Amendment) Bill 2007 would exempt members of the first type of body, both employed and self-employed, from the requirements of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 in regard to collective bargaining, but would not exempt members of the second type of body.  In that Act there are two types of bodies which can carry on negotiations on the fixing of wages or other conditions of employment.I agree with the Deputy that collective bargaining by trade unions on behalf of their members is actively encouraged as a bedrock of social partnership.  Bargaining can take place, for example, at individual level between an individual worker and his or her employer or at collective level between a group of workers and their employer or between an employer or employers' association and one or more trade unions.  Under this process, standard matters such as wages or hours of work are determined and, in addition, some collective agreements lay down procedural rules that govern the conduct of industrial relations.  Thus, voluntary bargaining and not the law has been the primary driver of regulation in the employment relationship in Ireland.  My concerns regarding the provisions of the Bill also encompass certain reservations regarding the approach to extending or granting protections to the self-employed through the device of what is commonly understood as providing immunities to trade unions in the carrying out of their collective bargaining functions.A major degree of institutional and trade union reform and protections were included in the Industrial Relations Act 1990.  Since then more than 20 new and amended legislative provisions have been enacted and they have widened the scope of employment protection both collectively and individually.  These have resulted from initiatives from various Governments, the updating of Irish law, the transposition of European directives and the delivery of various commitments in the respective social partnership agreements.It would not be appropriate, in my view, to single out a specific individual or group of self-employed professionals, through the mechanism of an amendment to the Competition Act 2002, to legislate for their particular employment status or bargaining position.  I am not unsympathetic to the problem identified arising from the decision of the Competition Authority but this issue requires further detailed analysis and assessment on a much broader basis than the position set out in the context of this debate.During the Dáil debate on the Consumer Protection Act earlier this year, Deputies may recall that I indicated my intention to review the operation of the 2002 Competition Act and that I would bring forward proposals for legislative change where it is warranted.  In October, I announced a public consultation on the operation and implementation of the Competition Act 2002.  In addition to publishing newspaper advertisements requesting comments, observations and submissions from any interested parties, we also wrote directly to a number of experienced competition law practitioners as well as to business representative groups and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions requesting their input into the review process.  The end of year has been set as the deadline for receipt of all submissions.I ask the House and, in particular, Deputies Higgins and Stagg to allow the proposals contained in the Bill, including their wider European Union implications, to be examined in the context of this overall review.  That is the context in which we would favour consideration of the issues raised in this debate.  To separate, select, identify or specify one category of the self-employed, albeit combined within a particular union, is not the best way to deal with the issues that have arisen.  They are complex and connected to the relevant EU directive, which governs the overall legislation we enact in the Oireachtas.

I congratulate my colleague, Deputy Higgins, on introducing this Bill.  It is important to note that the European Court of Justice, with regard to the Viking case this week, reaffirmed that a fundamental right of association takes precedence over other rights, such as trade and competition law rights.  This is an important development that was not available when Deputy Higgins drafted this Bill but which informs the conclusions I heard the Minister reaching with regard to his promised review.The pharmacy dispute is inexplicable to many ordinary people.  It appears bewildering to them that incredibly well paid hospital consultants and general practitioners are able to negotiate collectively with the HSE but the pharmacies cannot do so.  The pharmacies deliver a community based service.  People can call to the pharmacy, discuss with the pharmacist how their medication is working and get general medical advice with their prescription.  Pharmacies are regarded as a vital element in community health services.The HSE in this dispute appears to be hiding behind a very willing Competition Authority, which, since its creation, has poked its nose unsuccessfully into a large number of areas.  However, none of the initiatives it has taken, ranging from stopping the Irish Kennel Club taking certain actions with regard to pedigree dogs to the Irish League of Credit Unions, where it sought more competition among credit unions, has led to lower prices and better services and value for consumers.

The Competition Authority was a special creation of the Progressive Democrats.  The Progressive Democrats are gone but the Competition Authority is not.  Everybody wants governments to take strong action against powerful businesses which abuse their position of prominence and dominance to charge higher prices and give bad services to consumers.  There are many such examples in this country, including the banks, insurance providers, cement suppliers, the construction industry and the owners and developers of lands for development.  All of them have managed in recent decades to charge consumers significant prices for services provided, but in none of their cases has the Competition Authority sent them so much as a Christmas card.  Instead, organisations such as the IPU, as well as the breeders of pedigree dogs, are raided by the Competition Authority.  I am glad the Minister will review this outfit.

We heard some on this side of the House speak last night, while some of the Minister's colleagues spoke earlier.  The point is that in Ireland the pharmacy provides a valuable service.  There is a legal problem and this Bill seeks to remedy it.  A number of Ministers have said that the Labour Party Bill is not perfect.  So be it, but they have the resources to correct the Bill's imperfections.  Deputy Higgins is willing to have the Government accept the Bill and use its resources to work on and correct its defects.The Health Service Executive is, in effect, eroding the traditional independent pharmacy in this country.  I suspect the HSE would be happier dealing with a single pharmaceutical network of companies, many of which in turn would own the pharmacies.  That would be the end of the independent pharmacy sector.  Deputy Higgins spoke about the impact on Actors Equity.  The pharmacy sector is an important adjunct in people's everyday lives as a place they can go for medical advice.This Bill is timely.  The comments of the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, are somewhat conciliatory and, in the context of the European judgment reaffirming the right to free association as a fundamental right, I hope they and the Government will reconsider their approach to the Bill.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	266	I compliment my colleague, Deputy Higgins, on bringing forward this Bill.  It is brought forward, first, because section 4 in the Act is over-restrictive in its interpretation and, second, to facilitate negotiations to address the dispute between the pharmacists and the HSE.  We have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the Chamber and I have done so as the party's spokesperson on health.  It has also been discussed in the health committee.Despite various attempts to have the issue addressed, significant progress has not been made.  We welcomed the fact that extra time was given to address the issues.  The new regime was to be implemented on 1 December so there has been some success in having the decision postponed.  Essentially, however, the HSE is trying to push through its view on what the prices of medicines should be, without any negotiation.  The IPU said it was prepared to go to the negotiating table without any preconditions or predetermined outcomes.  Anybody would consider that a reasonable approach, yet it is not accepted by the HSE.  Indeed, the HSE is not even accepting the advice of its financial advisers, Indecon, which said that the timing of significant changes is crucial and that the changes and the impact of the changes should be evaluated in advance in connection with key stakeholders.  That advice clearly was not taken.  There is now an attempt to bully a group of people into a take it or leave it deal which has serious implications for their livelihoods.  Nobody would expect a group of people to accept that.Last night the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, said the Labour Party was, in effect, championing price fixing, which is a serious crime carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years.  I welcome the fact that other Ministers have been a little more conciliatory.  If this is a case of price fixing, the HSE is doing it.  The HSE wants to fix prices without negotiations and the Competition Authority does not appear to have a problem with that.  However, it raided the offices of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and removed its computer server for a few days.  It is absolutely disgraceful that the Competition Authority should act in this manner.Somebody should tell us who complained to the Competition Authority about the IPU.  Who decided that the Competition Authority should raid the IPU in this way?  It is beyond belief that it should raid the Irish Pharmaceutical Union on this issue, particularly as the HSE is, in effect, trying to fix the prices.  It is ludicrous and in no way fulfils the objectives of the Competition Act.  For that reason, this Bill should be accepted and, by all means, modified.  This interpretation of the Competition Act is unacceptable.The Minister of State made his accusation last night but the Taoiseach cannot stand over the attitude of his Government and the HSE in this regard.  The Taoiseach has a great reputation for sorting out disputes such as this and for having a conciliatory approach in fixing them.  However, the Government appears to be standing back on this issue.  Many Government Deputies spoke about what the HSE has done but the Government established the HSE and its actions are taking place in a context where the Government is simply standing by and watching what is happening.  In that sense, there is an onus on the Government to address this issue and ensure a breakthrough is achieved in the negotiations.All the Irish Pharmaceutical Union wants is a fair process through which it can negotiate on behalf of its members.  If the Competition Act is an impediment to that, the Bill before us is a way to remove the obstacles and we present the legislation in that spirit.  However, in the broader context of resolving the dispute, it is essential that a mechanism be found to resolve the differences between the HSE and the pharmacists.  The latter have a fair case and, in some instances, do not make any profits whatsoever from dispensing to medical card holders.  In that respect, the IPU has a right to negotiate on behalf of its members.  If a mechanism is not found to address this issue, the most vulnerable patients will suffer because they are dependent on pharmacists for filling their prescriptions and addressing their needs under the drugs repayment, medical card and methadone schemes.  On this, the last day before the Dáil's Christmas recess, we ask that a mechanism be found to resolve the dispute before it affects patients.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	267	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, which addresses the fundamental right to collective representation and, in particular, the anomaly which currently exists for pharmacists in their attempted negotiations with the HSE.  I deliberately say "attempted" because the IPU is clearly making every effort to negotiate with the HSE but the latter has dug in and is refusing to talk.  The president of the MPSI has been referred to by almost every speaker.  All sides of the House would agree with his statement that the union is prepared to go the table without any preconditions or predetermined outcomes.  That is the fairest observation possible and the HSE should at the very least consider that reasonable and fair approach.The proposed amendment to the Competition Act will serve to ensure the legislation cannot be used to undermine the right to collective representation of atypical workers.  It is ironic that pharmacists are permitted to be members of a trade union which, in effect, is not allowed to negotiate collectively on their behalf.  That is at the heart of this debate.  Other European countries have found a way around the impasse, so it is not impossible to negotiate.  We could follow the example of our European neighbours by amending competition law to allow recognition of pharmaceutical bodies as unions rather than associations of undertakings for the purpose of negotiating a collective agreement with the Government.  Despite what the HSE and some on the Government benches have claimed, Irish competition law rather than European law needs to be amended.  Other EU countries, including France and the Netherlands, have amended their competition laws to allow representative bodies negotiate with full union rights.  If they can do so within the European Union, surely we can also address the issue.The uncertainty regarding payments by the HSE to the pharmacy sector has caused significant disruption to the customers who rely on pharmacists for the delivery of services beyond simply filling prescriptions.  The unilateral decision by the HSE to impose new cost saving procedures was short-sighted.  The one issue community pharmacists raise repeatedly is the disdain with which they have been treated by the HSE, which chose to seek a headline about €100 million savings on the drugs payment scheme instead of taking hard decisions by negotiating and seeking compromises.  The outcome for pharmacists of the pathway proposed by the HSE in a heavy handed and one-sided way will be uncertainty and threatened incomes.  The knock-on effect is the fear that has been generated among vulnerable individuals who depend on medical cards or methadone supplied by pharmacists.  The provision of methadone by pharmacists has been a progressive and much needed service in the community and the services provided by pharmacists to elderly customers in particular cannot be overlooked.  I have been approached by a number of constituents who expressed concerns about what will happen if the services are not provided locally.  They have been vocal in their support of their community pharmacists, who go beyond simply providing prescriptions and offer support and good advice.It is up to us, as legislators, to remove the barriers to negotiation so as to ensure the most vulnerable are not forced to suffer.  The best way to achieve that is face-to-face negotiations.  The position of the HSE is that the Competition Act prevents it from negotiating directly with the IPU.  The amendment we are putting forward removes any such problems under the Act.  I recommend this Bill to the House and urge Government Deputies to back it in a public display of their support for a negotiated settlement which will benefit patients, pharmacists and the HSE.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12796	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I noted with interest the contribution of the Minister for State, Deputy Michael Ahern, to this debate last night.  Not once did he mention the word "pharmacist" or even acknowledge the problem that exists for the IPU.  He stated: "the Bill before us today is, in effect, championing price fixing, which is a serious crime carrying a maximum prison sentence of five years".  This gives rise to the question of whether the Minister of State has decided by implication that the general medical scheme as it stands is administered by pharmacists in a manner that is not in keeping with the law.  He must clarify his opinion.The current impasse between the IPU and the HSE is characterised by the latter seeking to enforce its will on the former without even the courtesy or corporate social responsibility of allowing negotiations.  The very nature of this unilateral decision to slash the payments made by the HSE to pharmacists for the purchase of medicines will undermine the viability of pharmacies everywhere.I do not speak for the large multiples which will soak up the reductions in margins without pain but for community based and family run pharmacies which have a wealth of knowledge of their clients and are acutely aware of the intergenerational health issues that run within families.  The vast majority of these pharmacies are located in rural and marginal areas.  In my constituency of Cork East, towns such as Mallow, Fermoy, Mitchelstown, Youghal, Carrigtwohill, Cobh and Midleton are characterised by the presence of independently owned pharmacists who rely heavily on the general medical scheme.  I speak for those who may have taken over a pharmacy from a parent and are carrying on a proud tradition.  They deserve the opportunity to at least negotiate their position.This move by the HSE is dolled up as reform but we can see it for the bullying tactic it is.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12796	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	270	If the HSE had the reforming zeal it purports to have, it would have consulted the pharmacists prior to any unilateral move.  That is why we are seeking to ensure that by amending the Competition Act, organisations such as the IPU will at least have the right to negotiate a position that will not leave them stranded on this or any other issue.If the concepts of engagement and social partnership are to mean anything, the Government will at least afford them that right.  This unilateral action by the Health Service Executive, HSE, runs contrary to long-held beliefs that the primacy of negotiation with any representative body is paramount.  The Labour Party seeks to defend that right.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I thank my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, for introducing this Bill and I commend him on the extensive work that went into its preparation and the detail it contains.  Hopefully, through the acceptance of this Bill today, Members will move beyond the impasse that exists between the HSE and the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, IPU.  I intend to refer to three issues today, namely, the management by the Government of the matter, the ethos of community-based medical services and the basic premise of fair play.I will begin by posing the most obvious question that people in the Gallery must be asking, namely, why Members are debating this Bill today.  To an increasing extent, rather than taking up the reins of power as it was elected this summer to do, the Government has become crisis driven.  Since the return of the Dáil last June, crises have arisen in respect of water charges, provisional driving licences, Shannon Airport and cancer services.  Members now face another crisis because the Government's position has meant that it has failed to manage.  Although it was the Government's responsibility to bring a solution to this House, it has failed to so do.  The HSE is hiding behind the Competition Act 2002 and, in turn, the Government is hiding behind the HSE on this matter.This issue also raises questions regarding the Government's current ideological position in this regard.  Does the Minister simply believe in competition for its own sake?  If this is the case, community-based service providers that provide a necessary health service will be driven from the market.  Massive wholesalers that will be able to operate within the profit margins that will exist under the new contract will move in.  The idea of an elderly person with a prescription going to a local pharmacist will become a thing of the past, as have local grocery stores to an increasing extent.Last night, my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Joe Costello, referred to the concept of fair play and fundamentally this is what the Bill comes down to.  The manufacture of pharmaceutical drugs involves manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, patients and the HSE.  The HSE has dealt with the manufacturers and the wholesalers collectively and the IPU deserves the same treatment.  Had the Government been proactive in this regard, it would have negotiated with all the parties at the outset and the current position would have been avoided.  The sector is moving from one crisis to another and the HSE has spoken of imposing another deadline in February.  Matters are continuing without any direction coming from the Government to the IPU or in particular to elderly patients who wonder from where their next prescription will be attained.When Professor Drumm held a meeting with Members one month ago, he stated that the Competition Act 2002 contains anomalies.  If such anomalies exist, it is the Government's job to rectify them.  The Labour Party is doing the Government's job for it by introducing a Bill.  Should the Government finds flaws in the Bill, it should table amendments to correct them.  The Labour Members will discuss them with the Government and will offer any support it seeks to amend the Bill.  However, if I may use a pun, washing its hands of the Bill without having a prescription itself for the problem is a completely inexcusable position for a Government to adopt.Through this Private Members' Bill, Labour Party Members hope to clear up the existing anomalies that separate the HSE and the pharmacists.  I urge the Minister of State and the Government to follow suit.  The IPU's position is clear.  It does not want the Bill to set out prices but seeks an opportunity to begin discussions on this matter to bring them to a successful resolution.  It is on record as so doing and all Members have received correspondence from Mr. Michael Guckian on this issue.  It is a matter of public record that the IPU has adopted this position.Furthermore, all Members have received correspondence from pharmacies located in their own constituencies.  I assure the Minister of State that the pharmacists have read through the Bill and probably are more au fait with its contents than are the Government Members who spoke on it today.  The latter have, at best, cherry-picked what they perceive to be its weaknesses.  I reiterate the point that it is unacceptable and inexcusable that when a solution is proposed for an issue that has been before the House for such a long time, the Government simply washes its hands of it and states that it will consider it some time in the new year.  This position is unacceptable.  It is unacceptable for anyone who has a prescription or who requires pharmaceutical services on a regular basis to be left in a state of limbo because of Government inaction.I ask the Government to revisit its position, accept the Bill, work through its weaknesses, if such exist, and bring the matter forward.  The idea of Government Members leaving the Chamber today on the conclusion of Dáil business for a recess that will last until January and then returning having done nothing in the intervening period is completely inexcusable.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I have listened with great interest to the opposition to this Bill, which in this case comes from the Government.  I have only heard about the Bill's weaknesses and how it would encourage price fixing.  As other speakers have noted, price fixing exists at present and it was done at the Government's behest.  This is how the Government does business.  It determines the rate of increase for people who work in other areas and negotiates with the IPU, as it always has done, to determine the compensation pharmacies will receive in lieu of the service they provide to communities and patients.  One must ask a fundamental question.  As matters stand, Members are considering legislation that could resolve this impasse and the Government is saying "No" by refusing to accept this legislation.If the Government is determined not to negotiate with the IPU, how does it imagine that people will have their prescriptions filled?  Does it expect people to revert to the old dispensary system?  Does it expect the old and the sick to queue up in cold, damp hovels to be dispensed their medication through an awful hatch in the wall and to be treated as they were in the past?  Is this the Government's intention?  Ireland has moved away from such practices.  We have moved away from having designated doctors in Ireland.  Both private and public patients now sit in the doctor's surgery and no one can tell the difference.  It is exactly the same in pharmacies and no one can tell the difference.The Government is determined that this system of equality, which has come about through long years of negotiation, will come to an end.  The Government is determined that pharmacies will be located only in areas of high population.  Small towns in County Cork, of which Members are aware, will no longer have local pharmacies because they will not be able to survive.  I note the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Billy Kelleher, is in the Chamber.  He represents a Cork city constituency, part of which is fairly rural.

The authority is completely independent and was set up statutorily in 2002.  The Act was the culmination of a root and branch review of all aspects of competition law in the State undertaken by the Competition and Mergers Review Group.  The group comprised social partners, economists, lawyers and people with expertise in the area and it reported in 2000.  The Act was a follow-up to it.This Bill must be put in the context of the current position on competition.  Deputies from the Labour Party referred to the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE but should realise this matter has broader ramifications.  The existing legislation was put in place primarily to protect consumers, to ensure the existence of open competition and to ensure an organisation would have teeth to investigate cartels and price fixing.  It would be disingenuous of the Labour Party to suggest we should row back on this and should have an organisation without teeth that is incapable of investigating records to determine whether price fixing is taking place or whether cartels are operating.  Fundamentally, the Competition Authority acts in the best interest of consumers and any diminution of its activity would undermine its credibility.  It would really undermine its independence to ask for such a diminution and for the Government to have a say in the offices it can inspect.Let me refer to speeches on the trade union movement made last night.  We all understand the impact the Bill would have in this regard.  According to the explanatory memorandum, if the Competition Act 2002 applied with full force and effect to trade unions and their members, trade unions would then revert to their old common law status as unlawful "combinations" and trade union leaders would be prosecuted as parties to a criminal conspiracy.  The 2002 Act applies only to undertakings and associations of undertakings.  For the greater part, trade union members are employees, not undertakings, and in the view of the Competition Authority, trade unions representing employees would never, when acting in that capacity, be considered as associations of undertakings.  It is important that the Opposition's views in this regard not be let hang in the air uncorrected.The State is supportive of the trade union movement and its role in society.  Through the national partnership process, it played a dynamic role in paving the way for national prosperity in modernising our economy and accommodating change in creating a healthy climate for industrial relations.  Through its participation on boards and many State bodies, it has contributed significantly, both in representing and vindicating the rights of its members and helping to shape our strong performance and rapid development.  A difficulty arises, however, when a trade association acts on behalf of self-employed contractors.  By engaging in fee negotiations for services provided, the trade association is, under competition law, engaging in price fixing.  We can talk about the specifics of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union and the HSE but this Bill has broader ramifications.Let me refer to the findings of the European Court of Justice on the Viking Line case referred to by Deputy Michael Higgins.  It is complex in its balancing of the rights of freedom of establishment under the treaty against the rights of trade unions to take collective action in defence of workers' interests.  This will require much more detailed analysis.  All of these matters can be analysed in the context of the review of the Competition Act and all interested parties have been invited by way of public advertisements to participate.  I am sure the debate last night and today will be taken into account.A report was issued on the Laval case yesterday and could have ramifications.  The detail of this will have to be analysed also.

There is none is Sweden and we must acknowledge this.I sometimes feel I live in a different area to some of the Deputies opposite.  We have very robust and strong legislation to protect employees and ensure their rights are vindicated.  The Employment Appeals Tribunal, Irish Human Rights Commission and Labour Relations Commission are instrumental in this regard.  There is a vast corpus of employment rights legislation to protect workers.  To suggest this side of the House is not caring in this regard is incorrect because we have been very proactive in ensuring the establishment of the National Employment Rights Authority.  I hope 90 labour inspectors will be recruited by the end of the year.  These measures were all included in Towards 2016 on foot of strong commitments made in negotiations with the social partners.We will be opposing the Bill.  A review body has been set up and all the Members who have contributed today can make submissions thereto.  The deadline is at the end of this year.  I am quite sure the review will be successful.  If there are anomalies in the legislation, we can then deal with them.  We will deal with them in a structured manner rather than by way of the Labour Party's knee-jerk reaction.

I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on it and I probably have as good a legal view on it as anybody else.The subject of the Bill first raised its head in respect of Actors Equity and, more recently, the Irish Pharmaceutical Union.  It has now arisen in respect of other organisations and it seems to be the accepted wisdom in the HSE and other bodies that the Government can no longer negotiate fees and prices for representative bodies delivering services on behalf of the State.  This is ludicrous.  The Labour Party believes discussions and negations on fees and prices between representative bodies such as the Irish Pharmaceutical Union, the Irish Medical Organisation, the Irish Dental Association and others should be allowed so the Government can deliver services in an organised and efficient manner that is surely in the public interest.  The Minister of State has deliberately omitted to refer to section 3 because it does not suit his purposes.  My argument does not in any way imply that we do not believe we should not strive to obtain value for money.  We have been arguing with the Government for value for money for a long time and certainly have not achieved it.  It must be achieved through partnership with stakeholders.As the party's spokesperson on enterprise and employment, I would like to address a few issues related to the Competition Act, which I have studied carefully.  In this regard, let us consider the market we are talking about.  As I understand it, under the medical card scheme, medicines are delivered free of charge to patients, and pharmacists are then reimbursed by the State through the HSE.  The prices for the medicines are agreed between producers, distributors of the medicines, pharmacists and the State in negotiations.  For people who are not entitled to obtain a medical card, medicines supplied to a value in excess of €90 per month are supplied free of charge to the patient.  The pharmacist is again reimbursed by the State through the HSE.  Where is the price fixing and who is the price fixer?  Why is the Competition Authority not investigating the entity that fixed the price?
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The State.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	282	It is the State.  Consequently, if we examine the consumer market, it will be clear that there is and can be little price competition between pharmacies, particularly in the case of medical card customers since these customers obtain all their medical requirements at zero cost.Other services provided by pharmacists, such as advice on health issues, about which we heard in the House, are generally provided free of charge.  I can go into Mr. Niall Weir's pharmacy, Mr. Richard Woods' pharmacy, McEvilly's or any pharmacy in Mullingar and the staff will advise me.  I have had a few health issues and in this regard they have been very good to me.  For the life of me, I cannot understand how services provided by the State, in respect of which prices are fixed the whole way down the supply chain, can come within the terms of section 4 of the Competition Act 2002.  Even if they did, the conduct of negotiations in which there is a considerable interest involved, in addition to the individual's right to association and representation, would come within the terms of section 4(5) of the Act.I would like to review the provisions of section 4(5).  It allows conduct that would normally be considered to be anti-competitive where certain conditions are met.  It must be established that the anti-competitive conduct satisfies the following conditions: contributes to improving the production or distribution of goods or provision of services or to promoting technical or economic progress, allows consumers a fair share of the resulting benefit, does not impose on the undertakings concerned terms which are not indispensable to the attainment of these objectives and does not afford undertakings the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.The objective of the State is to provide medicines to people who cannot afford to pay for them.  The Act states: "contributes to improving the distribution of goods or services relative to what would be the case in the absence of the arrangement".  It does not take a genius to come to the conclusion that if these medicines are not supplied and the Government does not pay for them, people will not be able to afford to pay for them.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	284	In the terms of what constitutes a fair share of the resultant benefit under section 4(5)(ii) of the Act, it seems there is a significant gain in consumer welfare among all qualifying households.  They get timely and ready access to medication and it is free for medical card patients, or else it is subsidised by the Government under the drugs refund scheme.  The ultimate benefit to the consumer across the country is very clear.Section 4(5)(iii) states that the only terms imposed on the undertakings in the case of pharmacy services is to supply the medicines free of charge, or in the case of the drugs refund scheme, free of charge over the €90 threshold and the keeping of relevant accounts.  According to section 4(5)(iv) of the Competition Act, only pharmacists can supply medicines covered by these schemes.  I again cannot see how the current arrangement between pharmacists and the State can afford to an undertaking the possibility of eliminating competition in respect of a substantial part of the products or services in question.  There is no price competition in methadone or in the medicines schemes because the price is agreed with the State.  There might well have been an issue when we had a limitation on the number of pharmacies, but as we have now the most liberal pharmacy market in Europe, the current negotiation arrangements must surely comply with this section of the Act.  In passing the Competition Act of 2002, it was never envisaged that the Act would prevent negotiations with representative bodies for members who supply services on behalf of the Government to citizens of this country.I question the handling of this whole situation by the HSE, which is indicative of its handling of many other issues.  What is going on between the HSE and the Competition Authority?  Was it divine intervention that prompted the Competition Authority to raid the offices of the Irish Pharmaceutical Union?  Who prompted it?  Who asked the Competition Authority to get involved?  Why would the Competition Authority want to interfere in markets when, as I have explained clearly, the potential for price competition is limited?  Is it helpful to have the authority involved in what is a sensitive, volatile and difficult industrial relations issue?  I ask the Minister to ensure that there is no collusion between State institutions in trying to force their will on any law-abiding individual or organisation. Surely we have an obligation to all our citizens to protect their rights of association, representation and fair procedures.

The Bill is important and is certainly not a knee-jerk reaction.  After all, it is just over two years since I wrote to the Taoiseach asking him to do something, in November 2005.  Yesterday evening I outlined details of his letter to me in which he suggested that he agreed that ICTU was concerned.  A previous version of this Bill existed and I received communication from the social partners asking me to withdraw my Bill so that the issue could be solved in the partnership talks.  I deeply regret that that did not happen and that the Bill is not being allowed to proceed to Committee Stage, where all those who wanted to amend it would have the opportunity to make a contribution.In the short time available to me, I would like to clarify a number of points.  When I came into this House for the first time 20 years ago, I was told that when interpreting a Bill, it is important to interpret the entire Bill.  One particular section cannot be taken and used out of context.  This is advice that some of the younger Deputies should follow and they should avail of the courses on the interpretation of legislation that are provided by the commission.  For example, section 2 of my Bill is qualified by section 3(2), which states: "Where the Government makes a declaration under this subsection that there is, in relation to a scheme to which this section applies, a public interest in negotiating a collective agreement between the public body concerned and an organisation that is representative of the profession concerned, providing for the terms ....."  Therefore, there is a choice.  I could have tried to strike down section 4, but I did not because I was not striking against competition.The Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, in a rather strange speech of 17 pages, devoted 14 pages to what one might call a hymn of praise to the Competition Authority and three and half pages to the Bill.  He happened to get it wrong and I would like to clarify some points in law that are straightforward and clear.  Article 81 and Article 82 of the EU Treaty only apply to transnational commerce.  They do not apply directly into the State.  They are translated into domestic law by the different member states.  In the case involving Actors Equity, as part of SIPTU, and the Competition Authority, the latter clearly invoked a section of the domestic legislation.  There is no point in sowing what is a dishonest confusion into the argument in that respect.There may be many people who worry about bricklayers and stonecutters getting organised and referring to ancient guilds that might be established, as we heard last night.  BATU is in existence and it has 9,000 members.  It is in the building industry and it organises brick and stone layers, carpenters and joiners, as well as wood-cutting machinists.  They enjoy a registered employment agreement so the Government is wasting its time if it wants to wish itself back to the 18th century, or if it wants to start advocating that little children should be climbing chimneys.  Unions have every right to work against the process of casualisation.  I believe that right is on the side of their argument.  Reference was also made to farm workers.  My party was founded in 1912 and we organised rural workers and there is a joint labour agreement that governs minimum rates.In making his speech last night, the Fine Gael spokesperson said that there is a legal flaw in the Bill because it only amends the Competition Act 2002 and does not either the EU Treaty or the relevant EU regulations.  That would be a nonsense because that is not what the Bill sets out to do.  It sought to amend the Bill that gives compliance with the EU regulation and with the EU Treaty.  He suggested that the Bill would be of no benefit to groups such as Actors Equity, as the Competition Authority's rule is now based on Article 81 of the EU Treaty and not the Competition Act 2002.  This is completely wrong.

The Competition Authority's decision of 2004 and the agreement between Actors Equity, SIPTU and the Institute of Advertising Practitioners in Ireland was based fairly and squarely on the application of the Competition Act and domestic Irish competition law.  That is what the Bill was trying to change.  In particular, the issue at stake is the concept of an undertaking, something that has not been resolved by the Government or by the social partners.  This is defined in section 3(1) of the Competition Act 2002 as a "person being an individual, a body corporate or an unincorporated body of persons engaged for gain in the production, supply or distribution of goods or the provision of a service".  It is true that section 4(1) of the Act is based on Article 81(1) of the Treaty of Rome.  In applying section 4(1), the authority looks to its interpretation in the Irish courts and by the European Commission in the Community courts.It was a great pity that the Minister's advisers did not find it possible to refer to the Viking Line case or to the more recent decisions of the European Court of Justice.  The decision in the Viking Line case asserted that the right to collective representation is a fundamental right, that it will therefore flow into the treaty and that it takes precedence over laws on transnational commerce.  It is a most important ruling.  I would have been happy, if this Bill had been accepted on Second Stage, to have had it amended by those who want to improve it.  However, there are those in this House to whom I am opposed, who are in favour of casualisation and removing protections from workers.

I had hoped that by beginning to address the issue with actors, musicians and freelance journalists, in addressing section 4 as I did, particularly through section 3(2) of my Bill, I would prevent the bullying and outrageous behaviour of the Competition Authority towards different groups.  In a thoughtful speech, the Fine Gael spokesperson on health, Deputy Reilly, made the point that the Competition Authority would not help industrial relations by raiding offices.  The Competition Authority has nothing to do with industrial relations.Is Europe assisted by regarding opera singers and actors, who may be unemployed for long periods, who have to live on €4,000 or €5,000 per year as anti-competitive?  Should a Minister be proud to say that their union cannot represent them in selling voice-overs and that because they get no maternity or holiday benefit, or any other protection, they should be happy with it?  That is a disgrace to everybody who allows it to continue.  I will return with this Bill if the Government delays another two and half years.

Within that envelope, the allocation for the greener homes scheme in 2008 is €28 million.  Some €35 million is being allocated across the range of energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes managed by Sustainable Energy Ireland, including €5 million for the new home energy savings scheme and €2 million for the energy efficiency advisory programme for small and medium enterprises.I am advised by SEI that analysis is under way on the level of demand across all programmes and schemes in 2007.  In the case of the greener homes scheme, more than 9,000 definitive grant offers were made in 2007 and total expenditure under the scheme this year will be €28.2 million.As the Deputy is aware, demand under the greener homes scheme has been exponential and continues strongly with 1,900 applications received to date — under phase 2 of the scheme.  I fully expect the demand for the programmes and services of SEI to continue to grow in 2008 and continue into the future.

At the time, I was extremely unhappy, as were others in Opposition, that to bail out Sustainable Energy Ireland and ensure the bills committed to the greener homes scheme would be paid the Minister needed to find money from other areas within his Department such as broadband schemes and a research budget.At the time, the Opposition clearly stated it did not want this mistake to be made the following year.  Here we see less money allocated for 2008 than was spent in 2007 for a scheme which continues to grow and is becoming more popular among house owners and home-makers according to Sustainable Energy Ireland.Last year we got it wrong in a major way and had to reallocate approximately 40% extra to pay the bills for the greener homes scheme.  It is still a demand-led scheme which does not have a cap.  Is the Minister satisfied that next August we will not have to find money from other areas in the Department to bail out Sustainable Energy Ireland for a second time in what is a successful, attractive and sensible scheme for making houses more energy efficient?  I am concerned that we have not allocated enough money.  The allocation for 2008 represents a cut from 2007.

Deputy Coveney is correct to state it is a demand-led scheme.  Because of the nature of demand-led schemes, it is difficult to forecast and be accurate on what will be the demand from the public.  This is true not only with regard to the number of applications but also the number which feed through to contracts being signed and work being undertaken.  Both of these variables varied and we had to secure additional funding for the scheme.  I was happy to do so in the manner I did because it was orderly and feasible as my Department has unspent allocations which could be transferred.Considering the overall picture for the SEI and the various schemes it has, if I recall correctly, the original budget allocation in 2007 was approximately €31 million.  Next year, the allocation will be €63 million, which more than doubles the figure.

It is not our job to continue forever and a day to grant aid particular technologies.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The EU statistics agency, EUROSTAT, published a report, "Internet usage by enterprises 2007" on 10 December.  This showed Internet access by enterprises in Ireland at 94%, which is the EU average.  In all, six member states were at 94%, ten were above average and ten were below average.  The average rate for broadband connection was 77%.  At 66%, Ireland was among 13 member states which were below average, one was average and 12 were above average.  No data was available for France.It is important that statistics such as these are seen in context.  The reference period for these statistics was 2006.  Since then, Ireland has experienced and continues to experience considerable growth in broadband.  A recent report from the OECD shows that we have the strongest per capita subscriber growth in the OECD, with Ireland adding 6.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during the past year, almost double the OECD average of 3.65 per 100 inhabitants.  More than 20 operators provide broadband services in Ireland over a range of platforms; DSL, cable, wireless, mobile and satellite.ComReg's latest quarterly report published yesterday shows broadband take-up continues to grow strongly.  In Quarter 3, broadband subscriptions grew by 8% to more than 700,000, which represents year-on-year growth of 61%.  When mobile broadband is included, total broadband subscriptions stand at almost 800,000, this brings the total growth in broadband subscriptions over the quarter to 14.6%.The number of mobile broadband subscribers in Q3 2007 stood at 88,400, almost double that at the end of Q2.  Broadband penetration for Q3 2007 is over 16% compared to the EU average of 18.2%.  When mobile is included, Ireland's penetration rate is 18.4%.In the case of business broadband, the near-universal take-up of fast broadband services by bigger businesses is being followed by large scale SME take-up.  ComReg's eBusiness survey showed that 79% of SMEs had broadband services as of July 2007, compared to 30% two years previously.The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for Government.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant aid under the recently concluded group broadband scheme and investment in metropolitan area networks, MANs.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In order to address this issue the procurement process for a national broadband scheme, NBS, is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.The first phase of the procurement process, pre-qualification questionnaire, is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Limited Consortium, Eircom Limited, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Limited and IFA Motorola Consortium.The Department has invited these remaining candidates to participate in the "competitive dialogue" phase of the procurement process and to present their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	322	I thank the Minister for his reply.  We must focus on the purpose of the question which relates to enterprises with ten or more employees.  Although these are not major enterprises it is clear that broadband access remains a major issue.  We lag behind and no amount of statistics will change this fact.  In the most recent report, we were at 66%.  At that time, the UK was at 78% and little Malta was at 89%.I accept we have had an increase and it is proper and right because we started from such a low base.  However, as we move other countries move further ahead and this affects our competitiveness.  What will the Minister do at a practical level to deal with the complaints in the IT sector in particular about the issues of quality and cost of low penetration?  It has been described as a joke.  People have stated they are embarrassed about the relationship between broadband and business in Ireland.When will the needs of teleworkers in rural areas be met?  I do not expect the Minister to know where Preban is in south Wicklow but I want him to know that 25 householders in the parish need broadband.  Some of them could stay at home and work much more productively if they had broadband, rather than being stuck in traffic jams trying to get to work in Dublin, but they have no means of accessing a broadband service.  Despite being part of Enterprise Ireland, they are not being catered for.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	323	I accept that Ireland has lagged behind other countries, primarily as a result of an initial lack of investment in our incumbent network and a lack of competition between cable operators and the incumbent.  Competition has been the main driver of competition in other countries and is the reason they are ahead of us.  We must also acknowledge that with subscriber growth here twice the OECD average and at the top of the range, Ireland is catching up.  This is not sufficient and we must move beyond catching up and start leading.  To do this, we must examine developments in successful countries such as Britain, the Netherlands and states of a similar size to Ireland where competitive markets have been the main drivers for broadband bandwidth increases and price reductions, the two key developments required here.  Once Ireland has attained universal coverage, the key issues will be the speed and cost of broadband services.  We must continue to increase broadband penetration and speeds and reduce prices.On the secondary issue of rural and isolated areas, to take the example of County Wicklow, the Department is working on a competitive tendering process to provide universal coverage and ensure no area is left behind.  Four applicants have applied under the scheme.  The complicated and detailed competitive tendering process will be completed in the second quarter of 2008 and contracts will be ready by June.  This will be a significant development in terms of further competition, particularly in the areas in question.To return to my main point, the reason the figures on broadband uptake in Ireland are encouraging is that we are seeing rapid uptake of mobile broadband services.  This may be for geographical reasons as it is more difficult in Ireland to get broadband into very dense developments when compared to other countries.  Mobile penetration combined with much greater development of broadband by the cable operator and other wireless and satellite operators is leading to a more competitive market.  We must push this development in order that companies compete effectively to deliver better quality services at a lower price.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	325	The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard, my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include investment in metropolitan area networks, MANs, the concluded group broadband scheme, GBS, and the recently announced national broadband scheme, NBS.An indicative €435 million of Exchequer funds has been provided for the communications and broadband programme in the national development plan.  To date, €35 million has been spent on broadband initiatives during 2007, including phase II of the metropolitan area networks programme and national broadband scheme.  It is anticipated that the full €435 million will be fully utilised over the lifetime of the NDP.  It is not possible at this stage to give a detailed breakdown of the approximately €400 million that remains to be allocated over the period of the plan.  Some of this allocation will be expended in the NBS and commitments under phase II of the MANs programme.In the recent 2008 budget, provision was made of €53.634 million in my Department's Vote for the information and communications technology programme.  This allocation will be used in 2008 to fund MANs and NBS projects, as well as other information and communications technology programme initiatives.  As the NBS is going through a tendering process, I am not in a position at this time to give details of the breakdown of funding.A value for money and policy review of phase I of the MANs programme will be completed and published in January 2008.  In the circumstances, I consider it prudent that further contracts for the construction of new MANs networks should not be signed until I have had an opportunity to consider and assess the implications of the value for money report and the outcome of the consultation on the next generation broadband policy paper.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I welcome the increase in funding in this area, which I hope reflects a realisation that we need to front-load money allocated in the national development plan for telecommunication infrastructure.  When will the report on the next generation network consultation process be available?  Why is the Minister unable to provide additional details on how the budget for next year will be split behind MANs, the national broadband strategy and what he describes as "other information and communications technology programme initiatives"?  Surely when he makes a pitch for money from the Department of Finance, he must indicate what he plans to do with it.  Why can he not provide more detail?I assume the Minister is aware that the broadband challenge for Ireland is not only to achieve broadband access for the 15% or 20% of the country that does not have it but also to achieve next generation network capacity, namely, higher speeds.  While we try to catch up in terms of first generation broadband connectivity, we are falling further behind in terms of speeds.  On average, the advertised download speed here is three megabits, the third worst figure of 35 countries in the OECD.  The average advertised speed in France is 44 megabits, in Sweden it is 21 megabits, in Italy it is 13 megabits and in the United Kingdom it is ten megabits.  What specific measures does the Minister have in mind to front-load capital investment to try to kickstart the provision of high speed next generation networks by assisting the private sector using the capital available under the national development plan and next year's budget?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	327	The report on the next generation network will be completed in early January when it will be sent to a national advisory panel I will establish to obtain an outside opinion.  As this is a complicated area, it is good to examine international experience and precedents.  The report will be published after the panel's work is completed.  This will be a short process which will last for weeks rather than months.The Deputy asked the reason I will not provide details on expenditure.  The Department is engaged in a competitive tendering process in which it is seeking tenders from corporations for a national broadband scheme in which they will provide services with State support.  If I was to give a breakdown of the scheme, it would give an indication, from the Government side, as to the possible financial picture.  It would be highly inappropriate in a competitive tendering process to flag what the Department would consider a budget allocation.  For this reason, I will not break down the figure further.The Deputy is correct that the debate must be about how, in a fast changing world in which broadband penetration is increasing dramatically and technology and bandwidth are increasing, we move to much higher bandwidth speeds.  It is encouraging that the incumbent, Eircom, is rolling out, in a large number of exchanges, a new 12 megabit DSL connection facility.  The mobile operators, which have experienced remarkable growth in the past two quarters, expect to double the bandwidth they have available on their mobile broadband services.  We will need these increases in speed next year and in the years thereafter to ensure supply is always ahead of demand, rather than lagging behind, as has been the case, and new services, whether video streaming, data upload or home-working, can thrive with much faster broadband speeds.  This will be achieved through policy initiatives such as State investment in MANs and support for other applications but primarily by fostering competition between the companies to determine which of them can provide the best service at the best price.

This compares with a 5.1% increase in energy related emissions in 2005 and a 4.2% increase in demand.  On a Kyoto Protocol basis, excluding international aviation, a reduction in energy related CO2 emissions of 0.4% was recorded in 2006.All sectors with the exception of transport experienced reductions in direct energy related CO2 emissions in 2006.  Industry experienced a 0.6% increase, residential sector experienced a 1.2% reduction, services experienced an 8.8% reduction and transport energy related emissions grew by 7.1% in 2006. Overall, electricity generation experienced a 1.8% reduction in CO2  emissions, notwithstanding a 6.3% growth in electricity demand.  In total, renewable energy contribution to total energy demand increased by 15% in 2006.Electricity generated from wind grew by 46%, bringing the contribution of renewables to gross electricity consumption to 8.6% at the end of 2006, up from 6.8% in 2005, an increase of 32% in absolute terms.  The current estimate, provisional, of renewable contribution to gross electricity consumption is just over 10%.  Had transport energy not experienced any growth in 2006, energy-related CO2 emissions would have reduced by 2.8%.  It is the case that energy related CO2  emissions increased by 54% between 1990 and 2006.  In that context there is no doubt that the transport sector presents the greatest challenge in reducing energy related greenhouse gas emissions.My colleague, the Minister for Transport, is preparing a sustainable travel and transport action plan which I understand he intends to publish for consultation shortly.  Furthermore, my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, announced a range of measures in the carbon budget creating structural change in relation to VRT and motor taxation to provide incentives for more sustainable choices in the car fleet in the medium to long term.My Department intends introducing a variety of other measures to promote energy efficiency and renewables to help us meet the Government's targeted 3% annual reduction in CO2  emissions.

What I am trying to assess is the difference he will make in terms of 2008.  The Green Party went into Government to make a difference.  The Minister has listed what has happened until now but he does not tell us what will be different from now on.  When I put the question to him this morning I was surprised he did not have an answer.  What I want to know is the target for the Minister's area of responsibility for 2008 and how he intends to achieve it?I wish to make a seasonal point.  Why, during the Minister's term of office, has Eirgrid informed us that Christmas lighting is increasing electricity usage by 2%, which is a very significant amount.  We have seen the excess amount of lighting around.  At a time when that is happening the Government, through the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, handed out over €100,000 for Christmas lighting in Irish.

Eirgrid has set out the increases in electricity that arise at this time of year from Christmas lighting.  We will see many opportunities and technological developments which will provide certain solutions.  For example, with LED lighting we can achieve light with a much lower energy reduction.  I commend my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who, in the budget, agreed to a complete phase out of energy inefficient light bulbs by 1 January 2009, which will save in the order of 700,000 tonnes of emissions each year and €185 million in reduced electricity bills for consumers.  That is an example of a very practical technological measure which achieves a significant gain without a significant cost to citizens.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	333	In the meantime will the Minister ensure, through Cabinet, that this kind of expenditure is properly proofed in terms of climate change?  We can have all the fine words in the world but the reality is that we have this type of venture, which is largely spent in that Minister's constituency, promoting Christmas lighting, which is all very nice — I am being Scrooge here — but it does not tally with the views of the Minister on what needs to be done.  It is significant.  That there have been only two ministerial meetings of the sub-committee of the Cabinet is evidence of what happens when it does not meet on a regular basis to ensure the Government is performing and not just talking.

The delivery of the carbon budget, the first one in any country in the world, took an extensive amount of preparation but we are only at the start.  It will require cross-Government, cross-Department involvement in a common goal, which is to reduce CO2  emissions by 3% per annum across all areas and particularly in areas where long-term decisions have to be taken in recognition of the long-term challenge in this regard.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	335	In March 2002 the Government gave approval for the design and construction of fibre optic metropolitan area networks, MANs, using Government and ERDF funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006.  Phase One of this programme has delivered fibre optic networks to 27 towns and cities throughout the country, which were built on time and under budget.  ENet the management services entity, is currently managing those completed networks.In planning the second phase of the MANs programme, a review of the availability of DSL broadband in the regions showed that over 90 towns with a population of 1,500 and above that did not have a broadband service by the private sector, and these towns were targeted for the provision of MANs under phase two.The towns of Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross had DSL available and were not deemed to be the most needful for MANs infrastructure at that time.  These towns are among the towns listed for phase three of the MANs project.My Department is preparing a draft policy paper on next generation broadband networks which will consider the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll-out of high speed broadband networks.  I expect to publish the draft policy paper on next generation broadband networks for consultation early in the new year.MANs that are under construction will proceed as planned.  There are 66 phase two MANs that are either recently completed or under construction.
#MichaelWDArcy	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-party	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-dob	unknown-#MichaelWDArcy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	336	The Minister knows better than most that DSL is old hat at this stage in regard to broadband connectivity.  In County Wexford phase one was disappointing in that only one town was connected.  Kingscourt, with a population of 1,700; Kiltimagh with a population of 1,000 and Manorhamilton were connected in phase one.  Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross, out of 94 towns, with populations closer to 10,000, were not connected.  There is a competitiveness issue here that is very important.  These are fast expanding towns that will not be considered for high-end jobs because they have a very much inferior version of broadband connectivity.  The Minister is talking about phase three for the next generation broadband networks.  Towns such as Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross are being left behind.An employer in County Wexford with an employment base of more than 250 people has no broadband connectivity but does not wish to be named because of embarrassment.  I ask the Minister if it would be possible, given that we are losing jobs and competitiveness, to consider an assessment for major employers, with 200 to 250 employees or more, who have zero broadband connectivity?  It is a hugely important matter.  The Minister should know better than most that we cannot lose jobs because of the lack of broadband.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	337	To say DSL technology is old hat may not be completely accurate.  There are evolutions in the DSL technology, the latest version being VDSL, which is a much higher speed, something like the 12 megabyte I mentioned earlier.  This is an ongoing variation in terms of what is possible and there will be further variations as we move to next generation broadband networks where fibre optic cables are brought closer to either the exchange or to the cabinet on the street.  That will mean there are towns which have exchanges enabled in that way that they could get high speed connections which may well involve VDSL or another variation of it.The issue about the economy, competitiveness and the availability of broadband is crucial.  Some 49% of our exports are in a digital form.  It is crucial that we have high capacity connections.  The experience on the ground is that larger employers are able to get fibre optic cables to the companies because they tend to have large-volume users and their experience compared to other international countries is reasonably good.  We have strong global processing and a competitive market where operators like BT, Eircom and a range of other companies are looking to service that kind of higher-end commercial market.The more crucial, difficult and important aspect for us is how we bring this to smaller enterprises, particularly those enterprises which are outside urban areas, so competition between a cable operator and an incumbent will see a much greater penetration of business being achieved reasonably quickly.  These are the areas where we have to decide whether to intervene, be it through the national broadband scheme, the development of a backhaul network to try to assist operators to gain access to this area or the development of MANs and the review of that to find whether it is more appropriate to install it in larger rather than smaller towns.The State has shown itself willing and able to make such investments, going back to the original investment in Global Crossing and moving to this investment in MANs.  It is an ongoing and changing process because the technology and the competitive market are changing.  We must take this into account and make sure no businesses or communities are left behind.

At present, it can cost tens of thousands of euro to connect to MANs, which is prohibitive given that the additional running costs are also very high.  E-Net got the contract in 2004 for 15 years.  Will the Minister review the cost for new connectors to take up usage in MANs?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The Deputy's point is a good one.  This is why a value-for-money report is ongoing in my Department to assess the difficulties as we roll out MANs in terms of backhaul connection but also in terms of what is known as the drop connection to get from the fibre optic ring to the business.  The Deputy is correct that once a roadway must be dug up to install such a connection, the costs can be of the order of €10,000.  We must examine this to find how we can be more flexible and help that service to the door.One encouraging indicator is that E-Net in its operations has seen a 59% increase in turnover from 2006 to April 2007 from a low initial base.  There is a certain uptake, although that is not to suggest there are not difficulties or that we do not need to examine this to make sure it works effectively.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The main focus of expenditure to date in the energy RTDI programme has been the Charles Parsons awards.  At the end of 2006, €7.9 million was paid out under the awards to the recipient projects for 2007, 2008 and 2009.  The next tranche of funds under the Charles Parsons awards falls due in 2010.  Payment will be dependent on the fulfilment of all conditions in the respective contracts with the third level institutions concerned.  These include satisfactory progress reports each year on outputs and outcomes.  I expect the Energy Research Council to submit the energy research strategy to me in early 2008, which will advise on priority research areas up to 2013.The decision was taken in the autumn to redeploy 2007 energy RTDI funding to meet exponential demand under Sustainable Energy Ireland's programmes this year.  This reflected in particular the success of SEI grant-aided schemes for renewable energy in homes and represented optimal use of the funds available under the research subhead.  In the event, expenditure under the energy RTDI subhead is estimated at €515,000 to year end.As announced on budget day, just over €13 million has been provided for energy RTDI in 2008, which includes significant new funding of €5.3 million for ocean energy research.  The Government is committed to a significant investment programme to make Ireland a world leader in ocean energy.  From 2008, targeted funding for research and development in ocean energy will help us to reach our ambitious target of 75 megawatts by 2012 and at least 500 megawatts by 2020.  A fully integrated approach to ocean energy development will be underpinned by the establishment of the national ocean energy unit next year.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	341	My understanding from the last time we discussed the RTDI programme was that it was being wound down.  When €6.2 million was reallocated from the energy RTDI programme to the greener homes scheme, with which I did not have a major problem due to the explanation given at the time, I understood this was because most of the research funding in the energy area was to come through Science Foundation Ireland in the future.  Less than €1 million was spent last year on the energy RTDI programme, which is why I am surprised to see an allocation this year of €13.2 million.The Minister was very critical when in Opposition of the Government spending significant amounts of money on research and development without having the necessary structures in place to measure the performance and results of that research.  Given that he is clearly planning to channel new funds through the RTDI programme, what structure has he put in place to measure progress and results in terms of research?  We all accept research and development is necessary, particularly in the energy area, so we can try to bring ocean energy, whether wave or tidal, to a commercial stage as soon as possible.  What measurement criteria are in place to ensure taxpayers' money is being efficiently and well spent?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	342	The Deputy is correct in that there was a significant change in the programme for Government so that Science Foundation Ireland is due to take a much larger role and to build capability in the basic energy research area.  There are additional new areas where I want to see research, perhaps not at a commercial level, as that would be more a matter for Enterprise Ireland, but at a level above basic level research.  A key area in this regard is that of ocean energy research.This is a multi-annual programme and therefore it is not necessarily for investment in 2008 or with a view to achieving immediate results.  It is part of a four-phase programme which began in 2005 and will deal with the development of ocean energy from 2008 to 2010.  This is moving to pre-commercial grid connectivity, which is where our spending will be concentrated with a view to moving ever closer to commercial application.  The return we will see on this may not be delivered in terms of actual electricity produced until 2012 or later.We are overseeing a multi-annual programme whereby we must invest now for the future.  There are a number of additional programmes which I am looking to support and launch in the new year, many of which will come under the auspices of SEI and which may involve research in the construction or electricity networking and metering areas.  These do not necessarily have immediate commercial application but involve research which seeks to push out new technologies in innovative ways.  It is this range of different programmes that I want to help introduce with this budget.Ocean energy is an area where we must further scale up from the level of investment we are considering here.  This is just a first stage and it will take time to get the contracts and materials in place to spend some of the money available here.  It will be a multi-annual programme which will require greater resources in following years as the level of investments that will be made will be very significant.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	343	A critical task for EirGrid, as the independent transmission system operator, is the provision of an annual winter outlook report.  The report provides each year an analysis and prognosis of national electricity generation capacity to meet expected demand over the peak winter months.  The 2007 winter outlook report was published by EirGrid last August.  Based on its analysis and on detailed engagement with all of the power generators, EirGrid forecasts that electricity generating capacity will be sufficient to meet demand this winter.  This is in line with EirGrid's previous medium-term generation adequacy forecasts.The report assumes a peak generating demand this winter of some 5,250 MW and this compares to the peak generating demand last winter of 5,035 MW.  I have been advised by EirGrid that a new customer demand peak of 4,871 MW of generated electricity was reached on Monday, 10 December.  The demand was met satisfactorily.EirGrid also closely monitors the availability of generation capacity on an ongoing basis and provides monthly reports on generation availability levels.  EirGrid has advised that some of the units at the ESB plants at Great Island, Poolbeg, Aghada and Turlough Hill have gone on forced outages and in all likelihood most will not now be available over the winter period.Part of the Tarbert plant, recently on forced outage, has now returned to service and all of that plant is now expected to be available for the winter period.  This scenario will result in reduced capacity margins compared with those forecast in the winter outlook report.  Generation availability is undoubtedly of continued concern and EirGrid has highlighted the imperative for improved performance.  However, the EirGrid analysis remains that the forced outages are broadly in line with probability assessments and, barring further unforeseen significant forced outages, generation capacity will be adequate to meet demand.As regards outages to date this winter, I am advised that these localised occurrences were not due to a lack of generation adequacy or problems with the transmission system.  They were caused by local faults on the low voltage distribution network system, which were repaired as a matter of urgency by ESB networks.EirGrid advises that the total installed capacity is 6,245 MW, of which EirGrid expects approximately 5,700 MW of capacity will be available over this winter.  This includes the new 401 MW plant at Huntstown which has been in operation since October.  In addition, available generating capacity of up to 300 MW was imported in 2006 across the interconnector with Northern Ireland.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.The capacity to import from Northern Ireland remains available this winter.  The contribution of renewable energy to electricity continues to grow.  Connected wind capacity is expected to reach over 900 by year end.  This represents a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of 2007.  By 2009 the generation capacity from wind is forecast to reach 1,216.EirGrid is working closely with generation providers to ensure available capacity is maximised and that the projected capacity margin between demand and supply for the peak period is ensured.  EirGrid also operates a range of demand control measures to assist in managing demand at peak times, including working with large commercial users to reduce their demand.  This is in the interests of ensuring that domestic consumer supply is maintained.Security and reliability of electricity supply over the coming years is of paramount importance.  The Generation Adequacy Report, recently published by EirGrid, assesses electricity supply and demand between 2008 and 2014.  Improved availability of generating capacity and delivery of additional capacity will be key priorities over the period.  Two new generation plants at Aghada and Whitegate are scheduled for end 2009, which will deliver capacity of over 800 MW.The delivery to schedule of the 500 MW east-west interconnector, due by 2012, and the second electricity transmission link with Northern Ireland, due by 2011, will also significantly improve generation adequacy margins. There is also considerable investor interest in providing further generating capacity, both conventional and wind powered.  EirGrid's assessment is that, as this investor interest is realised, in conjunction with improved generation availability and the infrastructure developments under way, supply will meet demand.It is clear however, that energy efficiency and demand side management, including smart metering, will be increasingly critical to ensuring generation adequacy. Energy efficiency is a fundamental part of the Government's strategy to address security of supply as well as energy costs and environmental impact.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I thank the Minister for his reply.  I certainly hope that EirGrid has got it right.  There is some concern, however, that we have problems with old plant that have not been invested in.  In addition, we have a phenomenon of forced outages that should not be occurring if we had the full, up-to-date modernised infrastructure that we need.  It might help if the Minister advised his ministerial colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, and made him aware of the situation.  It would be no harm to do so.  The Minister should also advise his other Cabinet colleagues about the importance of ensuring that the North-South interconnector is delivered.  We cannot afford to have such infrastructure being unduly delayed at a time when we have clear knowledge that when money was not put into infrastructure and plant difficulties, including failures, arise.  There is ongoing concern that we might not be able to meet the need at any point.  I am sure the Minister shares that concern and therefore speedy investment is required in infrastructure, whether it is for the interconnector or power stations.  I know the Minister is committed to the interconnector but, to put it bluntly, we need to hear from the Fianna Fáil Ministers in this respect.

It represents a demand growth of less than 1%, which is encouraging.  I agree with the Deputy's comments on the problems of forced outages we have had with older generation plant.  One of the ways in which we can manage through a tight situation is by energy efficient demand management — that is, getting the same services for using less.  This is the first time I have seen where the winter peak was significantly below what was being forecast.  A 250 MW increase was expected but less than a quarter of that has appeared to be delivered, which is an encouraging sign.I support the Deputy's comments on the North-South interconnector.  As regards the importance of this grid development for the economy is that increasingly companies seeking investment opportunities——

There are difficulties for industries locating in the north-west because we do not have a very strong grid.  Much of the reason for the development of this grid is to develop renewables North-South as well as providing a better balanced and more robust system, so that if there are outages it can withstand it.  It will also support economic developments in areas where that is an issue at present.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	350	Is the Minister concerned by private sector plans to build two 350-MW east-west interconnectors between Wales and Ireland?  If the plans go ahead as scheduled, one interconnector will be delivered by January 2010 and the other by January 2011.  Is he concerned, however, that that would make redundant plans for EirGrid's interconnector which is in the process of going out to tender?  In that case, the latter interconnector may not be needed due to sufficient capacity from two such connectors plus an additional 500 MW one planned by the Government.  Does the Minister have a preference for a privately or publicly-owned interconnector?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	351	We have been examining the issue of an east-west interconnector for a long time, but it has been stuck in the planning process.  We are now moving away from that process into the contracting process.  I am confident that EirGrid will deliver that interconnector on time, under budget, and in a manner that is of long-term benefit to the State.  Many of the complicated issues surrounding it are already being managed.  There are difficulties not only on this side, including a foreshore licence and grid connection, but also on the far side in terms of grid connection.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	352	That is not the question though.

Further interconnections may well be developed down the line but my job is to help deliver that one and I am confident we can do so.  It will be kept within State ownership and will be run on a flexible system that allows us to export and import as is appropriate for the market.  That is the key development I am looking forward to delivering.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	354	The energy policy framework and the Programme for Government have set renewable energy targets for the electricity, heat and transport sectors.  In addition to contributing to fuel diversity and sustainability, these targets are critical to national, EU and Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.We have set a target of 15% of electricity consumption to be generated from renewable energy sources by 2010, rising to 33% by 2020.  The contribution in 2006 was 8.6%, up from 6.8% in 2005 and 5.2% in 2004.  It is estimated that the 2007 contribution will be of the order of 10% with further incremental delivery in 2008.  We now have over 1,000 MW of renewable generating capacity connected and over 500 MW with signed connection offers in place, which will ensure that we meet our target in 2010.  I will be publishing the report of the all-island grid study jointly with my Northern colleague, Minister Dodds, early in 2008.  The report will inform the investment and infrastructure decisions necessary to deliver on the 2020 target.We have set a target of 5.75% market penetration by bio-fuels to 2010 and 10% by 2020.  The introduction of the bio-fuels obligation in 2009 will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that bio-fuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales. Implementation of the obligation will require consultation and appropriate legislation. Fuel suppliers will also require time to make the necessary adjustments to meet their bio-fuels targets.The obligation will build on the results of the 2005 and 2006 mineral oil tax relief schemes for bio-fuels, which saw a total of 18 projects being awarded excise relief between 2005 and 2010.  The schemes were designed as interim measures to accelerate the level of bio-fuels in the fuel mix, in advance of the introduction of the bio-fuels obligation in 2009.  They will underpin achievement of the 2% target next year.In line with the European Union, we have set a national target of 20% increase in energy efficiency by 2020 with a more ambitious target of 33% energy savings in the public sector.  We have just completed the public consultation process on the national energy efficiency action plan, which proposes over 60 actions to meet our energy efficiency targets.  The action plan will be launched in early 2008.The Government has also set a national target of 5% penetration by 2010 and 12% by 2020 for renewable energy heating.  The greener homes scheme together with accelerated delivery of Sustainable Energy Ireland's renewable heat and combined heat and power programmes will directly contribute to achieving our target for the heating sector.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	355	As I am conscious of the time constraints, I will focus on the 30% reduction in the public sector.  Has the Minister examined the costs involved in bringing that about?  He is talking about major efficiency in a sector where many buildings are probably not even up to basic standards.  For example, many prefabricated buildings are used in the education sector.  Is the Government providing a fund in the Departments of Education and Science and Health and Children, for example, to bring about that transformation?  How much will it cost?I must leave to attend a funeral following the Minister's reply.  I wish everyone a happy Christmas.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I wish the Deputy a happy Christmas and a happy new year.With regard to energy efficiency gains in the buildings area, it is the most beneficial, according to cost benefit analyses.  It provides the clearest gain, particularly in the context of heating, because demand is consistent and it can be quantified on a building by building basis and reductions achieved.  Although capital costs are incurred, the State can deliver efficiencies, gains and cuts in budgets and emissions in this area.The national efficiency action plan was published on the Internet and was subject to public consultation during October and November.  We are moving into the action phase.  It will require Government action across all Departments and agencies to make sure we retrofit buildings and we lead the way in the public sector.  On a building by building basis, we should ascertain the payback within a set number of years.  If, for example, the payback occurs within five years, that will represent a good investment by the State and that would be the economic model to use to deliver efficiency gains.All Departments are engaged in this process.  For instance, the Department of Education and Science is examining every school.  All public sector bodies are building a statistical picture to establish current energy use.  That exercise will lead to an examination of how to reduce energy use in buildings with high energy use.  It is a demanding target but it represents a significant opportunity rather than a cost.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	357	The Government is giving major priority to investment in research technology development and innovation in ocean energy.  Realising our wave and tidal energy potential is of strategic importance in support of our renewable energy targets, security of supply and carbon emission reductions.  It also has significant overall enterprise development potential, in terms of innovation and economic activity.  Ireland's geographical position is considered virtually unparalleled in the world with regard to wave energy.  In addition, the tidal stream conditions in the Irish Sea are considered to be of considerable potential.In the context of achieving our 2020 renewable electricity target of 33% of electricity generated from renewable sources, it is vital that we develop all the renewable resources available to us.  While wind energy will be the major contributor to renewable energy growth, the potential for solar, biomass and ocean energy technologies must also be rapidly progressed.  I am firmly committed to accelerating delivery of the ocean energy strategy starting in 2008.  We intend taking a range of measures which will include clear market signals in the form of a dedicated technology support price.As announced on budget day, we are providing €5.3 million for ocean energy technology and development in the 2008 Estimates.  The funding will be used to build on the existing work under way by Sustainable Energy Ireland, the Marine Institute and the hydraulics and maritime research centre in UCC.  It will also support the scaling up by the private sector.  Pioneering work to date has already seen the emergence of Irish ocean energy development companies.  The existing ocean energy testing site, which is located off Galway Bay has witnessed the successful testing of prototypes.We need to ensure a significant scaling up by companies of technologies and businesses.  The next stage is to demonstrate full scale pre-commercial development of these technologies.  Investment in the necessary facilities to support commercialisation is critical to achieving breakthrough.  Ocean energy worldwide is still at the developmental stage with no commercially viable or reliable proven technologies as yet available.  In terms of research activity in the sector, Ireland is among the four lead nations in Europe alongside the UK, Portugal and Denmark.  We are also working within the International Energy Agency's ocean energy agreement to benefit from collaboration on a wide scale.  The €5.3 million made available for 2008 will significantly upscale the national investment in ocean energy.  I will be announcing full details of the ocean energy package early in the new year.

In particular, I refer to the Shannon Estuary, which experiences an 8 knot tide.  Such a tide could allow for the use of reversible turbines to generate electricity and it offers huge potential.  Does the Minister agree research facilities in University College Cork and the University of Limerick could be expanded so that practical experiments in generating electricity from waves and tides could be carried out on a wider scale?  Is he satisfied that the timetable set out in the Department's strategy for ocean energy is on target?  Is he confident, for example, that the pre-commercial grid envisaged in the strategy will be in place by 2010?  What direct role, if any, does he envisage the State having in operating wave and tidal generating capacity?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I agree with the Deputy there is undoubted potential in this area to develop resources.  The tidal potential is more localised.  Wave power comes in along the Atlantic coast and elsewhere but tidal resources are more site specific and include areas that experience high tide speeds.  This raises issues regarding the technology used and whether a tidal barge, which traverses an estuary, should be deployed, as it can lead to complications and difficulties, or whether open tidal systems out at sea are used.  We will have to examine which is the best way to go.I also agree with the Deputy regarding the enhancement of skills in the universities in Cork and Limerick and the Marine Institute.  Facilities must be developed in areas close to the energy sources.  People have taken a lead in the locations mentioned by the Deputy.I am satisfied that the ocean energy strategy set out in 2005 is on target.  We are moving into the next phase, which involves pre-commercial grid connected devices.  That will require a range of different supports relating to grid connection and pre-commercial support prices, which will have to be tested.  I am satisfied with progress in this regard but I would not become complacent.  This is complex and certain technologies may not evolve.  Our options must be kept open so that we do not miss out on a technological development that may occur.The State's role is to leverage investment and to set up the regulatory environment, grid connection and price support systems but not necessarily to be the technological developer.  That is not where the Government's expertise lies.  It is more likely to lie within innovative new Irish companies emerging in this area.  The State will support them but it will not be the lead developer.  However, the energy expertise in existing Irish companies such as Bord Gáis or the ESB could be deployed in this area.  Their engineering and electricity generation skills could be used to establish what could be delivered.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	360	This is potentially an exciting area for Ireland.  An allocation of €7 million has been set aside for ocean energy.  A significant chunk of capital funding will be invested in advancing the wave energy prototype currently floating off the west coast.  That is valuable and important work.  How much capital investment does the Minister need to support tidal flow energy?  My office has been contacted by one person who has done significant work on electricity generation from consistent tidal flow in an estuary.  He knows a great deal about this because he provides statistics to the CSO regarding tidal flows but he has had a frustrating time trying to secure support from SEI for his work.  Does the Minister have a preference for tidal over wave energy?  The advantage of tidal energy is its predictability and consistency.  Is one technology ahead of the other?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	361	No.We must keep our options open and monitor which technologies succeed.  If we knew which technology would have the best commercial application, it would be an easy business, but no one knows that.  We must support a wide variety of technologies, including wave, tidal and offshore wind, to ensure there is a connection with the ocean sector, through grid connections, and not to underestimate the significant potential that exists, which is probably closer to commercial application.I cannot give details of what support schemes can be introduced until they are in place as to do so would pre-empt a process that must be engaged in on a proper basis.  This is a start.  Such provision will form  part of a multi-annual programme and significant further incentives will be needed.  It will be a part-funding or grant application to encourage or support other investment by the private sector in devices that are not quite commercial in that they must be tested.  We will also examine investment by the State in testing facilities to help that process.

While I welcome the Minister's indication that funding will be made available, the amount of funding that will be required is ambiguous, to say the least, given the huge potential that exists and the knock-on effect such development will have for the State as well as for the security of resources.  As this type of technology is only in its infancy, I would not like its development to be held hostage to the lack of funding.  I would like to be assured of that.  I thank the Minister in advance for his reply.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	363	The Deputy has my assurance in that regard.  Within wider Government circles, including in the Department of Finance and elsewhere, it is recognised that this is an area where potential exists.  The scale of it is far from certain but we should not avoid the opportunity it presents.  I said a number of times today that we will develop policies or schemes early in the new year and I hope to be able to launch one in this area then.  It would give some certainty to the industry that it would represent a follow through, on a multi-annual basis, of further significant support to explore what we can develop.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I propose to take Questions Nos. 64 and 72 together.Since taking up office, I have met the chairman and chief executive of Eircom to discuss Eircom's plans for the future, including those for structural separation.  Officials in my Department have also met representatives of Eircom to clarify some of the issues outlined in Eircom's discussion paper and I expect they will engage again with Eircom in due course.  Eircom, as a private company, is entitled to implement the corporate structure that best meets its needs, provided that appropriate engagement takes place with ComReg on any regulatory issues that might arise in a separated company.The roll-out of broadband infrastructure is a key priority of Government.  Given the extensive network operated by Eircom in this regard, its investment and organisational plans are of major interest to me.  It is, however, important to also emphasise the role of ComReg in terms of determination of the regulatory obligations arising from structural changes that Eircom may make.Open access for service providers is critically important and ComReg's recent resolution of the outstanding issues around local loop unbundling is a welcome development in this regard.  I am keen that we achieve the optimum level of an open access network.The question as to whether customers will be best served by the functional opening up of the network or by a structural split between the retail and network divisions of the business requires detailed policy analysis.  The European Commission has recently proposed the introduction of new powers for national regulators which will facilitate the promotion of functional separation where it is deemed necessary due to market failure.My objective in this regard is to further Government policy and to protect the public interest so that new higher speed communications services are delivered at the lowest possible price.  Any engagement on this issue will be in terms of what will ultimately benefit the economy by reference to underlying competitiveness and how the consumer will be affected.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I am glad another Member has joined us.  I largely agree with what the Minister said on this issue.  The most important aspect is for us to be able to ensure for the future that we have a network that is open and neutral in terms of allowing access to the existing infrastructure to enhance telecommunications capacity.I understand that Eircom favours a full structural split between its network and its retail arm.  If that is the case, does the Minister consider there is a potential opportunity for the State to buy back an asset that potentially it should not have sold in the first place?  When he was in opposition he was critical of the sale of it in terms of ensuring open and neutral access to the network or is he satisfied that a properly regulated marketplace can sufficiently sweat the asset when there is no retail arm to influence Eircom's  policy in terms of allowing open access onto the network?  Does he agree that access to the Eircom network has improved significantly in the past 12 months, even though until then it was a significant problem in terms of unbundling local loops and so on?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I thank the Deputy for his comments.  This is a complicated area given the market is rapidly changing, as are the technologies.  The volume of data on the networks of the main operators in the State has increased by the order of 300% or 400% per annum.  This is a rapidly changing area.  Moving from voice to data services and arranging new data services will result in a very much changed industry in the next few years.One of the crucial developments is to ensure that significant investment is made in our next generation networks.  We cannot rely on existing technology, we must ensure significant investment is made to deliver our next generation of networks.  One of the main drivers behind that process will be competition.  If we do not make such investment, we will fall behind.A related issue is that we must have a strongly regulated sector.  Where we try to encourage an open access network, we must ensure there is real certainty across the board for different operators as to the developments of the network, the nature of the new technology to be delivered and the level of access.  Regulatory certainty for other operators and for the incumbent is crucial to ensure that investment decisions can be made in a market that is complex.  Those issues extend beyond the ownership issue of the network, be that State or private ownership.  That is the first and foremost issue.We must have a consistent and clear sense of direction, particularly for the main core access network to ensure other operators know the type of open operation that exists and what role they have to play in that regard.  Such an open access network would benefit the incumbent.  The volumes of transactions that can increase would lead to a stream of revenue that could result in it being a profitable business, which would be able  to afford further investment.  Strong regulatory pressure in the United Kingdom, which led to the opening up of the access network, has resulted in a significant increase in competition, one that has benefited the network provider as well as other operators.Different questions surround the issue of opting for structural or functional separations. Structural separation has not been tried yet.  We do not have an example of where this has been done elsewhere and therefore cannot cite an example of how such separation works.  There are questions around the benefits that might derive from functions separation in having a retail arm and keeping pressure on a network company to make sure standards are maintained.  In the regulatory system we put in place, whether there is functional or structural separation, we must ensure we do not introduce a rigidity into the system such that new technological developments would not then take place.  In other words, we must ensure we do not have a system that is regulated in such a conservative manner to deliver a certain return that it does not allow for competition to function.  This is a difficult regulatory issue, on the detail of which ComReg must work.While we must be cautious and take due care to make sure that the regulatory system is right, we must also be willing to make bold decisions within a suitable timeframe.  We cannot wait for many years to make decisions on how to proceed regarding the next generation networks.  The industry is developing at such a speed that it requires us to make strong regulatory and policy decisions sooner rather than later.  That must be done on the back of detailed analysis, examining international examples and consulting all the players here to ensure we do not discourage investment by other operators who have an interest in the whole market.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	367	That is a "No" so I take it the Government will not consider trying to buy back the Eircom network should it structurally split from the existing company.  I accept the Minister's arguments on the advantages of functional separation versus structural separation.  In fact, in the UK functional separation has unbundled local loops to quite a successful degree.  However, is there not the same rationale with regard to the ESB's relationship with EirGrid and the ownership of the electricity grid in terms of the argument for functional separation versus full structural split when dealing with the ownership of assets?  This is not directly connected to the question being discussed but there is similar thinking from a policy point of view.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	368	I do not believe I said "No" to anything.  I am keeping all options open.  I would not predetermine what the final structures or ownership structures might be for any company in the area.  The one difference between this area and any other utility, be it water or electricity, is that there is a multitude of ways to deliver the service.  Electricity will only ever be delivered down a wire and water will only ever be delivered by pipe.  Telecommunications, however, can be delivered by means of wireless, satellite, fixed cable, DSL or fixed line telecommunication services.  It is intrinsically different and is a far more fast moving and changing utility sector, which means there will be different solutions.  There is no comparison between electricity and telecommunications or in the example the Deputy mentioned of the separation of EirGrid from the ESB.That complexity and the fact that there are myriad ways of delivering services adds to the regulatory issues I mentioned earlier.  We are facing a more varied system.  A telecommunications signal will go through a variety of different sources in the connection between laptops.  It may go from a fixed line to wireless or vice versa, on into a backhaul network, that might actually be owned by the ESB, and then connect to another operator’s network into an international system and into a server.  Not only are there various different ways of delivering it, one may well get a voice message that goes through a variety of systems and, indeed, different operators’ systems.In general, I believe there should be as open an access network as possible, where mobile networks are open and other operators use their networks to deliver certain services, where the fixed line network is opened and where a variety of different users use services in a flexible way.  That will be particularly appropriate in this country because we have two different distinct markets, an urban one and a rural one.  We will require a flexible response which suits the different characteristics of the two.

Broughan have been selected for discussion.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this issue, which affects parents, grandparents and anybody connected with children.  Everybody is concerned about the eradication of the invasive pneumococcal disease, a life threatening disease that can cause pneumonia, septicemia and pneumococcal meningitis.  A significant number of countries throughout the world, including the United States and the United Kingdom, already include this vaccine in their vaccination programmes.  Northern Ireland has made the vaccine available for some time, so it would be sensible to introduce the vaccine on an all-Ireland basis.  Canada, Mexico, Australia and Costa Rica as well as 11 other European countries routinely vaccinate children against this nasty and terrible disease.Pneumococcal meningitis is the second most common type of meningitis in Ireland.  It is the only preventable form of the disease that we do not routinely vaccinate against.  Infants from birth to 24 months, children with weakened immune systems and children who attend day care are especially at risk of developing invasive pneumococcal disease.  In April, the Minister for Health and Children, speaking at a health conference, announced that the national immunisation schedule was to be expanded to include routine immunisation of children against this disease and hepatitis B.  It was due to be in place by last September but that has not happened.  When will it be introduced and what Minister of State will be responsible for rolling it out?At the same conference, Dr. Kevin Connolly, a member of the national immunisation advisory committee, NIAC, which recommended the addition of the pneumococcal and hepatitis B vaccine to the Government, said he expected the new vaccines to be introduced last September.  This was welcomed by the people who had campaigned for the introduction of the vaccine.  However, it has not happened.  The Health Service Executive has been directed by the Department of Health and Children to introduce the vaccines next year and in the budget a sum of €18 million was set aside for it.  However, there is no date for its introduction and nobody has been given responsibility for it.  If somebody has been given that responsibility, we have not been informed who it is.The evidence available on the benefits of universal pneumococcal vaccination to population health and to the health services is overwhelming.  The latest research published in The Lancet in April 2007 showed that in the United States hospital admission rates for children under the age of two fell by 39%.  Will the Minister announce the date when routine immunisation against invasive pneumococcal disease will commence?  Who will be responsible for its introduction?  It is important for parents such as Karen Jordan and Angela Bligh, whose lives have been considerably worsened as a result of this meningitis, that the HSE prioritises the introduction of the pneumococcal vaccination as a matter of urgency.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I am responding on behalf of my colleague, Deputy Mary Harney, Minister for Health and Children.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the importance attached by the Department of Health and Children and the Health Service Executive to the issue raised.The Minister for Health and Children has been informed by the Health Service Executive that this vaccine will be introduced into the immunisation programme in September 2008.  Ireland's recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  The guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.  The current schedule contains immunisations against the following ten infectious diseases: tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio, haemophilus influenzae B, Hib, disease, meningococcal C disease, measles, mumps and rubella.The NIAC has completed a review of our immunisation schedule and the Department has received the updated guidelines.  These new guidelines include a number of changes, including the addition of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, PCV, to the schedule.  PCV provides a high level of protection to young children against pneumococcal infections.  I thank the NIAC for the time and effort that went into its deliberations on this important piece of public health work.Immunisation is a simple, safe and effective way to protect children against certain diseases.  Immunisation against infectious disease has saved more lives than any other public health intervention apart from providing clean water.  In order to eliminate these infectious diseases entirely, uptake of immunisations of 95% or greater is required.  When immunisation uptake rates are below 95%, outbreaks of infectious disease will continue to occur and some children will suffer complications or die as a result.  Although immunisation uptake rates in this country have not yet reached the target of 95%, they continue to improve.  The national uptake rate for children aged 24 months now stands at more than 90% for most vaccinations and the Department will continue to work with the HSE to achieve a 95% uptake rate.The social benefits for the community in general of achieving an uptake level of 95%, thereby providing population immunity, cannot be emphasised enough.  We owe it to the more vulnerable members of our community to protect them as best we can and we must encourage parents to immunise their children.  I urge all parents to have their children immunised against the diseases covered by the childhood immunisation programme to ensure that both their children and the population generally have maximum protection against the diseases concerned.

Regrettably, the response I received on the last occasion I raised it was grossly inadequate and I hope the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Kelleher, will see fit to providing a proper response today.The mid-west is being bypassed.  The previous response I received from the Minister of State referred to the national spatial strategy for the region and a commitment to balanced regional development but this is not evident on the ground.  The Shannon-Heathrow slot is about to be removed and, while we welcome CityJet's plan to provide services to Charles de Gaulle Airport, nothing could be further from the truth than the Government spin that it represents a better solution than Heathrow.  We are losing 40 cities worldwide with the discontinuation of the Heathrow service, so it is no substitute.  In terms of the national spatial strategy, Limerick, Shannon and Ennis have been designated a gateway hub, yet there is no rail link between Limerick and Shannon.IDA Ireland reports indicate that between 2002 and 2006, jobs in Limerick increased by only 139, whereas IDA Ireland jobs increased in Dublin by more than 3,000, in Cork by 1,800 and in Galway by more than 1,500.  These figures speak for themselves.  Other counties with smaller populations than Limerick's also experienced increases.  Kildare received an additional 742 IDA Ireland jobs, Waterford received 529 and Leitrim received 407.  I am not begrudging these areas their jobs but Limerick and the mid-west have been let behind.  In the past several months, we have lost 100 jobs in Full Flex and more in Atlas Aluminium.  We have had no major IDA Ireland job announcements for the past five years.The Minister of State's response made no reference to the future.  He massaged figures in respect of the years up to 2006 without mentioning 2007 and beyond.  He cited figures in respect of 2004 onwards but there was nothing in the mid-west between 2002 and 2004.  One company came to the region in each of the years 2005 and 2006.  The indications are that some companies will come in 2007.  Every company is welcome but the region does not have large-scale employers or IDA Ireland backed jobs.I look forward to the Minister of State's response, which I hope will bring good news for the mid-west.  All we have heard for the past several months has been bad news.  The Government does not fully understand the consequences of the loss of the Heathrow route for the region in terms of connectivity and employment.  More than 400 people are employed by Aer Lingus in Shannon, many of whom live in my constituency of Limerick East.  The multinational companies brought IDA Ireland backed jobs to the region because they were promised the connectivity now being lost.  I hope the Minister of State will indicate that IDA Ireland will bring jobs to the mid-west as a priority, that the region will experience balanced development and that the national spatial strategy will manifest itself in investment in the region rather than rhetoric.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	377	I do not intend to engage in rhetoric but will outline the issues involved.  I thank Deputy O'Donnell for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I have already clarified the issues which he raised last week.A central goal for this Government is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The attractiveness of Limerick for inward investment lies in its position as a regional gateway with the critical mass and infrastructure necessary to attract mobile investment to the region.  The national spatial strategy provides a framework for the development of the Limerick-Shannon gateway.  IDA Ireland's regional plans reflect the strategy with an emphasis on the gateway and hub locations.  IDA Ireland is the national agency responsible for attracting foreign direct investment to the country.  The IDA Ireland mid-west region, which consists of counties Clare, Limerick and North Tipperary, has a total population of 361,028 people.  Limerick and Shannon have been designated as the gateway for the region under the national spatial strategy.  IDA Ireland is responsible for building the FDI base in the region with the exception of the Shannon free zone which is the responsibility of Shannon Development.IDA Ireland has focused on working continuously with the existing client base to deepen the global strategic importance of existing Irish operations within the parent corporations and attracting high quality new names to the region.  IDA Ireland's mid-west team has been developing relationships with all the relevant stakeholders in the region to use its influence to improve the overall environment for economic development.  The mid-west has a strong base of overseas companies which are mainly located in Raheen and the National Technology Park in Limerick and in the Shannon free zone.  There are 49 IDA Ireland client companies in the region employing almost 11,000 people and employment has remained steady over the past three years.  Agency supported employment accounts for 17.3% of total employment in the region as compared to 14.8% nationally.The IDA Ireland strategy for the mid-west region is to grow a knowledge economy by winning new FDI in innovation driven, high value and high skills sectors; to work with our existing FDI company base to expand their presence in the region by increasing both the number and the scale of functions being carried out and by adding further strategic functions; to provide modern property solutions with supporting infrastructure; and to work with local authorities and other partners to influence the creation of the right infrastructural environment to help win new FDI throughout the region.In line with Government policy, the IDA is committed to the development of Limerick and the mid-west and works in co-operation with Shannon Development to that end.The position in Limerick is that the city and county have a strong base of foreign direct investment jobs.  According to the 2006 Forfás survey, agency-supported foreign direct investment, FDI, employment in Limerick consists of 35 companies employing 9,139 people in permanent jobs and a further 1,689 in temporary and contract employment.  Employment in agency-supported FDI companies represents approximately 11% of the labour force in the county and compares favourably with the national average of approximately 8%.  Limerick's FDI employment base is dominated by the information, communications and technology, ICT, sector, with companies such as Dell, Analog Devices and Banta representing approximately 50% of FDI employment in the county.  The life sciences sector makes up approximately 26 % of FDI employment, followed by globally traded business, which accounts for 16%.The existing base of companies is performing well and has evolved to meet the challenges of globalisation and Ireland's transition from a low cost location.  This transition has seen a number of companies transferring lower value activities to eastern Europe and Asia.  More importantly however, it has resulted in companies expanding their remit to include higher value activities.  Examples of such investment include Dell's enterprise command centre, Cook's European customer and financial centre, Analog Devices's move to 8" wafer fabrication and Vistakon's €100 million expansion.The investment projects that the IDA seeks to attract to Limerick are very different to those of the past.  Today, it relies on the skills of the people of Limerick and on a strong business and educational and research infrastructure to pull investment into the county.  The IDA's strategy is to reposition the county as a hot-spot for knowledge-based industry.  As an example of the success of this approach, Northern Trust's decision to locate its second Irish fund administration centre in Limerick has considerably increased the profile of the mid-west region as a location for financial services activities.IDA Ireland works closely with educational institutions to develop the skill sets necessary to attract high value-added employment.  The agency also works closely with the existing base of employers to encourage additional investment, particularly in activities such as research and development, customer support and back-office functions.Shannon Development's role complements that of IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland by providing bespoke property solutions for FDI and indigenous clients in the region.  Responsibility for the attraction of FDI and indigenous industry to the Shannon free zone lies exclusively with Shannon Development.  The free zone is one of Ireland's most competitive business locations, with 7,188 people working in more than 100 companies as of December 2006.  The zone continues to perform well against a very difficult global business background and a healthy pipeline of investment augurs well for the future.Shannon Development is at an advanced stage in overseeing a comprehensive master plan to regenerate the Shannon free zone and adjoining areas.  The master plan is being prepared by external consultants in close co-operation with all key stakeholders, including IDA Ireland and Shannon Airport, and will serve as the basis for regeneration and development of the zone in the coming years.While employment in IDA-supported companies fell in the early years of the decade, it has recovered significantly in recent years with a total increase of nearly 9% between 2004 and 2006.  In the period 2004 to 2006, eight investment proposals with the potential to create more than 500 new jobs were approved.  During this period there were 15 new research and development investment proposals from existing IDA client companies, which were committed to a combined investment of approximately €12 million.On the issue of connectivity, the connection to Charles de Gaulle Airport is a very welcome development because it has significant connections worldwide and I know Deputy O'Donnell will welcome this proposal.  I am confident that the strategies and policies being pursued by IDA Ireland in the region, together with the ongoing commitment to regional development and the roll-out of the national development plan, will continue to bear fruit in terms of overseas investment and jobs in the mid-west region.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12796	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	379	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me this opportunity to raise this matter.  I wish to speak about the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to address the serious delay in granting permission to St. Mary's community school, Buttevant, County Cork, to build a new school to provide for an increase in the student population.This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years.  It was last raised by my predecessor and late father in April 2007.  As yet, no progress has been made in this regard.  The staff and pupils, as well as the people of Buttevant, have been waiting for ten years for this project to be expedited and I now call on the Minister to tell the people of Buttevant when she intends to notify County Cork Vocational Education Committee of her approval of the new school.When I was a member of Cork County Council, it took a proactive decision to rezone lands for the purpose of designating an educational site to provide for this school.  At present, the school principal and those who are involved in the school only seek the appointment of a design team to enable them at least to move to a stage from which progress can be made on this issue.The school itself is characterised by buildings which in some instances date back to pre-Famine times.  As the enrolment has increased from 182 last year to 194 this year, is set to rise by at least a further ten next year and is increasing on a yearly basis, the people of Buttevant and the school authorities wonder when the Department will expedite this matter.The layouts of the buildings are of a very poor standard and design because the building is not a purpose-built school.  The staffroom is very cramped and there are no sporting facilities.  The school is obliged to use the local GAA facilities for physical education and other sporting uses.  As the site has been purchased on foot of the rezoning, that step of the process has been undertaken.  I call for some progress on this matter and for the Minister for Education and Science at least to deliver on a promise and commitment to the people of Buttevant because the population of Buttevant and the school's catchment area is increasing yearly.  It is anticipated that Buttevant's location on a main national primary route will make it a far more attractive place to live in future and the needs of the local secondary school on a new greenfield site must be met in that context.This issue has been ongoing for more than ten years and the people of Buttevant and of north Cork wish to see some progress in this regard.  I ask the Minister to take this on board and expedite the matter and bring it to design stage in 2008.  I will conclude by wishing the Acting Chairman, the staff and Members all the best for the season and for 2008.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	380	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  As he stated, it was raised previously by his late father and I understand the Deputy's interest in this school.  This affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's strategy for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position regarding the proposed new post-primary school in Buttevant.Modernising facilities in our 3,200 primary and 750 post-primary schools is not an easy task given the legacy of decades of under-investment in this area, as well as the need to respond to emerging needs in areas of rapid population growth.  Nonetheless, since taking office, the Government has shown a focused determination to improve the condition of our school buildings and to ensure that the appropriate facilities are in place to enable the implementation of a broad and balanced curriculum.As evidence of this commitment, more than €540 million will be spent on school building and modernisation projects in the current year on primary and post-primary schools. Since 1997, a total of €3 billion has been invested in school buildings and this has delivered more than 7,800 school building projects.  The further investment of more than €540 million is building on these achievements and will focus in particular on the provision of school accommodation in areas where the population is growing at a rapid rate.  As further evidence of our commitment, national development plan funding of approximately €4.5 billion will be invested in schools over the coming years.  I am sure the Deputy will agree that this record level of investment is a positive testament to the high priority the Government attaches to ensuring school accommodation is of the highest standard possible.On the specific issue of the proposed new post-primary school in Buttevant, the existing school is the only post-primary school in the town and is a co-educational provider with a current enrolment of more than 180 mainstream pupils.  County Cork Vocational Education Committee applied to the school planning section of the Department for funding towards the provision of a new post-primary school building on a greenfield site.  The proposed new school building was to cater for a long-term projected enrolment of 325 pupils and the proposed project reached an early stage of architectural planning in 2001.In light of declining enrolments at the school, the school planning section carried out a review of second level education provision in the area in consultation with the school authority.  This took into account factors such as enrolment trends at the school, the impact of projected housing developments and existing school provision in the general area.A schedule of overall accommodation has been agreed with County Cork VEC to cater for a long-term enrolment of 325 pupils.  The building project required to deliver the new accommodation is being considered in the context of the schools building and modernisation programme.I thank the Deputy for raising the matter and allowing me to outline the progress being made under the schools building and modernisation programme and the position on the proposed new post-primary school in Buttevant.  I wish him, all the staff and everybody else a happy Christmas.

Ongoing complaints are still being made to my office about the pyrite infill disaster affecting new housing in the north fringe in Baldoyle and Clongriffin in Dublin North-East.  Since mid-summer, residents in these and other north side and west side estates have been devastated to learn from Menolly Homes about the problem mineral pyrite which has been used in excessively high concentrations in the floors and foundations of vast new estates.  Pyrite was formerly known as fool's gold and is an iron sulphide that expands if exposed to air or water and reacts with oxygen and water to form sulphuric acid.  This causes much cracking of walls and ceilings and results in moving doors.Residents in Drynam Hall estate in Kinsealy, Beauparc in Clongriffin and at the Coast, Baldoyle, are enduring long months of testing and dislocation in which ground floors of affected homes are being excavated and removed down to a depth of 3 m.  The defective infill was sourced by Menolly Homes and other builders from a quarry located near Ballycoolin in Dublin 15 which is owned by the Irish Asphalt division of the Lagan Group.In my view and that of my constituents, the response of the Dublin City Council manager, the Fingal County Council manager and the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to this crisis in the construction industry has been feeble and totally inadequate.  The only response from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been to remind the local authorities of existing and completely inadequate building regulations.At a recent meeting with the Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council managers, I was again disappointed that they have not ordered an immediate and full traceability audit of all building sites supplied by this quarry.  Even more astonishingly, they have not contacted the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to request the immediate closure of this quarry which, incredibly, remains open.  This is a grave dereliction of duty by the two Ministers and the two local authority managers concerned.There were earlier allegations that this pyrite contaminated infill was also used in major infrastructural projects and the owners of the quarry concerned were partners on the construction of the Dublin Port tunnel.The Dublin City Council and Fingal County Council managers argued that the key problem in this matter is the self-regulation of the building industry.  Resources have not been provided by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to permit these two and the other 34 major local authorities to police building standards covering the housing delivered to often vulnerable young householders with huge mortgages to repay.  Legislation to empower and resource local authorities fully to invigilate house building quality standards was clearly urgent five to seven years ago but now, with more than 500,000 new homes built without effective quality standards, the horse has clearly bolted and young mortgage payers are left with often disastrous results.The two Ministers, Deputies Gormley and Ryan, have conveniently forgotten many of the strongly asserted beliefs they espoused in Opposition.  They formerly supported the Labour Party Bill introduced by the former Deputy, Seán Ryan, to forbid the granting of new planning permissions for newly built estates before existing estates were fully finished to an adequate standard.  Likewise, there seems to be no sympathy from the Green Party Ministers or their colleagues for householders with rapidly cracking walls.  The construction company concerned, Killoe Developments, refuses to discuss the matter or acknowledge any liability based on defective and self-enforced building regulations.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, simply refuses to answer questions on this company's behaviour.This appalling development in the north side and west side estates and elsewhere in Leinster has been regrettably very poorly reported in the media, with the notable exception of the Evening Herald, owing to the major newspapers’ total dependence on commercial and residential development advertising in addition to auctioneers’ advertising.  The Irish Times on Thursday is often dwarfed by the supplement advertising commercial property and residential housing.  Several national newspapers seem just as compromised in this matter as past politicians who depended on developers for financial support.Self-regulation in the building industry must be brought to an immediate end.  A dedicated task force led by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the managers of Fingal County Council and Dublin City Council must investigate immediately the closure of the affected quarry, conduct a full traceability audit of its products, immediately implement SR21 of the guidance document of the National Standards Authority of Ireland and establish a new national standard on pyrite and other problem minerals present in infill, especially for housing construction.Given the numbers of citizens affected by the present awful circumstances, the Minister should establish a national pyrite investigation and monitoring agency based on the initiatives taken by the authorities in Ontario and Quebec.  Failure by the Minister or local authorities to act will result almost certainly in a considerable charge on the two local authorities, the Department and taxpayers in future.  This matter should be addressed urgently and taken very seriously.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I am responding on behalf of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, who sends his apologies.I acknowledge fully the genuine difficulties experienced by homeowners whose homes have been affected by the use of pyrite in certain developments in and around County Dublin.  The purchase of a home by any of us is a major investment, financially and emotionally, and I am keenly aware of the hopes and expectations that accompany the transaction.  This issue has already been addressed in a number of parliamentary questions to date and I can report some progress regarding the quality standards of new homes as they pertain to pyrite.The certification of products is the responsibility of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI.  When the issue of pyrite arose some months ago and following an intervention from my Department, the NSAI moved quickly to reconvene its aggregates panel to give urgent consideration to the matter.  The Department is represented on this panel, together with representatives of the construction industry.  Following a public consultation process, the NSAI has now published a new standard recommendation, which is a definitive amendment to existing standard recommendation 21 on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new standard recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and the intention is that it will address the quality standards of new homes in so far as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  It is now intended to adopt this NSAI standard recommendation in the relevant technical guidance document associated with the building regulations.It would be helpful for me to set out the overarching legal framework for the construction of new houses.  The national building regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of new buildings, including houses, and extensions to and material alterations of existing buildings.  The related technical guidance documents provide technical guidance on how to comply with building regulations.Under the provisions of the Building Control Act 1990, responsibility for compliance with the building regulations rests with the builder and the owner of a building.  Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the 37 local building control authorities which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings when considered necessary.  The House has been advised in this regard that Fingal County Council has been in direct contact with the developers and the quarry concerned regarding problems encountered following the use of pyrite as an under-floor infill material in certain developments.Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, the Department issued a circular letter, BC 6/2007, to each county manager and local building control authority on 16 August 2007 to bring the issue to their notice and to request their co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements set out therein.  The circular also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.The resolution of any problems arising between homeowners and their builders is ultimately a matter for the parties concerned, namely, the homeowner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurer.  Where the construction of a house is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement of this contract is a civil matter.  The measures I have outlined represent the appropriate response to the issues raised by the Deputy.

I expect to publish the draft policy paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks for consultation early in the New Year.In the circumstances, I consider it prudent that contracts for the construction of new MANs networks should not be signed until I have had an opportunity to consider and assess the implications of the value for money report and the outcome of the consultation on the Next Generation Broadband policy paper.In the meantime, MANs that are under construction will proceed as planned.  There are sixty six Phase II MANs that are either recently completed or under construction.Twenty seven MANs have been completed under Phase I of the programme and these are currently being managed by eNEt, the Management Services Entity for Phase I.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I am interested in the protection of consumers and have recently expressed my concern about the level of consumer dissatisfaction and number of complaints from members of the public in relation to the operation of premium rate telecommunications services.In this context, I intend to examine how the regulation of premium rate telecoms services should be best addressed, and how the system could be strengthened to provide better and more targeted consumer protection, especially for children.As part of this process, I met recently with the Regulator and Chairman of RegTel to share my concerns and to explore how improvements might be made.  I also plan to engage with my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment as the area of consumer protection within which RegTel operates, also falls under his remit.As this area is fast moving and complex, my consideration of the issue may require input from many stakeholders, including child safety, parent and consumer organisations, mobile network operators, content providers, handset and network manufacturers, and regulators.Finally, I would like to emphasise the role of parents in decisions concerning the purchase and use of mobile phones by their children.  Their supervisory role is key to the protection of children.  I am also aware of the work done by the Irish Cellular Industry Association (ICIA) over recent years in encouraging the safe and responsible use of mobile phones including publishing a Parent's Guide, which aims to inform parents of some key safety tips to encourage responsible and secure use of mobile phones by their children.Notwithstanding this, the level of complaints being received from parents and children with regard to texting charges shows that there is a continuing problem which requires a much tougher regulatory approach.   I intend developing and delivering a new tougher regulatory system in the New Year.

I have arranged for usage details for both Electricity and Gas for the Dublin buildings to be sent to the Deputy.Elm House has only been occupied by staff from my Department since October 2006 and the Department's presence there is being built up on a phased basis. There is no comparative data available for that premises.I have asked to OPW to do a full energy audit of our head office in Adelaide Road and the offices on Leeson Lane with the intention of undertaking a major upgrade of the buildings as demonstration projects for what can be achieved in energy efficiency gains.

This includes additional funding of €2m announced in Budget 2008 for new technologies which I plan to introduce in the new year.  Programmes for these new technologies will be developed by Sustainable Energy Ireland, in consultation with my Department.  There have been almost 1900 applications received to date under Phase II of the Greener Homes Scheme.Phase II of the Greener Homes Scheme was launched on 1st October with several adjustments reflecting the evolution in the market for domestic renewable technologies.  The grant levels have been reduced for some technologies where the market has reached a level of maturity to allow it to continue at a lower rate of support.  Other grant levels remain unchanged.  The products that continue to be grant aided under Phase II are solar panels, wood pellet and woodchip boilers and geothermal pumps.Phase II aims to further consolidate the market, underpinning it with quality standards and training and providing for a long-term future that is not grant dependent.  In this way Phase II will help secure a range of objectives including more competitive offerings, revised product standards, improved training standards and greater stability across the renewable heating industry.  The aim is to ensure that the market for these products, services and fuels continues to develop strongly, allowing suppliers and installers to consolidate their market offerings ahead of an unsubsidised market.The Greener Homes Scheme will continue to be kept under review and will continue to evolve in light of the maturing of technologies and market developments.

My Department continuously seeks to deliver programme and administrative expenditure as approved each year by the Dáil in a value for money way whilst meeting the policy objectives underpinning this expenditure.My Department will reinforce its commitments to value for money in the context of the efficiency review announced in Budget 2008.  This will be informed by detailed guidance expected from the Department of Finance on the process and mechanisms to be employed in the efficiency review of administrative spending. It is premature to be specific as regards specific progress under the review which is due for completion by 1 March 2008 but particular scrutiny will be placed on the potential for administrative budget savings in my Department and the agencies under its aegis.

The smart meter programme is a key component of the Government's Strategy to radically improve demand, management and energy efficiency and to enable the development of micro generation and distributed generation on a wider scale.The implementation of smart metering is being directed, at my request, by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) with the assistance of a High-level Steering Group comprising my Department, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, ESB Networks (ESBN) and an Independent Operators representative. There are a number of high level objectives which underpin the roll out of the natural smart meters programme:To facilitate and inform demand side management.To facilitate more efficient use of energy.To aid in the promotion of competition and improved customer service.Improved meter management.Technical Working Groups, with wider industry representation, are being established by the CER, and will address all relevant issues such as tariffing, networks, data management and the optimal geographic distribution for the first phase roll out. ESB Networks has initiated the procurement process for smart meters and anticipates test meters will be available by mid 2008. ESB Networks plans the roll out of meters to begin in summer 2008 with a view to 25,000 meters being installed by year end.Microgenerators will be included in the assessment of the optimal design of a smart meter and associated processes.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In order to address this issue the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is currently under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.The first phase of the procurement process Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ) is now complete and four candidates have pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.The Department has invited these remaining candidates to participate in the "Competitive Dialogue" phase of the procurement process and to present their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country. It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.

I am aware of the recent ballot undertaken by a number of the unions within ESB and my Department is continuing to monitor the situation closely.  The proposal to transfer the ownership of the transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid is a commitment in both the White Paper on Energy and the Programme for Government 2007-2012.  It is in line with the proposal for full ownership unbundling of transmission networks by the European Commission contained in the 3rd Energy Market Liberalisation Package.  Most Member States support the proposal which reflects the de facto position in 13 Member States.As previously stated in this House, combining the ownership and operation of the transmission assets makes sense.  It will ensure that the system operates transparently and effectively giving confidence to all market players.  The present structure is complex and cumbersome and adds to costs.  It creates additional overheads and transaction costs, duplication of skills and activities and the risk of blurred accountability.  It also makes for more complex regulation.The transfer of ownership of the transmission assets will be implemented in a way that ensures the future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong Semi State companies, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders.  There is no question of breaking up the ESB.The ESB Group will remain a strong, commercially viable and integrated entity after completion of this process.  The ESB has a vibrant future ahead.  Given its prominent role in the Irish energy sector, ESB has a crucial contribution to make in the energy and climate change challenges ahead.  It is equally the case that EirGrid has a crucial national role to play in the new energy landscape as the strong independent operator and owner of the transmission system, delivering for all energy stakeholders and for the economy.

I am further advised that the contract for design and construction will be completed by the end of quarter 3, 2008, when the successful bidder will be announced.As regards funding of the east-west interconnection development, both the CER and EirGrid are working to determine the most cost-effective and efficient arrangement.In that context as signalled in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 the possibility of an Exchequer funded contribution for the project is being examined.  My Department is engaging with the CER and Eirgrid on all technical and financial aspects of a business case for a proportion of Exchequer support for this strategic energy infrastructure project.  Such support would of course require Government approval.The CER and EirGrid are working intensively to expedite the delivery of the interconnector.  I would emphasise that interconnection projects are of their nature complex not least because of the planning and related onshore infrastructure needs.A number of key milestones have already been achieved. EirGrid has secured Woodland in County Meath as the connection point for the interconnector on the Irish transmission system.  In recent weeks EirGrid has obtained a formal connection offer from the UK National Grid for Deeside in Wales.  EirGrid has also commenced work on a seabed survey to determine the most suitable route for the undersea cable.  In the coming year, the CER and EirGrid will continue to work to deliver the project to schedule.Quarter 3 2011 is targeted for the completion of works with quarter 1 2012 targeted for the completion of commissioning and testing and the start of commercial operations.The CER and EirGrid have planned the project to ensure that it is delivered in the shortest possible time frame.  The programme outlined is time barred and ambitious.  Where opportunities exist to undertake work in parallel, these will be taken. For example, the selection of the contractor to design and construct the interconnector is being carried out in parallel with the seeking of planning consents.The Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure Act) 2006 provides for a streamlined planning process for strategic infrastructure developments and includes special provision for electricity interconnector projects.  To oversee and ensure completion to schedule, a High-Level Coordination Group has been established under the Chairmanship of the CER and comprising representatives of EirGrid and my Department.

My Department is working closely with Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) to fully develop the details of the Pilot Programme, which I intend to launch in the first quarter of 2008.  Their work is being informed by considerations relating to value for money, cost of solution, overall energy efficiency and carbon reduction effectiveness.I envisage that the Pilot Programme in 2008 will support investment by householders participating in the Pilot to improve the energy performance of their homes.  In specific terms I would see improved roof and wall insulation as being of pivotal importance, together with other identified measures with the potential to significantly enhance the energy efficiency of the housing sector.It has been estimated that of the 1.7 million homes in Ireland, up to one million are deficient in one or more significant energy efficiency aspects. This is particularly true of pre-1981 private sector housing, originally built with no energy efficiency features and of which over 300,000 remain of low efficiency standards.The roll out of the Programme will have clear synergies with preparations for the mandatory home energy rating of existing housing put up for sale or lease after 1 January 2009.  Building energy rating is a key measure of energy efficiency improvement before and after remedial action.I am also providing additional funding to SEI to build on its 2007 energy efficiency programme for industry and Small and Medium Enterprises.  A further €2 million is being provided to SEI to administer and oversee the Building Energy Rating Programme.

The mechanisms to implement the transfer to EirGrid of ownership of the assets comprise a range of legislative, commercial, legal and financial dimensions, which are currently under consideration by my Department.The drafting and publication of the necessary legislation is a key step in the process.  I will be seeking Government approval to draft in the near future.  The Bill will include provisions enabling EirGrid to fulfil the requirements of the Transmission Asset Ownership function and undertake any necessary borrowing.  The legislation is also likely to include a range of amendments to existing electricity legislation to fully reflect the new arrangement.  The advice of the Attorney General on the precise parameters of the legislation will determine the scoping of legislation.In line with successive Partnership Agreements, there will be a full process of engagement with the management and unions of both ESB and EirGrid on implementation of the transfer of the asset ownership function.  The process will also include engagement on legitimate concerns of the ESB's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).I met with the ESB Group of Unions on 23rd July in relation to the energy policy objectives set out in the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy White Paper which impact on ESB.I have made it clear to the Group of Unions that I am willing to discuss constructively any legitimate issues of concern that they may have.  I look forward to a positive process of engagement and to further meetings as appropriate with the Group of Unions.I intend meeting with the ESB's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) early in 2008 on a range of issues, including the transfer of the transmission assets.  As was the case in my meeting with the Group of Unions, I will be listening to any concerns that they might have on the issues and providing a clear outline of my own position and that of the Government.Government policy is clear in relation to implementation of the transmission assets decision in a way that ensures the strategic future of both EirGrid and ESB as strong viable Semi State entities, as well as reflecting the position of the State and the ESOT as shareholders.

Under this legislation, RTÉ is required to carry the current national TV channels of RTE and RTE 2, TV3 and TG4 over a national, free to air DTT multiplex and the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) is required to offer multiplexes for the provision of additional commercial DTT services.  It is anticipated that, before 2012, there could be many TV channels available on DTT.  The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) is tasked with ensuring that sufficient spectrum is available for DTT services and that spectrum licences are issued to RTÉ and the BCI.  I am satisfied that ComReg, BCI and RTÉ are making progress in delivering on their statutory duties.The EU has proposed a deadline of 2012 for the switching off of analogue television broadcasting. It is expected that the coming year will see the upgrading and development of networks for digital terrestrial broadcasting. It is probable that actual DTT broadcasting will commence in the 2008/2009 period.Analogue broadcasting is due to be switched off by the UK Government in Wales in 2009.  At this time, the south east of Ireland will lose overspill reception of British analogue TV channels. The border area will continue to receive analogue overspill from Northern Ireland until 2012.  It is anticipated that, from 2008 to 2012, there will be a steady development of Irish DTT services as a range of services aimed at meeting viewers needs are made available by both public service and commercial broadcasters.

In order for this sector to develop to a level that is commercially sustainable, a regulatory and administrative regime would need to be implemented to provide for the orderly development of geothermal energy.  Some complex issues in relation to ownership and access will need to be addressed in this context.I am also conscious of the fact that the deep geothermal sector in Ireland is in a fledgling state and for this reason I am convening an internal informal group within my Department to address this issue.  The group will carry out a stakeholder consultation early in the course of their work and, I would expect this to be launched early in the New Year.  I have asked that they report to me as early as possible in the first half of 2008.  I will then consider how to further progress this issue.  Exploitation of earth resources is a private sector activity, which should be facilitated by the State and therefore the budgeting for the development of new geothermal resources will primarily be a matter for the private sector rather than the State.

The Government decision to revise the fiscal licensing terms followed an independent review that included a comparative analysis of eight other exploration areas, including Norway.  That review had regard to energy prices, water depths, operating and capital costs, along with the key consideration of Ireland's relative prospectivity as a location for exploration investment.  The review recommended that Ireland's fiscal terms should be revised to provide for a higher tax take in the case of more profitable fields while holding the tax take at 25% in the case of more marginal fields.  The Government decision provides for a tax take of up to 40% in the case of more profitable fields.Having regard to the findings of the review that was completed earlier this year, I consider that introducing the Norwegian tax rate of 78% in Ireland in this sector, would result in no future applications for exploration licences, as the risk involved would be considered by the industry to be far too high.  This would result in no new discoveries and as a result no tax return to the State.  Adopting the other element of the Norwegian model, the rebate on unsuccessful wells, might encourage exploration.  This would mean, however, that the Irish taxpayer would in fact pay the majority of the cost of unsuccessful exploration wells.  This would, in my view, place an unreasonable burden on the Exchequer as a single deepwater well in the Atlantic can cost in the region of €100 million.  I am of the view that it is the industry and not the State that should take the risk associated with investment in exploration for oil and gas.I am satisfied that Ireland's revised licensing terms strike the right balance given the current record of success from exploration in Irish waters.  The revised licensing terms are designed to attract what is mobile international investment, while ensuring a fair return to the State for its natural resources.

Better interconnection between electricity systems and major investment in transmission and distribution networks markets is a key priority for Europe.  The Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government underlines Ireland's commitment to a more sustainable energy future through a range of measures including electricity interconnection and investment in the electricity networks.The Single Electricity Market for Ireland came into effect on 1st November this year. As part of this market development, EirGrid is jointly developing the second North South electricity interconnector with its Northern Ireland counterpart.  The increased capacity provided by this interconnector will facilitate security of supply, fuel savings, lower emissions and ongoing integration of wind generated energy onto the grid.EirGrid is also strengthening the transmission network in Counties Meath, Cavan and Monaghan. The Woodland (County Meath) to Kingscourt (County Cavan) 400kV Power Line will reinforce the electricity system in the North East, facilitating competition in generation and ensuring secure power supplies for all customers.  The new lines are critically needed because existing transmission in the region will reach full capacity in the near future.  The ability of the North East region to attract new enterprise and maintain economic activity requires reliable electricity supply to business and consumers.The Meath-Cavan Transmission Investment Power is in line with the Government's national and regional economic objectives, the National Spatial Strategy and overall energy policy goals. Strategic energy infrastructure investment is a national priority under the National Development Plan 2007–2013.  The European Union Trans-European Network for Energy has funded 50% of the stage 1 planning phase for both the Meath–Cavan Power Line and the Cavan–Tyrone Interconnector.The planning and development of these 400kV lines is an operational matter for EirGrid and I have no statutory function in this matter.  The approval of the Transmission System Development Plan, is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, (CER). Individual power transmission lines will also require approval from An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act.I have, however, received advice from EirGrid on the undergrounding of 400kV power lines.  In international and European experience, high voltage electricity lines are only placed underground in heavily built up areas.  In areas of dispersed settlement overhead lines are the most technically feasible solution to providing a secure and reliable supply of high voltage electricity.  Overhead lines are also the most economic way of transporting power, with underground lines costing between six and 10 times as much as standard overhead lines.  Cost is a key consideration given that electricity networks investments are financed by all electricity customers.  In addition, finding and repairing a fault on an overhead line can usually be done within hours, whereas the same process for an underground line can take weeks if not months to effect.  A prolonged time delay in repairing a fault in a high voltage power line would cause a lengthy and significant loss of supply to a large number of electricity customers including businesses.The information available to EirGrid is that, there is no 400kV Alternating Current (AC) line of the length required in these two projects placed underground in any part of the world.  Some 97% of the onshore high voltage transmission network in Europe is of high voltage alternating current carried by overhead lines.In routing overhead lines EirGrid's operational approach is to maintain as much distance as possible from communities and houses.  A minimum clearance of 50 metres is the EirGrid routing target.As Deputies are aware, EirGrid is carrying out extensive public consultation and information dissemination at local community level on the proposed routes for the transmission lines in question.  Local communities and concerned parties will also   have the opportunity to raise concerns in the context of the planning process, once the consultation phase is concluded.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 104 together.Currently over 90% of Ireland's energy needs are provided for by imports. In order to ensure the security of our energy supply, the Government's objective is to reduce our reliance on imports and to significantly enhance diversity of energy sources.Natural gas, coal and oil accounted for 50%, 19% and 9% respectively of electricity generation in Ireland in 2006 while renewable sources provided 11% of overall generation.  I am advised by the CER that, with increasing usage, natural gas now accounts for over 60% of electricity generation in Ireland.With the decline of the Kinsale gas field and, pending the full development of the Corrib field, we now import over 90% of our natural gas from the UK.  Natural gas transported through the UK network comes from fields in the North Sea, the Netherlands, Norway and Russia.  The Energy Policy Framework points to the need to develop longer term strategies to reduce over-reliance on gas imports from the UK.  The actions set out in the Framework include long term strategic planning by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) in relation to security of gas supply and working within the European Union to deliver fully integrated regional gas markets for Northern Europe and diversification of supply.The CER has granted a gas storage licence to Marathon Oil Ireland Ltd to make the full capability of its depleted Kinsale facility, which has a capacity of 7 billion cubic feet (bcf), available to third parties.  This is the first such storage facility in Ireland and BGE has contracted to use over 5 bcf of it.  The planned development of a merchant LNG storage facility at Shannon may also have a positive impact on the security of our gas supply and improve our connectivity to the global gas market.Earlier this year, my Department in conjunction with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment for Northern Ireland (DETINI) commissioned a joint study on a common approach on natural gas storage and liquefied natural gas (LNG) on an All-Island basis.The study has assessed the medium to long-term position with regard to security of natural gas supply on an all-island basis, to consider the scope for a common approach on natural gas storage and LNG with a view to optimising that position, and to make recommendations accordingly. The report has been received in recent weeks and the findings are currently being assessed by both Departments, North and South.The connection of the Corrib gas field, with its estimated capability to supply some 60% of our annual natural gas requirements over the first 3-4 years of production, will also significantly reduce our dependence on imports during that period.Existing gas interconnection and planned electricity interconnection between Ireland and Great Britain, is a key plank in our security of energy supply strategy.  The current interconnection capacity with the UK Grid (through Northern Ireland) of 300 MW, will be increased by 500 MW with the delivery of the new East West electricity interconnector between Ireland and Wales by 2012.  Enhanced interconnection, in both electricity and gas, will assist in promoting the regional energy market, in line with EU security of energy internal market objectives.To further reduce our dependence on imported fuel, the Government has set ambitious and essential targets for the increased penetration of renewable energy.  Connected wind capacity will reach over 900 MW by year end, which will represent a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of 2007.  It is also a priority to ensure the provision of flexible generation plant to accommodate electricity coming on to the system from wind generation.As regards imports of oil, in 2005, the latest year for which definitive figures are available, 65% of Ireland's oil imports were sourced from the UK, with crude accounting for 12% and products accounting for 88% of those imports.  In the same year Norway accounted for 28% of our oil imports, of which crude consisted of 93% and products 7%.  The Irish downstream industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated.  My Department is currently undertaking a strategic review of security of oil supplies which will include consideration of security of commercial access to oil supply.In relation to contingency planning, Bord Gáis Networks, as National Emergency Manager for the gas network, has detailed arrangements in place to maintain supplies in the event of a shortage of gas imports from the UK.  BGN also works closely with the ESB and EirGrid, under the direction of the CER, to ensure coordination between the emergency arrangements for both the gas and electricity networks. Furthermore, BGN participates in the UK arrangements for gas emergencies, and are thus able to keep abreast of both the procedures in place in the UK, and the potential impact that any curtailment of gas supply in the UK could have on Ireland.

The Science, Technology and Innovation Strategy and the National Development Plan both reflect the vital importance of energy research and innovation to underpin the energy sector and the imperative to deliver sustainable, competitive and secure energy supplies for the economy and society.  Our ambitious renewable energy and energy efficiency targets in particular require a significant ramping up of research and innovation.A comprehensive energy research strategy is currently being finalised by the Irish Energy Research Council, which will advise on the key energy research priorities in the short to medium term.  Building national energy research capacity and capability has already been identified as an area for priority attention. The Charles Parsons awards have already committed €20 million for the period 2007 to 2012 to progressively develop energy research capacity in third level institutions.The Programme for Government also commits to enhancing the remit of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) to include a third research pillar in the area of sustainable energy and energy efficiency technologies, and discussions are underway with SFI accordingly. In the context of taking forward this commitment, I am considering carefully the approach to take in respect of a second round of the Charles Parsons Awards.At the end of 2006, €7.9m from the Department's Vote was expended on the first tranche of funding under the Charles Parsons Awards covering the period 2007 to 2009.  The projected 2007 outturn for the energy RTDI subhead of the Vote is estimated at €515,000.  As announced on Budget Day we are providing €13.1 million for energy RTDI in 2008 including new funding of €5 million to underpin Ocean Energy Research and Development.

The transfer of ownership of the transmission assets from ESB to EirGrid will take place by end 2008, in that context.In line with successive Partnership Agreements, there will be a full process of engagement with the management and unions of both ESB and EirGrid on implementation of the transfer of the asset ownership function.  The process will also include engagement on legitimate concerns of the ESB's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT).On 29 November 2006, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and ESB agreed a strategy, which includes an agreement for ESB to divest 1,300 MW of its existing capacity, to ensure the progressive reduction in ESB's market share in power generation to around 40% in an all-island market context by 2010.  It is in this context that ESB Power Generation will continue to compete in the island of Ireland and, eventually, as the regional energy markets progress, the wider single energy market in the EU.While ESB continues to develop its renewable energy portfolio on the island, approval has been given to the company to build a new power plant at Aghada, County Cork.  Authorisation for the construction of Aghada is intrinsically linked to ESB's delivery on the CER-ESB Asset Strategy to the full satisfaction of the CER.I expect that the ESB Group will play a leading role in supporting the development of renewable energy and demand side and management strategies.  ESB International will be strongly growing its UK, European and international business.  ESB Group will continue to compete successfully with Viridian, Airtricity and all other independents in power-generation and electricity supply in the all-island electricity market.I met the ESB Group of Unions on 23rd July in relation to the energy policy objectives set out in the Programme for Government and the Energy Policy White Paper, which impact on ESB.I have made it clear to the Group of Unions that I am willing to discuss constructively any legitimate issues of concern that they may have.  I look forward to a positive process of engagement and to further meetings as appropriate with the Group of Unions.I intend meeting the ESB's Employee Share Ownership Trust (ESOT) early in 2008 on a range of issues, including the transfer of the transmission assets.  As was the case in my meeting with the Group of Unions, I will be listening to any concerns that they might have on the issues and providing a clear outline of my own position and that of the Government.I have no doubt that the ESB has a vibrant future ahead.  Given its prominence and central role in the Irish energy sector, ESB has a crucial contribution to make in the challenges ahead.

As part of its analysis, the NPPB's advisors carried out an extensive consultation with stakeholders both within the postal sector and outside it with a view to arriving at a postcode model that best meets the needs of the stakeholders and measures the likely costs and benefits of the introduction, promotion and maintenance of such a postcode.After consideration of the matter in May this year, the Government decided that further analysis and quantification of the wider economic and societal benefits of postcodes would be required.  Subsequently, the commitment to introduce a postcode system in Ireland was contained in the Programme for Government 2007-2012 and I am currently considering the issues involved in order to progress the project which I believe will play a vital role in the development of a modern communications network for the country.

The provision of smart metering technology will allow customers to manage their own demand for electricity and reduce their bills.  In this way, smart metering is a key strategy for promoting efficient use of electricity and reducing the amount of electricity we generate, particularly at peak times.  This, in turn, would lead to reductions in both the costs of generating electricity, which is at its most expensive at peak times and in the levels of harmful emissions produced by that generation. Smart metering will also assist in the further development of micro generation, by facilitating the export of micro generated electricity, and the development of distributed generation.The implementation of smart metering is being led, at my request, by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and overseen by a High level Steering Group comprising My Department, CER, Sustainable Energy Ireland, ESB Networks (ESBN) and an Independent Operators representative.Technical Working Groups, with wider industry representation, are being established by the CER, and will be operational from January next to address all relevant issues such as tariffing, networks, data management and the optimal geographic distribution for the first phase roll out.  ESB Networks has initiated the procurement process for smart meters and anticipates test meters will be available by mid 2008. ESBN plans an ambitious roll out of meters to begin in summer 2008 with a view to meeting the target of 25,000 meters installed by years end.At this early stage the best estimate available for the cost of the first phase roll out of 25,000 meters is €10m. The initial estimate for the full network roll out is of the order of €600m under the Networks Investment Programme, which is regulated by the CER.

The Green Paper which was launched in October 2006 for a period of public consultation, outlined the options for future energy policy, including the competitiveness of energy supply.The Green Paper signalled the need for structural change in the electricity Sector.  The Green Paper also stated clearly that it was the Government's intention to retain a strong, commercially viable ESB and that the Government did not intend to privatise or atomise the ESB.  The policy directions set out in the White Paper are fully consistent with these positions.The Green Paper also stated that it was the Government's firm view that strategic electricity assets should be retained in State ownership for the long term.  The decision to transfer the transmission assets to EirGrid as the State-Owned independent system operator is fully in line with this position.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	423	My recent decision not to grant Prospecting Licences to two companies which would have allowed them to search for uranium in Donegal was taken after careful consideration.  The most likely end use of any uranium extracted here would be for nuclear electricity generation.  It would not be consistent, therefore, to permit the extraction of uranium for use in nuclear reactors in other countries, while Ireland is opposed to the use of electricity generated by nuclear power in Ireland.In granting a Prospecting Licence to search for any mineral, the clear understanding is that if a commercial discovery is identified, the Licence holder will be able to proceed with an application to mine the deposit.  It follows then, that it would not be right to allow an exploration company to carry on searching for a mineral when it is our clear policy not to allow extraction of that mineral.I do not see that this decision conflicts with the idea of a debate on nuclear energy which I hope can take place within the Oireachtas Committee system.  The debate should allow deputies or outside parties argue the case for an alternative policy position to the existing statutory ban on electricity generated by nuclear power in Ireland.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	424	The Government attaches the highest priority to the development of electricity interconnection between Ireland and other EU Member States.  The Energy Policy Framework underlines this commitment, which will contribute to security of supply and competitiveness.  Greater interconnection between Member States is also a key priority for the European Union to ensure the effective working of the Internal Market.I can advise the deputy that EirGrid is currently at an advanced stage in the planning of the second North South electricity interconnector with Northern Ireland, which will more than double the current cross-border power transfer capacity to over 600 megawatts (MW) and of the 500 MW East West electricity interconnector with Great Britain. While the immediate focus is on the delivery of the North South and East West electricity interconnectors, no later than 2012, EirGrid will be undertaking in the short term the necessary cost benefit analysis  and feasibility planning for further interconnection with the UK and potentially with Europe.The work that EirGrid is currently undertaking, together with the Commission for Energy Regulation, in planning and developing the East West interconnector will be clearly relevant to the development of further interconnection options, particularly in terms of appropriate technologies and projected costs.Enhanced interconnection with the UK in the first instance will improve both the competitiveness and the security of Irish energy supplies through access to one of the most highly developed energy markets in Europe.  The UK market is in turn linked to the wider European energy markets by both gas and electricity interconnectors and has recently invested heavily in additional import infrastructure including Liquefied Natural Gas terminals.Connected wind capacity will reach over 900 MW by year end, which will represent a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of 2007.  It is also a priority to ensure the provision of flexible generation plant to accommodate electricity coming on to the system from wind generation.  The successful establishment of the All Island Single Electricity Market will contribute to ensuring the security, reliability and competitiveness of electricity supplies throughout the island.

Far from there being a shortfall for energy efficiency initiatives in Budget 2008, I announced additional funding for insulation, energy building rating schemes together with the energy efficiency programme for SMEs.  This is in line with the Government's commitment to radically enhance energy efficiency in the interests of environmental sustainability and competitiveness.  I am making some €63 million in total available in 2008 for energy conservation measures, together with a further €13 million for energy research and development initiatives.  The €63 million funding for energy conservation measures, which is more than twice the original 2007 REV allocation for this area, will fund Sustainable Energy Ireland's programmes in the area of energy efficiency and renewable energy.  These include the House of Tomorrow Programme, the Public Sector Programme, the Industry Programme, the Low Income Housing Programme, the Greener Homes Scheme and many other smaller programmes.The separate Subhead entitled "Energy Efficiency Initiatives" exclusively relates to the funding for the National energy efficiency awareness campaign, Power of One.  The level of funding of €2.5 million in this subhead will meet the remaining contractual commitment in 2008 for the Power of One campaign, which was launched in 2006.  Some €4.9 million has been spent on the campaign in 2007.  The overall contractual commitment for 2006–2008 is €10 million.

A number of large scale public good energy infrastructure projects have been identified in the Programme. These projects include the construction of the East/West electricity interconnector, the construction of a second North/South interconnector, enhanced security of gas interconnection through strengthening the Ireland/Scotland gas link and strategic oil and gas storage.Because of the scale, strategic importance and immediacy of national energy needs, the Government will consider the possibility of an Exchequer contribution to fund, where appropriate and on a case by case basis, certain energy infrastructure projects over the period of the National Development Plan.  Any decisions in this regard will be a matter for the Government.The possibility of an Exchequer contribution to the cost of the East West Interconnector project is currently under consideration.  The technical and financial details of a business case in this regard are being developed by EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation together with my Department.  The question of Exchequer funding to support potential projects on gas interconnection reinforcement and strategic oil and gas storage will be explored as part of the decision making process for such projects at the appropriate time.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market that is regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.The role of the Government is to formulate regulatory and infrastructure policies to facilitate the provision of high quality telecommunications services by competing private sector service providers.  The widespread provision of broadband services has been a priority for Government.There has been very significant progress in the broadband market.  A recent report from the OECD shows that Ireland has the strongest per capita subscriber growth in the OECD, with Ireland adding 6.6 subscribers per 100 inhabitants during the past year, far ahead of the OECD average of 3.65 per 100 inhabitants.  ComReg's report for quarter 3 of 2007, published yesterday, highlighted continuing strong growth in terms of broadband subscribers.  There are now almost 800,000 subscribers which is an increase of 13.7% on the previous quarter.  In addition my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In order to address this issue the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is currently under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ))  is now complete, and four candidates have pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.The Department has invited these remaining candidates to participate in the "Competitive Dialogue" phase of the procurement process and to present their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.The matter of the speed of broadband services is, in the first instance, one for the service providers.  Worldwide, the telecommunications sector is focusing its investment plans on what has become known as Next Generation Networks (NGNs), which are likely to see the delivery of higher-bandwidth broadband services over fibre-optic infrastructure.  I understand many of the services providers in Ireland are formulating plans for the rollout of NGNs.  It is important that service providers understand their customers' positions and I welcome the contributions being made by various commentators in that regard.My Department is currently considering policy options in relation to the optimum role for Government in encouraging and facilitating the planning and rollout of next generation broadband in Ireland, including how existing Government owned infrastructure, and possible future Government investment, could help achieve national policy objectives in this area.  A policy paper is being drafted in this regard.  I will shortly be announcing an Advisory Forum of experts to critique the draft policy paper, following which, I will publish for consultation.

I share Minister Hutton's belief in the vast potential for renewable energy in these islands, and we also share a clear determination to play our national roles in meeting the EU target of 20% renewable energy by 2020.  I will be meeting my UK colleagues in the near future.  Our respective ambitious plans to radically develop renewable energy sources will be top of the agenda.I am committed to accelerated growth of renewable energy sources.  The range of measures already in place to incentivise and support that growth will continue to be enhanced and developed.  Ocean Energy, Solar Energy and Offshore Wind all have major potential and the Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government are committed to their development through incentivisation and systematically addressing the technical challenges.  I will be working with all the stakeholders and the renewable energy industry, including the offshore wind sector, in the coming months to put in place the necessary frameworks to meet the challenges and opportunities for renewable technologies in the short to medium term.

In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include providing grant-aid under the recently concluded Group Broadband Scheme and investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Under the current phase of the MANs Programme construction has commenced on four MANs in County Kerry.  These MANs are being built in Castleisland, Killarney, Listowel and Tralee.  Once completed these four networks will be available to all service providers who may offer high speed broadband services.  Under the Group Broadband Scheme, grant aid was paid for the provision of broadband in the North Kerry and Sliabh Luchra areas of Co. Kerry.There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  Accordingly, the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete, and four candidates have pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.The Department has invited these remaining candidates to participate in the "Competitive Dialogue" phase of the procurement process and to present their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country.  It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.

The purpose of holding the event was to start a dialogue with the key players on innovation and job creation in the energy sector.Investment in clean and green energy technologies is growing worldwide.  Ireland's advantage in renewable natural resources such as wind and ocean energy creates the potential to benefit from such investment.   Our ambitious and essential targets for energy efficiency in the built environment and across the economy will also stimulate and support economic activity in the energy technology services and the building sector.Meeting the challenge of climate change and ensuring secure energy supplies into the future means adopting a radically different approach to our energy services.  I believe that these challenges are also tangible opportunities to generate significant economic activity in the energy services and green technology sectors, with clear benefits to the economy.This forum was the beginning of a process of regular engagement with the energy industry.  On 23 November I hosted a high-level discussion for senior members of the Irish and international finance community.  This was an opportunity for discussion and an exchange of views with the finance community on the investment climate in Ireland for sustainable energy.  I am planning a further energy innovation summit with the sector next March as part of a regular engagement and dialogue.  Enterprise Ireland will continue to be involved in the engagement.Exchequer assistance is currently targeted at promoting the development of the renewable energy sector by stimulating demand for renewable energy goods and services.  The Greener Homes scheme which has stimulated significant demand by householders has achieved a dramatic increase in renewable technology suppliers and a ten-fold expansion in the number of renewable energy products available on the market.

A study by Sustainable Energy Ireland, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Geological Survey of Northern Ireland and Geological Survey of Ireland (GSI) examining the potential for such storage on the island of Ireland is proceeding on schedule.  The results of this study is due to be submitted to the Department by end September next year and at that point I will then decide how best to proceed in the matter.An EPA-GSI project in the next 2 years will evaluate the prospect for potentially favourable sites in the Moneypoint region.  This study is due to be submitted to the Department by end 2009.  The GSI intends to affiliate to an active European network on geological storage of carbon to ensure we are fully aware of best practice on technical options relevant to Ireland.My Department is also participating in other EU and international fora where the potential for carbon capture and storage is being progressed.  The Commission's Strategic Energy Technology Plan was published on 22 November, setting out a proposed roadmap for energy research for the period to 2020.  It sets out a number of key EU technology challenges for the next ten years including a CO2 capture, transport and storage project of industrial scale.  I have welcomed, in principle, the overall direction of the plan. The question of legislative underpinning for geological storage of carbon will be kept under review in light of developments.

Furthermore, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for operating and monitoring the scheme here with participants being legally obliged to report their emissions levels on an annual basis to the EPA.Under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme, installations are granted a certain level of allowances and are required to either mitigate their emissions or purchase allowances for any emissions above the level of allowances.  Accordingly, it is a matter for the individual electricity generating stations to decide on the most cost effective mix of abatement measures for their business.The Government has already decided, in the context of the preparation of Ireland's second National Allocation Plan under the scheme, that the emissions trading sector as a whole will be responsible for making approximately 3 million tonnes annual reductions in greenhouse gases out of the approximately 7 million tonnes per annum reductions needed to enable Ireland to meet its Kyoto target over the period 2008 to 2012, after existing abatement measures have been taken into account.  Research work being carried out by the GSI and others is also examining the potential future location of underground storage of carbon dioxide from fossil fuel power plants.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	439	The Cabinet Handbook provides that before Government approval for the drafting of legislation can be sought, Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA) must be carried out.  RIA is an assessment of the likely effects of a proposed new regulatory change.  It involves a detailed analysis to ascertain whether or not the new regulation would have the desired impact.  In cases where significant impacts or costs are involved, a full RIA must be carried out and this should include consideration of possible alternatives to regulation such as a tax or information campaign or an alternative form of regulation such as self-regulation or co-regulation.In line with the commitments contained in Towards 2016, an independent Review of the operation of Regulatory Impact Analysis commenced on 31 October, 2007.  The Review, which is expected to be completed early in the new year, will look at the extent to which alternatives to regulation have been considered.The focus on Better Regulation means that we now have the tools and systems in place to facilitate a much more considered approach to regulation.  This provides for a greater emphasis on whether desired policy outcomes can best be achieved through regulatory or alternative means.  Where we do regulate, there is now a greater understanding of the impacts involved and the importance of quality regulation.  This leads to a more balanced regulatory environment and appropriate regulatory outcomes.

The company is engaged from 1 October, 2007 for a minimum of 20 days over 6 months.  To date, payments amounting to €23,958 have been made.  The advice provided to date will be used by the Review Team in its work over the period ahead.  Boyd Freeman Design to develop a logo.  The cost amounted to €598.95.RA Consulting was engaged on 1 November, 2007 to design and conduct an Employee Opinion Survey for the staff of my Department.  The use of consultants helps to assure staff of the confidentiality of the survey and the independence of its findings.  A report on these findings is expected shortly, which will help us in developing our new HR Strategy.  The project does not relate to capital expenditure.  The cost of the contract is €18,101, including VAT.The Taskforce on Active Citizenship conducted consultations and presented a set of recommendations to Government in March 2007 which included proposals to improve policies that promote a continued sense of community and greater engagement with civic and democratic processes.  There was no capital expenditure incurred in this project.  A Steering Group, chaired by Mary Davis, is being established to oversee the work of the Active Citizenship Office as it prepares an implementation plan, in consultation with relevant stakeholders.In December 2006, the Government approved the initiation of a major Review by the OECD of the Irish Public Service.  The objectives of this Review are to benchmark the Public Service in Ireland against other comparable countries and secondly, to make recommendations as to future directions for Public Service reform which will support the Government's drive for delivery of world class services to the citizen and contribute to sustainable national competitive advantage.  A High Level Steering Group of senior officials, chaired by the Secretary General of my Department, is overseeing the Review.This is the first comprehensive review of the Public Service — as a system — ever undertaken in this country.  Given that this is the first whole of Public Service Review undertaken by the OECD, the work is very extensive and requires developing new approaches and working methods.  In order for the OECD to develop a holistic approach to reviewing the Public Service as an entity and to apply it in the first instance to Ireland, the Government agreed to increase its contribution to the OECD on a once-off basis by €490,000, to be paid over two years — 2006 and 2007. This Review will assist us in mapping out a new phase of the change and modernisation programme building on the significant change which has already occurred.  It is expected that the Review will be completed and published early in 2008.  This advice does not relate to capital expenditure.Fitzpatrick Associates were employed at the end of 2006 to undertake an evaluation of Customer Charters across the Civil Service.  Their brief was to evaluatethe quality of Charters across Government Departments and Offices;the visibility and accessibility of Charters; andtheir effectiveness.They were also required to recommend actions to improve the process and enhance the delivery of service to Civil Service Customers.  The report of the evaluation was presented to Government on 25 July, 2007.  On foot of the report, the Government established a Task Force on Customer Service to implement the recommendations of the Report.  The work also fed into the revision of Guidelines for the Preparation of Customer Charters and Customer Action Plans. These guidelines are currently being finalised and will be distributed across the Civil and Public Service in the coming weeks.  The cost of the consultancy was €57,838.  This advice does not relate to capital expenditure.Ms Isolde Goggin and Ms Gillian Lauder are undertaking a review of the operation of Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA).  The cost of this consultancy will be €108,900.  The final report is expected early 2008.  This advice does not relate to capital expenditure.Goodbody's Economic Consultants were engaged by my Department in March 2006 to provide economic support to Government Departments and Offices for the application of Regulatory Impact Analysis.  This advice was on an ongoing basis and the contract finished in 2007.  The cost of this consultancy was €29,040.  This advice does not relate to capital expenditure.The National Economic and Social Development Office (NESDO) comes under the aegis of my Department.  It consists of the National Economic and Social Council, (NESC), the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP).

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	441	Significant progress has been made in the area of statute law revision and reform in recent years.  The ultimate goal is to create a modern and streamlined Irish Statute Book which is more accessible to the citizen and to business.  The Statute Law Revision Act, 2007 provided for the repeal of 3,225 obsolete Acts which predated Irish independence.  The Act builds on the Statute Law Revision Act, 2005 under which more than 200 obsolete acts were repealed.  The current phase of the Statute Law Revision Project, focusing on Local, Personal and Private Acts, will see the completion of analysis of all pre-1922 primary legislation and the availability of a complete list of such legislation which remains in force.The focus to date of the Statute Law Revision Project on pre-1922 legislation has been a necessary first step in creating a modern Statute Book, but it is not an end in itself.  This phase has cleared away the deadwood of thousands of redundant and obsolete Acts that were clogging the Statute Book.The next phase of the project will allow us to focus on the remaining extant pre-1922 legislation and post-1922 legislation and to see clearly what now needs to be repealed and re-enacted in modern, consolidated form.  Good progress has already been made in this regard, with consolidation underway in key policy areas such as Land Law and Conveyancing; Liquor Licensing; Companies Law and Financial Services.  In addition, the Law Reform Commission is undertaking a programme of Statute Law Restatement, which will serve to make post-1922 legislation more accessible by providing, in the case of selected Acts, a single up-to-date text including all amendments.  This process of Restatement will also facilitate future consolidation and modernisation of legislation.I agree that the focus of future efforts should be on post-1922 legislation and particularly on the consolidation and modernisation of legislation in key areas.  It is a matter for each Minister to bring forward proposals in relation to legislation under his or her aegis and I strongly support further efforts in this regard.

The demolition of part of one of the buildings was done to remove planning risk, which would create greater certainty for the buyer and thus greater value for the exchequer in terms of the purchase price paid.  Having consulted with the relevant bodies, we are satisfied that the portion of the building which we retained on site contains the majority of the most architecturally valuable features.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	444	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Customs Service has primary responsibility for the implementation of drugs enforcement controls at all airports and private airfields/ aerodromes in the State.  I presume that the Deputy is referring to customs controls in place at the airfields and aerodromes outside of our three major international community airports at Dublin, Cork and Shannon.The Revenue Commissioners have informed me that Customs controls at such airfields/aerodromes are risk-based and are carried out by mobile Customs Enforcement Officers.  Attendance by these Officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators.  Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  Flights with origins and destinations with a high risk-rating would attract particular interest.  These attendances cover the full range of flight times and are kept under constant review in particular to take account of emerging smuggling trends and any traffic increases at these airfields.Since the beginning of 2007 there were 422 visits by Customs Enforcement Officers to such airfields/aerodromes.  Drug detector dog teams were also deployed.  There were 15 seizures of controlled drugs.  All of these were small "own use" quantities and none were for supply.In addition to drugs enforcement work, other duties are undertaken by officers in attending airfields/aerodromes including controls against the smuggling of excise products, the clearance of aircraft and passengers arriving from third countries, spot checks on EU flights, the verification of fuel drawback claims, the verification of end-use authorisations, clearance of aircraft under transfer of residence, and checks on private aircraft to ensure compliance with import procedures.It is important to note by way of context that the operating environment for Customs has been shaped to a significant degree by the introduction of the Internal Market and the related principles of freedom of movement within the EU.  Of specific relevance are the abolition of routine and systematic Customs checks on goods and passengers moving within any part of the EU and the elimination of Customs controls on the baggage of intra-Community passengers other than for anti-smuggling checks.  This is particularly relevant in the case of these airfields/aerodromes where passenger traffic is predominantly intra-Community. In fact some of the smaller ones had no international flights.  In this context, Revenue's approach has of necessity been to balance the freedom of movement principle in regard to people and goods with the need to control smuggling and enforce prohibitions and restrictions.The Revenue Commissioners assure me that having regard to the context set out above, they are satisfied that their risk-based approach remains valid and their operations are on a par with, and may even exceed, those of many other EU Member States.  I am also assured by the Revenue Commissioners of their strong commitment to playing their part in combating smuggling and criminal activity without unduly impeding legitimate international travellers or international trade.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	449	It is presumed the Deputy is referring to the costs relative to the old residential stamp duty rules which were in place prior to Budget 2008.  These costs are a function of the actual and estimated number of transactions and the price levels at which these transactions take place, and are therefore sensitive to cyclical changes in the housing market.The estimated cost of restructuring stamp duty for only non-first time residential buyers where there is 0% for transactions of up to €100,000, 5% on the next €350,000 and 9% on the balance would be of the order of €400m and €320m on the basis of transactions in 2006 and 2007, respectively.The estimated cost of restructuring stamp duty for only non-first time residential buyers where there is 0% for transactions of up to €125,000, 7% on the next €875,000 and 9% on the balance would be of the order of €285m and €240m on the basis of transactions in 2006 and 2007, respectively.The Deputy should note that the costs of the Stamp Duty changes introduced in Budget 2008 took into account an assumption that there will be lower levels of activity in the housing market next year as compared to the exceptional levels of activity that have been evident in more recent years.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the available information in respect of the number of cars (new and used) imported into Ireland for the years 2005, 2006 and the period 1 January to 30 November 2007 is as follows:Year2005New171,881Used41,801Total213,6822006New178,265Used56,327Total234,5922007New186,323(Jan to Nov)Used56,864Total243,187I am also advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the amount of Vehicle Registration Tax which might be under-declared on cars imported to the State between 2005 and 2007 is fully quantifiable only by reference to the detection of the particular offence in each and every case.  Revenue enforcement officers, who are based at numerous locations around the country, carry out regular and ongoing checks to identify and deal with breaches of VRT legislation involving under-declarations.  Their officers engage regularly in operations, including multi agency operations, which are targeted at high-risk areas of VRT evasion.  These operations can result in warning notices being issued to individuals who appear to have been late in registering their vehicles, or in seizure of the vehicles where significant and intended under-declaration of VRT is encountered.  In these latter cases the vehicle may be returned on payment of the under-declared VRT together with a penalty, or in some instances prosecution can result.As a result of operations in 2005, 1,195 warning notices were issued and this resulted in payments of VRT totalling €3,380,627.  In addition, 927 vehicles were seized during 2005 and resulted in payments of VRT and penalties totalling €3,866,375.  In 2006, 1,955 warning notices were issued which resulted in €5,309,272 in VRT being collected.  In addition 999 vehicles were seized during 2006 with €1,844,609 in VRT and penalties being recovered.  In 2007 to date, 1,944 warning notices were issued and resulted in VRT payments of €5,937,497.  In addition 1,016 vehicles were seized resulting in €1,223,726 in VRT and penalties being paid.  In a special operation in the last few days, 103 vehicles were seized and it is estimated that the revenue at risk is around €500,000.  In 2005 there were 23 convictions for VRT related offences.  In 2006 there were 8 convictions and 16 convictions in 2007.

The Office of Public Works acts as agent for my Department in developing crèches around the country for the children of civil servants as part of an initiative by the Government to improve childcare provision and increase the number of childcare places available in Ireland. The Interim Board of the Civil Service Childcare Agency (the Board) manages the Initiative. Operators are appointed by the Board following a tendering process. These operators must manage the crèches on a commercial basis.At present there are six crèches in operation under this Initiative — providing around 170 full-time childcare places. The crèches are located in Mount Street and Marlborough Street in Dublin and in Ennis, Athlone, Sligo and Backweston, Celbridge.Building work commenced on 16th April 2007 on a 135 place crèche at Mahon in Cork. It is expected that this crèche will be completed early next year and open for business in September 2008.As of 1st January 2008, fees in the Dublin area will be babies €189 per week, toddlers €179 per week and Montessori €163 per week.  Fees outside Dublin will be babies €160 per week and toddlers €140 per week. Other rates used by the crèches such as a daily rate etc, are calculated on a pro rata basis.  The Civil Service Childcare Initiative introduced in 2001 is currently undergoing a Value for Money and Policy Review which is due for completion early 2008.

Securitisation SPVs are as a general rule unaffiliated in terms of their ownership structure. It is an essential function of these SPVs that they are not owned by the originating institution; this allows the investor to rely on the asset within the SPV, and protects the investor from any risk of exposure to the originating institution.As these SPVs are not in the ownership of the originating institution it is a normal feature that they would be held by a charitable trust structure, established for the purpose of holding the equities in the SPV.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that they are aware that in a typical securitisation transaction it is common practice for the shares in the SPV to be owned by a charitable trust. The Revenue Commissioners are not aware of the number of such trusts nor the contribution that such trusts make to charities. These trusts are not within the exempt charity regime, and are chargeable to tax under the normal rules relating to trusts.The taxation of securitisation companies is governed by section 110 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Such companies are charged to corporation tax at 25%. The normal rate of tax for trading companies is 12.5%. There are 1,057 companies which have notified the Revenue Commissioners that they qualify for treatment under Section 110.Appropriate company law and other provisions apply to these structures, and the institutions arranging and originating the SPVs are generally regulated by the Financial Regulator or its equivalent in other jurisdictions.

The Steward's House was recently refurbished to provide additional guest accommodation as part of the overall Farmleigh complex but separate from the main house.  The Steward's House is an integral part of the Farmleigh Estate and it was included as part of the purchase of Farmleigh by the State in 1999. Much of the renovation work was done by the building maintenance service of the Office of Public Works as part of its ongoing programme of works. External contracts directly associated with the renovation work amounted to €568,076 inclusive of VAT. In addition, direct landscaping contracts came to €30,748 inclusive of VAT.  Since it became available for use, one group of 3 guests, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and two others, were accommodated in Steward's House for 2 days and 2 nights.

Accordingly, I have no data on the extent of usage of such instruments. If the Deputy has a concern about a specific instrument, I shall be happy to make further enquiries on the Deputy's behalf. The Deputy's question may relate to concerns arising from the international subprime difficulties and investments in so-called "complex financial instruments" by some financial services entities. A survey of the exposures of Irish banks published in the Financial Stability Report shows that the domestic banking system has no significant direct exposures to US subprime mortgages and essentially negligible exposures through investments and through links with other financial companies or special purpose vehicles.    Accordingly, the stability and health of the banking system here remain robust as assessed by the usual indicators of financial health such as asset quality, profitability, solvency, liquidity and credit ratings.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the threshold relating to the restriction on the use of tax reliefs by high income individuals, which I announced in Budget 2006 and which took effect on 1 January 2007.While preliminary tax payments will have been received for 2007, income tax returns, which will demonstrate the effect of the restriction, are not due to be made until late 2008. It will be some time after that before the statistics the Deputy has asked for will be available.The restriction on the use of tax reliefs is designed to address the issue of a small number of individuals with high incomes who, mainly by means of the cumulative use of various tax incentive reliefs, have been able to reduce their income tax liability to a very low level or to zero. Such individuals are no longer able to do so. The aim of the restriction is to raise the effective income tax rate of high income individual affected by the measure towards 20 per cent. This is achieved because the total amount of relief an individual can obtain from the specified reliefs is limited to 50 per cent of his or her adjusted income. This means that a minimum of one half of the individual's income will be taxed, mostly at the 41 per cent rate. Allowing for the standard rate band, this is equivalent to a 20 per cent tax charge on the individual's full income.The method used to increase the tax rates at which these high income individuals pay tax effectively addresses the equity concerns raised over the past number of years while, at the same time, ensuring that the intended incentive effects of tax schemes will continue to deliver.

Because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers, a figure for the highest amount of exempt income returned is not provided in relation to individual amounts exceeding €1 million. This is due to the small numbers of returns with amounts exceeding that level. Data is available only on gross, not net, income in the returns. Such income will now be subject to tax from 31 July 2008.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that its Large Cases Division looks after the tax affairs of high wealth individuals.  The 2005 income tax returns show that 19 of these individuals filed returns on which they claimed non-residency for Irish tax purposes.I am further advised by the Revenue Commissioners that residence is a feature of its risk-based programmes and that the procedures adopted in validating non-resident status depend on the circumstances in each case. The administration of the validation procedures is a matter for the Commissioners and the methods used to verify claims to non-residence include a range of tests and an intelligence-based dimension which, for obvious reasons, is not publicised.In relation to work carried out as part of its risk-based programmes, Revenue has previously advised me that it has no reason to conclude that there are failures to comply with the rules governing non-resident status.  However, Revenue continues to include a cross-section of non-resident cases in its risk-based programmes.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that Irish citizens, who are non-resident for tax purposes, are obliged to file Irish tax returns only in respect of:income arising in Ireland (e.g. income from directorships, a trade or profession, rented properties etc); andGains from the disposals of land, buildings or shares which derive their value from these assets, and certain other assets such as minerals in the State or other assets related to exploitation of such minerals.There is no statutory obligation on these citizens to return details of income or gains arising anywhere else in the world. Therefore, it is not possible to establish the amount of these incomes or gains, including any associated tax.

The Strategy builds on a strong equality framework, which is reflected in several pieces of equality legislation. The main elements of the Strategy are:The Disability Act 2005;The Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004;Six Outline Sectoral Plans published by Government Departments;The Citizens Information Act 2007The Disability Act 2005The Disability Act 2005 is a central element of the National Disability Strategy. The Act is a positive measure designed to advance and underpin participation by people with disabilities in everyday life.Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 was commenced on 1st June 2007 for children aged under 5. This gives people with disabilities an entitlement to an independent assessment of health and education needs and a service statement identifying the services to be delivered. A system of complaints and appeals has also been established. An assessment based on the needs of a client, independent of the costs of the provision of service, will be provided. The HSE will prepare a service statement outlining the services to be provided to the person. This is a very welcome significant step towards enhancing the level of support to people with disabilities.It is the first time that an independent assessment of need, conducted according to standards laid down and monitored by an independent agency, the Health Information and Quality Authority, will be available. The Act will also give us an accurate picture of service provision and of areas for improvement across the system.The assessment of need process is a matter for the HSE and I have referred this matter to the HSE who will be in a position to provide information in terms of the numbers involved.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	473	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will have a weekly subvention paid to the service in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service.  However, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  When I announced the new scheme in July of this year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was forwarded to my Office in November and December.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review has been completed and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government: the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents; services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place; where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year; special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required; in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced.As a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which would otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding will be conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has been approved for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS), and a letter of approval has issued from the Childcare Directorate of my Office.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Groups under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.

In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card. The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, childcare and travel to work costs. In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards. These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy. My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

The commencement of the new provisions has the effect of repealing all the old legislation relating to registration of marriages dating back to 1845.Under the 2004 Act, primary responsibility for the provision of civil registration services locally, including solemnisation of civil marriages at venues other than the registrar's office, rests with the Health Service Executive (HSE). The Act also provides that an tArd Chlaraitheoir (Registrar General) exercises a supervisory role in relation to the provision of services by the HSE. I understand that certain difficulties have arisen in relation to the filling of staff vacancies in the Eastern Registration Area, and that an tArd Chlaraitheoir is seeking a meeting with the HSE to discuss the matter.

Represented on the Review Group are the HSE, the HSE — Employers Agency, the Department of Health and Children, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, the Department of Finance and the Irish Dental Association (IDA). The Group is chaired by Mr Finbar Flood.During the course of the review, based on legal advice by the HSE, a legal issue arose in relation to the Competition Act, 2002 and the collective negotiation of fees with the IDA. The HSE was advised that the coming together of the DTSS contractors under the auspices of the IDA to negotiate fees would constitute a breach of the Act. The IDA was advised of the legal situation and,  in January 2007, discussions on the fee aspects of the review were temporarily put on hold. It is clear now from discussions between officials of my Department and the Attorney General's Office, that there are complex legal difficulties associated with the traditional process for the negotiation of professional fees and that a new approach, in line with Competition Law, must be found. Accordingly, officials in my Department are working with the Attorney General's office to clarify the way forward.

This eligibility status is applicable in respect of services in all HSE regions and administrative arrangements are in place to enable a person, for example, to access general practitioner or pharmacy services as necessary in any part of the country.The HSE has drawn up standard National Medical Card Assessment Guidelines to ensure that all persons applying for a medical card are assessed in a fair and equitable manner.  I am also informed by the Executive that national business processes have been developed to enable a model of best practice to be adopted for the processing of medical card applications, including the initial application stage, the assessment stage and the decision making stage.Before the establishment of the HSE, some variation in practice had developed over time, between the individual health boards, in relation to the provision of certain community services and the range of such services available.  These arrangements will be reviewed in the context of the ongoing development of primary care services and the legislative proposals being prepared by my Department to clarify and update existing legislation on eligibility for health and personal social services.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	491	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will have a weekly subvention paid to the service in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service.  However, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  When I announced the new scheme in July of this year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was forwarded to my Office in November and December.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review has been completed and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced.as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which would otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding will be conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the Group in question has applied to enter the new scheme and a letter has issued from the Childcare Directorate of my Office requesting them to forward outstanding information.  When this is received a letter of approval for transitional funding under the NCIP Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) will issue.  This funding will, for the first six months of 2008, be based on the level of funding currently being provided to the Groups under the EOCP staffing support grant scheme and subject to the necessary contractual arrangement with Pobal, who manage the day to day operation of the EOCP and NCIP.

Of course, in any instance where a critical or essential vacancy arises it may be filled through redeployment of existing staff by the Line Manager or re-assignment of responsibilities based on assessment of priority need.Notwithstanding this, it has been recognised that there are some circumstances where appointment of staff may be necessary in frontline services.  Accordingly, a process has been put in place by the HSE to evaluate, monitor and approve requests for derogation from the general recruitment pause.  A small group has been established including a representative of the National Hospitals Office, PCCC and other Directorates and this group meets regularly to consider such applications.Of the applications for derogation received to date, 860 w.t.e.s have been approved where posts have been identified as critical to service delivery.I have been advised by the HSE that the recruitment pause will continue for December 2007 and the current arrangement will be reviewed prior to the end of the year.  It is intended that a robust employment control framework will continue to be applied to services in 2008.I have also been advised by the HSE that career breaks are granted under the terms of the Career Break Scheme as set out in the HSE Terms and Conditions of Employment.  Employees applying for a career break are normally required to sign that they accept these terms and conditions.  Under the provisions of the scheme, "if a suitable vacancy does not exist at the date of the termination of the career break, an employee is guaranteed re-employment within twelve months, i.e. an unpaid period of up to twelve months could ensue upon termination of the date of the career break."

The table below shows the number of persons, according to the health boards' databases, with medical cards as a proportion of the national population on the dates requested by the Deputy.In interpreting this information, it is necessary to take account of the fact that the HSE (and before 2005 the health boards) has undertaken a substantial programme of work in recent years to improve data quality in the General Medical Services (GMS) client database.  For example, in 2003 and 2004, work carried out by the health boards led to a deletion of approximately 104,000 inappropriate entries where, for example, there were duplicate entries for the same person, the expiry date on the card had passed, the person had moved away or was deceased.  This exercise did not involve any reduction in the actual number of persons who held medical cards but rather resulted in a more accurate picture of the number of individuals in receipt of GP services under the GMS Scheme.YearNational PopulationNo. of medical card holdersProportion of National Population with Medical Cards1992 (as at 31st December 1992)3,547,6001,263,00135.60%1997 (as at 31st December 1997)3,626,0871,219,85233.64%2002 (as at 31st December 2002)3,917,3361,164,45329.73%2007 (as at 1st December 2007)4,339,000

In all other cases an assessment is undertaken having regard to the applicant's means.Information provided by the Health Service Executive (HSE) to my Department indicates that as of 1st December 2007, 131,668 persons aged 70 or over have received a medical card under the provisions of Section 45 (5A) of the Health Act 1970.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	503	As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP) and the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), which are being implemented by the Office of the Minister for Children.The main supports the Government makes available to parents to assist them with their childcare costs are Child Benefit and the Early Childcare Supplement.  The latter payment is the responsibility of my Office, and it alone amounts to expenditure of over €400m in a full year.  These payments are universal and benefit all parents, regardless of their income, labour market status or the type of childcare they choose.  In addition to these universal supports, Government childcare policy has also recognised the need to target additional supports towards disadvantaged families.Under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006 (EOCP), which is co-funded under the EU Social Fund (ESF), targeted support was provided through the staffing support grant scheme whereby community based not-for-profit childcare providers with a strong focus on disadvantage were awarded grant aid towards their staffing costs to allow them to operate reduced fees to disadvantaged parents.  Funding under this scheme was originally awarded for a limited period during which services were expected to move towards sustainability.  This funding was subsequently continued to the end of 2007, where it was considered necessary to enable services to continue to make their services accessible to disadvantaged parents.  This continuation funding was subject to the condition that tiered fee structures were implemented by the services in question.With the closure of the EOCP in December 2007, to continue to support community childcare services to provide affordable childcare to disadvantaged parents, the Community Childcare Subvention Scheme (CCSS) is being introduced from January 2008 under the Exchequer funded National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor programme to the EOCP.  The CCSS has been allocated €153 million over the next 3 years, representing a 16% increase in funding over the EOCP staffing scheme, and will continue to support community childcare services to provide reduced childcare fees for disadvantaged parents, complementing the universal supports in place for all parents.  Under the new scheme, it will be possible to ensure that the level of grant aid which individual services qualify for will reflect the actual level of service they provide and the profile of the parents benefiting from their service.  As part of their application for funding under the new scheme, services are required to ask parents using their services to complete a simple declaration form which is to be included in a return to my Office and on which basis the level of subvention for each service will be determined.  The subvention received by services will, in turn, be reflected in the reduced fees for parents who qualify as disadvantaged under the scheme.In practice, this will mean that parents with children in such services and in receipt of most social welfare payments (or participating in a scheme such as Community Employment which demonstrates an underlying entitlement to same) or parents in receipt of Family Income Supplement (FIS), will have a weekly subvention paid to the service in respect of their child.  A higher subvention will be paid where the subvented child is a baby, in recognition of the higher costs associated with the care of children aged under 1 year.  Parents who do not qualify for subvention will be charged the cost price for their childcare service.  However, as community not-for-profit services will, generally, have availed of capital grant aid under the EOCP or NCIP removing the requirement to cover rent or a mortgage, and as the services are run on a not-for-profit basis, this should still be significantly below the market price.It is considered that the new scheme will provide an effective framework for the continued targeting of additional resources towards disadvantaged parents and their children while continuing to support community childcare services generally.  The scheme has been informed by and takes account of a number of enhancements recommended by the report of the Value for Money Review of the EOCP.  These include the fact that the subvention to services will be more responsive to the level of service provided as well as the degree of parental disadvantage supported and the ceiling for funding, which existed under the previous scheme, is being removed.  Account will also be taken of all of the operational costs of the service rather than staffing costs alone.  Services, including full-time, part-time and sessional ones, which at present are, in some cases, inaccessibly priced for disadvantaged parents, will be available to them at more appropriate rates under the new scheme.The new scheme has clear advantages over its predecessor.  There is an increase in the level of funding available under it, and a majority of services will benefit from the changes it introduces.  Existing EOCP staffing grant recipients who enter the new scheme will continue to be funded at their current levels until July 2008.  My Office has engaged in a series of meetings with existing grant recipients to outline to them the details of the new scheme and to gather feedback from the services themselves.  A meeting with representatives of the City and County Childcare Committees has also taken place.Transitional arrangements have been made under which existing grant recipients will continue to be funded at their current levels until 1st July 2008.  This is to ensure that existing childcare services are facilitated to adjust to the new scheme, including making any adjustments necessary to their fee structures.  When I announced the new scheme in July of this year, I signalled my intention to undertake a review of the Scheme on the basis of the more detailed and comprehensive data which was forwarded to my Office in November and December.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that the review has been completed and the following adjustments to the scheme have been approved by the Government:the childcare subvention rates, which form the basis for assessing the level of grant funding payable to community childcare services, have been increased from €80 to €100 per week in the case of Band A parents and from €30 to €70 per week in the case of Band B parents;services will also be grant aided to enable them to provide reduced childcare fees for parents in Band C who are marginally above the Family Income Supplement (FIS) threshold and low income parents who qualify under this measure will benefit by €45 per week per full-time place;where a parent moves to a lower Band (e.g. from social welfare into employment), the subvention paid in respect of them will be withdrawn on a tapered basis with the effect that where a parent would no longer qualify for a Band A payment, he or she will be treated as a Band B parent in the following year;special provisions will be provided for in the case of childcare services where, for valid reasons, it is not possible to assess grant funding on the basis of annual parental declarations alone (e.g. women's refuges, special services for children of drug misusers) and, in exceptional cases, where special levels of funding provision may be required;in recognition of the on-going input of the community and voluntary sector, and to provide stability for services which would otherwise receive very low levels of grant subvention (e.g. small rural services) a minimum annual grant level of €20,000 is being introduced.as a transitional measure during 2008-2010, services which would otherwise face a significant decrease in their existing level of grant support from July 2008, will continue to receive grant aid equal to not less than 90% of their previous grant level during July-December 2008, equal to not less than 85% of that amount in 2009, and equal to not less than 75% of that amount in 2010.  The transitional grant funding will be conditional on all requirements of the Scheme being complied with including the return of annual applications together with completed parent declaration forms and the implementation of tiered fees based on the subvention levels for Band A, B and C parents.

The new vehicle standards will be given a statutory basis through revised regulations to be made by the Commission during 2008.It is proposed that the new requirements for wheelchair accessible taxis and wheelchair accessible hackneys will apply to all newly granted accessible vehicle licences from a date, to be determined, in 2008 and all existing accessible taxi licences from 1 January 2012.The Commission and my Department are currently in discussion in relation to a proposed subsidy arrangement that would assist taxi and hackney operators in purchasing wheelchair accessible vehicles, which by their nature will cost significantly more than standard saloon cars.The Commission has also made good progress on other commitments under the Department's Sectoral Plan Transport Access for All:(1)The Commission has indicated that it is proposed that Dispatch Operators will be licensed during 2008 and will have a number of standards to meet prior to licensing, including accessible booking processes which are reasonable and practicable.(2)A database of all licensed dispatch operators will be made available with contact details for booking small public service vehicles.(3)All of the Commission's publications are available in Braille and large print and a consumer information guide is available on the Commission website and can be provided in accessible formats on request.(4)A national complaints system is now in place and consumers can obtain a complaints form by telephoning the consumer line 1890 606090.

Cyprus did not hold a referendum. The Cypriot House of Representatives unanimously approved the Accession Treaty. In Bulgaria and Romania, which joined the European Union on 1 January 2007, the Accession Treaty was approved by parliamentary process in both countries.Each of the Union's current Member States were represented at, and fully participated in, the work of the European Convention which met from February 2002 and which laid the groundwork for the draft Constitutional Treaty. The Convention comprised of more than 200 representatives from the Member States, national parliaments and the EU institutions.The essential balance and substance of the draft Constitutional Treaty, which followed from the work of this representative Convention, is preserved in the Reform Treaty signed on 13 December. As a result, and given also of course the debates and reviews in the Parliaments of Member States by their elected representatives on the Reform Treaty, current Member States and their citizens have been facilitated in taking into account the principal developments and issues now incorporated in the Reform Treaty.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	526	As I informed the Deputy in my responses to Parliamentary Questions Number 517 on 26 September 2007 and Number 197 on 24 October 2007, relations between Ireland and Cuba have developed in recent years, particularly since the establishment of diplomatic relations in 1999. Our Ambassador in Mexico City is accredited to Cuba. In 2001, Cuba established a resident Embassy in Dublin, which has been headed by a resident Ambassador since October 2005. Prior to that the Embassy was headed at Chargé d'Affaires level, with the Cuban Ambassador to Ireland resident in London. The Cuban Chargé d'Affaires and, subsequently, the Cuban Ambassador have been very active in seeking to promote links between our two countries based, inter alia, on people-to-people contact and cultural activities.My Department and our Embassy in Mexico City also support the development of such links. In July 2005, the International Joyce exhibition, commissioned by my Department, was opened for display at the National Library in Havana and a donation of Spanish translations of the plays of Samuel Beckett was also presented on the occasion. And of course, many Irish people have visited Cuba in recent years. I welcome these developments and I would certainly wish to see the bilateral relationship between Ireland and Cuba develop further in 2008.As the Deputy will be aware, the European Union's 1996 Common Position on Cuba remains the basis of both the European Union's and Ireland's approach to relations with that country. The overriding objective of Ireland and our European Union partners in our relations with Cuba is to encourage, but not to enforce by external coercion, a process of transition to pluralist democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.The Common Position was most recently reviewed at the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 18 June 2007, at which I participated. The Council's Conclusions deplored the fact that the human rights situation in Cuba has not fundamentally changed, and noted that the Cuban Government continues to deny its citizens internationally recognised civil, political and economic rights and freedoms. We also recognised the right of Cuban citizens to decide independently about their future.While the European Union will continue to pursue its dialogue with Cuba's civil society and to offer to all sectors of society practical support towards peaceful change in Cuba, the Council also emphasised the Union's willingness to resume a comprehensive and open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities on all areas of mutual interest. In order to sound out the potential for such a dialogue, which should take place on a reciprocal and non-discriminatory basis, the Council decided to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels.The Council Conclusions represent a balanced approach, which is in accordance with the principles of the Common Position. The decision which we took in Council to invite a Cuban delegation to Brussels would provide an opportunity for establishing an open political dialogue with the Cuban authorities. The Cuban authorities have rejected this invitation. However, we remain hopeful that such a dialogue will be established in the future. In this regard, on foot of a further initiative of the European Union, a Ministerial-level meeting between the European Union Troika and Cuba was held en marge of the 62nd United Nations General Assembly in New York on 24 September 2007.

I was shocked by the sentences and by the context in which they were imposed. I regard any punishment by flogging as abhorrent, no matter where it takes place. Our overriding objective in making our views clearly heard on the issue was to ensure that the sentence was not carried out. I therefore very much welcome the announcement that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has pardoned the victim, recognising the trauma already suffered.As soon as I became aware of the case, I directed my officials to consult with our EU partners on the most effective possible intervention in the interests of the victims. We joined with partners in agreeing an immediate approach to the Saudi authorities, expressing our strong concerns. On behalf of the EU, the Portuguese Presidency raised the case with the Saudi Foreign Ministry, stressing our shock at the severity of the sentence, and the imperative need in such cases for physical and psychological support for the victims. The Presidency also emphasised the huge public concern about this case across the EU. Last week, I personally conveyed my concerns about the case to the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia.It is noteworthy that the verdict of the court in this case was also the subject of widespread discussion and publicly expressed disquiet within Saudi Arabia. This would have been highly unlikely a few years ago and in itself represents something of a positive development in relation to the human rights situation.

As the previous question asked about the last ten years, I have given details relating to this period.The Advisory Board for Irish Aid, which replaced the Irish Aid Advisory Committee, was established in August 2002 to provide general oversight and advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State for Overseas Development on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries.YearNo. of StaffBudget€2002365,72720033608,63220044950,257200541,008,119200641,062,884200741,050,000The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) was appointed by the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 2003 following the recommendations of the Ireland Aid Review Committee. Its purpose is to advise the Minister, Minister of State and Irish Aid on policy regarding development education. As an advisory body, it has no independent budget or overheads; the administration of DEAC is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department's overall budget.The Díon Advisory Committee was set up in response to concern about the situation of Irish emigrants in Britain in 1984. The Committee advises the Government and makes recommendations on Emigrant Services funding to voluntary organisations that work with vulnerable Irish people resident in Britain. In February 2003, these responsibilities were transferred to the Department of Foreign Affairs from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. As an advisory body, the Committee has no independent budget or overheads; the administration of the Committee is provided by our Embassy in London and financed within the Department's overall budget.The Ireland — United States Commission for Educational Exchange (the Fulbright Commission) The Fulbright Commission finances study, research, teaching and other educational activities between Ireland and the United States of America. The Fulbright Commission has eight members and enjoys autonomy of management and administration in accordance with the Educational Exchange (Ireland and the United States of America) Act, 1991. From 1997 until 2000 the Grant-in-Aid given to the Commission was £100,000 annually. In 2001 the annual Grant-in-Aid figure was increased to €254,000 per annum and has remained at this level since then.The Hunger Task Force was established in September 2007, in line with the recommendation of the White Paper on Irish Aid, to identify the contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger. The Task Force has 16 members and had its first meeting in September 2007. As an advisory body, the Committee has no independent budget or overheads; its administration is serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs.Bodies abolished, replaced or transferred (between 1997-2007)The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) was in existence between 1993 and 2002. Its purpose was to provide advice to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries. In 2002, as stated above, it was replaced by the Advisory Board for Irish Aid.YearStaffBudget19971£86,87219981£118,93819991£98,61820001£145,76420011€154,95220021€71,583The National Committee for Development Education (NCDE) was established in 1994 to promote development education throughout all sectors.

In 2001, following the recommendations in the report of the Interdepartmental Group on the Integration of Refugees in Ireland, the Government decided to replace the existing structures for dealing with refugees (including the Refugee Agency) with the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA), under the aegis of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.YearStaffBudget1997n/a€411,41819989€419,037199911€921,882200013€833,0002001 (year of abolition)6£150,000
(January-April 2001)The Cultural Relations Committee (CRC) was established in 1949 under the aegis of the then Department of External Affairs, and was transferred from the Department of Foreign Affairs to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism in 2002. The role and function of the CRC was to advise the Minister of Foreign Affairs on the administration of the annual Grant-in-Aid voted by the Oireachtas for the development of cultural relations with other countries. Its administration was serviced by the Department of Foreign Affairs.YearGrant-In-Aid1997€584,0801998€596,7771999€634,8692000€1,027,2182001€1,493,2122002 (year of transfer)€672,000
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	530	The Department of Foreign Affairs is responsible for two Votes — Vote 28 (Foreign Affairs) and Vote 29 (International Cooperation). I have set out in the tables below details of external advisory services engaged in connection with policy and administrative matters relating to the operation of the Department under both Votes and the amounts paid on such services since 1 January 2007.I am very conscious of the need to achieve value for money on such expenditure. The Department commissions external advisory services only where specialised knowledge and/or skills are not available within the Department and, particularly in the case of Irish Aid (Ireland's official development assistance programme), where ongoing independent evaluation of programmes and projects is required. Given the overall scale of the Irish Aid Programme, I am satisfied that this level of monitoring, review and evaluation is both prudent and proportionate.With regard to bodies under the aegis of my Department, only the Irish Aid Advisory Board commissioned external consultancies in 2007 and the relevant figures are included in a separate table.In addition to the foregoing, the Department, the Minister of State for Overseas Development and I had access to advice on policy and administrative matters relating to the operation of the Department from the following sources during 2007:The Advisory Board for Irish Aid provides general oversight and advice on the strategic direction of the Government's programme of assistance to developing countries;The Development Education Advisory Committee (DEAC) provides advice on policy regarding development education;The Díon Advisory Committee advises and makes recommendations on Emigrant Services funding to voluntary organisations that work with vulnerable Irish people resident in Britain;The Hunger Task Force was established in September 2007, in line with the recommendation of the White Paper on Irish Aid, to identify the contributions that Ireland can make to international efforts to reduce hunger. The Task Force will present a final report to the Minister of State with responsibility for Overseas Development.The administration of the foregoing bodies is met from the Department's budget.During 2007, I also received a report from the former Minister of State, Mr. Chris Flood, on a study carried out in relation to Irish people serving prison sentences overseas. This report was provided at no cost to the Department, apart from the travel costs associated with the study.The capital expenditure projects undertaken by the Department mainly concern the acquisition and maintenance of Mission properties abroad. The Department may from time to time seek advice from the Office of Public Works in relation to such property matters.I regret that it is not possible for me to give the Deputy an item-by-item breakdown of the advice received and the status of implementation in each case. However, I can confirm that all advice received is carefully considered and that all recommendations that enhance policy and administration will be implemented where practicable and where budgetary considerations permit.Service ProvidedConsultantsPayments made to date in 2007€Technical advice on the maintenance and development of the Department’s ICT security infrastructure.Bianconi Research Limited (trading as RITS) Information Security Centre, 2052 Castle Drive, Citywest Business Campus, Dublin 24151,250Development of technical specifications and tender documents for the support and maintenance contract for the Automated Passport System.Cornwell Management Consultants Ireland Limited, Alexandra House, Ballsbridge, Dublin 44,537Value for Money and Policy Review of the Support for Irish Emigrant Groups ProgrammesGoodbody Economic Consultants, Bankcentre, Ballsbridge, Dublin 425,894Quality Assurance Assessment of the Value for Money and Policy Review of the Support for Irish Emigrants Groups ProgrammesAnnesley Resource Partnership3,751Evaluation of the capacity building programmes provided by the Institute of Public Administration in 2006 to the Bulgarian Institute of Public Administration and the Romanian National Institute of Administration.BCT Communications Limited20,469Software Programming for Secure Document RepositoryVersion 1 Software Limited1,481Cultural Events Coordination and Advisory Services for State and Official VisitsMr. Eugene Downes9,883Taxation advice provided to the Irish Embassy, London.Mr. Peter Brown3,835Legal Advice on Contractual matterMason Hayes and Curran Solicitors1,355Automated Passport System Assessment ProjectSysnet Ltd.28,132Advice on technical specifications for procurement of new support and maintenance contract for the Automated Passport SystemCornwell Consultants6,079External Advisory Services Engaged in 2007Service ProvidedConsultantAmounts Paid to date in 2007Provision of advice and expertise on public procurement.Achilles Procurement Services Limited109,500Technical support to the Zambia/Ireland TeacherEducation InitiativeReginald Terrence Allsop15,910Quality Assessment of the Irish Aid Evaluation Tsunami ReportAnnesley Resource Partnership2,723Independent Consultant for the Partnership Programme for Europe and Central Asia Funding CommitteeAnnesley Resource Partnership6,579Review of the Irish Aid Fellowship Training ProgrammeAnnesley Resource Partnership34,388Technical Consultant to the Civil Society Funding SchemesAodh O’Connor13,800Technical Support to the Civil Society & Micro Projects Fund 9Aodh O’Connor2,658Advisory input to Irish Aid’s Project Assessment and Evaluation Group (PAEG)Andre Barsony10,166Programme Consultant for the Central America ProgrammeLuis Enrique Bran Reyes37,864Global Fund Strategy Technical SupportRuiri Brugha8,450Provision of Technical Support on Health and HIV/AIDS March 2005 to Dec 2006Catherine A Butcher3,893Technical Support to the Civil Society Fund and Micro Projects FundNicholas Chisholm1,500Monitoring of Irish Aid Recovery Programme, MalawiAnne Conroy82,773Provision of Technical support for HIV/AIDSÁine Costigan49,836External technical advice to the Fellowship Selection CommitteeBernie Crawford3,712Assist Irish Aid in appraising and approving proposals under the HIV /Aids Partnership Scheme Supplementary GrantBernie Crawford5,384Consultancy and Technical Support to the Civil Society Fund and Micro Projects FundThomas Crowley16,066Mapping of Irish Aid Approval ProcessesDalberg Global Development Ad25,410Provision of Public Health Specialist SupportSean Drysdale55,527Support to the revision of Irish Aids Country Strategy Planning (CSP) Guidelines and ProceduresKate Dyer28,895Evaluation of the Mozambique Country Programmes 2001-2006Ecorys Research & Consulting93,191Consultant to Development Education Grants CommitteeDeirdre Farrell5,000Advisory input to Irish Aid’s Project Assessment and Evaluation Group (PAEG)Arthur M Fell20,261Irish Aid Management ReviewFarrell Grant Sparks92,767Provision of Technical Support on Health and HIV/AIDS, October to December 2006Margaret Fitzgerald18,392Advisory input to Irish Aid’s Project Appraisal and Evaluation Group (PAEG)Margaret Fitzgerald8,480Mainstreaming;

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	531	The Programme for Government states that "This Government will campaign for a complete ban on the use of cluster munitions. In the absence of a full ban we will seek agreement on an immediate freeze on the use of cluster munitions pending the establishment of effective international instruments to address humanitarian concerns regarding their use."In my speech to the United Nations General Assembly in October I referred to Ireland's role in seeking a comprehensive response to the curse of cluster munitions, the appalling effects of which are all too evident in Lebanon and elsewhere, and stated that, in order to advance the collaborative effort launched in Oslo last February, Ireland would host a Diplomatic Conference in May 2008 which we hoped might finalise the first-ever international agreement on cluster munitions.At the Oslo Meeting in February 2007, to which I have just referred, 46 States adopted a Declaration which committed them to conclude by 2008 a legally binding international instrument that will "prohibit the use, production, transfer and stockpiling of cluster munitions that cause unacceptable harm to civilians." They also committed to cooperation and assistance for survivors and affected communities, clearance of affected areas and destruction of stockpiles and to consider taking steps at national level to address these problems, pending adoption of a treaty.Ireland has taken a leading role in the Oslo Process and is a member of the Core Group guiding it, together with Austria, the Holy See, Mexico, New Zealand, Norway and Peru. Following the Oslo Declaration, a meeting in Lima in May 2007 saw the number of participating States grow to 68, while the most recent conference in Vienna earlier this month attracted 138 States and saw detailed and substantive discussion of the text of a draft Convention. Further discussions will take place in Wellington in February 2008 and the Dublin Diplomatic Conference will take place in Croke Park from 19-30 May. Given the clear political momentum which exists, I am hopeful that it will be possible to agree an effective prohibition on the use of cluster munitions, with substantial humanitarian provision for victims and affected areas. A hallmark of the Oslo Process is the involvement of NGOs and civil society representatives, with significant attendance from this sector expected in Dublin.In the course of 2007, a number of countries whose armed forces possess cluster munitions, including Belgium, Austria and Hungary, have adopted legislation or moratoria banning their use. Though Ireland has never possessed these weapons, I am willing to examine the case for a ban in domestic law as a signal of Ireland's leadership role in this area. To that end, I have asked my officials to examine, in conjunction with other Government Departments, what measures would be necessary to achieve a ban in domestic law.Our main focus remains on securing effective action at the international level. Once an international instrument on cluster munitions is adopted it will be necessary to consider the steps, including possible new legislation, required to enable ratification by Ireland.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	532	In response to the humanitarian emergency caused by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and as an expression of solidarity with the people of the United States, Ireland provided €1 million in emergency funding to the disaster effort. Approximately €700,000 was delivered via the Irish Red Cross to the American Red Cross, and a further €300,000 was committed by our Embassy in Washington to support civil society and community based organisations working in the affected region with the recovery effort.My Department, through Irish Aid, has also provided €490,000 over the period 2005 to 2007 to support field based humanitarian research in emergency environments. This research, carried out by the Feinstein International Centre, in Massachusetts, is designed to assist international humanitarian organisations and NGO's to respond more effectively in crises situations. The work also focuses on protecting the vulnerable in conflict situations and in rebuilding livelihoods in the aftermath of emergencies and is part of Irish Aid's commitment to best humanitarian practice.The Deputy will also be aware that Ireland makes significant ODA eligible payments to many organisations having their headquarters in the United States of America — the UN and the IMF / World Bank being obvious cases in point. Those, mainly multilateral organisations, have as their main objective the economic and social advancement of developing countries. Contributions to those organisations are published in the Irish Aid Annual Reports.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	533	As I said in response to Question No. 328 of 4 December 2007, this was a particularly brutal and shocking murder, widely and rightly condemned.  Since then, on 17 December, I met with the parents of the deceased young man, in Dundalk. I conveyed to them the sympathy of the Government on their terrible loss and our determination to see justice done in this matter.A very active criminal investigation by An Garda Síochána is ongoing and receiving excellent co-operation and assistance from the PSNI.  My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Mr Brian Lenihan T.D. has discussed this case with Secretary of State Woodward and NIO Security Minister Paul Goggins in the context of the ongoing investigation.  I would again urge anyone who has any information on this murder to pass it on to the two police forces. It is only through full co-operation with the law enforcement agencies that the authors of this vicious crime will be brought to justice.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	534	Ireland's overseas development assistance (ODA) is delivered through a wide range of development and humanitarian organisations, including non governmental organisations (NGOs), multilateral and other international organisations, and directly through our own programmes in our 9 Programme Countries. This mix and balance of delivery mechanisms is designed to maximise the impact of our assistance on the ground, in line with the priorities set out in the White Paper on Irish Aid published in 2006.The multilateral component of Ireland's ODA is predominantly channelled through the United Nations (based largely in New York, Geneva and Vienna), the World Bank (based in Washington) and the European Development Fund (based in Brussels). A percentage of this multilateral ODA is also paid by other Departments such as the Department of Finance (which makes payments in support of the International Financial Institutions including debt relief); the Department of Agriculture and Food (which supports food relief through the World Food Programme and the Food and Agriculture Organisation) and the Department of Health and Children (which supports the World Health Organisation). Ireland is also credited with substantial amounts of the EU development cooperation budget.Ireland's core multilateral ODA amounted to over €190 million in 2005 and €312.5 million in 2006. While precise figures are not yet available, a figure in the region of €200 million is expected for 2007.It should be noted that while Irish Aid makes a number of core contributions to UN development bodies, we also support the UN to carry out aspects of our own bilateral programmes, particularly emergency humanitarian relief. For example in 2006 and 2007 we contributed €10 million and €20 million respectively to the Central Emergency Response Fund. The CERF was established, with Ireland's support, to enable humanitarian organisations to respond much more rapidly to sudden onset emergencies in order to save lives. Ireland also works with international organisations such as the Red Cross family in its humanitarian endeavours. The Red Cross received €5.6 million in 2005, €10.7 million in 2006 and €11.6 million in 2007.The majority of Ireland's development contributions to the UN are concentrated on a small group of agencies whose policies and development priorities fit best with our own, which have the most robust management arrangements and which have monitoring and evaluation systems considered to be of the highest calibre. These are the UN Development Programme (UNDP), which plays a central role in coordinating the delivery of development aid on the ground, with a special focus on governance; the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR). The decision to designate these bodies as Priority Partners within the UN system followed a recommendation by a 2006 external review of Ireland's engagement with the UN Funds and Programmes.Irish Aid makes smaller contributions to UNAIDS, the UN Population Fund (UNFPA), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD),   the World Health Organisation (WHO), Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA), the Environment Programme (UNEP), the Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), UN Volunteers and the Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM). Assessed contributions to the UN Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO), International Office for Migration (IOM), and the World Conservation Union are also made.Irish Aid's support for the World Bank is also directed to a number of large global funds managed by the Bank, notably the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria. This is one of the principal mechanisms for addressing the HIV/AIDS pandemic in a systematic and effective way. Smaller amounts are given in support of the International Finance Corporation, the branch of the World Bank Group devoted to strengthening the private sector in developing countries.Irish Aid also funds a range of multilateral organisations under the general heading of Aid for Trade. These include the International Trade Centre and the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). The total amount of funding provided to assist the various trade capacity building and development projects in 2005 was approximately €1.4 million, with €3 million contributed in 2006 and €6 million in 2007.A comprehensive list of Ireland's contributions to multilateral and international organisations for each year is outlined in the Irish Aid Annual Report, which is placed in the Dáil Library.

This is scheduled to take place in early 2008 on completion and fit-out of the permanent premises in Henry Street. Good progress has been made and personnel have either been assigned to, or identified for, 103 posts or approximately 83% of the 124 posts scheduled to be decentralised.An advance party involving 55 staff has already decentralised to interim office premises in Limerick. Forty-nine of these were Dublin-based applicants and the remaining 6 were from provincial locations.Two officers of this Department, based in the Passport Office Cork, transferred directly to their chosen decentralised location in other Departments.Twenty three Dublin based-officers of this Department have transferred to other Departments with a view to moving to a provincial location under the Decentralisation Programme. Thirteen of these officers initially transferred to Dublin- based offices of the respective decentralising Departments and ten transferred directly to a provincial location.

The marketing of individual areas, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I have been informed by the Agency that in the period 2004 to date in 2007, there has been a combined total of 16 visits by potential investors to the towns of Ballinasloe, Gort and Tuam.  Details of these visits are set out in the tabular statement.  Discussions with existing or prospective client companies are an operational matter for the Agency and are treated as confidential.  However, one of these visits resulted in the establishment of a research, marketing and distribution facility by USCI in Ballinasloe.  This facility currently employs in the region of 70 people.A central goal for Government is the achievement of balanced regional development.  The National Spatial Strategy provides a framework for achievement of this goal through the prioritisation of development and investment in gateway and hub locations.  Under the NSS, Galway City is designated as a Gateway and Tuam is designated as a hub town.  Both locations together with Ballinasloe are priority locations in Galway for the Agency.Despite increasing competition, Galway County and City continue to be very successful in winning Foreign Direct Investment. There are 50 IDA supported companies in Galway City and County employing almost 10,000 people in permanent jobs with a further 2,000 in temporary and contract jobs.  Indeed, over the last three years employment trends show a continuing gradual increase in IDA supported employment.In addition, IDA Ireland is investing significantly in the provision of planned and focused property solutions in the West region. IDA is developing world class Business and Technology Parks in Oranmore, Tuam, Ballinasloe, and Parkmore.I am confident that the strategies being pursued by IDA together with the roll out of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and job creation for the people of Galway.2004200520062007Ballinasloe4 (March, May, September & October)6 (February, March & May00Gort01 (December)00Tuam2 (March & December)1 (December)2 (July & August)0

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	539	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I have been informed by the Agency that, from 2003 to date in 2007, there have been a total of 5 site visits by prospective investors to towns in County Kildare.  During the course of an itinerary all potential sites, including sites owned by IDA Ireland, would be brought to the attention of prospective clients.  Details of these visits are set out in the attached tabular statement.  To date, no investment has resulted from these visits.Over the past 5 years, IDA Ireland's focused strategy for Kildare has been to promote the County as part of an integrated East Region with access to a population base of 1.5 million people.  The East Region offers foreign direct investors a global gateway and benefits from almost half of all employment in IDA supported companies.In recent years Kildare has attracted some world class manufacturing companies such as Intel, Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B and Hewlett Packard.  At the end of December 2006, the latest date for which figures are available, there were 24 IDA supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 10,310 people.In October 2007, Wyeth Medica in Newbridge announced a €24m R&D project which will enhance the quality of products within the plant.  Another significant development, announced earlier this year, has been the decision by Tegral to relocate to a Greenfield site. Within the Tegral Group, Athy is seen by the parent company as being efficient, competitive and worthy of new investment.  Also the decision by Coca-Cola to increase the job numbers in Athy International Concentrates is most welcome.I am satisfied that the strategies being pursued by the Agency together with the roll out of the National Development Plan will continue to bear fruit in terms of investment and job creation for the people of Kildare.200320042005200620072

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The Enterprise Development Agencies under the aegis of my Department, Enterprise Ireland, the County Enterprise Boards, and IDA Ireland have remits respectively in the areas of, growing indigenous enterprises, and attracting and growing foreign direct investment. In addition, Shannon Development is the regional economic development agency for the mid-west region, and has specific responsibility for Foreign Direct Investment in the Shannon Free Zone. My Department has put in place a range of strategies, programmes and financial incentives to promote economic and enterprise development that will support sustainable employment throughout the country.Ireland is building its position as a leading European provider of the next business step up from contact centres — shared services and business process centres, by offering detailed technical support and a wide range of services way beyond giving simple solutions to straightforward customer inquiries. Some are operated by outsourced suppliers, but most in Ireland are managed by the companies they serve.Ireland has approximately between 60 and 70 shared services centres that are multilingual, pan-European and trans-Atlantic.  These include major companies the size and scale of IBM or Dell. Outsourcing is often undertaken as part of a long term strategic business growth plan of Irish companies.These companies increasingly focus on outsourcing as a strategic option.  Outsourcing by indigenous enterprises is a natural stage in the growth and development of internationally trading enterprises as they seek to achieve international scale. In general, companies engage in outsourcing with the objective of enhancing corporate profitability and maintaining the international competitiveness and long run survival of the company by accessing productivity enhancing factors of production such as skilled labour, low cost raw materials and labour.Outward Direct Investment (ODI) gives rise to a range of costs and benefits which impact on the firm itself, its stakeholders, and the Irish economy as a whole. A 2007 Forfás Commissioned report on the effect of ODI on the Irish economy concludes that ODI by indigenous firms has a positive impact on the domestic employment levels within investing firms, a positive effect on the skills levels within those companies indicating increased numbers of higher skilled employees and a positive impact on the productivity of the investing firm.Overall the Forfás Commissioned report concludes that ODI by indigenous firms has a net positive impact on the economy. However, the creation of high-value added jobs in the context of ODI is often accompanied by a loss of low skilled jobs in low-value added activities. This may have greater impact where it happens in regional areas of the country, where alternative employment opportunities may be less readily available.Looking to the future, neither the Government nor my Department is complacent or unaware of the varied challenges facing the country's economy. One of our main tasks is to ensure that Ireland remains an attractive place to do business, and to support the development of economic competencies higher up the value chain. In that regard, we continue to work to maintain and enhance our framework competitive conditions, and promote new areas of competitive advantage by developing our R&D base, investing in critical physical and communications infrastructures, and promoting tertiary education and lifelong learning, in line with the NDP and the Programme for Government.

This legislation requires that appropriate measures are available to enable a person with a disability to have access to employment, to participate in employment and/or to undertake training.Within its remit for providing vocational training services for people with disabilities FÁS does everything possible to have in place any supports or assistive technology that a disabled learner may require.  This could relate to training itself or in any examination or test that might be part of the certification process for his or her FÁS course in compliance with current legislation.Assistive technology and training supports are currently funded out of FÁS regional training budgets.  However, FÁS plan to establish a central dedicated budget for this in 2008 in accordance with a recommendation in the FÁS Vocational Training Strategy for People with Disabilities.Accessible training materials are made available by FÁS on the basis of individual need.  In regard to publications, the FÁS web site is currently WAI Triple A compliant for publications, and will be "Browse Aloud" compatible in early 2008. These facilities directly address the requirements of Section 28 of the Disability Act.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Since 2006 an annual national target is set in all FÁS regions in the first quarter of the year for all training and employment programmes in respect of a number of target groups, including people with disabilities.  For 2007, there is a targeted increase of 1% over the 2006 figures regarding registration, completion and placement. Targets are monitored quarterly.  In 2006, 7,385 persons in receipt of disability payments completed employment and training programmes.The total numbers of persons in receipt of a state disability income who commenced on all FÁS training courses in 2006 was 983.  Approximately 50% of these would have commenced training in Specialist Training Providers, such as National Learning Network (NLN), which are specifically for disabled people and are contracted, and monitored by FÁS.The immediate objective under my Department's Sectoral Plan for People with Disabilities in the medium term is to raise the employment rate of that cohort who do not have a difficulty in holding a job towards the employment rate of their peers who do not have disabilities. The immediate objective over the period of this plan is to aim to have at least half, or 7, 000 of that cohort in employment. The Plan covers the period 2006- 2010 and will be reviewed in 2009.

Of these, Forfás is the main source of advice which inputs into decisions taken by me and my Department in relation to policy matters.  Forfás is the national policy and advisory board for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation and the body in which the State's legal power for industrial promotion and technological development has been vested. It is also the body through which powers are delegated to Enterprise Ireland for the promotion of indigenous industry and to IDA Ireland for the promotion of inward investment. Science Foundation Ireland was established as a third agency of Forfás in July 2003 to provide strategic support to scientists, engineers and academic researchers working in biotechnology and ICT development.In carrying out its functions Forfás works with a number of bodies which operate under its aegis or to which Forfás provides an administrative and/or research function.  The work of these bodies is an important input into policy formulation at my Department. These bodies include:The National Competitiveness Council (NCC), which reports to the Taoiseach on issues of National Competitiveness.The Advisory Council for Science, Technology and Innovation (Advisory Science Council), which advises on medium and long-term policy for science, technology and innovation (STI) and related matters.The Expert Group on Future Skills NeedsThe Enterprise Strategy Group and associated Enterprise Advisory GroupThe Business Regulation Forum,Discover Science and Engineering, the national science awareness programme.The Small Business Forum, which reported to the Minister for Enterprise Trade and Employment in May 2006.The Interim Board of the National Consumer Agency (established as a statutory entity on 1 May 2007).The Irish National Accreditation Board (INAB), a committee of Forfás, is the National Body with responsibility for accreditation in accordance with European and international formal standards and guides.There has been no additional cost to the Department as it is the function of Forfás, which supports the work of the above bodies, to provide such policy advice to the Minister.As regards Company Law initiatives and legislation, the Department consults a variety of stakeholders including the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, private sector stakeholders with legal, accounting and fund management expertise and Company Law Review Group.  The advice provided by these experts is free of charge to the Department.In addition, as part of the commitments included under the partnership agreement ‘Towards 2016', a High-Level Manufacturing group was established to review the challenges facing the manufacturing sector and to identify further measures to meet those challenges.None of the above advice relates to capital expenditure projects.In respect of externally sourced advice, outside of my Department's agencies, which was sought in the period 1 December 2006-30 November 2007 as an input into policy formulation and administrative matters pertaining to the operations of my Department, the information required by the Deputy is set out in the tabular statement.Name of ConsultantsPurposeTotal CostImplementation of adviceHELM Corporation Ltd.Advice and support on the Optimisation of the ORACLE Financial Management system€18,525.07 (none of which is Capital expenditure)The advice provided through this consultancy has resulted in greater use being made of the ORACLE Financial Management system.

The number of posts in this decentralised advance office is 98.  Of the staff in place in this office, 38 were decentralised from locations outside Dublin with the remainder decentralised from Dublin.Additionally my Department has 48 staff due to decentralise to Carlow in the substantive move scheduled for 2009.  The number of staff who have transferred from my Department to other decentralising Departments is 59.Health and Safety AuthorityThe Health and Safety Authority is to decentralise 110 staff to Thomastown, Co. Kilkenny. In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Health and Safety Authority has established an interim office in Kilkenny city and to date 27 staff of the Authority have decentralised to that office which is now at full capacity. The majority of these staff were either directly recruited or transferred from Dublin. All staff that move to the Kilkenny office will transfer to Thomastown when the premises there are completed.Enterprise Ireland (EI)The Government decentralisation programme provides for the transfer of the Enterprise Ireland Headquarters, with 300 posts, to Shannon.  Further progress in effecting this move is contingent on a number of factors, including the level of interest in the Shannon location expressed through the Central Applications Facility and the resolution of certain key issues for agency decentralisation in discussions at central level.  I understand that there have been 25 applications through the Central Applications Facility from civil and public servants for transfer to Shannon.  Enterprise Ireland, working closely with the Office of Public Works, has identified, but not yet acquired, a preferred site for the construction of a new HQ building in Shannon.Following the transfer of responsibility for indigenous industry development in the Mid-West Region from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland (EI) from 1 January 2007, Enterprise Ireland established its new National Regional Development Headquarters, which incorporates the County Enterprise Coordination Unit, in Shannon.  This has given Enterprise Ireland a major presence in Shannon. At present, 40 staff, including a number of staff transferred from Shannon Development and over 20 local recruits, are based at recently leased offices in Westpark, Shannon. It is expected that this number will increase to about 65 over the coming months.  A senior manager has been appointed as Head of Regions and Entrepreneurship to oversee the establishment of the EI presence in the Mid-West Region. EI managers with responsibility for the County Enterprise Coordination Unit and EI Regional Development strategy as well as the Regional Director with responsibility for the Mid-West Region are now in place in the Shannon office.  As part of EI's regional strategy, these posts were assigned from Dublin to the new office in Shannon.FÁSTransferred from Dublin to Birr, 12Transferred from outside of Dublin to Birr, 3New Entrants to Birr (replacing Head OfficePosts, 6TOTAL, 21

It is also available to people who are under 66 years of age who are living alone and receiving payments under one of a number of invalidity type schemes. The increase is intended as a contribution towards the additional costs people face when they live alone. The policy in relation to support for pensioners has been, for many years, to give priority to increasing the personal rates of pension rather than supplements like the living alone increase.  The objective is to use resources to improve the position of all pensioners to the fullest extent possible rather than focusing on particular groups.  This approach was continued in Budget 2008 with increases of up to €12 and €14 per week granted on personal rates.The results of this policy can be seen in the recently released results from the EU Survey on Income and Living Conditions (SILC) which showed that the position of older people improved significantly from 2005 to 2006, with the ‘at risk of poverty' rate falling from 20.1% to 13.6%.  Furthermore the number of people aged 65 and over ‘at risk of poverty' was significantly lower than the figure of 17% for the general population.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	554	The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at below standard levels.Family Income Supplement (FIS), which is a weekly tax-free payment for families at work and on low pay, is also one of the qualifying payments for the purposes of the BSCFA scheme. This enables families, not normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment to avail of the BSCFA scheme. Self-employed people on low incomes may qualify for Jobseekers Allowance (JA), depending on the income from their business. As JA is a qualifying payment for BSCFA a self-employed person may then qualify for payment of BSCFA subject to meeting the other qualifying criteria of the scheme. A means test is applied to ensure that limited resources are directed to those in greatest need.  Income Limits for 2008 will be €496.10 for a couple with one child and €347.30 for a lone parent with one child. The limit is increased by €24.00 for each additional child.  The fact that the income limit is aligned to weekly social welfare payment rates means that it is automatically indexed upward each year with budget increases.In Budget 2007, the rate of payment of BSCFA was increased by €60 per child for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €95 for children aged 12 to 22 — a 50% increase on the previous allowance.  The rates for 2007 are €180 for children aged 2 to 11 years old and €285 for children aged 12 to 22.  Budget 2008 has increased BSCFA rates by €20 to €200 and €305, a further increase of 11% and 7%, respectively.  Expenditure on the scheme will increase by €3.5m to around €43.5m in 2008.  These improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for October 2007, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.5% over the past twelve months.  Since December 2001, clothing and footwear costs have decreased by 18.4%.I consider the back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme to be an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available to me for improvements in social welfare payments generally.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The Government has made significant improvements to the carers allowance and Carers Benefit in recent years.  The number of hours a person can work and continue to receive payment has increased from 12 to 15 hours per week.  The income disregard has been increased in Budget 2008 to €332.50 for a single person and €665 for a couple.  The respite care grant was extended to all people providing full time care and Budget 2008 provides for the payment to be increased to €1,700 in respect of each care recipient.  Other enhancements include care sharing and the extension of the Carers Benefit scheme duration to 24 months.At present there are over 34,000 carers in receipt of a weekly payment for caring from my Department.  Of these, over 32,400 are in receipt of carer's allowance and over 1,980 are in receipt of carer's benefit.  In addition, over 8,000 carers have received a respite care grant from my Department in respect of 2007 and applications continue to be received.  One of the fundamental qualifying conditions for all of these payments is that the recipient must be providing full time care and attention to a person who needs it.According to Census 2006 there are 160,917 people providing at least 1 hour of unpaid help per week for a friend or family member with a long term illness, health problem or disability.   Of this number, 93,363 people provide up to 2 hours of unpaid help per day and a further 17,093 people provide unpaid help of between 2 and 4 hours per day. So there are approximately 50,400 people providing care for more than 29 hours per week or just over 4 hours per day.  Of these, approximately 19,600 people are classified by principal economic status as being at work and many of these would be engaged in employment for more than 15 hours per week which would make them ineligible for carer's allowance or benefit.Budget 2007 provided for significant structural reforms to introduce new arrangements whereby people in receipt of a social welfare payment, other than carer's allowance or benefit, who are also providing someone with full time care and attention, will be able to retain their main welfare payment and receive another payment, depending on their means, the maximum of which will be equivalent to a half rate carer's allowance.  Similarly, people currently in receipt of a carer's allowance, who may have an underlying eligibility for another social welfare payment, can transfer to that other payment and continue to receive up to a half rate carer's allowance.  These new arrangements which came into force in September 2007 apply to almost all weekly social welfare payments including state pension contributory and non-contributory; widow/er's contributory/non-contributory pension and to people in receipt of qualified adult allowances.I will keep supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The reduction and eventual elimination of child poverty is a national priority and at the core of the strategic process to combat poverty and social exclusion, as set out in Towards 2016,  the National Action Plan for social inclusion (NAPinclusion) and the social inclusion commitments in the NDP.Children growing up in low income or jobless households are the most vulnerable to poverty.  A high proportion of these households are composed of larger families with three or more children, and those headed by lone parents. As national and international evidence shows that employment participation is the main route out of poverty, the policy direction followed by successive Governments from 1995 to 2006 was to dedicate substantial resources to Child Benefit (CB).  This process was intensified during the period 2001 to 2006 when an additional €1.27 billion was invested in the scheme, making child income support more neutral vis-à-vis the employment status of the parent and thus ensuring more parental choice in relation to working inside or outside the home in relation to retention of child income supports.The shift towards CB has been substantial, from a position where Child Benefit represented 27% of the total CB/Qualified Child Increase (QCI) payment, to 63%.  In other words, following the CB increases, a family will now lose only 37% of their child income support when moving into full-time employment.  The advantage of this change is that, unlike QCIs, it does not contribute to unemployment or poverty traps.  In addition, the introduction of the early child care supplement in 2006 in respect of all children up to six years of age has increased the overall level of child income support to all qualifying families, and proportionately more in the case of low-income families.In the ten years from 1998 to 2007, CB rates have increased by 300% (lower rate) and 266% (higher rate).  This compares with a consumer price index rise of 39.2%. In addition, the early child care supplement, which is payable in respect of all children under six years of age, provides a further €83.33 per month (paid quarterly in arrears). Budget 2008 provides for further increases payable in respect of all children.  In percentage terms, these represent increases of 3.8% and 3.2% over 2007.   When added to the increase of €100 per annum to the Early Childcare Supplement, the overall increases in relation to children under six years are €14.33 (lower) and €16.34 (higher) per month, percentage increases of 5.89% and 5.87% respectively.While CB rates continue to increase, recent budgets have seen the concentration of additional resources on more targeted payments and specifically to families who are dependent on welfare supports, including family income supplement which is paid to low-earning employees with children.  In this context, Budget 2007 provided for the first increases in QCIs since 1994, followed by the further increase which I announced in Budget 2008.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The state pensions contributory and transitional include, where appropriate, an increase for a dependent spouse or partner.  This increase is means-tested and a full increase is payable where a spouse's income is less than €100 per week, and reduced rates are payable until income exceeds €300 per week, up from €280 before the recent Budget.  The decision is made on the basis of the income enjoyed by the qualified adult only.  However, where capital or property (other than the family home) is jointly owned, then the qualified adult will be assessed with 50% of any actual/notional income or capital value deriving from that asset.  The effect is that the qualified adult of a couple with capital of just under €116,000 will qualify for a qualified adult increase at the maximum rate of  €200 per week provided the principal pensioner is also in receipt of state pension (contributory) at the maximum rate.  Social Welfare legislation provides for the tapered withdrawal of the qualified adult increase until it is withdrawn where a couple has capital of €216,000 or more.As set out in the Programme for Government, the policy in relation to the means-testing of qualified adult payments is to increase the income limits that apply in the means-test so that more people will qualify for the allowance. These limits are kept under review in a budgetary context.  The issue of means-testing qualified adult payments for pensions is discussed in the Green Paper on Pensions, published on 17 October. Although this is an issue which cannot be looked at exclusively in a pensions context, as it applies to all social welfare payments, the consultation process on pensions will include discussion on the future status of qualified adults.

Under this new arrangement, customers have the choice to opt either for a direct credit to a telephone company for their landline as before or for a cash payment in respect of their mobile phone.  This means that it is no longer necessary for a person to have a landline installed in order to benefit from the telephone allowance.  The Programme for Government includes a commitment to further extend the telephone allowance to include broadband services.  A range of proposals have been made to extend the coverage of the household benefits package of free schemes. These proposals are kept under review in the context of the objectives of the scheme and budgetary resources.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	561	In July 2006 my Department launched its Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005. The plan is aimed at developing services that not only give people with disabilities financial security but encourage maximum participation in society. One of the objectives of the plan is to engage meaningfully with persons of working age, particularly marginalised groups and provide services directly and in co-operation with other relevant agencies to encourage and support these people in taking up relevant work, training and education or development opportunities.My Department is committed to the development of a systematic programme of engagement for all people of working age, including people with disabilities.  The Social & Economic Participation Programme under the NDP 2007-2013 will develop an active case management service for all people of working age including people with disabilities. This service will be complemented by my department's existing back to education and back to work schemes. Senior officials representing relevant departments and agencies have met to progress activation commitments under the Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016 and the National Development Plan. A review of existing social and family support services resources within my Department has been undertaken to identify gaps in service provision.In addition, a project proposal entitled "Supporting Economic Participation by People with Disabilities" has been approved for funding under the European Social Fund, Human Capital Investment Operational Programme 2007-2013. The high level objective of the proposal is to develop and test a comprehensive employment strategy based on individual case management of people on illness and disability welfare payments, that will have the capacity to increase their rate of employment. Planning for the project has commenced in the Border Midland and Western region where the project will be piloted. Nominations for the project board have been sought from relevant departments and agencies.An amendment to existing legislation, effective from 1st January, 2007, provides that where a person who has been in receipt of illness benefit for a period of two years and engages in employment for less than 26 weeks, payment of the benefit will be re-instated without the requirement to serve waiting days if that person finds that s/he is unable to continue to work. A similar exemption applies with disability allowance, except that the person may engage in employment for up to 52 weeks and still qualify for immediate re-instatement of the payment, should the need arise.These provisions ensure that people with an illness or disability can return to the labour market without fear of losing entitlement to the benefit or allowance should they find that they are unable to continue in employment. Information regarding restoration of benefits is provided by the relevant scheme areas and individual customers are advised of the arrangement where applicable.

This Group comprises representatives of all the key Departments — including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform — and Agencies involved in delivering the National Drugs Strategy 2001-08, as well as representatives of the community and voluntary sectors.    At the meeting, a presentation was made by the Health Promotion Unit of the Health Service Executive outlining the forthcoming National Drugs Awareness Campaign, the initial phase of which was launched last Monday.  The aim of the campaign is to dispel the myths surrounding cocaine and cocaine use and it is targeted at recreational users aged 15-34 years.While the Health Promotion Unit has lead responsibility for the development of this campaign, an Advisory Group, including representatives of my Department along with the Drug Task Forces and the National Drugs Strategy Team, was established earlier this year to consider the most effective way forward with the campaign.  The campaign will be primarily digital based.  It is expected that the second phase of the campaign, which will include radio, outdoor, ambient and press coverage, will be rolled out in February 2008.  I have not given directives to agencies within the remit of my Department regarding the effects of drug misuse over the holiday period.

Accordingly, agreement is reached by consensus on annual programmes of island works on the basis of prioritisation and in the context of the overall budgetary provisions.  Any projects that cannot be processed at a given time are kept under review.  Total capital expenditure under the Islands subhead of my Department's Vote for the Donegal islands over the last 3 years was in excess of €1.1m, as shown in the following table:200520062007*€202,085€479,849€449,900*Final end-year figure outstanding.The works in question comprised a wide range of infrastructural works, including piers, helipad, coastal protection and roads, in addition to the provision of smoke alarms and safety equipment.  In the case of the Mayo islands, the total capital expenditure over the last 3 years was in excess of €4.4m, as shown in the following table:200520062007*€2,948,832€1,397,557€73,800*Final end-year figure outstanding.The works in question comprised major pier developments on Inishturk and Clare Island, in addition to other infrastructural works, such as roads and slipways.  The Deputy may wish to note that my Department also provides funding for islands under various other subheads and programmes, including, for example, CLÁR, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme, as well as a range of Gaeltacht schemes in the case of islands located in the Gaeltacht.  If the Deputy requires further information in relation to any specific island or project, I will, of course, be happy to assist.

This project was funded by FÁS, under the Social Economy Programme on the basis that it would become commercially viable and self-sustaining.  The Social Economy Programme transferred to my Department in 2006 and has been re-named the Community Services Programme, to reflect a change of emphasis towards the provision of community services. After 8 years of operation the blueberry farm at Allenwood had failed to become commercially viable and could no longer meet the eligibility criteria for funding under the Programme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	579	On 31 October 2007, I announced the closure of the Farm Improvement Scheme as applications received under the Scheme had reached the level of funding provided for the Scheme in the 2006 partnership agreement, Towards 2016.  The applications received under the Scheme up to 31 October 2007 will be processed by my Department up to the level of funding available.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	580	An application under the Single Payment Scheme was received from the person named on 25 April 2007.  Also an application to consolidate entitlements was received on 26 April 2007.  An advance payment in the amount of €5422.10 issued on 16 October 2007.  Payment of the balance was slightly delayed while the application for consolidation was being processed.  This application was rejected, as under the rules of the consolidation measure a person must declare a number of eligible hectares which must be at least 50% of the number of entitlements originally granted to him.  The balancing payment in the amount of €5422.09 has been cleared for issue, and will be lodged to the account of the person named in the next 2 to 3 days.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The person concerned is an applicant under the Farm Improvement Scheme.  Approval to commence work was issued by my Department to the applicant on 22 October 2007.  My Department has no record of having received any notification of completion of works and the related documents from the applicant since that date.  The matter cannot be further progressed until this documentation is received.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The delay in making payment under the 2006 Single Payment Scheme arose from the fact that the person named did not declare land parcels during the 2000-2002 reference period.  Under the regulations governing the old coupled schemes, the person concerned was not obliged to declare his land.  Under the Single Payment Scheme it was necessary for my Department to establish what land was owned by such applicants in order that a number of payment entitlements could be determined.  Under EU regulations, the number of entitlements could be determined based on either the land declared during the reference period or, alternatively, on owned land declared in either 2004 or 2005.  This case was complicated due to the fact that the applicant also leased out some land and entitlements in 2006 that he acquired from another farmer.Insofar as the 2007 Single Payment Scheme is concerned, an application was received on the 15 May 2007 requesting a transfer of 5.77 entitlements from the person named to a third party by way of one-year lease.  As essential elements of the application form were not completed, it was necessary to return it to the herd owners for completion. In addition it was also necessary to query the number of hectares being transferred.It transpired that the net area of land being transferred was 5.6 hectares and, as each leased entitlement must be accompanied by one hectare of eligible land, it was necessary, in consultation with the herd owners, to reduce the number of entitlements being transferred to 5.6.  The transfer has now been fully processed and payment will issue as soon as possible.

However, as he does not hold any Single Payment entitlements, payment cannot issue to him.  He has received full payment under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme in respect of these lands.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	585	The only persons other than established civil servants from whom advice has been sought or received on a personal basis by me, or the Ministers of State in my Department are two personal advisors. Mr Michael Shovlin was employed by me as press advisor until earlier this year, with a salary of €83,815 per annum.  Mr Stiofán Nutty is currently employed by Minister of State Sargent.  His salary since appointment amounts to €15,106. Advice on capital projects was not provided by either of the advisors.Apart from this, as a matter of course, I regularly meet with farming and other representative groups as well as State agencies under my Department's remit in connection with matters appertaining to the operation of the Department. In addition there is frequent engagement with the food industry under the Agri-Vision Action Plan.  A research group, chaired by industry, was established by me to advise on high level research priorities.  The group includes representatives of third level food research institutions, the food industry and consumers.  No fees are paid in any of these cases.There are many other areas where my Department receives advice.  For example, my Department receives advice, in relation to potential disease outbreaks, from BirdWatch Ireland, the Centre for Veterinary Epidemiology and Risk Analysis (CVERA) in UCD and the Avian ‘Flu Expert Advisory Group and, in relation to animal welfare issues, from the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Council (FAWAC).The Department's Audit Committee which comprises non-public service members, officials from other Departments and officials of my Department, also offers advice on an on-going basis on administrative systems and procedures.  A per diem rate is payable to non-public service members.  A total of €2,800 has been paid in respect of 2007.

An additional 70 civil servants were assigned to Portlaoise from outside of Dublin.  There are 82 civil servants in my Department's offices in Dublin assigned for decentralisation to Portlaoise.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	587	This month Office of Public Works has announced further progress towards the provision of permanent accommodation in Mullingar for my Department in that it has just invited a consortium to become the successful tenderer for a decentralisation accommodation project to include Mullingar.To date no decision has been taken as to whether a number of posts will be located into temporary accommodation in Mullingar in advance of the full decentralisation of 300 posts into the new permanent accommodation.  As I have previously indicated, the issue is re-examined from time to time.The relocation of posts in my Department from Dublin to Athlone will take place next year, so my Department will be relocating 400 posts from Dublin into new permanent accommodation in Athlone and Mullingar over a period of approximately 2 years.  The capacity of my Department to manage its business if this process is accelerated by sending an advance number of posts to temporary accommodation in Mullingar is a major consideration in deciding whether it is appropriate to relocate a number of posts into temporary accommodation in Mullingar in advance of the full move of 300 posts into the new permanent accommodation.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The details sought by the Deputy are not readily available. As the Deputy may be aware, the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004.  Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of €300 million have been completed.  Considerable extra investment has been provided in the Budget to increase funding for school buildings to almost €600 million next year. With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008.  There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme next year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating special educational needs resources, including assistive technology supports to schools to support students with special needs.  On receipt of an application for assistive technology from a school, the SENO will examine the application in the light of the needs of the student, the school facilities and the qualifying criteria.  The SENO then makes recommendations to my Department in relation to assistive technology which may be required by students with certain special educational needs and my Department will advise schools on the level of grant approved.  The equipment will be the property of the school and the school's management authority will have responsibility for maintenance, repair, insurance etc. of the equipment.All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO and it is open to schools to contact the SENO in this regard.  Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.  My Department has grant-aided the provision of 247 laptops in 2007 and 240 in 2006 for second-level special needs pupils.The Department funded the Laptops Initiative from December 2000 to May 2005.  This nationwide ICT in education initiative co-ordinated by the National Centre for Technology in Education (NCTE) was aimed at identifying how laptop computers could best be used to support second-level students with dyslexia or other reading and writing difficulties.  Thirty one schools participated in the initiative one of which was St Dominic's Secondary School, Ballyfermot, Co Dublin.  Various methods of software use in Irish second-level teaching and learning were successfully explored and the project established the feasibility of using integrated mobile ICT in busy school environments.  Much practical knowledge was gained about the management of mobile ICT in schools.In relation to grants available for the purchase of laptops the grant scheme for Minor Works to National School Properties includes ICT equipment within the range of approved school expenditure.  At Post Primary level recent developments include the introduction of the new Technology syllabus and the revised Design and Communication Graphics syllabus at Leaving Certificate level which were introduced this year with an associated investment of some €14 million to schools to upgrade their facilities.  The schools could buy laptops with the funding given, up to the end of September this year 1666 laptops were purchased.  Disadvantaged schools are also benefiting from the €3.4m ICT Grant scheme for DEIS Schools from the Dormant Accounts (Educational Disadvantage) Fund from which laptops can be purchased.There are some schools which have received funding from sources other than my Department for the supply of laptops.  One example of this is St Aidan's Community School which is funded by South Dublin County Council which has provided latops to all teachers and first year students.With regards to funding for ICT in schools the Government has set out an investment of €252 million under the National Development Plan.  I appointed a Strategy Planning Group to advise me on the prioritisation of measures under the planned investment over the period of the NDP.  Among the issues which the new strategy will address are the upgrading and renewal of hardware along with the provision of software and digital content for learning, teacher professional development, curriculum development, the maintenance of the national broadband network for schools and technical maintenance and support requirements.  I expect to be in a position to publish the new Schools ICT Strategy shortly.

It was opened to provide for children who it had emerged could not be accommodated in the two established schools in the area, both under Catholic Patronage.I recently announced that it is my intention to roll out a new model of primary school patronage which will be introduced on a pilot basis under the patronage of County Dublin VEC, in September 2008.  The pilot will operate in more than one location, in Phibblestown (Dublin 15) and the Phoenix Park, subject to securing the identified sites, planning permission etc.  As in the primary school system generally, the schools will operate under the management of an independent Board of Management. County Dublin VEC will be represented on the Board of Management, as patron, and will provide practical management supports to the school.It is my intention that Scoil Choilm will become part of the pilot model following a two year transition period.  Practical arrangements for achieving a smooth transition to the patronage of County Dublin VEC will be agreed with the interim Patron.

Educational provision will continue in both locations pending delivery of a permanent school.A decision regarding the closure or phasing out of the school referred to by the Deputy is a matter ultimately for the Patron and the Board of Management.  Any decision regarding the future use of the school property will also be a matter for the Patron.  The Department is in the process of acquiring a site in the Tyrellstown area to provide a new 24 classroom building for this school.

An assessment of projected enrolment trends, demographic trends and housing developments in the area will be required in order to determine the long term projected staffing figure on which the school's accommodation needs will be based.  Once the long term projection has been determined and agreed with the school authorities the required building project will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation programme.Generally my Department will use a variety of information sources when examining demographic trends and housing developments,  these would include, inter alia, the Census, County Development Plans / Town Development Plans, Local Area Plans as well as current and projected enrolment patterns.The Office of Public Works, which acts on behalf of the Department in relation to site acquisitions generally, has been requested to investigate the acquisition of a suitable site.  Due to the commercial sensitivities involved, I do not propose to comment any further in relation to a specific site as referred to by the Deputy.The Deputy should note that my Department is included among the prescribed authorities to whom local authorities are statutorily obliged to send draft development plans or proposed variations to development plans for comment.  From the documentation received in my Department, I am advised that the local authority in question have issued an "Issues Paper" leading to the review of the existing development plan and that the deadline for receipt of observations set by the authority is today.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I propose to take Questions Nos. 310 and 311 together.The National Council for Special Education was required by the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act 2004 to make a report on the implementation of the Act. This report is essentially advice to the Minister on the steps the Council considers should be taken to implement the Act. The report sets out an action plan, where the Council envisages implementation of the provisions of the Act over a four year period.  However, the Council report also acknowledged that further work, analysis and discussion, especially with the key stakeholders involved, needed to take place given the extensive and fundamental developments required to implement the Act. The Council further acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for it to be prescriptive nor definitive in many areas, and it has put forward its views and recommendations in order to stimulate the necessary discussions and debate.As the Deputy will know, the legislature in passing the Act, also recognised that implementation would require a considerable change agenda, to develop and support inclusive schools to deliver on the provisions of the Act. For this reason, the EPSEN Act, 2004 specifically refers to a five year implementation period.  I would like to inform the Deputy that I do accept the core thrust of the principles and recommendations set out by the Council in its Implementation Report, and I am anxious to implement the Act in full in the quickest time possible. However, following consideration of the issues raised in the Council's implementation plan, and the consultations to date with the Education Partners, I consider that the five year timeframe acknowledged in the legislation is the appropriate period in which to implement the provisions of the Act.A number of sections of the Act have been commenced, principally those establishing the National Council for Special Education and those promoting an inclusive approach to the education of children with special needs.  Specifically, the following sections have been commenced — 1, 2, 14(1)(a), 14(1)(c), 14(2) to 14(4),  19 to 37, 40 to 53.The remaining sections have not yet been commenced.  As the EPSEN Act does not provide for phased commencement by age cohort the education sector must be in a position to provide the required services to all children before the relevant provisions are commenced.  My Department's priority, therefore, has been to put in place the resources required for children with special educational needs, and to ensure that the necessary supports are in place to facilitate the commencement of the remaining sections of the Act.  As I indicated in the Dáil last week it is my intention to implement the remaining sections of the Act within the five year timeframe as outlined in the legislation by October 2010.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	610	As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS, and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.Under the SCPA an allocation of assessments is made annually to schools commensurate with 2% of its pupil enrolment and it is in the first instance the responsibility of the school Principal to identify and prioritise pupils for assessment under the process.It should be noted that since the Government provided for a guaranteed allocation of resource teaching hours to all primary schools in 2005, the majority of primary school children do not now need psychological assessments in order to get extra support. Notwithstanding this benefit the level of assessments allowed to each school has not changed, allowing school Principals extra flexibility in the range of pupils that can be assessed.In common with other psychological services NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.It has always been the policy of NEPS, within the normal boundaries of finance and process, to endeavour to respond positively and flexibly to extraordinary need and circumstance as presented by school authorities on occasion and it is open to school Principals who have urgent needs for pupil assessment in excess of allocation to discuss the matter with the local NEPS Regional Director.The Deputy will also be aware that since NEPS was established, we have trebled the number of psychologists in the service. Notwithstanding this and as I have previously announced my Department is committed to increasing psychological service staffing further, so that by 2009 there will be 200 NEPS psychologists. Current numbers stand at 138 and it is my intention to expand NEPS psychologist numbers to some 169 during 2008.My Department remains committed to the development of a strong and robust educational psychological service serving the needs of all primary and post-primary pupils.

However, as the Deputy will be aware the Summer Works Scheme was introduced in 2004. Since then, over 3,000 projects costing in excess of €300 million have been completed. Considerable extra investment has been provided in the Budget to increase funding for school buildings to almost €600 million next year. With so many small projects having been completed over the past few years, I intend to focus on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008. There will not, therefore, be a new Summer Works Scheme as part of our building programme next year.

The average class size for the 2007/08 school year is currently being compiled in my Department.As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.Extra teachers were provided by the Government for the 2007/08 school year to improve primary school staffing so that schools would generally get at least one classroom teacher for every 27 children.A further initiative in recent years that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools. For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year. Over 330 such posts have been sanctioned in the 2007/08 school year compared to 280 in 2006/07.The improvements we have made in school staffing in recent years are absolutely unparalleled. The Government is committed to providing more teachers to our primary schools over the next five years in order to reduce class sizes. We will also continue our focus on measures to improve the quality of education in our primary schools to ensure that increased resources lead to better outcomes for our children.School YearNationallyKildare2006/0724.0926.52005/0624.126.72004/0523.926.82003/0423.926.82002/0324.027.2

However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer for Co. Kildare and Bus Éireann have advised that the transport service under the school transport scheme is operating to capacity. The family in question should continue to liaise with Bus Éireann regarding the availability of catchment boundary seats in the future.

Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to deal with such issues. In November 2006 I increased funding for the minor works grant by 44% on the previous year and around €27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.Another avenue to claim grant-aid from my Department is the Emergency Works Fund. Grants from this fund are available for very urgent unforeseen works, primarily of a significant health and safety nature, to schools that are in most need of resources for capital works.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	619	The first national data on school attendance was collected for the 2003/2004 school year. Attendance data relating to the 2005/06 school year is currently being analysed by the NEWB. The findings from the 2004/05 analysis, which are consistent with the findings for the previous year, indicate that approximately 84,000 children under the age of 16 miss more than 20 days each year. The explanation for the absences are for a variety of reasons ranging from unexplained absence to explained absence such as ill health.On average the Board estimates that it works with 10,000 cases per annum involving students with reported school attendance difficulties. The findings from the analysis of the Annual Attendance Reports continues to inform the work of the Board. It is encouraging to note that in relation to the effectiveness of the service, research findings show that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.I have been informed that since January 2007, the Board has worked on 8381 cases involving children who are experiencing difficulty with school attendance. 4358 of these cases are now closed and 4023 are still ongoing.My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. We established the National Educational Welfare Board to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers to parents, children and schools. It is encouraging to note research findings that attendance at school in the areas where EWOs are working intensively improved by 4% in 2004/05 compared with the previous year.My Department is also currently implementing DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) an action plan for educational inclusion. DEIS is an integrated educational inclusion strategy developed for 3-18 year olds and represents a shift in emphasis away from individual initiatives, each addressing particular problems to a multifaceted and more integrated approach.In addition to the NEWB there are some 620 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS. The School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) are preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving. Children at risk of early school leaving are targeted under the School Completion Programme for a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school. The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time. The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.Other measures facilitated through the DEIS action plan include extending access to Schools' Business Partnerships, school meals, guidance counselling and student councils. Increased integration is also being promoted between the work of second-level schools and centres catering for young early school leavers, particularly Youthreach centres and Senior Traveller Training centres.The range of curricula available to students has also been extended to include the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme. These options provide an alternative for many children who might otherwise opt out of formal education at an early stage.This Government has shown a sustained commitment to providing greater opportunities in the further education sector by supporting second chance educational opportunities for young people who leave school. Many of these young people take up places in Youthreach centres, while others pursue options such as FÁS apprenticeships. In line with the commitment in Towards 2016 we have already created 400 of the additional 1000 Youthreach places to be put in place by 2009.Through increased investment and improved services this government is determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system and will continue to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I propose to take Questions Nos. 322 and 323 together.The services the Deputy refers to are therapy services provided by the Health Service Executive. Responsibility for the delivery of therapy services lies with the relevant health authorities who are allocated funding for this purpose.As the Deputy will be aware, my Department provides a range of teaching and care supports for children with special educational needs, including children with behavioural difficulties.The special educational needs of such children can be addressed in special schools, in special dedicated classes attached to ordinary schools, or on an integrated basis in ordinary schools. Decisions regarding the most appropriate model of response in each particular case are based on the professionally assessed needs of the individual pupil.In this regard psychologists from the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) work in close collaboration with health professionals in relation to the needs of individual children and interface with the relevant elements of the HSE at local, regional and national level.In addition to the above, my Department's Teacher Education Section has developed a strategy designed to meet the continuing professional development needs of personnel working with children with special educational needs. This involves a major expansion of the range of post-graduate professional training programmes available to teachers in the special needs area and the ongoing development of the Special Education Support Service (SESS) to support schools staff locally. Significant levels of provision of training for Challenging Behaviour exist as part of post-graduate Special Education Needs (SEN) programmes in the seven colleges of further education. In addition, the Institute of Child Education & Psychology (ICEP) are involved in the provision of courses in this area in conjunction with St Patrick's College.The Special Education Support Service (SESS) have adopted a dual approach to the provision of training in the area of Challenging Behaviour. The SESS has a "Local Initiative Scheme" in place in which the training provided is identified by teachers and schools. This dynamic approach in the area of Special Education offers the relevant support and training to suit the requirements of the individual teachers and schools. A Core Strategy of Managing Challenging Behaviour is also adopted by SESS. In this strategy they approach training on the basis of the level of behavioural difficulties encountered. Teachers working with students with a moderate general learning disability are offered training in the form of day long seminars with follow-up visits to schools if necessary. Teachers working with students with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (ASD) were offered an Applied Behaviour Analysis (ABA) on-line course and three day workshop. A Summer Schools Programme at Primary level was offered for teachers who deal with serious and persistent challenging behaviour on a day-to-day basis, and was also offered to the teachers dealing with students with severe challenging behaviour.As part of its work at whole school, customised and Behaviour Support Classroom levels, the National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) conducts in-school and out-of-school continuous professional development (CPD) courses which focus on systemic behaviour improvement in schools at post-primary level. To date, in-school CPD has mainly concentrated on upskilling staff in the areas of low level disruption and prevention and de-escalation techniques for high level disruption. Out of school CPD has been organised for Behaviour Support Classroom staff only and has concentrated on all aspects of the prevention and addressing of challenging behaviour in the classroom and around the school.

The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) was established to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school.  The Board runs promotional campaigns on the importance of attendance and finishing school and provides a service locally through its Education Welfare Officers (EWOs) to parents, children and schools.This Government is determined to do all that is possible to ensure that every child gets all the opportunities and support they need to enable them to achieve their potential and participate fully in education.  The funding to the Board for 2007 amounted to €9.808 million, which represents an increase of 20% on the 2006 allocation and of 50% on the 2004 level. This substantial increase in funding is a clear indication of this Government's commitment to prioritise investment in favour of those most at risk.  Sanction for 15 additional staff was given in 2007 and this brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area.  The staffing complement is comprised of 19 Head Office and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.  The allocation to the NEWB will increase to €10.119 million in 2008.In addition to the NEWB there are some 620 staff, within the education sector, deployed in education disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools) the action plan for educational inclusion which provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The School Completion Programme and the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL) are preventative measures designed to combat issues of poor attendance and early school leaving.  Children at risk of early school leaving are targeted under the School Completion Programme for a variety of extra supports aimed at encouraging them to stay in school.  The supports cover both educational and non-educational interventions and are provided during and outside of school time.  The Home School Community Liaison Scheme works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education.  Consequently work is ongoing to develop appropriate protocols for all agencies and services to work together in collaboration and to ensure that optimum use is made of the resources deployed.Through increased investment and improved services we are determined to optimise access, participation and educational outcomes at every level of the system for disadvantaged groups.I will be keeping the issue of resources for the NEWB under review in light of the rollout of services, the scope for integrated working and any proposals that the Board may put to me in relation to clearly identified priority needs.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE), which has been in operation since 1 January 2005 with over 90 members of staff, works exclusively in supporting students with special educational needs.  The NCSE was established under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act (EPSEN) 2004 to improve the delivery of education services to persons with special educational needs arising from disabilities with particular emphasis on children.  Since it was established in 2005, the NCSE has been responsible for allocating resources for children with special educational needs.  The NCSE has a key role in the delivery of services and operates through a network of special educational needs organisers (SENOs) who act as a focal point of contact for schools and parents.  SENOs are responsible for processing applications from schools for special needs supports and they convey decisions on the applications directly to the schools.  These supports include resource teaching hours, special needs assistant (SNA) support and assistive technology and equipment.  The budgetary allocation for the National Council for Special Education for 2008 is €10.832m and I am satisfied that the NCSE will be able to manage within the 2008 budgetary allocation.Going forward, the NCSE has produced an Implementation Report regarding the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs (EPSEN) Act, which is currently receiving detailed consideration within my Department.  As part of this process, my officials have met with the education partners to obtain their views on the report and its recommendations. Arising from this process and taking account of the Council's implementation report, a Working Group in my Department has been developing proposals for the implementation of the Act and this work will be completed shortly. In this context, I am satisfied that effective progress is being made to advance development of the necessary policy and supports to enable formal commencement of the remaining provisions of the Act.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	622	The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single statutory body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.The Board operates through 5 regional teams, with bases in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Galway and Waterford. A service is provided from 26 locations nationwide.  Staff are deployed in areas of greatest disadvantage and in areas designated under the Government's RAPID programme. In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education.  Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) have been appointed and deployed throughout the country to provide a welfare-focused service to support regular school attendance and discharge the Board's functions locally. EWOs play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs help parents and guardians who are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child and work with local agencies in prioritising children's needs.The NEWB has informed me that it prioritises its service to address the educational welfare needs of the most vulnerable children and young people who are out of school and /or have no school place and that children in care receive priority attention as a vulnerable group.  I am advised that the Educational Welfare Staff of the Board work closely with the HSE Social work staff addressing the educational welfare needs of individual children in care.In addition many children who are excluded from school benefit from the Home Tuition Scheme which is sanctioned by my department.  This initiative makes funding available to parents to provide education at home for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school.  The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.  A total of 628 children have been sanctioned for Home Tuition in the 2007/08 school year.This government is committed to supporting the work of the Board and my Department has sanctioned an additional 15 staff to the NEWB in 2007.  This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area.  The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.It should, however, be remembered that the service provided by the Board is just one aspect of the comprehensive framework that this Government has put in place to improve school attendance and encourage more young people to finish school.  In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs.  In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 620 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of the School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.  Access to these services is being increased with the continued rollout of services under DEIS the Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	624	In line with the requirements of Sustaining Progress, agreement has been reached between the parties to the Teachers' Conciliation Council in relation to the standardisation of the breaks at Christmas, Easter and mid-term in the first and second terms for the school year.Once schools adhere to the agreed standardisation, they have local flexibility in determining how they make up the required number of teaching days, 183 days in respect of Primary and 167 days in respect of Post Primary Schools.  My Department does not centrally determine whether or not a school opts to have a closure for any particular event, once, the overall number of teaching days is delivered by the school over the course of the year.  This approach aims to strike a balance between allowing schools some local discretion while at the same time ensuring that pupils get their full entitlement to education.  It is of course essential that there be the greatest possible consultation with parents and that sufficient notice is given in relation to any school closure.Schools may use their discretionary days, where available, to determine the precise start and end of the school year. However, it is recognised that the commencement of Certificate examinations will mean that post primary schools will not be open for tuition beyond the Friday preceding the June bank holiday in any year.  The expectation is that in order to meet the overall requirement of a minimum of 183 days at primary level or 167 at post primary level the school year will normally commence in the week that 1 September falls.In reality most post primary schools would not have any discretionary days, but where they do, the arrangements provide some limited flexibility to schools on certain other days outside of the defined periods at Christmas, Easter and mid-term.

The scheme is not intended to leave schools with significant fundraising needs but for schools to tailor the scope of capital works commissioned to the available funding.An appeal was recently received from the school referred to by the Deputy requesting an increased grant.  The appeal was examined and additional funding was approved for the school.

This support consists mainly of grant-in-aid assistance for national and major regional youth work organisations under the Youth Service Grant Scheme, targeted youth work responses for young people through the Special Projects for Youth Scheme and support for youth clubs and groups at a local level through the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme.The budget of €43,733m to the main funding line for youth work will allow for the continued consolidation of existing provision which will in turn positively impact on local services, and will support the further roll-out of the Youth Work Act, 2001 and the National Youth Work Development Plan on a phased and prioritised basis.My Department has no direct involvement in Youth Cafés.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	630	In order to provide greater choice and to cater for the requirements of an increasingly pluralist society, my Department is developing a new model of primary school patronage which will cater for the diversity of religious faiths represented in growing urban areas.  It is also intended to cater for the wishes of parents who do not wish to have their children follow a programme of religious instruction. This new model of community primary school will be piloted next year in Dublin under the patronage of Co. Dublin VEC. Consultations have taken place with all of the education partners in the context of the development of this new model of patronage and many of the issues mentioned by the Deputy have arisen in the course of these consultations.I accept that providing sufficient pupil places in all rapidly developing areas, including those with large immigrant communities, is absolutely vital to ensuring that enrolment policies do not lead to the exclusion of any child on religious or ethnic grounds and to this end, the Government is committed to substantially increasing the level of school accommodation in rapidly developing areas under the €4.5 billion school building programme included in the National Development Plan.The Government is also committed to integration as set out in the National Action Plan against Racism and it is the policy of my Department to ensure there is no discrimination in the provision of education in this country.

The information in respect of the school year 2006-07 is contained in my Department's published "List of Post-Primary Schools", a copy of which is provided to each member of Dáil Éireann annually.  I have asked that another copy be forwarded to the Deputy through the post.

However, based on the number of children enrolled in fifth classes in 2006/07, the expected number of children leaving primary schools will be 970.There are six post primary schools currently serving the Dublin 15 area and in September 2008 a new Community College under the patronage of Co. Dublin VEC will open in Phibblestown. These schools will between them have capacity for first year enrolment in the region of 1,050.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	636	As the Deputy may be aware I have made a particular point of visiting as many schools as possible as well as attending school openings.  This practice affords the opportunity of engaging with principals, teachers, pupils and parents and allows me and them to raise issues of interest and concern. In the course of a visit to another school I met with the principal of the school referred to by the Deputy.  I took the opportunity that our meeting presented to raise an issue which I considered to be of serious concern.  I know you shared this concern as some of your previous parliamentary questions  raised  this particular issue, which was the failure of the school to open a special unit which had been provided for children with Autistic Spectrum Disorder. The Unit in question had been built at the taxpayers' expense and my Department was willing to provide the appropriate staffing resources.  Despite this the Unit had not opened some four years after the school opened its mainstream classes.My Department's Officials have been in regular contact since 2004 with the School Authorities in an effort to progress the early opening of the autism classes.  My Department's Officials also contacted the Educate Together Patron Body to seek its assistance in opening the classes and the National Council for Special Education also met and was in regular contact with the School on this issue. I am sure the Deputy will agree that the children with autism who could benefit from these facilities have to be accorded priority and it was in this context I raised the issue of the delayed opening with the principal.The Unit in question is now open and I am sure that the pupils and staff will enjoy a positive enriching education system.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	639	In 2004, the Government commissioned a major OECD review of higher education to support Ireland's strategic ambition of placing our higher education system at the front rank of the OECD in the context of the wider national objective of developing as a world leading knowledge economy and society.  A key recommendation of the OECD report was that Ireland should retain the differentiation in mission of the university and institute of technology sectors, which it identified as a key strength of our system, and that there should be no institutional transfers into the university system for the foreseeable future.  The report also recommended that the universities and institutes of technology should be brought together under the remit of a single authority for the purpose of achieving a unified higher education strategy.The Institutes of Technology Act 2006 addresses significant elements of these recommendations and marks a major milestone for the sector and for the development of higher education in Ireland.In February 2006 the Governing Body of Waterford Institute of Technology wrote to the Department of Education and Science requesting a review of its status under Section 9 of the Universities Act 1997. To assist in the assessment of Waterford IT's application, I appointed Dr. Jim Port in February 2007 to provide preliminary advice on the merits of the submission by WIT, having regard to; (i) the national strategy for the development of Irish higher education, (ii) implications for regional development in the South-East in the context of the National Spatial Strategy and (iii) any likely implications for the overall structure of higher education in Ireland. Dr Port's report has been received and is currently under consideration.There are significant wider policy issues that need to be considered in advance of any possible statutory review and I am currently considering these in the light of Dr Port's report.

A recruit may not be finally approved unless he/she is considered suitable in all respects for service in the Permanent Defence Force.  This person participated in the training process and undertook Regimental Duties as part of his recruit training. He had been made aware on several occasions during his training that his performance was not meeting the required standards. At the completion of his probationary period he was not finally approved and, accordingly, was not passed out.I am advised that the person concerned, as a member of No 15 Recruit Platoon, was asked by his fellow recruits to contribute to a Platoon Fund to help finance an unofficial function organised by the recruits in a local hotel after the official passing out ceremony. I am further advised that he has been reimbursed all the monies he contributed to this fund and has furnished a receipt to confirm same.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	652	I am informed by the Garda Authorities that there are presently 49 Community Alert Schemes in operation in Kildare, which represents an increase of 10 Schemes in the past five years.The Community Alert Programme is a community-based initiative in rural communities, set up in 1985 by Muintir na Tíre in association with the Garda authorities. There are around 1,300 Community Alert groups nationwide dedicated in particular to improving the quality of life of vulnerable people in rural communities, especially the elderly, bycrime preventionneighbourliness and self-reliancegeneral community safety and well-beingaccident preventionpromotion of personal safety, andawareness of social inclusion.The relationship between Muintir na Tíre and An Garda Síochána is formalised in a Memorandum of Understanding between the two organisations on the development and operation of the Programme.  A review of the Programme resulted in the publication recently of a strategy which sets out the priorities for the organisation over the coming years. The success of the Programme is due primarily to the fact that it is community driven and serves the needs of the local community.  Issues of local importance are identified by local volunteers and they are addressed collectively in partnership with the Garda Síochána.My Department has provided funding of €150,000 in 2004, €120,000 in 2005, €175,000 in 2006 and €200,000 in 2007 to the Programme. The funding supports the coordinator and three of the five Development Officers employed by the Programme, while a further two development officers are supported by the Department of Health and Children through the HSE.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	653	As I have outlined in response to previous Questions on this issue the internet, by its very nature and despite its many advantages, lends itself to being used for a wide range of criminal activities. These can include illegal pornography, racist or hate materials, financial fraud, intimidation or any other criminal activity carried out via the internet. Combatting such illegal, harmful and predatory use of the internet requires a response at national, EU and wider international levels. The internet is an international and world-wide phenomenon with no borders and no single organisation controlling it. Measures to combat illegal materials and activities on the internet are, therefore, influenced by a multiplicity of jurisdictions, differing legal systems, and differing societal norms. Furthermore, new developments in communications technologies allowing for internet access by new means are a regular occurrence. These are largely positive developments but also bring particular challenges for those charged with protecting against the downsides of the internet.A combination of responses  and the co-operation of all the stakeholders, at both national and international level — legislators, law enforcement, schools, child protection practitioners, parents and guardians — is essential.  My Department is fully committed to playing its part in a pro-active way.One of my first steps as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was to provide for the establishment of the Office for Internet Safety (OIS) as an executive office within my Department.  As I outlined previously, arrangements for the staffing and headquartering of this new Office are well advanced.  The new Office will continue to build on the work of the Internet Advisory Board which was set up in February, 2002 following the Report of the Working Group on the Illegal and Harmful use of the Internet.    It will oversee and further develop the self-regulatory regime for the Irish internet service providers, encourage best practice procedures; promote awareness of the internet downside issues and provide advice and facilitate research on internet related issues regarding child safety. The overall objective of the Office will be to make the internet a safer place for users, and particularly for children.In terms of using technology to counter the most harmful effects of the internet, the Office will be tasked with investigating, in conjunction with An Garda Síochána, the issue of applying blocking technology to the internet.  The Office will also consider the possibility of operating some form of symbol assignment to content as a method of rating such content as age appropriate within Ireland.  The OIS will  continue to oversee the operation of the Hotline (www.hotline.ie — the system for dealing with reports of illegal content on the internet). The Hotline is funded by the Internet Service Providers' Association of Ireland with support from the EU Safer Internet Action Plan.  It accepts and investigates reports from the public in relation to child pornography and other illegal material on the internet.I launched two new booklets in the GET with IT! Series on behalf of the Internet Advisory Board (IAB) earlier this year. The first booklet "Get with IT" A Parents Guide to new media technologies is an update on the Board's first "Get with IT" booklet which was originally published in September, 2005 and was a major success. That booklet gave an overview of new technologies for parents in an effort to address their potential worries about the dangers of the new media for their children.   The second booklet  "Get with IT" A Parents' Guide to filtering technologies helps parents navigate the processes of how to use filtering technology.  This latter booklet offers practical advice to parents and others on how best to use readily available tools to filter out unacceptable material.  The booklets are available free of charge from my Department, and are also available on my Department's website, and on the website of the IAB.In terms of legislation, in the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act, 1998, Ireland has one of the most robust pieces of legislation anywhere.  Under the Act, the possession, distribution, importation and exportation or sale of all forms of child pornography — films, video or material in written or auditory form including material produced or transmitted via the internet — are offences with penalties of up to 14 years' imprisonment. Mere possession of child pornography can be punishable by imprisonment for up to 5 years.  Using a child or allowing a child to be used for the production of child pornography is also punishable by up to 14 years' imprisonment.I am informed by the Garda Authorities that they monitor child pornography on the internet and where evidence is available action is taken in accordance with legislation.  I understand that An Garda Síochána, in conjunction with its EU colleagues, is currently examining new methods of preventing the production and distribution of child pornography on the internet.International co-operation is a vital part of the fight against child pornography on the internet, and Ireland is fully committed to playing its part. The Deputy may be aware that the European Union has taken a strong line on combating child pornography and other illegal and harmful uses of the internet.  Since 1999, under the Safer Internet Action Plan, the EU has provided financial and other supports for measures in the member states to combat illegal and harmful uses of the internet, with particular emphasis on protecting children.  A new EU action plan — Safer Internet Plus — covering the period 2005 to 2008, and with a budget of €45m, was agreed under the Irish Presidency in June 2004 and is now in operation.  My Department is represented on the management committee for the Safer Internet Plus programme.My Department is fully committed to co-operating with and promoting internet safety measures nationally, at EU level and on the wider international level.

The Scheme will give effect in Irish law to Directive 2005/60/EC known as the Third EU Money Laundering Directive.  It will also take into account relevant recommendations arising from the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) third mutual evaluation report (2006) on Ireland's measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism (which have largely been embodied in the Third EU Money Laundering Directive), as well as relevant Council of Europe requirements.I expect to be in a position to submit the General Scheme to Government for approval early in the new year.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO is examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

Ardfinnan and Clogheen Garda Stations form part of the Tipperary Garda Division. The personnel strength of the Tipperary Garda Division on 30 November, 2007 ( the latest date for which figures are readily available ) was 362.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Garda Stations referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.

He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why he should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leaving the State before an order is made; or consenting to the making of a deportation order.  In addition, he was notified that he was eligible to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with regulations known as the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, S.I. 518 of 2006 which came into force on 10 October, 2006.No representations have been received on behalf of the person concerned to date.  The case  will be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), as amended.

At that time, this Unit would have taken a lead role in Regional drug initiatives and operations in conjunction with the Garda National Drugs Unit.Between 1998 and the present day, under the commitment of An Garda Síochána to the National Drug Strategy, Divisional and District Drug Units have been established nationwide, including additional Divisional Drug Units in the Southern Region. The current strength of the Cork City Divisional Drug Unit is 17. The combined strength of all Divisional Drug Units in Cork City and County is now 31.The Cork City Divisional Drugs Unit is focused on Divisional operations. It leads intelligence driven and targeted operations and is supported in this Divisional responsibility by significant other resources, including specialist and plain-clothes personnel to combat organised and drug-related crime in the Division.Expertise has also been developed in the Division by secondment of other divisional members to the Divisional Drug Unit, thereby enabling an increased level of activity on the street and cohesive operations across the Division. In addition to this of course, every member of An Garda Síochána is tasked with the enforcement of legislation, including drug-related legislation.Garda personnel assigned throughout the country, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy, are continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and the best possible Garda service is provided to the general public.

Passage West Garda Station forms part of the Cork City Division. The personnel strength of Cork City Division on 30 November, 2007 (the latest date for which figures are readily available) was 658. Local Garda Management report that they reallocated personnel within the Togher Garda District, which Passage West forms part of, to enhance the Garda service provided across the District.The Deputy will appreciate that, as with any large organisation, on any given day the overall strength of the organisation may fluctuate due, for example, to  retirements, resignations etc.It is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner to allocate personnel throughout the Force taking everything into account. The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of the Garda Station referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered by the Commissioner within the overall context of the needs of Garda Divisions throughout the country.

This facilitates the criminal in stealing by using illegally obtained data.An Garda Síochána has noted a recent increase in this type of criminality and a Working Group chaired by the Assistant Commissioner with responsibility for the Dublin Metropolitan Region has been established to target this type of crime. The increase is also being addressed by security measures introduced by the financial institutions together with increased Garda attention to ATM machines nationwide. Incidents of so-called ‘skimming' are reported to the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation (IPSO) by the relevant financial institutions as soon as fraud is established.  This in turn is reported to and circulated by An Garda Síochána. A nationwide roll-out of a Garda initiative targeting these crimes is planned for 2008.An Garda Síochána is in constant liaison with the financial institutions with a view to tackling ATM fraud.  This is being targeted through various fora, including bi-monthly meetings of the ATM Fraud Forum comprising representatives from the various financial institutions and An Garda Síochána, and is chaired by the Irish Payment Card Services Organisation (IPSO).This type of criminal activity is also addressed through the Hi-Tech Crime Forum which comprises representatives of the banking institutions, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, the Internet Service Providers, IPSO and other stakeholders as deemed appropriate. This forum meets every two months.Any perceived weaknesses or new attack methods identified are discussed at these meetings so that counter-measures can be identified to prevent further occurrences.The following table shows the number of such incidents recorded as having occurred in Carlow/ Kildare Division:YearNo of incidents (Carlow/Kildare Division)2007*21220063220054*Statistics provided for 2007 are operational, provisional and liable to change.

The purpose of the scheme is to engage local communities in enhancing community safety by supporting the Gardaí to tackle criminal and antisocial behaviour and also in helping to counteract the fear of crime.  The scheme is administered on behalf of my Department by Pobal which carries out thorough evaluations of each application under the scheme and also provides advice and assistance to applicants.  Pobal has not evaluated the Community-based CCTV Scheme as yet.  Projects funded under the scheme began to come on stream gradually throughout 2007 and it is considered too early to undertake an evaluation at this stage.  However, planning for such an initial evaluation is currently underway.  The only significant changes which have been introduced to the Community-based CCTV Scheme since it was introduced in 2005 are those arising from the Garda Síochána Act 2005, which came into effect in 2006.  These relate to the requirement for all proposals to be authorised by the Garda Commissioner and the role of the relevant local Joint Policing Committee.  All of the projects which are up and running are subject to monitoring.  However, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate to indicate precise monitoring arrangements at each location.  In addition to monitoring of images, images are recorded and can be reviewed at short notice when required.

The day-to-day administration of the Scheme is carried out by Pobal on behalf of my Department.  Under the Scheme grant funding is provided by my Department to local groups to assist with the capital costs of installing a CCTV system.  Matching funding is available to successful applications from RAPID areas from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  Public and private CCTV systems are an invaluable source of information and intelligence to An Garda Síochána in the prevention and detection of criminal activity.  I am informed by the Garda authorities that the specific information requested by the Deputy relating to CCTV systems is not readily available and would require a disproportionate expenditure of Garda time and resources to collate.

The Garda Síochána Act 2005 consequently makes provision for this and the CSO has established a dedicated unit for this purpose.  Following the setting up of the necessary technical systems and auditing of the data from which the statistics are compiled, the CSO is now compiling and publishing criminal statistics and has published provisional headline crime statistics since the third quarter of 2006.  In addition, it has compiled and published a series of quarterly and annual statistics for the period starting with the first quarter of 2003.  I understand that the CSO are examining how the crime statistics published might be expanded and made more comprehensive.  I have requested the CSO to provide the statistics sought by the Deputy directly to him.

However, the proposed Immigration, Residence and Protection Bill will, for the first time, make statutory provision for a status of long term resident.  The most recent application for long term residency from the person referred to by the Deputy was received on 14 September 2006.  The position in relation to granting long term residency is as follows: Persons who have been legally resident in the State for over five years on the basis of work permit/work authorisation/work visa conditions may apply to the Immigration Division of my Department for a five year residency extension. In that context they may also apply to be exempt from employment permit requirements.  The dependants of the aforementioned, who have been legally resident in the State for over five years may also apply for long term residency.  This particular long term permission does not exempt the person from employment permit requirements.  Time spent in the State on student conditions cannot be counted towards long term residency.  I understand that applications for long term residency received in July 2006 are currently being dealt with.  As soon as a decision is made on the case, the person concerned will be notified.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	680	I propose to take Questions Nos. 387 to 389, inclusive, together.Section 4(2) of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides that I, as Minister, may, by reason of size, nature or limited effect upon its surroundings, by Regulation, provide exemptions for a particular class of development provided that development is not contrary to the principles of proper planning and sustainable development.In presenting the proposed exemptions referred to for public consultation, I am seeking to achieve this as a means of encouraging uptake of renewable energy and remove from planning permission requirements classes of development which would have limited effect upon their surroundings.  The introduction of a mandatory referral process would undo the impact of the proposed exemption by replacing one determinative process with another.In relation to the application of restrictions on exemptions set out under article 9 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001, it is a matter for planning authorities to identify, through the development plan, any landscape, or a view or prospect of special amenity area value or special interest.  Where a planning authority includes the preservation of any such area as an objective of the development plan or of the draft variation or draft development plan, exemptions from planning permission requirements do not apply.Advertisements announcing the commencement of a public consultation on the proposed exemptions were placed in the following newspapers on 25 October:The Examiner;The Irish Times;The Irish Independent;The Star.I also issued a press release to the local and national media on the same day and my Department directly circulated the consultation paper to a wide range of organisations inviting their views, including all planning authorities, a number of Government Departments, the National Consumer Agency, the Irish Farmers Association, Sustainable Energy Ireland and various renewable energy industry groups.I am satisfied that 3 months is an appropriate consultation period and have no plans to extend it. It should be noted that this is a relatively lengthy consultation process, well beyond, for example, the normal 8-week period allowed by the European Commission, for completion of written consultations.The consultation process is ongoing and it is, of course, open to any person to make a submission to my Department on any aspect of the proposed exemptions set out in the consultation document, including the proposed conditions relating to scale and siting of technologies, before 18 January 2008.  As outlined previously, the final draft amendments must also then be laid before the Oireachtas for approval.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	682	Section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 provides local authorities with powers to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise from commercial premises.  This provision was enacted in an environmental protection context and was not, therefore, intended to apply to internal sound levels in any premises.  Issues in relation to the impact of internal sound are, I understand, a matter for the Health and Safety Authority.Under the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Noise) Regulations 1994, a person may also seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated, including noise from discos, pubs and other social venues. The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation.In addition to the above, I understand that under Section 4 of the Courts (No. 2) Act 1986, any person is entitled to object to the renewal of an intoxicating liquor licence at the annual Licensing Court.In accordance with the Programme for Government, I am currently examining options to strengthen legislation on noise pollution.

No. 140 of 2006) give effect in Ireland to EU Directive 2002/49/EC relating to the assessment and management of environmental noise.  The Environmental Protection Agency is the national authority with overall responsibility for implementing the Regulations.At local level, implementation of strategic mapping requirements is a matter for the relevant noise-mapping bodies designated in Article 6 of the Regulations and any action required on foot of the noise mapping process, including the determination of responsibility for funding such action, is a matter for the action planning authorities designated in Article 7.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	685	Under Article 7(2) of the European Union (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, local authorities are responsible for monitoring and testing drinking water supplies and authorities make their own arrangements in that regard.  Article 7(12) of the Regulations assigns responsibility to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for oversight of local authorities' functions in relation to the monitoring and testing of drinking water.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Recent annual reports by the Environmental Protection Agency on the quality of drinking water in Ireland indicate a sustained increase in the overall rate of compliance with all prescribed standards, from 96.1% in 2003 to 96.4% in 2004, and to 96.7% in the most recently published report for 2005.  Notwithstanding these high overall compliance rates, the reports, nevertheless, have drawn attention to water quality problems in certain private group water schemes in particular, and to the shortfall in the levels of monitoring by local authorities of water supplies, particularly in these group schemes.Statutory controls were, therefore, strengthened under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations 2007 to underpin comprehensive supervision and monitoring regimes for both local authority and group water scheme supplies.  The Regulations provide for supervision of local authority water supplies by the Environmental Protection Agency, and for the supervision of group water supplies by local authorities.  In each case, the relevant supervisory authority has new powers of direct intervention, if required, to ensure that measures are taken to achieve compliance with prescribed water quality standards.The Water Services Act 2007 provides for the introduction of a licensing system for group water scheme supplies, under local authority supervision.I envisage that these provisions will strengthen considerably the level of monitoring and enforcement in relation to drinking water supplies, and will ensure adequacy and consistency in monitoring performance in drinking water supplies throughout the State.The Government continues to invest very considerable resources in water services  infrastructure, with some €4.7 billion provided under the new National Development Plan (2007 to 2013), in addition to the unprecedented investment of €3.7 billion under the previous Plan.  Significant increases in water treatment capacity and improvements in distribution systems are being achieved as a result.  Water supply schemes completed in the period 1997 to 2006 have already produced additional drinking water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of some 1.2 million.Substantially increased sums have been invested in resolving group scheme difficulties in meeting drinking water standards.  Some €130 million was invested in the Rural Water Programme in 2006 — twice what was spent in 2002, and three times more than the corresponding expenditure in 2000.A comprehensive overhaul of sewage collection and treatment infrastructure has also been undertaken nationally to tackle pollution of surface and ground water from which water supplies are abstracted, and the capacity of Ireland's wastewater treatment infrastructure was increased by a population equivalent of 3.1m under the last National Development Plan.

Both the public consultation process and subsequent press comment pointed to the desirability of members of the public being given reasonable notice of any tax changes being introduced and the need for an acceptable lead-in period for the motor trade.It was against this background that 1 July 2008 was chosen as the starting date for both the  new motor  tax and VRT  systems.  The aim of the new system is to influence the purchasing decisions of consumers in the future.  It would be unfair to penalise car owners for a purchasing decision made in the past.Finally, I would add that the proposal for an EU Directive on passenger car-related taxes applies to cars registered for the first time in a Member State.

When the issue of pyrite arose, and following an intervention from my Department, the NSAI moved quickly to reconvene their Aggregates Panel in order to give urgent consideration to publication of additional guidance in relation to appropriate protocols for testing underfloor infill material.  My Department is represented on this Panel, together with representatives of the construction industry.Following a public consultation process, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)  has now published a new Standard Recommendation, which is a definitive amendment to  SR 21 — Guidance on the use of (Irish Standard) I.S. EN 13242:2002 — Aggregates for unbound and hydraulically bound materials for use in civil engineering work and road construction, and incorporating amendment 1:2007.  The Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and the intention is that it will address the quality standards of new homes insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  It is now my intention to adopt this NSAI Standard Recommendation in the relevant Technical Guidance Document to the Building Regulations.The national Building Regulations set out the legal requirements for the construction of houses. The related Technical Guidance Documents (TGD) provide technical guidance on how to comply with the Regulations. Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations rests with the builder and the owner of the building.Enforcement is a matter for the 37 local Building Control Authorities, which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, when considered necessary.  I understand that Fingal County Council has been in direct contact with the developers and the quarry concerned in relation to problems encountered following the use of pyrite as an underfloor infill material in certain developments.Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, my Department issued a circular letter, BC 6/2007, to each County Manager and local Building Control Authority, on 16 August 2007, to bring the issue to their notice and to request their co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements. The Circular letter also brought to their attention a Notice Issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.The resolution of any problems arising between home owners and their builders are ultimately matters for resolution between the parties concerned — the homeowner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurer.  Where the construction of a house is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder, enforcement of this contract is a civil matter..

These range from standard local authority rented housing to loans for improvements and grants for adaptation of existing houses.  In assessing applications for accommodation, authorities have been asked to ensure that applicants are made aware of the full range of options available and to establish the most suitable response to an individual's need.  In addition, local authorities enable the voluntary and cooperative housing sector, through their housing schemes, particularly the Capital Assistance Scheme which is funded by my Department, to provide accommodation for people with a disability.My Department's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, published earlier this year, reflects the commitment in Towards 2016 to develop a national housing strategy for people with a disability, by end 2009.  Work has commenced on the development of this strategy which is being progressed by a National Advisory Group under the aegis of the Housing Forum, headed by my Department and involving the Department of Health and Children, the Health Services Executive, social partners and other relevant stakeholders including the National Disability Authority.  The strategy, which will give a broad framework to inform the future development of local authority Housing Action Plans, will support the provision of tailored housing and housing supports for people with a disability and have particular regard to adults with significant disabilities and people who experience mental health issues.

In this regard local authorities are required to put in place arrangements to ensure that systems, procedures and time frames equivalent to those used by them in relation to correspondence from local authority members also apply in respect of parliamentary representatives.My Department has gathered information from local authorities on the practical application of the arrangements for the supply of specified information to Oireachtas members under the Local Government Act 2001 (Section 237A) Regulations 2003.  Based on the information received, I understand that local authorities are, for the most part, complying with these arrangements.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Details of broadband services available throughout the country are available on my Department's website (www.dcenr.ie).The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In order to address this issue the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is currently under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.  The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.The first phase of the procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ))   is now complete, and four candidates have pre-qualified to enter the next phase of the procurement process.  As my Department indicated on 2 September 2007, the four candidates are, in alphabetical order, BT Communications Ireland Ltd Consortium, Eircom Ltd, Hutchinson 3G Ireland Ltd and IFA/Motorola Consortium.  The Department has invited these remaining candidates to participate in the "Competitive Dialogue" phase of the procurement process and to present their proposed solutions to meet the Department's requirements for the delivery of broadband to the unserved areas of the country. It is anticipated that a preferred bidder will be selected and appointed in June 2008.

The North South interconnector is scheduled to be delivered by 2011 and will more than double the existing cross border electricity transfer capacity to over 680MW.EirGrid and the Commission for Energy Regulation are working to schedule on the delivery of the East West electricity interconnector by 2012.  The interconnector will provide 500MW of capacity and which will remain in State ownership vested in EirGrid.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I propose to take Questions Nos. 412 and 414 together.The Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government set the overall strategic directions for energy security of supply, sustainability and competitiveness.  The Single Wholesale Electricity Market came into operation on 1 November 2007 and will contribute to the reliability and security of supply of electricity on the island of Ireland and which will overtime deliver more competitive energy prices for business and consumers on the island.The Energy Policy Framework sets out a range of actions for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity including:ensuring the progressive reduction in ESB's market share in power generation to around 40% in an all-island market context by 2010 through the CER-ESB Asset Strategy Agreement of November 2006;the development of a land bank of ESB owned sites by 2008 to facilitate independent power generation investment up to 2020;the retention of the electricity network infrastructures as strategic national assets in State ownership;the establishment of EirGrid as the National Transmission Grid Company by end 2008, transferring to EirGrid ownership of the transmission assets;ensuring the full operational independence of the Distribution System Operator as an ESB subsidiary by completing its legal unbundling.Immediate priority is being given to creating the right environment for delivering sufficient generation capacity and ensuring sustained investment in electricity networks while delivering enhanced levels of interconnection within the next five years. The reduction in ESB's market share in power generation and the implementation of the CER-ESB Asset Strategy will improve the investment potential of the Irish market. Ensuring Ireland's generation adequacy position between 2007 and 2011 and planning for adequacy beyond 2012 is an immediate and critical priority which will require close cooperation between EirGrid, CER and my Department as well as existing and potential new players in the power generation sector.We have also set ambitious and essential targets for the increased penetration of renewable energy.  Connected wind capacity will reach over 900 MW by year end, which will represent a very significant increase of over 25% of installed wind capacity since the start of 2007.  It is also a priority to ensure the provision of sufficient flexible generation plant to accommodate electricity coming on to the system from wind generation.In relation to the transmission system, the decision to transfer the transmission assets to EirGrid, establishing it as both the owner and the operator of the national transmission system will reduce the amount of heavy regulation and duplication on both EirGrid and ESB and will deliver efficiencies and significantly reduced overheads for EirGrid.  Above all, combining the ownership and operation of the transmission system in EirGrid will deliver confidence to all market players that the system is run in a non-discriminatory way.The unbundling of the distribution system operator as a legally independent subsidiary of ESB will ensure efficient and non-discriminatory access to the distribution system and encourage effective competition in the electricity market.

The decision to revise the fiscal licensing terms followed an independent review that included a comparative analysis of eight other exploration areas.  That review had regard to energy prices, water depths, operating and capital costs, along with the key consideration of Ireland's relative prospects as a location for exploration investment.  The review recommended that Ireland's fiscal terms should be revised to provide for a higher tax take in the case of more profitable fields while holding the tax take at 25% in the case of more marginal fields.  The decision provides for a tax take of up to 40% in the case of more profitable fields.  I also revised the non-fiscal licensing terms with a view to ensuring that exploration is conducted in both a timely and effective manner.I am satisfied that Ireland's revised licensing terms strike the right balance.  They are designed to attract what is mobile international investment, while ensuring a fair return to the State for its natural resources.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2007-12-19 00:00:00	Prelude	710	I propose to take Questions Nos. 422, 425 and 426 together.I understand from the developers, Shell E&P Ireland Ltd, that they expect that first gas will be available in late 2009.  I would add, however, that completion of development works by the developer is clearly the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  At peak production the Corrib Gas Field has the potential to provide up to 60% of Ireland's gas requirements.Since my appointment as Minister I have met the developers of the project and have also had discussions with parties who are interested in the project.Consultants engaged by the developers of the Corrib Gas Field are continuing to focus on identifying a modified onshore pipeline route as recommended by the independent mediator Mr Peter Cassells, within the core area around the three indicative route corridor options presented to the public on 19th September 2007.  The process of consultation continues and consultants for the developers have carried out further environmental and technical studies, which I understand have led to variations of two of the three indicative corridor options.  Consultation around the three indicative corridor options and their variations are due to continue until mid January 2008.  After that date the developers will move towards selecting a final preferred route.Once a preferred route is selected it will be necessary for the developers to make application to me under the Gas Act, 1976 for consent to construct the pipeline.  In addition, consent from An Bord Pleanála will also be required under the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act, 2006.It would not be appropriate for me, having regard to my regulatory role, to express a preference for any particular pipeline route for the Corrib Gas Project.

Based on their analysis and on detailed engagement with each of the power generators, EirGrid forecast that electricity generating capacity will be sufficient to meet demand this winter.  This is in line with EirGrid's previous medium-term generation adequacy forecasts.Since August, EirGrid has provided regular updates on the outlook for generation adequacy this winter.  In light of a number of forced outages at ESB plants EirGrid now calculates that generating capacity of 5,700 megawatts will be available this winter to meet demand.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, (ComReg).The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These include investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are allowing the private sector service providers to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under Phase One and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.Phase Two of the MANs Programme is currently underway.  Networks have been completed in 21 towns to date and are under construction in a further 45 towns.The National Broadband Scheme which will be implemented next year will provide broadband coverage to those areas of the country that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.My Department is also preparing a draft policy paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks which will consider the optimum role for Government in facilitating the roll out of high speed broadband networks.  I expect to publish the draft policy paper on Next Generation Broadband Networks for consultation early in the New Year.

A further 20 staff members are ‘in post' in Dublin, pending planned decentralisation to Cavan, which is currently scheduled for end 2009.As regards SEI, temporary accommodation has very recently been acquired in Dundalk pending a permanent move and thus far two persons have located in the decentralised location.  Neither has transferred from a location outside Dublin or in post.In relation to the CFB no person has transferred to the proposed decentralised location as yet.
