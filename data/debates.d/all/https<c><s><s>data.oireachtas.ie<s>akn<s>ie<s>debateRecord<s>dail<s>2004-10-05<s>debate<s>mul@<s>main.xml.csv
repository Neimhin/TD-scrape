#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.There are no proposals to decentralise any part of my Department or any of the bodies under its aegis. As of 7 September last, 44 members of staff in my Department had applied through the central applications facility to relocate under the decentralisation programme. The breakdown by grade is assistant principal — six; administrative officer — eight; higher executive officer — four; executive officer — 12; staff officer — two; clerical officer — 11; and general operative — one. The transfer of staff will take place on a planned basis and it is not anticipated that it will in any way impact negatively on the work of the Department.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Is the Taoiseach happy with the situation whereby his Department will be left in situ, as will the Department of Finance while central policy units of other Departments are expected to be moved to other parts of the country? Does the Taoiseach expect that to have an adverse effect on his Department and the Department of Finance?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I do not think it will have an adverse effect on Departments. The main criteria used to select Departments and agencies for decentralisation, which were obviously used when examining the case of my Department, were set out in the budget last year. The underlying principle of the programme was the continuity of effective public service delivery, and this was one of the factors taken into account both in the selection of Departments for decentralisation and the location of those which would not be decentralised. That covered my Department. It was decided not to transfer any sections of the Department of the Taoiseach out of Dublin taking into account the core business of the Department, the relatively small number of staff and the need to ensure that any sections being transferred would be of sufficient size to constitute viable working units. I am sure that in considering the optimum location for my Department, which is one of the smaller Departments, the Minister for Finance took into account how the Department could best support me in performing my constitutional duties as Head of Government.Although 20% of people at all levels, a significant number, have opted to list their names in the central applications facility process, I do not believe this creates a difficulty for the Department. Obviously all the criteria and issues of staffing, training and movement have been covered in the recent report of the implementation group. My views have also been taken into account by the group.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	17	The Taoiseach quite rightly referred to the criteria used for the selection of Departments to be decentralised from Dublin. Is it not a fact that of the 10,000 posts to be decentralised, just 3,500 have applied to move to one of these posts and only 1,800 have agreed to move beyond greater Dublin?

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	27	In the Taoiseach's assessment, what impact will there be on his Department and its policy-making unit if eight other Ministers are to have their Departments and central policy units decentralised to various locations throughout the country? Has the Government carried out an assessment of that and does it show that it is in the national interest to proceed on that basis with the decentralisation programme?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	28	While I abide by the Ceann Comhairle's ruling, may I say that under the criteria, a sizeable number of people, including a sizeable number in my Department, are to be located under the CAF. All issues of industrial relations, information and communications technology, the Civil Service in the aftermath of decentralisation — something which obviously affects my Department — property and finance are addressed in the reports of March and September and are being analysed in considerable detail with decisions taken as matters proceed. It is a comprehensive assessment of all aspects of all these issues. I am aware that the relevant people currently working on this will make a presentation tomorrow to a committee of the House. To answer Deputy Kenny's question, as regards my Department, all these things are of interest and have a bearing, but I do not see difficulties with these issues from a policy point of view.I envisage information technology and conferencing facilities being used, as happens in every small business, never mind large businesses. Next month we will be using technology at the Cabinet having piloted it in Departments for the past year. I do not see any difficulties. Multinational companies employing 300,000 or 400,000 people on several continents are able to coherently organise their business. It will not be a problem, therefore, for the Irish public service, employing 25,000 in about 50 locations in 25 counties, to do likewise. There will be problems and obstacles in getting to this position in an operational sense, but I do not foresee a problem of any great magnitude.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	31	If there is a logic in not decentralising the Department of the Taoiseach, could the same logic apply to other areas? However, the opportunistic and hasty way in which the Government made the announcement, inappropriately in the course of a budget speech, did not allow for a proper examination of that. If I have heard the Taoiseach correctly some 44 members of his Department have applied to be decentralised. What percentage of the Department in terms of personnel does that constitute and how does it compare to other Departments? In what timescale does he expect those people in his Department to be redeployed?Deputy McCreevy, before the Taoiseach gave him his bag of bullseyes and sent him to Brussels, had declared categorically that 2007 was to be deadline for the achievement of decentralisation. The Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, on the other hand——
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	32	The question refers specifically to the Taoiseach's Department.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I am aware of that but I have to put my question in the context of the Minister who made the policy. I want to find out how aspects of the policy appertain the Department of the Taoiseach because the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, the junior Minister, though surely not in his own mind, told the House that 2007 was only an indicative date. Will the Taoiseach say whether decentralisation in his Department will be completed in 2007 or what date does he expect that to take place?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I do not wish to repeat what I said in answer to Deputy Kenny. Criteria were taken into account and it was not a rushed decision for the last budget. Various tranches of decentralisation have happened over many years. A substantial amount of decentralisation took place when I was Minister for Finance some 12 years ago, affecting the Departments of Social Welfare and Justice, the Revenue Commissioners, CSO and other areas. It is an ongoing process and there was an examination of what we should do in future. About 20% of the staff in my Department have expressed a desire to be decentralised. The Deputy asked how this compares to other Departments. More clerical officers are interested in moving to new locations than there are jobs.The figure for executive officers is about 85%, for higher executive officers is 74%, for assistant principal officers is 67% and for principal officers is 38%. As people get older they are less inclined to move. Overall, the total number of civil servant applications for the new Civil Service locations equates to about 83% of the number of Civil Service jobs available in those locations. There are 47 locations and in the case of 28, applications exceed 80% of the total number of posts available and in 18 of these locations, the total number of applications exceeds the number of posts available. Some of them are internal, some are external. Some people have already moved or want to move to existing locations. It will mean an orderly move over time. The Government stated last year that we would make substantial progress before 2007, and we will do that. We cannot simply build on the greenfield sites; we have to go through a planning process and see how that operates but all these things are moving effectively and my Department will comply with the regulations set out by the Department of Finance.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Has the Taoiseach's Department, as a consequence of the programme generally, taken account of the expert evidence given to the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service to the effect that this was not a decentralisation programme but is about the dispersal of civil servants, that it has nothing to do with decentralisation which involves devolution of real power? Is he now resiling from the notion abroad that the foot has been taken off the accelerator on this issue since the debacle of the local and European elections and that the original programme for his Department, and every other Department, is no longer feasible? The Minister responsible for driving it has said words to that effect. Is the Taoiseach resiling from that? Has any quantification been done in his Department of the implications of dispersing the eight other Departments to 53 locations around the country? Is the Taoiseach telling the House that he thinks he can conduct the governance of this country by teleconferencing or video conferencing? I know some of his colleagues on the Front Bench might not be all that happy about being in the same room as him but video conferencing appears to be taking it a step too far. Is the Taoiseach saying we can do business like that in future, merely because of progress made in information technology and so on?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Deputy Rabbitte asked if there was any pulling back from the commitment to move 10,300 civil servants to 53 centres in 25 counties. The answer is "no". The Government is committed to doing that and is working with all the expertise on the implementation group and various people are helping in different areas to achieve that. I am sure the Minister responsible will answer questions on the report of the Committee on Finance and the Public Service.I have heard all these arguments before — as one gets older one hears the same old nonsense. I remember listening to arguments that Revenue could not be decentralised to Nenagh or the section of the Department dealing with widows could not be located in Sligo, that the world would fall apart.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	40	The fact is that we did away with many of the inefficiencies. If a meeting is being held across Departments we do not need to pull people out of those Departments. Most businesses now use technology to do that on a daily basis, whether it is a meeting on-site or to talk to people in their offices in London, Chicago or wherever. It is normal practice in the world. It is not like the Cabinet meeting which is done collectively and is collectively responsible, but if an assistant secretary wants to talk to another assistant secretary, it is not necessary to meet in one location. We should try not to think in old-fashioned ways that have more to do with gombeen days.

Dr. Walsh and Professor Bannon are experts on the subject and that is the testimony they gave to the committee.

He said we should assess and analyse all of these issues carefully and make decisions based on the criteria. Ed Walsh successfully moved to Limerick 25 years ago as he believed it was not necessary to centralise all third level education in just a few places. When he set up the national Higher Education Authority and developed it into what it is today—

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	60	He came from America, not from Dublin.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Yes, but he moved to Limerick on the basis of decentralisation when he could have gone to any third level institution in Galway, Cork or Dublin at that time. He is in favour of decentralisation, but he urges caution. That is why we asked him to examine areas such as IT, industrial relations and human resource issues, which he mentioned in his speech, and individual implementation plans.I wish to confirm for the Deputy that every Department has had a series of workshops and seminars to help Departments and agencies in preparing their implementation plans. A number of Secretaries General, including the Secretary General in my Department, have met to ascertain the views on issues that arise in implementing the programme. I assure Deputy Rabbitte all those valid issues are being carefully studied. We have also looked at the post-decentralisation Civil Service. My Department is not affected, but we have examined the property and financial aspects and how things could work when decentralisation has been completed.The former Minister for Finance announced last year, with the agreement of the Government, that we would make as much progress as physically possible by 2007. We are doing well. The two reports of March and September highlighted the progress that has been made and there is no need for me to go into it. It is the intention of the implementation group to have identified sites for purchase or existing offices — in most cases it will be greenfield sites — by the end of the year. Planning will then have to be sought and building commenced, and it is hoped that by the end of 2006 many of those will have come through.Obviously, if there are planning difficulties, it will take longer. However, by 2007 a large amount of progress will have been made. Even if it takes somewhat longer than that in a particular area, that would be no harm. The Civil Service will still be here in 2010. I would like to see the greatest progress made in 2007. That would be good for the Civil Service, which has changed fundamentally in two decades. Everyone in the House and in Government can take credit for that.It is good that we are intent on decentralising. We cannot always complain about traffic, about the fact that Dublin is getting too big and that there will be a further 1.5 million people living in the city in ten years' time and then insist that the Government and the Civil Service cannot show that they want to do something about it. It is silly to behave in that manner. We must try to modernise our country, encourage people to live in the regions and take seriously what the national spatial strategy said about developing towns, large and small. I have spent all my life living within two miles of the centre of the capital city and I am of the opinion that it makes sense to decentralise. We cannot have a situation where people are obliged to develop houses in their front or back gardens, where increasingly taller buildings must be constructed in the heart of the city and where there is nobody living in other parts of the country. It makes sense to do this in a small country and we can do it in a short period. Whether decentralisation will be completed by 28 May or 20 June 2007 is important but if it is completed a short time later, so be it.

The decentralisation programme makes sense. In light of the recent reshuffle, will the Taoiseach indicate what is the make-up of the Cabinet sub-committee on decentralisation? In the context of the remarks by Ruth Barrington of the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 15 September to the effect that there had been no prior consultation to the announcement in budget 2004 regarding——

Ruth Barrington stated that there had been no prior consultation with any of the State agencies. Will the Taoiseach indicate if a survey was carried out in his Department or, if he wants to be generous, in any Department or Government agency in respect of the willingness of people to sign up to a decentralisation proposal? If it is the case that Ruth Barrington has indicated the correct position, how was the calculation of 10,300 places ever arrived at? What was the rationale behind that figure?

The Taoiseach provided some figures in his initial reply. Is he in a position to provide an estimate of the number of people who will be transferred from other Departments to his Department and vice versa? Will it be an exodus? In the review have people expressed an interest in transferring to his Department? Has he any idea at this stage about the degree of flow in and out of his Department?As regards the numbers of people involved in his Department and across the remainder of the spectrum, does the Taoiseach share the concerns of other Deputies that we are seeing the relocation of people in peripheral towns to the city of Dublin? Would he agree that this is not a decentralisation programme in real terms, particularly when one considers the position of Naas, Kildare and Drogheda which all act, perhaps, as dormitory towns for Dublin, that decentralisation to these towns means that people already domiciled in Dublin do not have to relocate at all and that we will not see real and substantial benefits for them or for communities beyond which would have benefited——

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	69	I will try to answer a number of those questions while complying with the Ceann Comhairle's ruling.Phil Flynn who reports to the special Cabinet sub-committee chairs the implementation group responsible for driving forward the process. There has been no change in the composition of the sub-committee in terms of the Departments involved but different Ministers have come on board since the reshuffle. The group comprises Mr. Dermot Quigley, former Chairman of the Revenue Commissioners; Ms Jane Williams, managing director of SIA Group; Mr. Fred Devlin, chartered surveyor; Mr. Eddie Sullivan, Secretary General of PSMD in the Department of Finance; and Mr. Seán Benton, chairman of the Office of Public Works. That group, working to the Cabinet sub-committee, drives the implementation. In many cases it uses outside agencies or individuals where needed to assist in its work.Obviously the second question related to people who would move from my Department and decentralise. Individuals in other Departments who did not want to move would then move into those posts. That would be a function of the central applications facility which would deal with all these issues.Regarding the locations, we must remember that the scheme is voluntary. The Deputy might say that the locations could be more widely dispersed. While no particular research was carried out before the budget for 2004, it was well known because we have been involved in this process since the late 1980s. Nothing has really changed in that. The people do not want to go too far away in greater numbers and we must work on it. It is a voluntary scheme so we must carry people with us.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The best research is the practical knowledge that has been gleaned, based on the sizeable number of Departments and agencies that have moved to various locations around the country, from Donegal to Kerry, over the years. From that knowledge it is known where the demand is. Even before the budget of 2004 people were applying for relocation and that base is known. Many people would be surprised at the numbers who have applied to the central applications facility, both Dublin-based people and those from other locations — maybe not from State agencies.The knowledge existed and the criteria were based on that. This was how the locations were picked. The suitability of those locations equals the numbers in the agencies. That was how it was done. It is no more complex than that. Considerable thought was given to it and now the implementation group and the Cabinet sub-committee will drive it on for the future.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	74	As has been stated, we should call this dispersal policy rather than decentralisation policy in terms of its effect. How would the Taoiseach ask a civil servant from his Department to volunteer to move? Essentially it is something of a Hobson's choice. Would he ask if such a civil servant would be disappointed not to be working in Dublin in the future? Is there any particular way to ask a person to volunteer when it is very clear, for example, to principal officers that it is not in the best interest of their careers. It seems that the number of volunteers would only fill 38% of the vacancies available. Based on his Department, will the Taoiseach give the lead as to how this might be more successfully done? Does the Taoiseach realise that difficulties exist? He seems to indicate that everything is going swimmingly. However, the reports we have seen show huge difficulties and the deadline of 2007 will not be met.The Taoiseach mentioned the sites and the building programme for the new offices. Based on replies to previous questions, I know the Taoiseach is not a huge fan of public private partnership. He certainly said the Department of Finance was not a huge fan of such arrangements. However, the construction on 53 new sites at a cost of €800 million may relate to his Department, which is why I ask the question. Does this represent good value given that much of that building——

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The Taoiseach often talks about the value for money aspect of a plan, particularly a plan relating to his Department. I am asking him if the best value for money is achieved by the State employing somebody else to construct the buildings and then leasing them back at a considerable cost.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	81	That does not arise. In fairness to other Deputies whose questions were disallowed by the Chair for the same reason, I ask Deputy Sargent not to pursue that matter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I am asking about the Taoiseach's own concerns, I am not really straying in the manner the Chair suggests. Will the Department of the Taoiseach take on the cost of claims from the Association of Chief Executives of State Agencies, which is considering making claims of millions of euro on behalf of public servants who hold job-specific contracts of employment? Is that part of the cost package for this programme?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	83	The Deputy asked a number of questions. A sum of €20 million has been provided for properties in this year's Department of Finance budget. It is obvious that we need to try to determine the locations as quickly as possible. The Office of Public Works, which has significant expertise in this area, will make decisions on the best locations. As I said, I understand from the last report that the OPW will decide to develop greenfield sites to a greater extent than existing accommodation.The Deputy also asked about locations. Applications have been received from State employees in Dublin and other locations, who wish to move to new locations, for approximately 80% of the posts which will be available in Dublin and other locations and in State companies. Approximately 3,700 civil servants in Dublin, 500 civil servants in State companies and 3,300 civil servants in other locations are interested in the decentralisation programme. That is the make-up. Decisions will be taken about using public private partnerships and other matters.As I said, the Government is committed to making as much progress as possible by 2007. That does not mean that every last thing has to be finished by 2007 — it will continue. I hope we will have identified the sites by the end of the year and I hope we will make substantial moves next year. Matters are moving very well. I do not deny that there are problems and difficulties, as there are in everything one does. Life is about overcoming problems and difficulties, moving things on and making progress.I do not have to ask anyone in my Department to move. Although the Department is not being decentralised, over 20% of its staff have signed forms and have asked to be moved. That can continue, as the Deputy knows. The priority listing ended on 7 September last, but the applications system remains open. I do not doubt that the number of applicants will increase as more people examine the advantages of decentralisation and consider their family situations.A special joint unit of the Department of Finance and the OPW was established to support the implementation team and liaise with Departments about all the property aspects of the programme. Each Minister whose Department is earmarked for decentralisation has established a special decentralisation unit within the Department to report to the management advisory group and the Minister. In turn, the Department reports on a regular basis to the special Cabinet sub-committee that works with the implementation group. That is how the system is working. Everything is not perfect, but there is a process which has to move on, and that is what is happening.

Will the Taoiseach indicate whether these matters were discussed with the Northern Ireland or UK authorities? It is obvious that the authorities are interested in these matters. Were they discussed last Friday when the DUP was here? Have they been discussed with the Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív? Has progress been made due to the fact that Foras na Gaeilge and other agencies have a North-South, cross-Border dimension?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The central applications facility and the implementation teams in the Departments must deal with that. Deputy Allen is right in saying that previous experience has shown it is more difficult to get professional groups to move. He will recall — I believe it is his area — that we moved the Central Statistics Office to Mahon in Cork about 12 years ago. We had some difficulty in doing so. However, as he knows, the CSO recently celebrated its tenth birthday there, having successfully reached its first decade in Mahon. It took time to get the various professions to move. In the Departments, Secretaries General have been designated to speak to senior people individually about their requirements and views. About 19 of 55 have agreed to go, with 19 others considering it. That is not yet the full number, but it must be done by one-to-one management to see if the people are willing to move. Since the scheme is voluntary, where that is not the case, they will have to find an alternative, as we did with some of the cases a decade ago. It takes longer, but it is the only way.

What is the percentage of women appointees to boards and organisations under the aegis of his Department? While he is answering, perhaps he might comment on the distribution of €9,000 watches to selected members of a State board by an outgoing chairman.

However, why were all the other nominees from Departments men? Is he not being listened to or being taken notice of by his other colleagues? Would it be worth reminding them that they must try to implement gender balance themselves rather than leave it up to him?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	97	In reply to Deputy Kenny's first question, we always try to adhere to that figure, and most of the boards under my Department's control, such as the National Economic and Social Forum, draw from various groups, as Deputies will know from my responses to previous questions. One is therefore dependent on whom they put forward. However, we continually make the point. Some of them are very good, and I believe that the NESF has over 40% women, although some of the others are far below that figure. It is always an issue with the social partnership groups when discussing the make-up of the NESF that we endeavour to get them, while appointing competent men or women, to maintain that balance. We will continue to do that as best we can.If there is an opportunity to respond on the other matter I will take it.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	101	As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008. The strategy contains 100 individual actions under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.With regard to prevalence of opiate use, research conducted by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs last year estimated that there were 14,452 people using opiates in Ireland. The estimated figure for Dublin is 12,456 with 2,225 people using opiates outside the capital, although a number of these would be in Wicklow and Kildare, which are part of the ERHA region. Although this represents a reduction in the numbers in Dublin of approximately 1,000 over the previous 1996 estimate, this is the first available prevalence data for the regions outside Dublin.The recent report by the Health Research Board showed that the numbers in treatment for heroin use outside the ERHA area have increased very significantly in the period 1998 to 2002. As the Deputy will be aware, this is in line with one of the key commitments in the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 which is to increase the number of treatment places available for drug misusers. While in percentage terms the increase in the numbers in treatment in the regions is considerable, the vast bulk of methadone treatment continues to take place in the ERHA area. In this regard, the Department of Health and Children, which has overall responsibility for the addiction services, reports that at the end of August 2004 there were 7,190 people receiving methadone treatment. This figure compares with just over 5,000 in December 2000, an increase of 40%.To date, the treatment services in the regions have undergone a similar pattern to that observed in the ERHA when treatment availability was expanded, in that existing users are much more likely to come forward and present for treatment as it becomes more available, accessible and attractive. Accordingly, as the services have expanded, so have the numbers in treatment, which is a positive development as it indicates that services are meeting an existing demand.Additional informationAll health boards are working towards the increased involvement of general practitioners and pharmacists with regard to the methadone protocol. In July 2001, there were 168 GPs and 233 pharmacists involved in the scheme, compared to 219 GPs and 317 pharmacists involved at the end of August 2004.I will continue to monitor the overall national situation with regard to opiate use. The programme for Government calls for monitoring of the use of heroin, in particular outside Dublin, and the NACD is in the process of setting up an early warning system to address this issue. The regional drugs task forces are currently mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas, as well as the range and level of existing services, with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. Where opiate use is a problem in particular areas, I expect this to be reflected in their action plans. I look forward to receiving those plans over the coming months and allocating funding for their implementation.The mid-term review of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 is currently under way. The review is examining the progress being made to date under the strategy and will enable priorities for future action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary, for the remaining period up to 2008. As part of the review, the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of drug misuse, including emerging trends, will be examined, and any gaps presenting will be identified. The prevalence of heroin use throughout the country will be considered in this context also.

However, as the Minister of State has admitted, the drugs problem has significantly increased outside Dublin city during the Minister's term of office. I acknowledge there has been significant improvement in the 14 to 21 age cohort in Dublin city, but is it not true that in Louth, Meath, Westmeath, Wicklow and Carlow, heroin is being used more than ever? Has the Minister's national drugs strategy failed? The strategy is in its fourth year, yet the regional drugs tasks forces have been set up only in the past year and have produced no reports. The Minister has failed to deal with this issue.Parents in particular are concerned at the spread of heroin, albeit to a significant minority of people. Nevertheless, that minority never previously indulged in heroin abuse. Is the Minister's strategy failing because he has failed to resource or fund it in these best of times? We have never had more money in our coffers, yet never has less been spent on the national drugs strategy in the regions.

The figures referred to the numbers in treatment not usage. It is positive if the numbers in treatment in certain midlands towns went up by 400%. Under the strategy, we have been trying to achieve the provision of treatment so that we can attract abusers to the services. That the numbers in treatment have increased does not mean that usage has increased.

However, that figure did not upset us because treatment has been provided, which is the aim of the strategy. Naturally, when services exist, people will be attracted to them, which is positive because it is only when people come forward that they can be treated to try to rid them of their habits.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	111	The Government decided it was unacceptable to continue to have a completely unregulated charities sector. In the programme for Government we undertook to enact a comprehensive reform of the law relating to charities to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud.Some areas of charitable fund-raising are particularly vulnerable to abuse under the current system. For example, modern methods such as selling tokens like flowers and lapel pins, or collecting promises of money such as standing orders or direct debits, do not need a permit from the Garda. The lack of regulation to date has meant that there is no reliable information on the number of active charities, their financial worth and how they spend their funds. Moreover, there is no requirement to show where donations come from, how much money was received, or what it was spent on; there is no legal obligation to spend donations on the charitable purpose for which they were collected; and there is no requirement to show what percentage of donations was spent on, for example, administration, advertising, professional fund-raisers etc.These are just some examples of the kind of issues that will need to be tackled by the regulatory body to be established under the legislation which my Department will now prepare. A statutory body to regulate charities will specifically aim to supervise charities and subject them to full regulatory scrutiny. I intend there to be a requirement for charities to provide regular accounts to this body to ensure public accountability. This body will regulate and monitor charities, including their charitable fund-raising activities, on an ongoing basis, and it will protect the public interest by monitoring and investigating possible abuses, including in regard to charitable fund-raising activities.Additional informationThe body will also be tasked with issuing performance reports on areas of the charities sector and I would expect matters such as the publication of league tables to come under this aspect of its responsibilities.Informed, vigilant trustees also have a crucially-important role to play in guarding against fraud or abuse. I am pleased to report, in that regard, that the Law Reform Commission has been engaged to assist and advise my Department on the updating of charitable trust law, which will form an integral part of the draft charities regulation Bill. This specialist area of the reform will be the subject of a separate public consultation, under the aegis of the Law Reform Commission, in December 2004. At this stage, the current best estimate for publication of the Bill is end 2005. This is a hugely ambitious goal, as the legislation is likely to run to about 200 sections and numerous schedules.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	112	In the wake of the events of 11 September 2001, did the Minister receive a request from the United Nations, which went out to member countries, to review the laws governing charities? The UN claimed that a number of charities were being used for fund-raising and money laundering for international terrorist organisations. If this took place, has the Minister had the opportunity to investigate? Has he concerns regarding the use of so-called charities in this country for that type of purpose?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	113	Yes. The programme for Government includes a provision for a totally new regime for charities. I am pleased this was included because the relevant legislation has been in force for more than 40 years. Since the 1990s, three reports have been drawn up to suggest the action we should take, including those drawn up by the Law Reform Commission and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs in 1996, Deputy Burton. Reform of the legislation governing charities is a part of the programme for Government and we are working on this.I accept concerns exist following the events of 11 September 2001 that charities set up here could be abused. While we have been asked by the UN to consider and update our legislation, we were working on this in any case. There is concern at different levels because the current regime is totally unregulated. The aim is to have compulsory regulation and a regulatory body following up on these groups and controlling what they do. The situation up to now was wide open and anything could happen.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	114	Will the Minister confirm that some charities here do no fund-raising? Does he not think it urgent, if it is a possibility that so-called charities are fund-raising or money laundering for terrorist organisations, that something should be done in advance of the legislation? As this type of activity can lead to awful terrorist acts, must we wait for the legislation? Can something be done in the interim?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I do not think anything can be done in the interim. It is full steam ahead as far as the Department is concerned. However, this is not simple legislation. If we manage to get it published by the end of next year, we will be doing well. It will be a comprehensive Bill with more than 200 heads. Public consultations have been held and in recent days the independent evaluation of the submissions made has been published. The Law Reform Commission is working in the area of trust law. However, much work needs to be done and new legislation is needed.The area is unregulated. Most of the charities we hear about daily do great work and fully support our efforts. The public reaction and that of the charities has been very favourable because all charities doing good work need this legislation as a protection and the sector needs to have safeguards. However, as the sector is unregulated, there are no provisions short of the legislation. We are progressing that as best we can.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	116	I informed the Deputy in reply to his Parliamentary Question No. 1284 last week that the community after schools project, Dublin 1, was originally funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform through Area Development Management. Following a decision in that Department that the project no longer met the criteria for funding through ADM under the equal opportunities child care programme, my Department agreed to fund the project through its community development unit in recognition of the need to maintain the after-schools services in the Amiens Street area. Short-term funding until the end of 2004 has been agreed. Subject to continued satisfactory progress within the project, I anticipate that funding will be made available to this project in 2005 from my Department.However, I understand that the CASP also applied for funding to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board. The board has decided to engage ADM to administer the initial round of funding on its behalf. This application is currently being evaluated by ADM against the criteria set out in the published guidelines. Following this evaluation process, a recommendation will be made to the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursements Board for decision. The CASP will be advised of the board's decision in due course.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I accept that funding is being provided for this year and, hopefully, next year from the community development unit of the Department. Is it intended, all going well, that the community development unit will continue to fund this project on an ongoing basis? I ask in the context of the fact that, since its inception in 1995, the project was funded first by the Department of Social Welfare, then the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and now the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. There is a great deal of frustration with such projects that no one Department appears to take responsibility for after-school projects. Does the Minister of State accept that the recent OECD report severely criticised this country regarding early childhood education and specifically the need to provide after-school activities for children in severely disadvantaged areas? Here we have a group which has spent years of frustrated effort and energy in trying to locate a source of ongoing funding to provide such a service. The OECD report stated it was one of the strengths of the Irish system that it had voluntary and community groups carrying out this type of work.Will the Minister clarify the position regarding funding from the community development unit? Is it intended to provide this on an ongoing basis? What can be done to mainstream groups providing after-school services in the absence of anything else for children in extremely disadvantaged areas in the north inner city? That part of the north inner city, as the Minister is well aware, is a byword for inequality and lack of access to second and third level education.There was a question earlier about drugs and children who end up using drugs. Services and community projects such as the one under discussion steer young children away from drugs and give them a chance to get through second level and into third level education. Does the Minister accept it is of vital importance to disadvantaged areas that projects such as these are given a permanent source of funding for the very badly needed after-school activities they provide?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	118	Funding is secure for this year. I anticipate that next year funding will be provided either from the dormant accounts fund or by the Department. I cannot say what the position will be further into the future.This is a very good project. The fact the Department took it over is proof of that. I am not sure whether the Deputy has done it justice because some items he mentioned might be on a different tangent. The Deputy is correct about its history, that it was under the Department of Social and Family Affairs and then the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform as a child care project. It has come to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs as a community development project. For the Deputy to zone in on the child care aspect of it is not music to the ears of my Department. The reason it was moved from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is that it no longer met the necessary criteria. It now covers not only children but adults and community development. That is why my Department is involved. It is a good project but it has outgrown the existing funding schemes. It is now viewed, from a long-term perspective, as community development and that is how it is being funded. Its effectiveness must also be examined in terms of continuing resources. It is a good project. The issue is to find the right home for it. If it fits the criteria of community development, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs will be happy to look after it. However, the difficulty is that as such projects grow, they do not remain within the criteria set out by different Departments. That is why it was moved from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	119	The reason I raised the matter is that it is such a good project. The Minister of State says his Department is happy to fund it for the moment. That is the problem. How can the people running this project, which has been in operation since 1995, continue without funding? They need something better than a promise of funding for the moment.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I hear what the Deputy says. Departments are rather structured and fund the groups in question within certain criteria. I do not believe the project is in any immediate danger. The fact that I can state that it is viewed as a good project indicates that. However, it is moving towards adult education. My Department is happy to fund the project under the heading of community development. It is not a child care project. If it was it would be dealt with by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The total number of applications received which have been reported to my Department by the implementing bodies is 997. A total of 565 applicants have been allocated places on the scheme, 82 of whom have been unsuccessful on the grounds that they do not meet the eligibility criteria. The remaining applications are under consideration. This is good progress on the scheme and I expect the numbers to increase significantly before the end of this year.As outlined in the Budget Statement on 3 December 2003, the Dormant Accounts Fund Disbursement Board transferred €10 million from the dormant accounts fund to my Department to deliver the scheme this year, at my request. The second source of funding is savings arising in the Department of Social and Family Affairs as a result of persons transferring to the rural social scheme. My Department will be discussing the issue of how these savings will be dealt with in discussions with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.I am confident the amount transferred will meet the needs of the scheme this year. The issue of any funds unused at the end of the year will be dealt with in accordance with Government financial procedures and the rules applying to the dormant accounts fund.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	122	Is the Minister satisfied with the speed of implementation of this scheme? I understand it began as a pilot scheme in eight areas and is now being implemented nationally. Does the Minister believe he can meet the target of 2,500 places by the end of the year? Is there anything that might prevent people from joining it? Is there clarity on whether people will retain their secondary benefits, for example, medical cards and so on? A medical card is extremely important to a person on low income in rural Ireland, not merely from the medical point of view but in the context of school transport, clothing allowance and so on. Can the Minister guarantee that a person joining this scheme can still avail of the secondary benefits enjoyed under the other schemes? Would the Minister admit that, nine months on, this scheme has been slow to get off the ground?
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Like all schemes, this was slow at the beginning. One of the causes of the delay was the decision to use existing community structures to deliver the scheme, that is, the Leader companies. A major delay over the summer occurred as a result of having to wait for the Leader companies to declare themselves ready to take on the scheme. The Deputy will be glad to hear the scheme is now available nationally.In addition, I am confident, given the areas in which it now operates, that we will have no trouble filling the 2,500 places. In the areas where it is already operating there are not enough places to meet demand. We allocated the initial tranche of places in direct proportion to the number of people receiving farm assist in each area. We have therefore held places for those coming into the scheme now. I believe there will be a very fast take-up. As each Leader company learns from others, the experience gained will be transmitted from one to another. It was significant that, apart from Duhallow, the Gaeltacht schemes made the most progress. However, Údarás na Gaeltachta, which was involved in the Gaeltacht schemes, had considerable experience with community employment schemes and had already ploughed that furrow. I am happy that the figure of 2,500 participants will be attained soon. I will not put my life on whether it will be on 31 December 2004 or sometime in January 2005. However, now that the scheme is in full operation, it will soon see a full take-up. The Leader companies coming in now will learn from the experience of the first Leader companies.The aim is to ensure that the same secondary benefits available to community employment scheme participants will be available to the rural social scheme participants, including the medical card. I can confirm that the Christmas bonus will be paid. However, I will check the other matter with the health authorities. The case was made for all secondary benefits available to community employment scheme participants to be available to those in the rural social scheme.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	124	That provision is of the utmost importance to the rural social scheme. Unless the situation is clear to community health officers, they cannot state otherwise. I understand there has been no clarification in this area and the Minister is simply informing the House how he believes it should be. However, clarification on the availability of secondary benefits, such as the medical card, is needed and vital to the scheme. It is unfortunate that the farmers have been made scapegoats in this area.

I will also check with the health authorities as to the exact status of the rural social scheme. The case my Department has made is that it should be the same as the community employment scheme. I understand some arrangements must be made. I will check if they are in place and will convey the answer to Deputy Crawford.

Caithfear a rá an bhfuil cumas na Gaeilge ann nó nach bhfuil i dtreo is go dtuigfidh daoine go bhfuilimid ag dul sa treo cheart agus ní a mhalairt. An módh oibre fostaíochta is mó atá i gceist agam anseo. Nuair a thagann duine i gcomhair agallaimh, ba cheart a chumas oibre trí Ghaeilge a mheas. Ní dóigh liom go bhfuil sé sin i gcoinne aon riail.

Ma bhreathnaíon sé ar phlean mo Roinne féin, is é atá ann go soiléir ná go mbeidh duine i ngach uile rannóg a bheidh in ann seirbhís a thabhairt do chustaiméir trí mheán na Gaeilge. Ní hamhlaidh atá i láthair na huaire. Ar ndóigh, mar atá ráite go minic, déanann rannóg na Gaeilge, rannóg na n-oileán agus rannóg na Gaeltachta a ngnóithe trí Ghaeilge, ach ins na rannógaí eile ní hamhlaidh atá.An rud atá i gceist a dhéanamh as seo go ceann trí bliana ná déanamh cinnte go mbeidh daoine ins na rannóga eile sa Roinn a bhéas in ann déileáil leis an bpobal trí Ghaeilge. Chuige sin, beidh orainn, idir tréanáil, earcaíocht agus folúntais inmheánacha, déanamh cinnte gur chuid den pholasaí earcaíochta é go mbeidh duine le Gaeilge i ngach uile rannóg. Ní shin le rá go mbeidh ar gach uile dhuine sa rannóg Gaeilge a bheith acu ach beidh orainn déanamh cinnte go bhfuil, ar a laghad, duine le Gaeilge i ngach rannóg. Beidh orainn é sin thógáil san áireamh i gcúrsaí earcaíochta, ardaithe céime agus mar sin de.Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeadh sé seo ar fad bunaithe ar sheirbhís don phobal seachas ar rud inmheánach ar mhaithe leis féin nó seachas rud le buntáiste a thabhairt don Ghaeilge thar an mBéarla díreach ar mhaithe le post a fháil. Ní shin atá i gceist. Ar ndóigh, dá mbeadh post do thréidlia, chaithfí dul agus tréidlia a fháil. Má tá post ina bhfuil Gaeilge agus Béarla riachtanach, beidh orainn duine le Gaeilge agus Béarla a fháil. Beidh ceann de na postanna sin le líonadh i ngach uile rannóg i mo Roinn as seo go ceann trí bliana.Beimid ag súil go n-úsáideann na rannóga Stáit agus na comhluchtaí poiblí eile plean Ranna s'againne seo mar eiseamláir de dhea-chleachtas agus go leanfar é thar an tseirbhís poiblí. Dá mbeadh duine amháin le Gaeilge i ngach uile rannóg Stáit agus i ngach uile rannóg des na heagraíochtaí Stát, bheadh orainn go leor daoine le Gaeilge a earcadh. Luíonn sin le réasún.Is ar mhaithe le seirbhís don chustaiméir agus ard-chaighdeán seirbhíse a thabhairt do chustaiméirí atá seo á dhéanamh agus ní ar mhaithe le buntáiste a thabhairt don Ghaeilgeoir thar an duine nach bhfuil ach Béarla amháin aige. Ar ndóigh, ar nós aon cháilíocht a bheith ag duine, is buntáiste é an cháilíocht bhreise a bheith ag duine go bhfuil sé nó sí dátheangach.

Rinneadh é sin roimh feidhmiú an Achta. Beidh ar oifig Ombudsman na Leanaí plean a chur faoi bhráid na Roinne le déileáil le ceist sheirbhís trí Ghaeilge ach níl mise ag dul a rá inniu céard a bheidh sa bplean sin. Is rud é sin a bheidh le plé. Roghnaíodh 25 des na comhluchtaí poiblí is tábhachtaí sa tír — bíodh siad tábhachtach ar bhonn náisiúnta, mar Oifig an Úachtaráin nó Oifig an Taoisigh, nó mar go bhfuil siad ag freastal ar an nGaeltacht, mar Chomhairle Condae Thír Conaill — agus a rá leo go bhfuil orthu plean a réiteach. Beidh orthu an plean sin a aontú agus beidh spriocanna cinnte ann mar atá leagtha amach i bplean na Roinne s'agam féin, an t-aon phlean atá foilsithe. Beidh an sprioc agus an rud atá leagtha amach le déanamh go ceann trí bliana soiléir nuair atá an plean aontaithe.Beidh sé de dhualgas ag an gCoimisinéir Teanga déanamh cinnte go bhfeidhmnítear an plean sin, mar is plean reachtúil atá i gceist. Is eisean a bheadh ag déanamh tuairisciú ar chomhlíonadh na ngeallúintí ar fad atá ins na pleananna. Sin an t-easnamh a bhí i saol na Gaeilge go dtí anois. Is iomaí plean a réitíodh agus is iomaí geallúint a tugadh ach ní raibh éinne neamhspleách taobh amuigh den chóras le déanamh cinnte gur comhlíonadh na geallúintí ar fad. Beidh sé sin amhlaidh sa gcás seo agus is céim mhór chun cinn é sin.

As the Deputy will be aware, details of the allocations to individual programme areas are included in the Revised Estimates Volume 2004, which was published earlier in the year.Expenditure up to 24 September 2004 across the three main programme areas, excluding administration, is €162 million, which can broadly be broken down as follows: an Ghaeilge agus an Ghaeltacht, €49 million; community affairs, €77 million; and rural affairs, €36 million. The Deputy will also be aware that expenditure within these programme areas takes place across a wide range of schemes and projects, descriptions of which are available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.
It is the practice of both my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, and myself to make available on the Department's website details of all announcements relating to grant approvals and other expenditure-related decisions under these programmes.

I will see to it, as far as I possibly can, that the Department spends every euro it receives, and not only the euro but also the cent. Last year, the Department was within €100,000 of a total spend and that is as good as one can hope for.There are variables to be taken into account. It can sometimes be difficult to ascertain details of the spend at certain times of the year. For example, I have been asking local authorities to send in bills for the money spent to date this year to have some information on the work completed. It has been a tradition for local authorities to send in all the bills at the end of the year. I find it strange that they would not look for the money because my Department wants to give them the money and it makes budgeting more difficult. The Department has been in constant contact with local authorities, suggesting that they send in quarterly bills for the work done. It would provide the Department with a better fix on the work done and enable it to budget better.As Minister, I keep a very close eye on the situation. I must ensure that I do not overspend. The Deputy can rest assured that my target is to hit it right on the button at the end of the year and to ensure that all the funds given to the Department are spent. It is difficult enough to acquire the funding and it is preferable to spend it.

I anticipate that each of these will have finalised schemes before the end of March 2005.I am satisfied that sufficient resources of staff with the appropriate skills, and of good will, which is as critical a resource in this work as money, are available within each of these public bodies to prepare substantial schemes which will see a worthwhile improvement in the availability and quality of public services through Irish. My officials have informed me that they have met a positive and enthusiastic response to this challenge in each of these 25 bodies.I reiterate a point I have made on a number of occasions, that the implementation of the Official Languages Act is a long-term project which poses real challenges for the public service. Not everything can be achieved quickly. My intention is to achieve sustained improvement in the delivery of public services through Irish over the lifetime of perhaps several successive rounds of schemes. The detail of each individual scheme will be framed by the public body concerned in the context both of the resources available to it and the demand from the public for services through Irish.Ainm na hEagraíochtaName of OrganisationOifig an UachtaráinOffice of the PresidentRoinn an TaoisighDepartment of the TaoiseachOifig na gCoimisinéirí IoncaimOffice of the Revenue CommissionersAn Roinn AirgeadaisDepartment of FinanceAn Roinn Comhshaoil, Oidhreachta agus Rialtais ÁitiúilDepartment of Environment, Heritage and Local GovernmentAn Roinn Ealaoin, Spóirt agus TuarasóireachtaDepartment of Arts, Sports and TourismAn Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus TeaghlaighDepartment of Social and Family AffairsAn Roinn Oideachais agus EolaíochtaDepartment of Education and ScienceAn Roinn Talamhaíochta agus BiaDepartment of Agriculture and FoodOifig Choimisinéirí na Státseirbhíse agus na gCoimisinéirí um CheapacháinOffice of the Civil Service and Local Appointments CommissionOifig an Ombudsman/ Oifig an Choimisinéara Faisnéise + An Coimisiún ReifrinnOffice of the Ombudsman/ Office of the Information Commissioner + the Referendum CommissionAn tSeirbhís ChúirteannaThe Courts ServiceAn Chomhairle EalaíonThe Arts CouncilBord Sláinte an IarthairThe Western Health BoardBord Sláinte an Iar-ThuaiscirtThe North Western Health BoardCoiste Gairmoideachais Chontae Dhún na nGallCounty Donegal Vocational Education CommitteeComhairle Chontae Chiarraí*Kerry County Council*Comhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall*Donegal County Council*Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe*Galway County Council*Comhairle Chontae Phort Láirge*Waterford County Council*(*Comhairlí Baile faoina gcúram san áireamh — liosta thíos)(*Including Town Councils under their remit — list below)Ollscoil na hÉireann, GaillimhNational University of Ireland, GalwayOllscoil na hÉireann, Má NuadNational University of Ireland, MaynoothOllscoil Chathair Bhaile Átha CliathDublin City UniversityInstitiúid Teicneolaíochta na Gaillimhe- Maigh EoGalway Mayo Institute of TechnologyOifig an Stiúrthóra Ionchúiseamh PoiblíOffice of the Director of Public ProsecutionsAinm na hEagraíochtaName of OrganisationComhairle Bhaile Bhéal Átha SeanaighBallyshannon Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Bhun CrannchaBuncrana Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Bhun DobhráinBundoran Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Leitir CeanainnLetterkenny Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Chill ÁirneKillarney Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Lios TuathailListowel Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Thrá LíTralee Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Bhéal Átha na SluaBallinasloe Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Locha RiachLoughrea Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile TuamaTuam Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile Dhún GarbháinDungarvan Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile an Lios MhóirLismore Town CouncilComhairle Bhaile na Trá MóireTramore Town Council

I wish them the very best in the time that remains to them in their present positions.The Minister has sought plans from 25 bodies. The Schedule to the Act listed over 600 bodies. The Minister hopes to have approved plans for these organisations by the end of March 2005. What does the Minister envisage as the timeframe when he refers to long-term? If fluent Irish-speaking staff are required in 600 different organisations in addition to interpreters and translators who will be required if the Minister succeeds in his efforts to have Irish accepted as an official working language of the EU, I worry that there is an over-estimation of the number of people who are available and who will have sufficient fluency in the language to implement the Act.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I thank the Deputy for his good wishes. I agree with him on the points he made. In the context of the Act and the position of the Irish language, I stated in this House during the passage of the Bill that we must be realistic. The available resources must be assessed and we must progress according to what is available. For that reason the plan for my Department is modest because resources are limited. The number of publications requiring translation is limited and has been vastly exaggerated. The Department is aware of the resources issue. It is the responsibility of each body to decide what are the proposals and what would be required to provide a good service.The Department has chosen 25 bodies, but they have been chosen strategically, either because of their great national importance, such as the Office of the President or the Department of the Taoiseach, or because they service the public in an interactive way, such as the Office of the Revenue Commissioners or the Department of Social and Family Affairs, which deals with everybody, those from the Gaeltacht and the non-Gaeltacht, Irish and English speakers. Bodies have been chosen if they are located in regions, in the case of local authorities and health boards, where there is a Gaeltacht region. The 25 bodies represent a large percentage of the public's interaction with State bodies. The public's interaction with the final 200 or 300 bodies may be much less than those 25 bodies which deal with the public on a significant daily basis. Taxing one's car and dealing with the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners are simple tasks everyone in the State does. Ergo we have focused on the bodies with the most interaction with people in the State. When these 25 bodies are in place, we will have made a major impact in terms of services.

As a supporter of the Act — I stressed that in my question to him — does he not think it would be a good idea if many of these plans were published only on the web because it is a waste of money in terms of printing and so on? It would be far more efficient if they were bilingual and on the web. If one wants to see them, one can access the web and download them. That would save much money. Much of the criticism comes from the fact that to print plans bilingually costs a lot of money which we would not need to spend if we published them on the web.

An interesting side-effect of the Act is that people have suddenly become aware of printing costs. We all see beautiful glossy magazines and photographs which cost us a fortune. Many publications are way too comprehensive. In my experience, one gets so much material each week that there is only one place for most of it, that is, in one's little wastepaper basket. That is an issue which concerns us all. As part of the implementation of the Act — it is an issue we will discuss — we must all look at practical ways to save costs on behalf of the State.However, there are certain fundamentals — this is a point on which I really appreciate Members' support — to which we should adhere. It is a fundamental right of the Irish speakers of this country to get certain basic documents in Irish and to get basic services through Irish. I do not care what that costs, it is a fundamental right. We can make cost savings in other ways so that the net cost is not an unrealistic burden. In my Department's experience — we have totted up the figures and have looked at it from every perspective — if we use the web on which I am very keen, we will find we can implement the Act without any serious impression on the cost base of running the country. However, Irish speakers will still have that fundamental right to which they are entitled in their own country. It will take a little adjustment but we will get there with the minimum fuss.I have one reservation about publishing everything on the web. When we publish consultation documents and so on, we put them on the web and do not publish them in hard copy. However, in the case of certain documents, we should have a small number of hard copies for people who, unlike us, do not have access to a computer or a facility for printing documents. I use printed copies for such purposes.

I am sure he accepts the goodwill of the House to make sure the Act is implemented to the greatest extent possible. Is the Minister satisfied that this House is doing all it can? Maybe the issue of the availability of Irish translation in the Visitors Gallery can be taken up with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. I believe the film in the audio-visual centre is not available as Gaeilge. Next week I will host a very fine school from my constituency, Coláiste Dáibhéid, and these are the basic facilities which should be available.

I do not have a list in front of me but I understand that is one of the bodies that will have to present a plan, although I will have to verify that. The Deputy is correct in that it is vital we give example. It is for that reason I very much welcome that the first list of bodies contains such bodies as the Office of the President, the Department of the Taoiseach and the Department of Finance. That gives a clear signal that the top layers of Government right up to the top of the Oireachtas — in other words, the Office of the President — are willing to play a full part and to lead by example. That is crucially important in making it clear that this is something being done from the top down and is not just for other organisations, that we will lead it.

Tar éis tairiscintí ina leith a bheith iarrtha agus scrúdaithe ag mo Roinn, d'fhógair mé ar 31 Eanáir 2004 go raibh an conradh chun a leithéid de staidéar á bhronnadh ag mo Roinn ar Acadamh na hOllscolaíochta Gaeilge, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh i gcomhar leis an Institiúid Náisiúnta um Anailís Réigiúnach agus Spásúil, Ollscoil na hÉireann, Má Nuad.Meastar go dtógfaidh an staidéar — a thosaigh i mí Aibreáin 2004 — dhá bhliain go leith le cur i gcrích. Tá súil agam, mar sin, go mbeidh torthaí críochnúla ar fáil thart ar Mheán Fómhair 2006. Bainfear úsáid as torthaí an staidéir seo mar bhunús chun forbairt theangeolaíoch na Gaeltachta mar cheantar labhartha Gaeilge a threisiú agus chun athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar na limistéir oifigiúla Ghaeltachta, faoi mar a moladh i dtuarascáil an choimisiún.

Nach bhfuil sé so-fheicthe do éinne a théann go dtí na Gaeltachtaí go bhfuil ceantracha áirithe nár cheart Gaeltacht a thabhairt orthu i láthair na huaire? An rud a chuireann imní orm ná go bhfuil an tAire ag rá go mbeimid ag feitheamh go dtí 2006 chun toradh na hoibre ó Ollscoil na hÉireann, Gaillimh, a fháil. Idir an dá linn beidh cúrsaí ag dul in olcas an t-am go léir.Mar a dúirt an tAire cheana, más rud é go bhfuil ceantar lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht mar atá ina dteastaíonn ón bpobal a bheith ainmithe mar Ghaeltacht, tabharfar an seans don cheantar teacht suas chuig caighdeán áirithe Gaeilge agus a bheith ina Ghaeltacht. Tá sé deacair ceantar mar sin a ainmniú ach má tá ceantracha amuigh ansin go dteastódh uathu a bheith ina nGaeltachtaí an d'fhéadfaí iad a mholadh agus seans a thabhairt dóibh an toradh sin a bhaint amach chomh luath agus is féidir?

Ní raibh aon áit taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht go raibh níos mó ná 10% den phobal ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil seachas trí toghroinn cheantair a bhí ar imeall na Gaeltachta go raibh cuid den toghroinn cheantar sa nGaeltacht agus an chuid eile taobh amuigh. Mar sin, ní léir go bhfuil aon cheantar i láthair na huaire taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht ar cheart dó bheith ina Ghaeltacht.Maidir le ceantracha atá san nGaeltacht anois agus go bhféadfaí argóint a dhéanamh nar cheart go mbeidís san nGaeltacht, an fhad is go bhfuil an staidéar teangeolaíochta ar siúl tá dhá rud eile ar bun taobh le taobh leis.

Táimid ag déanamh rudaí go dearfach.An dara rud atáimid ag rá go soiléir le pobal na Gaeltachta an fhad is atá an staidéar ar bun, go mbeidh ceist le freagairt ag an bpobal an dteastaíonn uathu fanacht san nGaeltacht nó nach dteastaíonn. Beimid ag déanamh soiléir dóibh má theastaíonn uathu fanacht san nGaeltacht go mbeidh critéir áirid le comhlíonadh.

Nach mbeadh sé níos fearr gan dul ar aghaidh leis na toghcháin sin go dtí go mbeidh imill na Gaeltachta socraithe ag an Aire? Má leantar ar aghaidh leis na toghcháin, beidh daoine nach bhfuil Gaeilge á labhairt acu agus nach bhfuil baint dháiríre acu leis an nGaeltacht ag vótáil sna toghcháin.

An Agreed Programme for Government contained a commitment to annual funding for the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census data. The Government decided on the additional areas for inclusion in the CLÁR programme and I announced these on 17 January 2003. Areas in 18 counties amounting to a total population of 361,000 are now included in the programme. There are no plans for any further review of the boundary of CLÁR areas. I can also confirm that no other significant areas fulfil the population criteria for inclusion in CLÁR.The provision in the Estimates for 2004 is €13.49 million and this funding will continue to support investment in physical, economic and social infrastructure across a wide range of measures. To date in 2004, more than €14 million has been allocated to the counties in CLÁR under the various measures operating under the programme. Some measures operate on a two-year cycle, 2004 and 2005, and this is reflected in the funding allocated. In some cases, the bulk of the approved funding in 2004 will not fall for payment in the same year, for example, top-up funding under the 2004 sports capital programme.The breakdown by county is as follows: Cavan — €1.1 million; Clare — €2.124 million; Cork — €1.077 million; Donegal — €818,000; Galway — €1.682 million; Kerry — €972,000; Leitrim — €1.406 million; Limerick — €29,000; Longford — €236,000; Louth — €154,000; Mayo — €1.3 million; Meath — €29,000; Monaghan — €118,000; Roscommon — €1.156 million; Sligo — €1.404 million; Tipperary North — €196,000; Tipperary South — €23,000; Waterford — €361,000; and Westmeath — €103,000.

I beg him to look again at a few areas in the Border region that do not meet the criteria of being close to existing CLÁR areas, namely, the Knockatallon-Bragan mountain area and the Mullyash mountain area, both in County Monaghan. It is a scandal that those areas are excluded solely because they are separated by the Border.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	154	It is now clear that in August 2001 the Garda Síochána had information from Interpol concerning details of alleged customers of a company offering access to child pornography websites and that the name of Brian Curtin was included in that information.On 25 May of this year, the Taoiseach informed me that Mr. Curtin was appointed a judge on the recommendation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, of which the then Attorney General, now Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, was a member. It is clear from section 14 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board has the power to consult persons concerning applicants' suitability for appointment as judges. Will the Taoiseach inform me whether the board consulted the Garda before JudgeCurtin's appointment? If the answer to that question is "No", does that not mean there is a major shortfall in the operation of that board when recommending such sensitive and critical appointments? If contact was made, it appears likely that the appointment of Judge Curtin would not have happened and we would not now face uncharted constitutional territory before a committee of the Houses. Will the Taoiseach comment on that and has he moved to address this serious lapse in procedures?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	155	As we know, Brian Curtin was appointed a judge of the Circuit Court almost three years ago in November 2001. On 27 May 2002, the Director of Public Prosecutions prosecuted Judge Curtin for knowingly having in his possession child pornography, which is contrary to section 6 of the Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998. Accordingly, the matter was dealt with on indictment in the Circuit Court in Tralee. The trial commenced on 20 April and ended on 23 April on the basis that the warrant on which the Garda searched Judge Curtin's house was sent on the day that it was executed, namely, 27 May 2002.The fact that the name of Brian Curtin appeared on a list received by the Garda Síochána from Interpol in August 2001 was put on the record of the House by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on 2 June this year during the motion regarding the procedure on Judge Curtin's removal from office. In fact that was the first matter referred to in the resolution. However, the Garda Síochána has confirmed that it did not advise the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform at that time, Deputy O'Donoghue, or his Department of having received the list from Interpol. Brian Curtin from Tralee, County Kerry was one of more than 100 names on that Interpol list. Obviously the Garda investigation was required to ascertain who Brian Curtin actually was and whether or not it was he who personally accessed the sites. A garda in Harcourt Street was not to know that Brian Curtin was a senior counsel in Tralee who was at the time being considered by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board for the Bench. Deputy Kenny is asking whether the judicial appointments board would have checked with the Garda. I cannot be certain that it did, but I would surmise it would not have, in a case like that. Even if it had carried out a security check on Brian Curtin, it is doubtful whether the information from the investigation would have been received at that stage. Security checks seek details of criminal convictions. At that stage a security check would not have shown up that he had a criminal conviction because he did not have one, and still has not.Deputy Kenny's last point was that the procedures of the judicial appointments board should be amended so that it could be seen whether someone to be appointed had a criminal record or was on a Garda list. I am not sure how the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board would take that suggestion. However, he raised the question as to whether a security check was done. A security check is done on staff in many areas and I will look at that point. I cannot say for definite, but I believe it is unlikely, because of the people being dealt with. It is highly unlikely that the board carries out a security check on the type of people who would be on that list, but I will check that point.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Will the Taoiseach set in train a system whereby the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board should check with the Garda as regards appointments such as this? If a caretaker is being appointed to a school, a character reference is sought from the Garda. I had a distraught parent on the telephone last night who was unable to adopt a child because of a minor indiscretion with regard to a driving licence, I understand. As I understand the mechanics of the final approval for such an appointment, the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who was then Attorney General was a member of the judicial appointments board, and the then Minister for Justice, Deputy O'Donoghue, and the Taoiseach would have had a final consultation about names under consideration. Does the Taoiseach recollect whether Deputy O'Donoghue, from that part of the country, made any comment about the suitability of the person being proposed for appointment? In his replies to me on 25 May this year, the Taoiseach said he would try to check whether the then Attorney General had any information to that effect. He appeared certain that he had not. Will he confirm what the position is now?I will repeat that there is strong public concern over the necessity to have absolute clarity about appointments of such sensitivity and importance. It is necessary that the systems in place to supervise such appointments are seen to be absolutely above board and in the people's interest.

I take the point, however. I believe the important position of an usher in this House involves a security check. I believe all positions are important and should be checked. I shall make that suggestion.On the other aspect, we have spoken about this before, but at no time did either the Attorney General or the Minister indicate that they had any knowledge or information to show that Brian Curtin was an unsuitable person. I have checked that since. While the Minister could recall who Brian Curtin was, neither he nor the Attorney General had information as to his unsuitability.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	160	Will the Taoiseach say what the poor people of Ireland did to deserve Deputy Brennan as Minister for Social and Family Affairs? He does not want the job. Clearly he has no interest in it. He got it by accident and poor people who are marginalised and unemployed are now going to have as their advocate and champion at the Cabinet table a man who would prefer to be doing anything else. Did Deputy Brennan threaten to resign his seat, as is reported, when he learned that Deputy Kitt was to be in the Cabinet and that he was to be dropped? Were representations made to retain him and if so, by whom, and how is it that he ended up in the Department of Social and Family Affairs.Will the Taoiseach say if he got a letter of resignation from the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid? Deputy McDaid said he was sacked. If he was sacked it would require a Government decision, which meant the Taoiseach came to the House with 18 rather than 17 junior Ministers if Deputy McDaid had not been removed by Government decision. I do not want to start any shockwaves in sub-Saharan Africa at the prospect of my constituency colleague, Deputy Conor Lenihan, being deprived of his office, but is he appointed properly? Will the Taoiseach say how he reconciles all of this with Inchydoney? At Inchydoney the message was that the social inclusion agenda was at the top of Fianna Fáil priorities. How is it now that we have ended up with Deputy Brennan in the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Harney in the Department of Health and Children——

How can any of that be reconciled? If the Taoiseach believes these Ministers were not performing in their existing Departments, why should anyone believe they will perform in their new Departments?

Deputy Brennan will be far more caring. He will demonstrate this tonight when he talks about the carers' issue in the House.What normally happens as regards the appointment of Ministers and Ministers of State is that Ministers resign. Whether they are resigning, as in this case, or whether they are asked to resign, I receive letters of resignation. In the case of Deputy McDaid, when I met him on Wednesday, I did not ask him for a letter of resignation. I did that on Thursday morning. When I gave the list of appointments to the House on Thursday morning, I had not received that letter. I now have the letter from Deputy McDaid, so the statutory duty is fulfilled.I will finalise that regulation when I give the individual Ministers——

We were looking to hear a broad based view on where we should best allocate resources in the next budget and following budgets based on the excellent report brought forward by Fr. Healy and his colleagues. We looked at that report and believed we should have received a presentation on it. I suggest that meeting was very good for all my colleagues in my party and for everyone else in that we saw the things we should do and where the priorities lie. When anybody brings forward a report on the priorities in terms of the areas in which we should spend money, it is right that the Government should look at it. In this case the Government did that.

There is neither purpose nor pattern to the reshuffle. It is like a farmer at the cattle mart who goes into the bullpen with the cattle and prods them to move them around. One bullock gets out the gate but the rest are in the position in which they were before he moved them around. Is it right to say that the Minister, Deputy Brennan, is familiar with the social inclusion agenda or dealing with poor people? The only time he ever touched on it was when he was looking after Deputy Healy-Rae, Deputy Fox and others. He does not want to be there.What is the Taoiseach saying about him? Were his decisions at Dublin Airport not Government decisions? Is the Taoiseach saying he was off on a frolic of his own at Dublin Airport and that the new Minister for Transport will behave differently or was he pursuing Government policy? How can the Taoiseach reconcile this Cabinet with the commitment he made at Inchydoney and since 11 June that there would be a more compassionate, caring face to this Government? He has put square pegs into round holes. People who were unable to perform in their old Departments are now expected to deliver the goods in new ones.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	175	As I said last week and previously, decisions made by Government are collective, responsible decisions and people act towards the agenda. As far as I am concerned, everybody is equal, regardless of the Ministry held. Whether it is I, a Minister or a Minister of State, people are equal. They have a job to do. Decisions are discussed in advance. The Government makes policy and by moving people and bringing four new people to the Cabinet table, which is a quarter of the Cabinet, we are bringing new vibrancy, activity and dynamic to the Government. I hope the colleagues I have put forward will show that in all of their Ministries.I will not take lectures from parties that, when in Government, never served the people who were in need. Tonight this House will debate the carer's allowance but it was this Government that brought in a carer's allowance. Most measures in the social welfare code were initiatives of my party or the parties in Government. If the Opposition has any good suggestions about new issues we will debate them but I will not listen to lectures by people who did not take the opportunity when they were in office.

I speak specifically in regard to Aer Lingus. Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is a scandal that the national airline has been sized up for a sell-off, a privatisation, to the management team at Aer Lingus? Does the incoming Minister for Transport intend holding to the policy position pursued by the Minister, Deputy Brennan, while he had that responsibility or will the Taoiseach now definitively, on his own behalf and on behalf of Government, reject the outrageous proposal for a management buy-out of Aer Lingus?Will the Taoiseach not agree, and I do not believe this is overstating the fact, that it is an act of piracy against the interests of this country and economy, not to mention the workforce, that any particular body of the workforce, albeit the current management or whatever, is in a position to buy out and take overall control of Aer Lingus and then, presumably, participate in a massive stripping exercise for their own personal gain? We need to be cognisant of the fact that workers in Aer Lingus have been the key factor in ensuring its success over many years, and that is not to lose sight of the loyalty of Irish travellers who have been, through the most troubled and difficult economic times, loyal users of Aer Lingus. People throughout the country feel strongly about this issue. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that already there have been 3,000 redundancies? Does he not accept that it is a misnomer to describe the proposed further redundancy of 1,300 people as voluntary when it is clear that it is anything but voluntary, against the backdrop of this company recording profits of €100 million in the past year? Is the Taoiseach aware, and I ask him to be clear when replying to the House, of the detail of the proposals being put to some 1,300 workers and their families, with all that means, and does he accept that this is not voluntary and that the vague promises about replacement and relocation amount to nothing?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	180	On the issue of Aer Lingus and as I said to Deputy Kenny some time ago, that report is being prepared. It should be ready some time in October and will examine some of the strategic issues raised about Aer Lingus. The Government will examine that report. I said previously that the idea of a management buy-out was not one I thought received support but we have to do these things properly and examine it. We also have to be realistic and twice in the past 14 years Aer Lingus has experienced grave difficulties, once in the early 1990s when we had to give what was then very substantial resources in the order of £360 million to help the company at that stage, which worked successfully, and then more recently on the back of the events of 11 September. There is no doubt that the good work of staff and trade unions in the airports is highly commendable. They have done a great deal to help keep the airline functioning and put it back into profit from the difficult situation in which it found itself in the last quarter of 2001. However, we cannot close our eyes to what is happening around the world. Some of the great airlines have gone because they were not able to compete and survive. As an island country we have a strategic national interest in an airline. These issues must be carefully examined and the Government will do that.

He perpetuates the concerns, not only of the workforce but of broad opinion on this issue across the country. Is the Taoiseach aware that in its last major redundancy offer Aer Lingus medical staff in the axed medical centre were offered relocation as baggage handlers within the Aer Lingus workforce? What is being offered to the 1,300 people who now face threat? Does he regard that as an offer that would keep them still in the voluntary bracket? Nobody else would.Is the Taoiseach aware that there is great concern among the existing and the pensioned workforce of Aer Lingus about management's efforts to undermine the detail and terms of the pension entitlements and rights of workers in the airline? The Pensions Board deemed this exercise totally unacceptable. Will the Taoiseach at least be specific in addressing the retired and the present workforce in guaranteeing that he and the Government, particularly the new Minister for Transport, will ensure that there will be no tinkering with the pension rights and entitlements of existing or former employees at Aer Lingus? He should at least give them that comfort.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	182	The Government will continue to work closely with the trade unions representing Aer Lingus and its staff on all the issues vital to their future. The report on the future of Aer Lingus, which considers some of the strategic options and some of the difficulties, will be available this month and there will be an exchange with the workers. I have stated that I am familiar with the efforts of the workforce, the trade union representatives, the staff and management associations, and with issues concerning former staff. I have addressed these and worked with the individuals involved since the late 1980s and will continue to do so.

#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following specific and important matter of public interest requiring urgent attention, namely, the need for the Government to approve the planning brief for the Tuam hospital so that a community hospital, ambulance base and ancillary accommodation can be provided on the Tuam health campus. The submission from the Western Health Board seeking approval for the community hospital has been gathering dust on the desk of the Minister for Health and Children since 8 October 2002 and has not been approved. As a result, the locked-up hospital continues to deteriorate resulting in a waste of public funds which were invested to purchase the property with the approval of the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	185	I seek the adjournment of Dáil Éireann under Standing Order 31 on a matter of extreme importance regarding Ennis national school in County Clare and ask the new Minister for Education and Science to avert the all-out strike on Thursday next by teaching staff by providing emergency funding for the provision of temporary accommodation for additional teaching staff, and to provide the necessary funding to deal with the deplorable health and safety conditions which are causing undue stress for pupils and teachers at Ennis national school, and that this work be carried out during the October bank holiday weekend.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I request the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an item of local and national importance, namely, the proposed strike in Ennis national school next Thursday. In view of the atrocious conditions teachers and pupils must endure in this school, I call on the Minister to ensure that this strike will not take place and to act immediately to address the reasons for the strike. I attended a meeting in the school last night where parents expressed their deep dissatisfaction with the lack of action over several years by the Department of Education and Science which has culminated in the proposed strike. The Minister must act immediately.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss a major issue, namely, the case of a student in County Tipperary. The student achieved good marks in her exams and was accepted by a school of nursing in Scotland. However, due to the delay in notifying her marks she could not enter the nursing school because places were filled in the meantime.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I seek leave to move a motion for the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss the following matter of urgent public concern, namely, the cancellation of elective surgery at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda in the past week; the unacceptable situation whereby the same hospital was on the verge of having to go off call due to a shortage of resources; the urgent necessity for the Minister for Health and Children to ensure that no hospital is forced to go off call as a result of a lack of resources and for the reform of the health services to be underpinned by the goal of creating an accessible and equitable health service.

It is a scandal that of all the political parties on this island, to date only Sinn Féin and the Alliance Party have done so despite the commission's call for all political parties to make their submissions by 1 September 2003, over a year ago.

This is a proposal to refer these matters to various committees. It may be necessary to have a discussion in the House when they come back.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	195	If the Taoiseach cannot give a commitment that he will roster No. 18 for discussion here, I oppose its being taken now without debate. This concerns the ring-fencing of betting tax for the horse and greyhound racing industry, although the tax was reduced from 5% to 2% in 2002. The result is that we have been paying out €56 million each year since then and the Taoiseach intends to provide an additional €325 million over the next four years.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	196	We cannot debate the content of the motion. The motion is whether this matter should be referred to committee.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am not debating the content. I am explaining why I am opposing the taking of it without debate. It is a matter of the most profound significance. It is virtually the only earmarked tax in the country and we are pouring out hundreds of millions to support this industry, not from betting tax, as was intended, but from the Exchequer at a time when 101,000 people are losing their entitlement to medical cards. This is a major issue which requires debate in the House. It is one of the legacies of the old regime which was designed to look after the lads in the racing industry by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the other emeritus Minister, Deputy Walsh.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The Green Party also wants this matter to be debated in the House. I ask the Ceann Comhairle to take people's concerns into account. Public moneys are at stake here and there has been some discussion about the ethical use thereof. This is a matter which also relates to ethics. Racing greyhounds must be registered with the Irish Coursing Club and there are many in the House, of whom I am one, who would be unhappy with that club being seen as the custodian of public moneys. The ethics of coursing would not be in line with many people's personal ethics. This matter should be debated in the House because public moneys are in question here and a great deal of such moneys have been invested in upholding a so-called sport which to many people is repugnant.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	199	This matter should be dealt with in the House in the first instance rather than being referred to committee at this stage. What is at stake here is an additional €300 million over the next four years. In effect, this amounts to multi-annual ring-fencing of public money. This would not happen in the case of funding for cancer care or for the needs of those coping with disabilities. However, we are being asked to allow this matter to be referred to the committee without debate. While I sympathise with the points made by the previous speakers, the pattern has always been that when something of this nature is returned to the House, there is no further time or opportunity to dissect or scrutinise it properly as should be the case. It should not fall only to the committee to consider this matter because far too much is involved. It is as if Santa Claus McCreevy could not make it to Christmas and he offered an early "Adieu, adieu, to you and you and you". He had all of his friends picked out in advance.While I wish both the horse and greyhound racing industries well, we need to know the detail in respect of the management of this fund, how it will be disbursed and how it will be operated. Will the fund relate only to specific areas within both industries? Will smaller areas throughout the country benefit from it? What are the details? There is no information in anything that has been provided on the Order Paper. All the relevant details should be presented to Members in advance of taking a decision as to whether the matter should be referred to committee without debate. We need to know the facts. I oppose its being referred to committee at this stage without debate.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	203	It has been requested that this matter go before committee where it and all of the surrounding issues can be debated. The regulations are designed to increase the aggregate limit of the fund. The money in the fund is reinvested in the industry to develop its infrastructure. There are 25,000 jobs in this industry. I have no difficulty with the report being brought back to the House for debate. Whatever people think about the sport or greyhound racing, it is now a sophisticated industry which is responsible for the livelihoods of a substantial number of people. As regards how the money is spent, the transparency and regulation of the fund, etc., such matters will be dealt with by the committee and, as normal, it will send its report to the House, at which point it can be debated. The Whips can work out the details in that regard.

When will the electricity Bill — in respect of which there is not yet a date for publication — the energy (miscellaneous provisions) Bill and the national oil reserves agency Bill fast-tracked to indicate urgency on the part of the Government in respect of the matter to which I refer?

I am very concerned that we are now dealing with changes affecting emergency medical practitioners without having an opportunity to discuss or debate issues on registration and fitness to practice, which are contained in the statutory instrument but are not part of the health and social care professionals regulatory Bill. Would it not be better practice and lead to better legislation to have this incorporated into the Bill so that it can be debated in due course? This is a relatively important issue relating to the Hanly report.

The Railway Safety Bill stalled on Committee Stage in July 2003 and has been held up for the past 15 months. What is the problem with that Bill? Has the Department of Transport finalised its thinking on the Bill? When will the Bill come before us again? It provides a legal framework to address rail accidents, including those involving the Luas, so it is very much needed and overdue.The Road Traffic Bill is intended to sort out the mess that the penalty points system has become. That Bill was stalled before the summer. It was postponed when priority was given instead to the State Airports Bill. As the number of road fatalities has soared during the summer months, it is urgently needed to sort out the penalty points system. When will it be taken?

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	265	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I am pleased to bring the Water Services Bill 2003 before the Dáil. The Bill has been passed by the Seanad and has benefited from the debate in that House and a range of amendments agreed by it. I wish to explain what is meant by the term "water services" as it is used in the Bill. If one is to appreciate the overall thrust of the Bill, it is helpful to visualise water services as pertaining to "water in the pipe" — from the time following abstraction that it first enters a supply pipe to the point of its subsequent discharge to the environment as treated waste water. The Bill does not seek to take a broader environmental view of water resources issues, such as pollution control, water quality in its broadest sense and river basin management. It is intended that the legislation will complement other legislation in this area.The term "water services" encapsulates the provision of water supplies and the subsequent collection and treatment of waste water. Water supply and waste water services were generally provided for separately in earlier legislation, but such an approach is no longer considered to be appropriate as continued separation could lead to legislative anomalies and would run counter to the ongoing programme of reforming and simplifying the legislative code. Water supply and waste water services are inextricably linked. While each contains some unique elements, they are two sides of the same coin, in effect. Water services are provided by county and city councils acting as sanitary authorities. The Bill provides that, where water services are concerned, county and city councils will cease to be known as sanitary authorities and will become known as "water services authorities". References to water services authorities in the Bill are, in effect, references to the relevant county or city council acting in its capacity as the provider and guardian of water services in its functional area.The primary purpose of the Bill is to establish a comprehensive and modern legislative code governing functions, standards, obligations and practice in respect of the planning, management and delivery of water supplies and the collection and treatment of waste water. The Bill, which consolidates and modernises the existing legislative code governing water services, is the first root and branch consolidation and modernisation of water services law for more than 120 years since the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878. While some of the older texts have stood the test of time, much of the language and concepts are outdated and arcane. Many quaint terms used in the 1878 Act, such as "water-closets" and "water undertakers" are no longer in common usage. Other provisions, such as those in the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 referring to "earth closets, water-closets or privy accommodation", have echoes of past centuries and have long since been overtaken.The legislative code is being consolidated to provide a modern and easily accessible code governing all aspects of water services in a single text. Those undertaking research on water services law are required to trawl through a maze of different enactments, many of which have been amended or superseded by later enactments. The Bill sets a baseline behind which legislators, practitioners, the courts and the public will no longer be required to search if they wish to ascertain the legal foundation for requirements relating to the provision of water services.Having introduced the House to the Bill's key terminology and familiarised Deputies with its objectives, it is appropriate to clarify what the Bill is not about. This is necessary to correct any misunderstandings, or deliberate or untruthful efforts to create misunderstandings which might exist in respect of its objectives and to better inform the upcoming debate.I wish to deal first with the suggestion that the Water Services Bill is linked to privatisation in some way. Nothing in the Bill is intended to move water services policy towards privatisation. The Bill retains the present public ownership arrangements and provides the necessary supports to foster the development of those arrangements into a top-class service. The privatisation of water services would require significant additional legislation to provide for an independent regulator to oversee service delivery, for example. That is not attempted in the Bill and is not its intention or purpose.The Bill anticipates the growing involvement of public private partnerships, PPPs, in the provision of water services. Neither PPPs nor related design, build and operate arrangements are precursors to the privatisation of water services. Such arrangements involve the contracting of private sector expertise to perform functions on behalf of contracting water authorities. Assets remain in the full ownership of the relevant authority or group water scheme. Such arrangements represent the best way forward for the development and renewal of our water services infrastructure. They can provide value for money and the application of the latest specialist expertise. They give independent assurance that legal obligations relating to the protection of human health and the environment are being complied with when water services are being delivered. All my Department's capital funding of new water supply and waste water treatment infrastructure is subject to an assessment of the suitability of the project for procurement as a PPP. That is a long way from privatisation.I would like to discuss the issue of domestic water charges. If I may be excused the pun, it seems that there has been a deliberate attempt to muddy the waters in this regard. I stress that the Bill before the House does not provide for or facilitate the re-introduction of domestic water charges. The Government's position on water charges is not changed in any way by this Bill. The Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997, which specifically precludes charging for domestic water services, remains in force and will continue to apply after the Bill has been enacted.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	273	The Minister would know all about that.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	274	Before I outline what the Bill is about, I wish to address concerns which have been expressed about provisions on metering of water services. The power to install meters is provided for in existing water services legislation. The metering of water services is a long-standing policy for non-domestic users and a prerequisite to effective water management. Local authorities are well on the way to metering all non-domestic users of water services by 2006, which was the target set out in the Government's 1998 water pricing policy framework. Surveys have indicated that non-domestic consumers would prefer to be charged on the basis of the amount of water consumed rather than at a flat rate because such a system of measurement offers due regard for those involved in water conservation efforts. Water metering promotes the sustainable use of water resources and reflects the proper application of the polluter pays principle and the cost recovery requirements of the EU water framework policy directive. I repeat that the Bill is not a Trojan horse for domestic charges. Such charges are specifically prohibited under the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997.It may be helpful at this stage to give a brief overview of what the Bill provides. It establishes the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as the national authority for regulating the provision of water services. I envisage a hierarchical system of regulation and supervision extending from my Department, through the water services authority sector, to the group water services scheme sector.Section 30 sets out the functions of the Minister for that purpose. It places a duty on the Minister to facilitate the provision of safe and efficient water services and associated infrastructure. The Minister is also required to supervise and monitor the performance by water services authorities of their functions under the Act and is given responsibility for planning and supervision of investment in water services.So that he can carry out those functions, the Bill provides the Minister with a broad range of powers, including regarding the provision of guidance, the issue of binding directions, and the monitoring of the performance by individual authorities of their functions — including their own supervisory functions as necessary. To assist and advise the Minister in that regard, the Bill also enables the Minister to appoint statutory consultative groups and committees. That will allow the Minister to involve a broad cross-section of expertise and stakeholder interests in the ongoing evolution and implementation of policy and best practice regarding water services.The main functions of water services authorities are set out in sections 31 and 32. Those two sections provide the basic statutory framework for water services authorities to deliver water services, assist others in providing water services and supervise the delivery of water services by other persons. The Minister may make regulations specifying performance criteria and quality standards which must be achieved regarding those functions. It is envisaged that most of the EU directives concerning water services, including the drinking water directive and relevant elements of the urban waste water treatment directive, will be transposed into national law under those provisions.Consistent with the EU drinking water directive, each water services authority is obliged to ensure that water intended for human consumption in its area meets prescribed standards and is provided with powers to prohibit or restrict the use of a water supply, where necessary, to protect public health or the environment. It is envisaged that those powers could be applied either to follow up a water quality incident or at times of drought to protect the integrity of the water supply and related ecosystems.The Bill provides that each water services authority will carry out its functions in the context of a strategic management framework for the delivery of water services in its area, drawn up in agreement with the Minister. Strategic planning is the cornerstone of all successful enterprises and provides a structured approach to anticipating and responding to demand. It is an essential prerequisite for the efficient and effective delivery of services to required standards, at the right point, at the right time and at the least cost. The hallmark of that approach is evident in the operations of many of our major companies and other public utilities, and it is no less relevant to water services.Strategic planning has already been introduced on an informal basis in the rural water sector. Section 36 provides for the introduction of an operational planning and review cycle across both rural and urban areas in the functional area of each water services authority. Each water services authority will be required to draw up a water services strategic plan for its functional area at intervals of six years, or after such shorter period as the authority may decide, and to submit it to my Department for approval. The plan will outline the situation regarding water services in its area of application, both current and projected, and identify appropriate responses with a view to protecting human health and the environment and supporting ongoing sustainable development.The strategic planning process will be based on a partnership between my Department and each water services authority to ensure that national and local water services agendas are fully synchronised. Such co-ordination is essential to ensure that water services plans are fully integrated into national investment planning for social and economic development. The provision in the Bill to enable two or more authorities to prepare joint plans will also ensure that plans for adjoining authorities' functional areas are properly integrated with each other in order to maximise potential synergies and efficiencies and guard against any cumulative impacts that might have an adverse effect on sustainable development or environmental protection in the surrounding region.The Bill also puts in place a framework of provisions to protect the integrity of water services distribution and collection networks. Unauthorised connection or discharge to a waterworks or waste water works is prohibited. Section 103 prohibits building over another person's water distribution system or drains without the consent of the relevant water services authority. New powers in sections 55 and 61 enable a water services authority to require a developer to open up water supply pipes and drains for inspection before connection to its services. Water services authorities will have powers to specify technical requirements regarding such connections, and it will be an offence under the Bill to make any such connection without the prior approval of the relevant water services authority.The Bill places a new duty of care on owners and occupiers regarding the sustainable use of water services on their premises and prohibits discharge of anything into a sewer which would block or damage it or adversely affect a waste water treatment process. Water services authorities are provided with powers to direct owners to undertake remedial works, or may themselves carry out any necessary repairs and recover their costs from the owners of the premises.This suite of provisions is essential to protect the integrity of the water services infrastructure. It is also essential from an environmental and public health perspective and makes sound economic sense. Over the course of the current national development plan, some €4.4 billion will be invested in the provision of water supply and waste water infrastructure. It is vital that our investment in these new and upgraded water services assets be protected. Duties of care on owners and occupiers are also an essential prerequisite for sustainable rural development. Those provisions are a necessary precautionary measure to help strike a sustainable balance between the potentially adverse environmental impacts of development and the social and economic benefits deriving from such development. Accordingly, section 70 in addition specifically obliges occupiers and owners to maintain septic tanks — referred to as treatment systems — in such condition as to avoid nuisance or risk to human health or the environment.Section 56 provides extensive new powers for the purpose of conserving water supplies. An authorised person is enabled to direct the owner or occupier of a premises to take corrective action to prevent water from being wasted or consumed in excessive amounts. Such officers will also have powers of direction regarding the restriction of water use. Exercise of those powers will be subject to appeal to the District Court, except in times of emergency, and the authorised person will have power to cut off or restrict supply pending compliance.It is essential that adequate powers be available to water services authorities to prevent the wilful waste of water and maximise the benefits of the national water conservation programme. Some €276 million is being invested in the current round of a national programme to identify and substantially reduce the levels of unaccounted-for water in Ireland's water supply network. The investment must be supported by effective enforcement powers to prevent its being undermined by user-side leakage and waste. That is particularly relevant to the household sector, which, because a charge is not levied for its water supplies, has little or no incentive to conserve them.I hasten to repeat once again that there is no intention to re-introduce household water charges. On the matter of costs, the increasing demands on water supplies and levels of cost associated with the provision of this essential public utility is a matter of concern, and everyone must recognise that water is a valuable and finite resource. With that in mind, I intend to bring forward a national water conservation publicity campaign to increase public awareness generally and encourage practical water conservation measures. Sustainable living is a shared responsibility. The fact that water is provided to a household free of charge does not mean that it is free of cost. Water conservation measures will not be fully effective until there is broad public awareness of that fact.The Bill has been drafted with a specific customer focus in mind. Section 32(3) enables the Minister to make regulations on procedures for dealing with consumer complaints. The Bill also contains several new provisions to address long-running problems for consumers that have been brought to the attention of my Department. Section 51, for example, regulates the temporary interruption of water services and obliges water services providers to give reasonable advance notice of interruptions, except in an emergency. Alternative supplies are required to be provided where domestic drinking water supplies are interrupted for more than 24 hours. To ensure unimpeded access to services, water services authorities will also have powers under section 92 to facilitate the connection of individual premises to water services networks through neighbouring connections.Of particular interest to some customers will be the provision in section 43 in relation to the repair of private connections, linking premises with a sewer or water main. Up until now, responsibility for such repairs has rested with owners and occupiers, resulting in particular problems and inconvenience where faults or breakage occurs outside the boundary of the premises. In the absence of clear legislative authority, sanitary authorities have experienced difficulty in providing assistance to households, even where it was considered appropriate to do so. This anomaly has been the subject of much complaint, including in parts of my constituency, and has attracted adverse criticism from the Office of the Ombudsman. I am glad to be in a position therefore to provide in section 43 for a balanced package of measures to address the issue, enabling water services authorities to intervene, to repair or take into their own charge such service connections as they consider appropriate.Detailed provisions in relation to rural water services are set out in Part 6 of the Bill. Chief among these is the proposed introduction of a licensing system to regulate and develop the operations of the group water scheme sector. Problems with the quality of drinking water supplies have been a matter of concern to all involved in the rural water sector for some time. My Department, in consultation with the national rural water monitoring committee, the National Federation of Group Water Schemes and relevant local authorities, has undertaken or facilitated a series of initiatives to address the issue. Record investment has been put in place under the rural water programme of the national development plan. Rural water strategies have been prepared for all relevant county councils. A national source-monitoring programme for schemes serving more than 50 persons has been completed and a comprehensive drinking water monitoring programme is currently under way for these schemes.While these initiatives are having a progressive beneficial effect, it is evident that a stronger regulatory regime is also required to ensure compliance with the relevant operational standards. Part 6 provides accordingly for the introduction of a system of licensing for the group scheme sector. Each water services authority will be the licensing authority for its functional area, and it will be an offence for any person, other than a water services authority, to provide services other than in accordance with the terms of a water services licence.It would be neither practical nor necessary to licence all of the 6,000 or so group water services schemes across the country, many of which serve only two or three households. To do so would place an inappropriate and excessive administrative burden on smaller schemes. It is intended therefore only to apply the licensing requirements of the Bill to the 1,500 or so larger schemes serving more than 50 persons. Provision is therefore included in section 79 to exempt smaller schemes from licensing. However, there are powers to make regulations to provide for alternative requirements with regard to the registration of smaller schemes and their general compliance with specified standards, as required.Individual scheme managements have nothing to fear from the introduction of water services licensing. I intend that water services authorities will use their licensing powers in a proactive manner to support and nurture the development of best practice throughout the group water services scheme sector. The objective will be the progressive achievement of the necessary standards. This will be a developmental and supportive regime, not a bureaucratic one. When operational, it will provide a structured mechanism for each scheme to assure itself of its compliance with its obligations.The Department consulted widely with the group water scheme movement during the course of drafting the Bill, and has its general support for the new provisions, which will serve to underpin the viability of the sector into the future. The group water scheme has been one of the cornerstones of community development in rural areas for the last 40 years or more. It is a prime example of what can be achieved when communities band together to achieve a common good. The many volunteers who have given so generously of their time, talents and energy over the years to improve the lot of rural communities deserve our deepest respect and admiration for their efforts. The group water scheme sector came into being at a time of great need in rural Ireland. It provided an impetus to develop water services infrastructure at a rate far in excess of what central or local government could have achieved if left to their own devices at the time. While the country has changed beyond all expectations in the meantime, the sector is still an essential component of rural water services delivery, and will remain so for the foreseeable future.Licensing is only one of the supports for the development of rural water services provided for in the Bill. Additional administrative powers are also included to enable a water services authority to intervene directly in the operations of a scheme where it considers that its expertise could be applied to the resolution of a particular problem. Section 91 enables a water services authority to take over the operation and management of a waterworks or waste water works on a temporary basis, where it considers that its operation could constitute a risk to public health or the environment, or where a scheme is experiencing operational problems or is consistently in breach of a licence. Such powers, which may be exercised with or without consent, will enable a breathing space to be established to allow individual schemes to continue to function as going concerns while particular problems are resolved.I have outlined the main provisions of the Bill. Metering, to which I have already adverted, is dealt with in Part 5. This Part provides for necessary powers of access for installation, reading and maintenance of meters, and investigation of possible offences pertaining to interference with meters or fraudulent use of supplies. Part 7 of the Bill provides for general powers of acquisition for water services purposes and synchronises these functions fully with local authority powers of acquisition under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Existing powers of acquisition for water services purposes currently dealt with under the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878 will now be repealed. Such simplification and standardisation of procedures is a key objective of the Government's ongoing regulatory reform process.Among the miscellaneous provisions in Part 8 are savers to prevent older, often obscure, pre-1922 statutes from frustrating the application of the Bill. This is a pragmatic, fail-safe device to avoid undermining of the Bill by ancient and long forgotten legal provisions enacted in another era but which may still perversely be applied against the interests of the common good by a petitioner with a particular vested interest.Provision is also included in section 102 to enable An Bord Pleanála to determine fees for appeals to it in relation to licensing of effluent discharges to sewers and waters. This is in line with similar provisions under the planning code, and will facilitate the application of similar procedures by An Bord Pleanála in respect of the various appeals processes for which it has responsibility, and further streamline the regulatory process.I place on record my appreciation of the valued input of the various stakeholders who contributed to the development of this Bill. Key stakeholders, including business interests, the local authority sector, the national rural water monitoring committee and other social partners, were consulted during the drafting process, and helped to ground the provisions of the Bill in a practical reality, reflecting modern-day requirements which the Bill is intended to address. A series of public forums around the country was organised under the auspices of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, and these also facilitated a wide-ranging exchange of views and helped to fine-tune the provisions of Part 6, in particular, to the needs of rural consumers.The final shape and content of the Bill owe much to these consultations. It is in effect a synthesis of expert views on best practice requirements for the development and delivery of modern water services in a modern society. The Bill is a testament to the interest and effort of those who were asked to contribute to it, and I value and appreciate the contribution of all who have made an input.Publication of the Water Services Bill marked another milestone in the ongoing process of regulatory reform undertaken by the Government, and in which my Department has played a leading role. The process has already seen the planning and the local government codes updated and consolidated by my Department. It is now the turn of water services. I am aware that related matters such as water abstraction and management of water bodies such as lakes and river basins are not directly addressed in the Bill. A further consolidation exercise will be required to gather together a comprehensive volume of legislation on the protection and management of water resources generally. However, for the moment I am giving priority to this long overdue element of the regulatory reform process. I will give further consideration to the next phase of the ongoing consolidation and modernisation programme at a later stage.It is interesting and perhaps instructive to reflect on events here and abroad when the legislative code which the Bill replaces was originally enacted. In Ireland, the Fenian rebellion had not long been suppressed, Isaac Butt was in the process of establishing the Home Rule movement and the GAA was yet to be founded. Abroad, slavery had only recently been abolished in America and, in science, Charles Darwin was working on his The Origin of Species. One may marvel at the technology available to this House today but at that time Alexander Graham Bell was only setting about inventing the telephone.I make these points because the Bill is intended to bring ancient provisions up to date. Many events have occurred over the past 150 years and we need a new code. While the outgoing code stood the test of time, its time has now past. In commending this Bill to the House, therefore, I hope the new code will prove as robust and long-lasting as its predecessor. I commend the Bill to the House.

It modernises a significant amount of legislation dating back through the centuries, some of which bears little relevance to the present. The key objective in any water services Bill is that the highest possible standards are achieved to ensure compliance with European Union guidelines and that these standards are complied with at all times.The Minister — perhaps he protests too much — has denied that the Bill is a vehicle for privatisation of our water services or paves the way for the introduction of water charges. However, I am concerned that the Bill may be used as a Trojan horse to introduce water charges, maybe not before the next general election but, if this Government by any chance were successful in that election, we could see the introduction of water charges shortly afterwards.

The Minister may have the expertise of the Civil Service behind him but the Opposition has advantages also. We are committed to hard work on legislation, listening to representative groups and giving views that reflect our experiences on local authorities. The Minister should take this on board so we can begin on an even keel, with respect for each other. He should not be so quick to shout the moment I begin to speak.

The Minister protests too much and I will not accept assurances from a Minister in this discredited Government.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The Bill deals with many issues, one being the metering of premises. The charges for non-domestic water consumers at present are hefty and those users bear the brunt of increases on an annual basis at local level. There is no respite for them in the Bill.From time to time people are critical of EU directives but directives on the environment, particularly with regard to the quality of drinking water and the treatment of waste water, have transformed the way we think and, more importantly, act on these issues. They have served the country well by ensuring greater care, management and accountability on environmental issues. Significant resources have been spent on the delivery of water and EU funding has assisted greatly in co-financing many of the schemes. The water services authorities seem to be presented in such a way that they can be easily cut off from the umbrella of the local authorities and the definition of functions and powers leaves me to suspect that the ultimate goal of the Government is the privatisation of the water services.I have no problem with the requirement of a six-year strategic plan for the purpose of improvement, management and operation of water services infrastructure. This is a sensible approach and one that can be measured to provide a maximum return on the significant investment of public finances in this area. Reports coming from the Environmental Protection Agency state that some public water supplies are regularly in breach of standards for nitrate pollution. What is the up-to-date position on this issue? The Government has long prevaricated in regard to the nitrates directive. When will it make up its mind on this issue? The previous Minister conceded that Ireland is not yet ready to meet the terms of more stringent regulations on drinking water quality. When will we be in a position to comply fully with these regulations and to state what EU directives we are still not implementing?Group water schemes contribute less than 10% of the country's water supply and problems have sometimes been recorded with the quality of water from such schemes, although I accept that major improvements continue to be made in this regard. It must also be acknowledged that the voluntary group schemes have played a major role in rural areas and I hope the new licensing system will assist in their development and address water quality issues in that sector. The Minister is aware that in many areas raw sewage is still entering rivers and the sea, which is a disgrace. He should tell the House when he expects sufficient waste water treatment plants to prevent raw sewage entering the waterways.In the 1980s and 1990s a water charge for domestic and non-domestic uses was in place. However, in 1997 the Government decided to abolish domestic water charges and this was given legal effect in the Local Government (Financial Provisions) Act 1997. Commercial and industrial users of water and waste water continue to be charged for it on both a metered and non-metered basis.The capital cost of major infrastructure was traditionally borne by central Government. Planning contributions levied by local authorities were used mainly for small capital improvements. In the late 1990s the capital cost of providing new infrastructure was part financed through securing major contributions from industrial and commercial users of water and waste water services, especially given that the required investment in water services infrastructure through the national development plan was estimated at about €10 billion. Could the Minister provide analysis in regard to the slow progress of developing some of the major infrastructural schemes? For example, the waste water scheme at Little Island, County Cork, has been ongoing for approximately seven years and is still being commissioned. Has any analysis been undertaken regarding such projects being kept within their cost projections and estimated completion times? Has the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out any analysis of the cost overruns for this type of infrastructure projects?This is important because the rising cost of doing business in Ireland is posing a serious threat for industry both in terms of competitiveness and viability.One cost which is of major concern relates to the charges to be imposed on local industry as a result of newly built waste water treatment plants. One example of this is the charges being imposed on local industries in my area of Cork following the building of the waste water treatment plant at Little Island. IBEC has been in consultation with the two local authorities, Cork City Council and Cork County Council, over the past number of years on this issue to ensure that industry is equitably charged for that plant. I am sure the same arrangement exists in other locations throughout the country.Under the polluter pays principle, the non-domestic sector in Cork city and Little Island will be expected to pay charges towards the construction, operation and maintenance of the plant. The process to determine exact charges for industry has been slow, and it has not yet been fully resolved. However, I am aware that industries will be issued with bills shortly in relation to the operation of the plant.IBEC has a steering group comprising its own representatives and member companies to monitor the progress of the charging mechanism and engage in dialogue with the local authorities concerned. Again, there is an example in the Cork region where the IBEC steering group has engaged with the Cork Chamber of Commerce which is fully supportive of the need to ensure fairness, transparency and equity for local industry which provides many jobs in the region. To give an indication of the seriousness of the situation, one company has been quoted charges of approximately €400,000 per annum. That level of charging is unsustainable for many companies and will lead to job losses if not total cessation of operations. Many companies in my constituency are facing an increase of at least 400% on their current water bills. That matter must be addressed.Approximately €4 billion has been allocated under the national development plan for water supply and waste water treatment infrastructure for the period 2000-06. Under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive 1991, local authorities are obliged to construct secondary and tertiary water treatment plants by 2008. The Water Framework Directive 2000 establishes the polluter pays principle as the method of payment for Ireland's much needed water infrastructure. Customers can be differentiated into domestic and non-domestic based on who pays for their share of the infrastructural costs. Domestic consumers will not pay for water supply or treatment as their share will, at least for the moment, be funded from the Exchequer under the National Water Pricing Framework Policy 2000. However, all non-domestic customers must pay both capital and operational costs for the infrastructure, and a capital contribution is their marginal cost which is the cost of providing the facility over and above the cost of levy being incurred if it had to service the domestic sector only.In dealing with the question of charges, customers in the non-domestic sector can be subdivided into two types of users, significant and general. Significant users are defined as those who have a significant impact on the provision of the service and their number for each treatment plant will depend on the thresholds set by each local authority. Significant users must individually negotiate a contract with the local authority to pay, first, capital costs over a 28 year period and, second, operational maintenance costs per annum. The quantity and nature of output will be metered from each significant user's facility.General users are defined as those companies whose water consumption and waste water production is relatively small and similar to domestic waste water in quality. The quantity of water used will be metered and general users will pay a consolidated charge which covers both capital and operational costs based on metered usage.Have the costs for each local authority been defined? To my knowledge they have not been defined in the Cork area, and arriving at the costs is a complex task. Some local authorities currently define a significant user as an enterprise whose effluent floor rate is in excess of 100 cubic metres per day and which has a loading of 100 kilograms per day of BOD. In the Cork area the local authority has identified 18 significant users and they are being charged accordingly.It seems that where spare capacity has not been provided for non-domestic customers at waste treatment plants, any new industry locating in that area needing treatment capacity will be required to pay the full cost of expanding the treatment plant rather than just a marginal cost as is the case at present. It is believed that this will have very serious implications for industries already located in certain areas that wish to expand their plant facilities. I am also informed that west of the Shannon, areas of lower population density are becoming less attractive to new industries because of these requirements. Will the Minister set out his views on how this arrangement impacts on job creation in areas of less dense population?I know from discussions with businesses that the business community is extremely concerned about the steady erosion in the competitiveness of Irish companies in recent years because business costs have risen extremely rapidly in Ireland and have far outstripped inflation. The very large rises in non-pay costs such as insurance, energy, waste and rates have made the business environment in Ireland very difficult. Further large cost increases such as those associated with waste water treatment must be examined to ensure the costs do not threaten the viability of companies or hinder future capital investments in certain areas. The scale and range of cost to companies in the Cork region is very substantial and onerous — the annual costs for significant users amount to between €250,000 to €800,000. This is a further tax on businesses and employment. Businesses and their representative bodies are suggesting that, given the business community will be contributing a significant portion of the cost of the treatment plant, the issue of ownership needs to be clarified. In addition, the question of liability in the event of incidents in relation to both the plant and pipework servicing the plant is of significant concern.The reality is that, in order to comply with very strict EU water quality standards, member states will need sophisticated treatment plants in all urban areas by 2008. However, the quantity and nature of Ireland's treatment facilities are well below what is required and there is need for ongoing upgrading of our infrastructure. Significant investment in water infrastructure will be required in the future.While water infrastructure predominantly serves the domestic sector, the usage by non-domestic customers is between 10% and 20%, and the full cost recovery from all non-domestic customers could result in business facing a bill of between €500 million and €1 billion in capital charges alone. A recent survey carried out by IBEC of 450 companies showed that the average increases in water costs were in the region of 47% between 2001 and 2003 while a similar survey of local authority water charges showed average increases of 90% since 2000. The impact on hospitals, schools and farms will be significant. Schools are now under tremendous pressure to meet their liabilities as non-domestic consumers and much of the fundraising done is to meet these and other liabilities.This brings me to the subject of design, build and operate arrangements. If we are not careful regarding design, build and operate arrangements, up to five major companies will control significant areas of our water services. Will the Minister give details of the extent of design, build and operate arrangements that are in place and what are his plans in that regard?In 1998 the Government adopted a water services pricing policy. Its key principle aimed to make the full cost of water and waste water services transparent and to secure the cost recovery from customers. There would be no cross-subsidy of domestic services from non-domestic charges. Non-domestic charges were to include a maximum 20% allowance for leakage. Another key element was the recovery of average operational and marginal capital costs of water services from all non-domestic users. The framework planned for the completion of the metering of all non-domestic users by 2006 and the maintenance of non-charging for domestic water users. Domestic operational costs were to be met through the local government fund and capital costs through the capital programme of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The impact of the development levies imposed since last year has been well-documented. These are effectively a tax on house buyers, particularly first-time buyers. Will these be used to supplement funding from the Department's capital programme for water services?In addition to public schemes, there are approximately 2,500 group schemes providing a water supply for 145,000 households nationwide. Since 1997 the National Federation of Group Water Schemes has made substantial progress in addressing the widespread water quality and distribution problems in that sector. A large number of schemes have been bundled into design-build-operate contracts in partnership with local authorities, the national federation and the groups themselves. I also acknowledge the research carried out by the Institute of Engineers of Ireland in this area. It has pinpointed key issues in the challenges facing Ireland in delivering water services at 21st century standards. High standards are essential to the economic and social well-being of the country. I agree with the institute that, in order to comply with new legislative and sustainability standards, major changes in the organisation of water services must be introduced. I agree with the institute's key objectives of the delivery of high quality water services to best international services; the reduction of leakage losses from a 2000 average of 47% to 20%; the upgrade of the water pipe network, much of which is in poor condition; and meeting the challenges of climate change.There are approximately one million domestic and 160,000 non-domestic water consumer connections. However, the level of water use and leakage in Ireland is higher than that pertaining in Europe, including the UK. In Ireland, daily domestic consumption of water by customer is approximately 160 litres compared to 125 litres in England and Wales and 115 litres in other European countries. While the percentage of water loss in distribution through leakage in Ireland stands at 50%, it stands at 24% in England and Wales and at less than 10% in other European countries. To have a sustainable high quality water service, the need to account for the impact of global warming on rainfall patterns and water storage requirements must be recognised. Ongoing major capital investment must be introduced to meet water quality and waste water standards. The pipe network, much of which is in poor condition, must be renewed. We must ensure the environmental management of water resources in accordance with the objectives of the European water framework directive. We must ensure best value for money while recognising the need for economic and environmental regulation in order to protect the consumer.In addressing water quality and supply, the Institute of Engineers of Ireland has stated that a comprehensive review of the organisation arrangements for delivery of water services should be carried out with the adoption of a regional approach based on river catchment. It has also recommended the establishment of local and regional water authorities for the management and delivery of water services. It has called for the establishment of a water services regulator to set standards and targets for service delivery by these water authorities and to approve water charge mechanisms and charges. Will the Minister give his views on these proposals?The Minister has denied that this legislation will be used as a Trojan horse to introduce privatisation and water charges. While it is not a reflection on the Minister's judgment, I do not have his confidence in the Government.

The only way to stop the creeping privatisation of our water services and the introduction of water charges is to ensure that the Government is not re-elected.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	286	As I listened to the Minister's reverie about the 19th century, I too was struck by how times have changed. The Minister was struck by the contrast between the rudimentary nature of the Victorian world and the modernity of present day society. I was struck more by the contrast between how much more was achieved in the 19th century in the provision of infrastructure in this country by a foreign government during the poorest of circumstances and how little has been achieved in the past seven years by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government during the wealthiest of times this island has ever experienced. Contrast the Victorians' achievement in the building of national schools, a road and rail network and the provision of water and sewerage schemes for towns with what this Government has done, with all the technology and moneys available to it. There is no decent public transport system. Instead, the rail system between our cities is less efficient and frequent than it was in the Victorian era. Why are there places where water quality is still poor and supply inadequate? Why must the people of Corke Abbey and Woodbrook Glen in the Dún Laoghaire constituency endure the stench of sewage every summer because of the inadequacy of the treatment plant in that area? Every once in a while, a boring-looking Bill appears on the Order Paper, the contents of which appear to be non-contentious and the debate on which promises to be pretty pedestrian. The press disappear from the Press Gallery, Deputies use the opportunity to raise issues of mainly local concern and eventually the Minister and the party spokespersons are despatched into committee to consider technical amendments that never fire the political imagination.On the face of it, this is one such Bill. It consolidates and modernises all the arcane 19th century legislation on water and sewage; transposes to national law a battery of EU directives and regulations; introduces a licensing system for water services and puts the national rural water monitoring committee on a statutory basis. Until the Bill is examined more closely, this seems to be all good, solid law making, but boring politics. When one peels back the misleading rhetoric of the Minister's speech and reads the text of the Bill that bears little relationship to what the Minister said about it in the course of his speech, one finds a Bill that may have significant implications for every household but the implications of which may not be felt for a number of years to come. At that stage, press and politicians alike will wonder where the extraordinary powers came from and how this happened, only to find that it all emanated from a dull-looking Bill called the Water Services Bill 2003.This seemingly boring, technical Bill will permit water services in Ireland to be privatised without any further authority from Dáil Éireann and will allow water service providers to charge for water. Although the Minister protests that water charges are not being introduced, this Bill provides a way around the 1997 Act that abolished domestic water charges. The Bill introduces metering of water and of sewage. It authorises water service providers to tell a householder how much water he or she may use and if necessary to ration the water. It allows future EU water legislation to be implemented without further primary legislation being brought before the Oireachtas. The Bill empowers county managers to make and amend strategic water service plans without any public consultation and without having to obtain the approval of the elected councillors. It permits water service providers to dig up public roads without having to obtain a road opening licence. They will simply need the consent of the roads authority, I presume, with just a telephone call. The Bill makes individual householders legally liable for the quality of water coming through their domestic taps, while at the same time it indemnifies the Minister, the city and county councils and the water service providers for any fault on their part.Perhaps the most remarkable thing about this Bill is what is omitted from it. One would expect that the first water services Bill of the 21st century, in a State that, according to economists, intends to be the most prosperous in Europe, would have something to say about the citizen's right to water. Water is essential for life. This Bill acknowledges and legislates for European directives that emphasise water quality and hygiene, but nowhere does it state that the people have a right, subject to compliance with planning law, to a connection to a public water supply or to access clean water. This legislation should define access to water as a right and the consequential obligations should be placed on the relevant public authorities.If anything, this Bill faces in the opposite direction. Sections 6 to 14, hammer out what a person may not do in respect of the provision of a water supply. These sections set down heavy penalties for non-compliance. I appreciate the intention of these sections is to confine the provision of water services to the public water authorities or to authorised or licensed water service providers and that such a regulated framework is in the public interest. However, it is at least very odd drafting to begin a Bill with what is being banned, before setting out what is being provided. In the absence of a clear statement of a statutory right to water, the effect is to turn water into a commodity and to give water service providers a role that is at least potentially commercial.The provisions that make the Minister, the water authorities and other water services providers, immune from legal action reinforces the omission of a statutory right to water. Section 29 states that nobody can take a legal action against the Minister, a water services authority or other prescribed person, arising from any failure to provide water or failure to fulfil their functions under this Bill. Similar immunity is being granted to their officers and employees. A water services authority can cut off a water supply to a household or to a business and under section 56(12):Liability shall not accrue to a water services authority arising from any consequence of the restriction or cutting off of a supply of water in accordance with subsection (11).If this Bill is passed, the individual person or householder will have no statutory right to water. The supply of water will be legally confined to the public water authorities and to those licensed or authorised under this Bill and those bodies cannot be made accountable through the courts for any failure or omission. They can deny us water, they can even poison us with the water they supply and we cannot seek remedy in a court of law.We will not be able to do much about it through the democratic system either. The provision of water at local level will be governed by the water services strategic plan. This will be analogous to the county development plan or the waste management plan. Section 36(3) states:The making, replacement or revision of a water services strategic plan is an executive function.In other words, the water services strategic plan will be decided by the city or county manager, and under section 37, it will be approved or amended by the Minister. There is no provision for any public consultation about the plan. The elected council will have no function at all in respect of the plan. Lest there be any doubt, section 36(5)(b) prohibits the council from exercising its powers under the Local Government Act to give any direction to the manager about the plan.This Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has habitually transferred local powers to city and county managers. The unique feature of this Bill is that there is not even a pretence of public involvement or democratic accountability. Strategic planning for the provision of the most basic necessity of life, water, will be done in secret by appointed officials who will not have to tell the public what they are doing; will not have to subject their plans to a vote of the people's representatives and will be immune from action in the courts for the consequences of their actions.According to section 38, it is only when it has been made by the manager and approved by the Minister that the plan must be published. Under section 38(3), the only right being granted to the public is to get a copy of the plan after it has been made and then only on payment of a fee by the member of the public. Even then, the person can be made wait for 21 days before the council forwards it to him or her.Apart from the lack of democracy and even courtesy to the public that this process demonstrates, it is wide open to abuse. The strategic planning of water mains and sewerage services and the lands through which they pass or service, are critical factors in the development of land and in the consequential speculation and value of land. I ask the House to imagine what a George Redmond might do if he had the power given in this Bill to make strategic water services plans and decide where and when water and sewerage pipes were to pass through whose lands and where.The powers of the Minister and manager are not confined to making strategic plans. In this Bill they are also being given the effective power to privatise water services without further reference to this House. The Minister protests it is not the intention of the Bill to privatise water services and that it is mischievous to say otherwise. All I can do is rely on the text of the Bill. Section 27 states:(1) Subject to subsection (2), where the Minister is satisfied that—(a) any function conferred on a water services authority by this Act could be effectively performed in lieu or in addition by the Minister, or other prescribed person,(b) any function conferred on the Minister could be performed in lieu or in addition by a water services authority or other prescribed person,the Minister may prescribe that the Minister, a water services authority or other person prescribed may perform the function from a prescribed date.It is quite clear from that that the Minister has the power to prescribe any other person to do anything the Minister or a water services authority has the power to do under this legislation. That enables the Minister to prescribe that a particular water service be delivered by, for example, a private company.Section 28 again emphasises that particular dimension. It states:(1) The Minister may, following consultation with any Minister of the Government who in the opinion of the Minister is concerned, by regulations—(a) assign to a water services authority or such other person as may be prescribed, additional functions in relation to water services.Again the power is being given to the Minister to assign to persons, other than himself or a water services authority, the additional powers envisaged in this legislation.Sections 6, 7, 24 and 25 all refer to the Minister, water services authority and what is called "any other person prescribed" as having duties and responsibilities under this Bill. The question that must be asked is, what is meant by this "any other person" referred to in this legislation? The term is not defined in the legislation. I am sure the Minister would have us believe that what is intended is the group water schemes, that is, that this is what "any other person" refers to. However, section 16, which deals with the allocation of grants, draws a distinction between the "any other person" frequently referred to in the legislation and the providers of water under group water schemes.The right to privatise water services under this legislation will not be confined to the Minister. Under section 31, a water services authority or a local authority can privatise its own water supply, a reservoir, a water treatment plant or an individual sewage treatment plant. I draw the Minister's attention to section 31(5) which states: "Without prejudice to the State Authorities (Public Private Partnership Arrangements) Act 2002, for the purposes of fulfilling all or any of its functions under subsection (2), a water services authority may make arrangements with another person, including entering into an agreement or arrangement with another person in relation to the provision of water services by another person or jointly with it in part or all of its functional area.” As I read it, that is not, as the Minister purported to tell this House, simply the public private partnership arrangement. This subsection makes it clear that, while it may be public private partnership, it may be much wider than that as well.It is nothing new. We already know, for example, that many local authorities have privatised their waste collection services. The process of privatisation in the area of water services has already begun. International water companies have already become involved in the upgrading of group water schemes. I understand there have been cases where group water schemes have been grouped together with some smaller public schemes. I have no objection to that. The design-build-operation formula is already being used effectively to privatise parts of the water services provision. It is meaningless for the Minister to try to assure the House that there is no issue of privatisation of the water services supply in this country when the process has already started and when this Bill clearly sets down a blueprint for it.Section 34 clearly anticipates that privatisation will occur. It provides for the Minister to issue guidelines and codes of practice to water service authorities and to what is called "the provision of water services by any other person". If water is to become a commodity and privatisation of water supply is to become a reality, then the issue, inevitably, arises about charging for water. Again, the Minister protests that water charges are not being introduced and that the 1997 Act, which abolished them, is not being repealed. That is true up to a point but this Bill clearly anticipates and provides for a charging regime. It is not surprising that it should do so.The Bill deals with the implementation of, or the giving effect to, European Union directives. We know the European Union water framework Ddrective requires cost recovering in regard to water supplies and that certain exemptions were made in making that framework for this country in that provided the Government could show there was cost recovery by some other means, it would not necessarily insist on the re-introduction of domestic water charges. We also know that is subject to review in approximately 2008 or 2010.Section 5 gives effect to the European Union directives. What is interesting are the contents of section 30(3) which states:When carrying out his or her functions under the Act, the Minister shall have regard to and take full account of:(a) the principle of recovery of the costs of water services as provided for in Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive.It is interesting that that provision of the water framework directive should be singled out for special mention in the legislation. After all, if the water famework directive is being given effect anyway in the Bill, why list this provision and highlight it as a matter the Minister must take into account in carrying out his or her function? It is to underline the fact that this Bill provides for a charging regime.An interesting and significant feature of this Bill — it is an unusual feature and one which I do not think has precedent in any other legislation I have seen — is section 28(2) which, as I read it, effectively means that this Bill is putting into Irish law future European Union directives in regard to water services before they are even made. Section 28(2) states:Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), regulations under this section may assign to a water services authority or such other person as may be prescribed, any function. . . in the opinion of the Minister, arises from, or is necessary for or in connection with the implementation of-(a) any provision of the treaties governing the European Communities,(b) any Act adopted by the institutions of those Communities, or(c) any international convention or agreement to which the State is, or becomes, a party.It is the first time I have come across primary legislation giving effect to international obligations, or to legislation drawn up by the European Union, before they have been made. That is happening in anticipation of a change in the water framework directive which may make it mandatory for this country to re-introduce domestic water charges.Section 30(4)(d) states the Minister may specify standards, issue guidelines and codes of practice and give directions on matters relating to the provision of water services, including pricing mechanisms. Section 36(8) requires a water services strategic plan to include a provision dealing with income and expenditure. Where is the income to come from in the water services strategic plans of local authorities if there is not some form of charging? Section 52 gives to a council, water authority or any other person acting jointly with it or on its behalf, the power to recover sums due to it in respect of the provision of water services. Why would councils or other persons providing water services need to have the power to recover sums due to it if there were not to be some kind of charging regime?Part 5 deals with metering. Section 72, which specifically permits the provision of water meters, sets out that subject to any direction of the Minister under this Act, a water service authority may supply water by measure and meter for it and so on. Section 72(1)(b) states that a water service authority may, subject to complying with the provisions of other enactments in relation to charging for water services, charge a rent or otherwise recover from a user the costs incurred by it in respect of every meter or other instrument provided for measuring the water supply to or the waste water discharged by that user. That is the way the Minister has found around the 1997 Act. He is leaving the 1997 Act in place. He said he is not re-introducing domestic water charges but he is obliging the householder to have a meter and he can charge the householder a rent for the meter.Section 72(5) outlines regulations governing the operation of meters. Section 72(5)(h) is interesting in that it refers to the Minister’s power to make regulations relating to the rental of meters and related charges. Meters will also be used for sewage purposes which will give a whole new meaning in the domestic household to the concept of spending a penny. The implications of this Bill for householders is very clear. There will be a charge for water and sewage. Those charges may yet have to be paid to private companies if the provision of those services is privatised as this Bill enables the Minister and the water service authorities to do.Section 54 outlines general duties on owners of premises. From a water conservation point of view I can understand why they are being introduced. It allows the water services authority to give a direction to a householder regarding how much water he or she is using and to ration water. Householders would be well advised to become acquainted with this provision because it puts a legal obligation on them regarding the quality of water in the home.As Deputy Allen stated, the Bill is most comprehensive. The Minister outlined how it provides a new regulatory framework for the delivery of water services. It places a serious obligation on the Minister and the Department. The new licensing regime and administrative responsibilities will also place new obligations on local authorities. A significant investment programme of €4.4 billion has been allocated for the introduction of the changes. However, I question whether the Minister and the Department will be in a position to implement the legislation. The Government has proposed to decentralise the Department to Enniscorthy, New Ross, Waterford and Wexford.

On the assumption that those 38 people are fairly evenly distributed throughout the Department, if the decentralisation programme proceeds, we will find that the staff and expertise which has built up in this rather complex area will have to opt for transfer to Departments remaining in Dublin and the Minister will have to start afresh with new people who may have considerable experience in Army barracks, school buildings and the fitting out of hospitals but will not have assembled a great deal of experience on water treatment plants. I submit that the same applies to other divisions of the Department. I wonder — as I am sure the Minister does — how this ambitious programme based on the new regulatory framework and costing €4.4 billion will be achieved within the time limits required by our European Union obligations, given that the staff dealing with the matter would be entirely inexperienced in the area.I accept there is a need to modernise and update water services legislation, introduce new procedures and implement European Union directives. However, I very much regret the inadequate legislation before us. For all the guff about consumer rights, no statutory right of access to water is being given to the public. The legislation is a thinly disguised attempt to privatise the water supply. Going hand in hand with that is a formula to get around the 1997 Act and re-introduce water charges by another name, be that a rent for the meter or a straight-up charge. It is our duty as an Opposition to oppose this legislation and, accordingly, the Labour Party will oppose the Second Stage reading of the Bill.

While I accept that a consolidation of the various legislative measures relating to water services dating back to the 19th century is long overdue, I question whether it was necessary to produce a legislative tome of this nature. I refer to its content rather than its size. I wish to focus on a particular concern relating to the introduction of legislation that is designed to pave the way for water charges and the privatisation of water services. The former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, stated in the Seanad that it was not the Government's intention to bring in water charges.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I do not believe a word of it. It also causes me considerable concern that this Bill has emanated from a Department under his guidance and probably explains why it is so extremely right-wing in terms of its proposals. The Water Services Bill should not have been intended to facilitate the privatisation of water services. However, given the Government's record on promises and in particular the previous incumbent's attitude to the Opposition, we can be forgiven for being sceptical particularly given that the Bill contains measures specifically related to the provision of meters.Part 5 has rightly raised eyebrows and a number of questions, as indicated by previous speakers as regards powers of access for installation, reading and maintenance of meters. Why are meters necessary if it is not the intention to bring forward water charges? I accept that meters have been used in strategic locations by local authorities for many years in terms of attempting to measure the volume of water going through systems. However, increasingly meters are being affixed to all new housing schemes. Why is this happening? Are people to be asked just to reduce the consumption of water? Are they going to be asked to use the toilet less, take fewer showers etc.? Why is there a meter on every home? It certainly raises suspicions on this side of the House as do a number of proposals contained in this Bill.Section 29, for example, gives complete legal immunity to the Minister, the local authority or the water authority in terms of access or even damage to property in the course of such inspections. Why is such a broad provision included in this Bill? Why is it necessary? On the issue of local democracy in section 36(3) the Minister is taking away the power of members of a local authority to make a plan in respect of water and waste water. That is now to be the complete reserve of county and city managers. We know why this is, because the last two Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey and Deputy Cullen, both rowed back significantly in terms of the powers of members of local authorities. They loaded those powers onto the executive, the county and city managers. I wonder if the current incumbent will attempt to reverse the trend that has been emerging under those two previous Ministers.Why should people seek election to a local authority? Increasingly members are being left with no authority. They cannot even sweep the streets, given the current trend. Section 56 prohibits an appeal to the District Court in certain circumstances. Is that not draconian?My party is completely opposed to the introduction of water charges. We view it as a regressive stealth tax. Given that we oppose direct charges for domestic rates, we cannot support proposals for metering of domestic water supplies. We are firmly of the view that everyone has the right to an adequate supply of safe, clean water as a basic entitlement. Ability to access safe clean water cannot be based on a person's ability to pay for it. The provision of water services is a key responsibility of the State and we are fundamentally opposed to the privatisation of water services. We would point to the disastrous record of privatisation of water services in other states.Many people believe that water will probably become the "new oil" at a point in the future when the good clean water supply will dictate the wealth of an economy or country. Is this legislation a case of the Government getting its boot in early? I ask the new Minister — he did not do so at the outset in his speech — to reaffirm the position outlined by Deputy Cullen, that water charges will not be introduced and that services will not be privatised. The best way the Minister can assure us that this is his belief would be to amend the parts of this Bill that indicate footsteps leading to privatisation and the charging for water services.We would also be particularly concerned that water charges may be introduced as a prelude to the making the water services attractive to privatisation, in the same way that waste charges have resulted in the privatisation of waste services in many parts of the State.One of the biggest concerns, apart from pollution of drinking water, is the problem of leakage which is responsible for the loss of between 30% and 45% of all water, particularly in urban areas. Obviously the situation is improving somewhat. Only two and half years ago there was a report from the Department indicating that between 47% and 53% was being lost. It is absolutely vital that a comprehensive leakage control strategy is put in place to address this. Vast quantities of water are being treated and simply allowed to leak into the ground because of faulty piping. Treating water for public consumption is expensive and losing treated water through leakage is a waste of a valuable resource. Although it is obviously not practical to eliminate leakage completely, we should aim for the lowest possible level. Addressing leakage is an area of savings that has not been fully explored, particularly as a mechanism for releasing extra resources for capital expenditure.I note section 36 provides for the making of the plan by the executive. I wonder if the new Minister, given that this is not his Bill, will give that little power back to local authority members and reinstate it as a reserve function.Water quality in this State remains a problem. As I said, I welcome the provision in Part 6 providing for the introduction of a system of licensing for group water schemes. This is particularly important in the light of the fact the EPA reported in February of this year that the overall quality of drinking water supplied by group water schemes remained unsatisfactory. Worryingly, that report also found that some public water supplies consistently breach standards such as aluminium and nitrates.Before I leave the subject of group water schemes, I commend those members of the community who for many years have been strong in terms of delivering on such schemes and providing an excellent service. Unfortunately my time is up, but I look forward to Committee Stage.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	294	The Water Services Bill, under cover of modernising the legislation, provides a framework for the privatisation of the water supply in this State and for the introduction of the hated water charges which a magnificent movement of ordinary people power forced out in 1996. A water tax may not be introduced before the next general election. The Government remembers what happened in the mid 1990s and the reaction of decent taxpayers in Dublin to the hated bin tax, for example. It may not want to risk introducing them before the general election, but the Minister should be honest. The Government wants a water tax. Senior people in various Departments want water tax, not as a conservation but as a revenue raising measure. Public private partnership, as provided for in this Bill, is a preparation for privatisation. Outsourcing is invariably a preparation for privatisation of public services. Witness Aer Lingus. The Comptroller and Auditor General in his recent report exploded the myth that public private partnerships gave value to the taxpayer. In the case of the six schools which he examined he found a stunning 13% to 9% greater cost than if they had been supplied in full public ownership.The supply of water is a crucial service. It is a life and death matter in many countries where billions of people do not have access to clean drinking water but it is wrong of elements of the media to hint, as did even the Minister, that this is a free supply. Householders, working people and taxpayers have paid for the infrastructure that provides clean water to our homes and other premises. That is the point and that is why it is available.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	295	I just said that. I said it is not free.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	296	Yes, but as I will show in the limited time available, the suggestion is that water is free and, therefore, having it supplied to our homes without a specific tax or charge on it means we will wantonly waste it. That is always the subtext for saying we must have direct water charges. I reject that.The explanatory memorandum states the Bill deals with management of water in the pipe from abstraction to discharge as treated waste water. I am bitterly disappointed with the lack of any originality in the Bill in respect of the significant measures that could be taken with regard to conservation and avoiding the waste of huge amounts of pure drinking water. Section 53 states a person who wilfully wastes or permits wastage of any water supplied by a water services authority is guilty of an offence, but the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government and local authorities throughout the country are guilty of standing over the wastage of huge amounts of pristine drinking water.For example, they could prescribe building regulations, and I want the Minister to reply to this at the end of the debate, that would ensure design of water systems in homes and other premises which could save massive amounts of drinking water on an annual basis. It is incredible that a single flush of a toilet to remove a fraction of a litre of waste liquid water wastes gallons of pure drinking water because of the huge capacity of toilet systems. Other countries have a dual flush system to remove liquids and greater amounts to reduce solids. In my estimation a simple measure such as the modification of toilet systems alone, and in Dublin alone, would conservatively save at least 500 million gallons, or 1.5 billion litres, of pristine drinking water each year. I preached that seven or eight years ago when I was elected to the Dáil, and before that in the local authorities. It is a massive dereliction of duty that nothing has been done. I am so frustrated I put an object about a litre size in my own toilet system as a personal saving measure but personal gestures are not what is needed. Similarly, in regard to the design of buildings, rain tanks in every home would save hundreds of millions of gallons of water that is wasted in gardens, washing cars and so on.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	297	As someone who has lived in rural Ireland for many years, I have first-hand experience of the wonderful people involved in rural communities. The greatest example of that is the group water scheme system, of which I have personal experience. I saw the wonderful effort made by so many people not only to set up those schemes but run them around the clock, no more than a rural general practitioner who is out at all hours of the day and night. That work was done by people whose cousins lived in the towns and had everything provided for them. I want to record my admiration of the wonderful and continuing effort by those people in rural areas.I became aware of a case involving two elderly ladies who were trustees of a particular scheme. They were being pilloried by the media, the Government and the local authority because there was contamination of the water in Ballycroy. Those ladies were put under terrible pressure but it was obvious that the money had not been made available by successive Governments to allow the necessary investment to bring those schemes up to the proper standard. The same investment available for local authorities was not made available to communities and that tells the story very well. What happened in that case was very unfair.I was involved in the setting up of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes. I was chairman of the federation until I was elected to this House. I was involved in negotiations on the rural water programme when I first suggested the idea of a quality control standard. I welcome that and the progress made on a charter of rights for group water schemes and so on. As a result of the threat of a large European Union fine, money was made available but that investment needs to continue. It would be a terrible injustice if the money was not put invested.I am concerned about the various penalties now being introduced. Many people involved in group water schemes were expecting this legislation, which is necessary to a point, but the concern is that it will be used as a stick to beat those very people who have made Trojan efforts. Those people need to be kept on board because if they are beaten down, so to speak, they will simply give up and this major voluntary effort will not be replaced by Government. Somebody else will then take over this work at a major cost to the State.I have also met many older people in particular throughout the country who have put their hearts and souls into these schemes, as well as those who were involved in the setting up of the National Federation of Group Water Schemes, people like Sean Clerkin, the current national co-ordinator, Brendan O'Mahoney, the current chairman, and so on.I welcome the fact that the national rural water monitoring committee is getting statutory recognition under the Bill. I ask the Minister to ensure in particular that the county monitoring committees are equally strengthened because they are key to ensuring fair play and that a democratic deficit does not arise. I suggested that scheme should be extended to the planning system, in which there is a major democratic deficit.A major infrastructure deficit exists also. We agree it has to be quality focused and the most money should be put into ensuring quality but there is a major problem with the lack of infrastructure. These communities have been deprived over the years. The systems are run down and with the exacting EU standards they are expected to perform. The penalties involved are severe but it would be a travesty if those people were penalised in any way.I congratulate the Minister on his appointment but I ask him to consult widely with the group water scheme activists, ensure there is fair play, that those involved in the group water schemes are not bullied or coerced and that the licensing system is fair. If the Minister allows any injustice to creep in, he will kill the goose that lays the golden egg, and the State will be the loser. The Minister should strengthen the county monitoring committees and ensure the system works in a democratic fashion.

It is worth noting that the Bill contains many excellent recommendations for improving the management of our water supply systems.I wish to pay tribute to those entrusted with the management of group water schemes throughout the country who have done Trojan work over the years and whose role, in a sense, is elevated by the demands of this legislation, not to supersede the work they are doing but to recognise that and put a good regulatory system in place, which is necessary.

I wish him well in his new portfolio and congratulate him on his appointment. I look forward to constructive dialogue commencing with this motion tonight.I move:That Dáil Éireann:—noting that it is almost 12 months since the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs published its major report, The Position of Full-Time Carers;—regretting the failure of the Government to take action to implement the key recommendations contained in the report;—conscious of the fact that the CSO has produced figures showing that almost 150,000 people in Ireland provide unpaid help for a family member or friend with a disability; and—aware that carers are saving the State huge expenditure that would arise should those being cared for have to be provided with institutional care;calls on the Government to recognise the value of the carers' contribution by:—the abolition of the means test for the carer's allowance;—the introduction of a comprehensive system of assessment of the supports and services required by carers;—a significant shift of resources to home care subvention;—the introduction of a respite care grant for all carers;—the development of a national strategy for carers.I wish to share my time with Deputies Stagg, Moynihan-Cronin and Lynch.Almost a year has elapsed since the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs launched its report, The Position of Full-Time Carers. Since that time the Government has done nothing of consequence to improve the position for carers who, as I have said repeatedly, are some of the best people in our society. Carers are the unsung heroes of Irish society. It is time we acknowledge their role and begin compensating them for the demanding work they are asked to do.Figures published by the Central Statistics Office last March show that there are almost 150,000 people in Ireland providing unpaid help for a family member or friend with a disability or health problem. The person being cared for could be a child with a physical or mental disability, a stroke victim or an incapacitated elderly relative. In many cases this unpaid care is being provided 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. In some cases a person may be caring for more than one dependant. Providing the level of care required can take a huge physical and emotional toll on the provider. The demand for care can be constant. Significant physical effort is often required, for example, in lifting or moving the patient. Carers can find themselves confined to the house almost as much as the person for whom they care. There is no guaranteed time off, no holidays, no weekend breaks and, in most cases, no financial compensation. Frequently the persons providing the care are themselves elderly. There cannot be a single Deputy who does not have a list of cases of carers enduring significant personal hardship because of their circumstances. I have been deeply moved by some of the letters I received from carers. I have volumes of them, but I will read two samples. The first states:Dear Mr. Penrose,As a carer and member of a support group I read with interest your report and recommendations of the joint committee. I am especially interested in a submission which calls for the abolition of means testing for carers. As it is almost a year since the report was passed I feel the decision should be acted on immediately. Could you please inform me of any future progress of same?The second letter states:Dear William Penrose,My name is — and I live at — with my mother, my husband and my three very young children. I am sure you are a busy man so I will keep this very short if I can. I have applied for carer's allowance and in the end I simply gave up not because I won the Lotto but because I could not keep up with the endless paperwork they requested. They even subjected my frail mother to an exam by a Department doctor as they would not accept or believe her doctor of 20 years that she is in need of full-time care. My brother and sister both work full time so all her care fell to me as I am at home with my kids. The thing is my kids are not the reason I cannot do the full-time computer course offered in a particular place with FÁS. They would give me the money for the child care but I have no one to look after my Mum. I feel like I cannot move on with my life until her needs are met.My choices are to put her in a nursing home and let the people's Government foot the bill or pay for full-time care which I cannot afford or leave her alone and hope nothing will happen and if something does happen she will end up in a particular hospital costing the Government thousands of euros every week. I feel I am stuck and not recognised by the Government. If I got my, as I see it, just reward for all the care I provided I might not feel so stuck. Please do your best to abolish the means testing for all us unseen and unheard carers in Ireland. We do the work for the Government. We just want to be recognised.These are very small cross-samples of the letters I receive.According to official figures from the Department of Social and Family Affairs less than 15% of the county's 150,000 carers qualify for the carer's allowance. This is largely because the means test requirements are so severe that only those on the lowest of incomes qualify, a topic I will deal with in more detail later. These carers save the State the high costs that would arise if those being cared for had to seek residential care, but they get little or no recognition from the State. Among the submissions made to me as Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, there were over 18 written submissions and many oral submissions by the Carers Association, Carers Alliance and numerous other organisations. The one point on which they focused was the lack of State recognition for the work they do for their relatives.If there are 150,000 carers, it is safe to assume that there are close to 150,000 receiving care. Taking an average of just €500 per week — Dublin Deputies will laugh at that sum but let us take an average — for institutional care, the cost to the Exchequer of providing residential care for those currently being cared for at home would be close to €4 billion per annum. Very few nursing homes provide care at that price. That does not even consider the capital costs that would be required to provide places for 150,000 people. The Labour Party believes it is time to end the shameful neglect of the country's carers. We want to see a package of measures that will recognise and in some way, not even fully, reward the role played by carers.When I launched the report, on which there was unanimous agreement within the all-party Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, I stated on the committee's behalf: "The timescale of implementation is as important to us as is the content of our recommendations and we do not want to see any dust gathering on what we have proposed here and about which there is no substantive disagreement or controversy." Deputy Ring will no doubt relay his views later.A year on, none of the committee's recommendations has been implemented. The only response from the outgoing Minister, Deputy Coughlan, was to claim that supporting carers was a priority of the Government, and then to do nothing of substance on the recommendations of the joint committee. The outgoing Minister, in a response to inquiries about the actions, if any, being taken on the committee's recommendations, replied to me in June 2004 with a classic, clichéd set of responses which were as disheartening as they were disappointing in tone and content. For example, on the recommendation of the joint committee that the means test for carers be abolished, the Minister responded that its abolition would cost in the region of €180 million per annum and that: "It is questionable whether it would be the best use of such resources in the light of other competing demands and the Department of Social and Family Affairs is aware that there are differing views on this issue."I would like to spend a little time analysing the former Minister's response on the issue and I hope the new Minister does not deliver this type of clichéd response on the issue of abolishing the means test. First, the Minister claims that it would cost €180 million per annum, a very small figure if all those receiving care were to go into institutional care at a cost of €4 billion per annum. It is small beer but absolutely vital to the people providing care. She did not indicate whether this was a gross or a net figure. Is it net of the substantial savings that would accrue if the machinery of means testing were abolished? Means testing is extremely expensive to carry out, particularly in Ireland where there are different forms of such testing, and it uses up large resources in terms of people and time.There are 21,000 carers who qualify for payment — some of them do not qualify in full — and they receive a paltry €139. Is the new Minister aware that, from the date they apply, it takes 15 weeks for them to discover if they qualify? That is an absolute scandal. It is not good enough and he would want to shake matters up. If the means test were abolished, that nonsense would come to an end.Let us assume the bald figure of €180 million to which the former Minister referred is a net figure and let us put it in an appropriate context. Figures provided by the Central Statistics Office in its Census 2002 publication, volume 10, on disability and carers reveal that the total unpaid care given by all carers in the State is almost 2,962,102 hours per week. If these voluntary carers were paid for their unpaid time at a rate of €1.17 per hour — one fifth of the minimum wage — the aggregate cost would be approximately €180 million per annum. These carers do not get paid for this time they spend looking after their relatives or friends. However, if the State were to abolish means testing at an aggregate cost of €180 million, it would still equate to slave wages for carers' unpaid hours.The former Minister stated "it is questionable whether it would be the best use of such resources in the light of other competing demands". What are these demands and what is more important than looking after people who care for others 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year? The former Minister claimed that "supporting carers in our society has been a priority of the Government since 1997". Is it a priority of the Government? Is it necessary for one to cite a litany of alternative expenditures by this right wing Government which have been criticised by friend and foe alike as utterly wasteful? One need look no further than earlier today when a proposal to amend certain regulations will result in an increase in the amount of money available to the horse and greyhound industries to a phenomenal sum in excess of €500 million.The former Minister, Deputy Coughlan, stated the "Department of Social and Family Affairs is aware there are differing views on this issue". Who, apart from people in her Department or the mandarins in the Department of Finance, provided those views? Did they come from the former Minister herself? The all-party committee I have the honour of chairing was unanimous in its support of the abolition of means testing. The new Minister should ask the Carers Association, Care Alliance, the various health boards and the many individuals interested in this issue such as the two women from Kildare and south Kerry who contacted me recently about where the committee stands. He should forget about the different views. There is one unanimous view that people should be given some recognition.Most of the submissions to the joint committee called for the abolition of means testing. The Mercer Report on the Financing of Long-Term Care commissioned by the Department gives several cogent arguments against means testing and in favour of universality. I draw the attention of the House to the views of the joint committee on means testing. The committee pointed out that such testing is regarded by carers as degrading, stressful and extremely complicated. That was before it took 16 or 17 weeks for applicants to receive word on whether they qualified for payment. If any Member has doubts about this, I urge him or her to examine the basic application procedures they would have to fulfil if they suddenly found themselves in the position of caring for a relative or friend. If Deputies did so, they would support the motion tabled by the Labour Party. They would vote with their feet tomorrow night. The new Minister, Deputy Brennan, has an opportunity to put a stamp on his new Department by accepting the thrust of the motion in conjunction with the heads of the carers Bill we are proud to table.I have questioned and criticised the outgoing Minister for Social and Family Affairs for her failure to take any substantive action to progress the implementation of the joint committee's report. I regret having had to do so and I wish her well in her new portfolio. I am familiar with the area of agriculture, having spent eight or nine years as my party's spokesperson on it. However, what I find really dispiriting in terms of obtaining a more just deal for full-time carers is that we previously had a Minister who would not do the job and we are now faced with one who does not appear to want the job. Despite my reservations, I call on Deputy Brennan to surprise us all, particularly the Taoiseach who, in the Minister's own words, "shafted" him, by fighting at Cabinet with the same intensity he showed in fighting to retain a ministerial position. I admire the Minister's guts and I find an echo of his behaviour in myself. I would fight to the bitter end for something in which I believed. In the area from which I come, we fight for what we believe in. The Minister must fight for resources for carers and for other seriously disadvantaged groups.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I want to see if "Inchydoney Man", that almost mythical, caring Fianna Fáil individual invented by the party's spin doctors, has any basis in reality or if he or she has melted away like the proverbial snow off the ditch. Deputy McCreevy is gone to pastures new. I knew him well. He was also shafted by the Taoiseach and the Government spin doctors persuaded him that he was being promoted. I also want to see if McCreevyism is dead or if it still resides in Tullamore. Most of all, however, I want to see the full-time carers who made strenuous and very moving submissions to the joint committee getting fair treatment. I promised them that and I like to honour a promise. No more will these people's needs be put on the back burner. As far as I and my Labour Party colleagues are concerned, they will now be to the fore.The joint committee, in addition to making a recommendation on the abolition of means testing, also recommended that caring resources should be shifted towards home care and a home based subvention system should be established; that a consistent and comprehensive system of needs assessment be established — I will provide the Minister with a copy of the Bill my party has drafted to ensure that this happens; and that the one size fits all inflexible approach to disability support, about which Deputy Finian McGrath has often spoken, be abandoned and a flexible approach to administration of the regulations be adopted.I would have far preferred to be addressing the needs of carers tonight by way of a Private Members' Bill, rather than simply a Private Members' motion. However, under Standing Orders, an Opposition Deputy is prohibited from tabling a Bill that would involve a charge on the Exchequer. It is impossible to address the needs of carers without spending additional money. However, the Labour Party has done its work and has produced a draft carers Bill 2004, which I will forward to the Minister. I would also be glad to make it available to any Member of the House.I will briefly outline the contents of the draft Bill. Section 1 provides for a right of carers to an assessment of needs. It states that a health board shall carry out such an assessment at the request of a carer providing care for a person to whom the board may provide health or personal social services. The assessment will relate to the carer's ability to provide and to continue to provide care for the person cared for. In addition, a board will be obliged to carry out such an assessment, if so requested, in conjunction with an assessment carried out under any other enactment, such as the Disability Bill when enacted, of the needs of a person for health board services. The Bill obviously will not apply to services provided by a carer under contract or by volunteer members of a voluntary organisation.Section 2 provides that, after carrying out an assessment of the needs of a carer, the health board must consider the assessment and decide whether the carer has needs in respect of the care which he or she provides or intends to provide; if so, whether those needs could be satisfied wholly or partly by services which the board may provide; and if they could be so satisfied, whether to provide services to the carer.Section 5 abolishes the means test for payment of carer's allowance and section 6 amends the Health Act 1970 by substituting a new section for section 61 which deals with the home help service. This service is currently provided on a discretionary rather than a mandatory basis. That is in contrast, for example, with the home nursing service. The new section 6 substitutes the word "shall" for "may", thus making provision of the service mandatory. It requires that the service be provided free of charge to those with full eligibility under the Health Acts.I sincerely urge the incoming Minister for Social and Family Affairs to progress these issues in a serious manner. However, I also urge him to shake up his Department and ensure he is not fed with tired clichés but rather that he will be presented with a little more innovation in the handling of important issues. Ministerial responses hiding behind clichés such as "any plans to change this situation would have to considered in a budgetary context" are no longer acceptable. I publicly challenge the Minister to come up with more innovative responses than those to which I have referred, which could be pre-programmed into any word processor.I ask Members to offer new hope to full-time carers, to their families and to the disabled people they look after. We can set new standards and new directions in this area if we have the collective will to do so. We can start by voting in favour of the motion.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I thank our spokesperson, Deputy Penrose, for bringing the issue of the neglect of carers to the attention of the House and to that of the Government and the Minister, who appear to have forgotten about such people. This motion presents the Government with an opportunity to demonstrate that the new caring image unveiled by Fianna Fáil at Inchydoney is a reality and not just an image.On my behalf and on behalf of my colleagues, I thank the thousands of carers in the State who selflessly dedicate their lives to caring for loved ones who otherwise would have no option but to move into full-time institutional care. This commitment by carers is total and requires their dedication seven days per week in every week of the year. Carers are tired listening to Ministers thanking them for their wonderful service while refusing to assist them financially with the burdens they carry.Accepting the motion would give the Government a chance to change its ways. We are now a rich country with the Government awash with the public's money. It is estimated that to remove the means test for the carer's allowance would cost approximately €180 per year, which represents peanuts in the present day context. Such a minimal commitment would greatly enhance the possibility of old and disabled citizens remaining in dignity in their own homes and would also lighten the load carried by their carers. We can easily afford the cost. As Deputy Penrose mentioned, the House today passed a motion relating to regulations to dedicate €550 million to greyhounds and racehorses. It is a matter of priorities and the "caring" Government gives a higher priority to racehorses and greyhounds than to carers and those for whom they care.If the elderly and disabled are to be enabled to continue to live in dignity in their homes and communities it is essential that basic and essential services are provided for them at home. An excellent system of advice and grants existed until recently to address these needs. The disabled person's grant provided up to 90% of the cost of providing ground-floor toilets and showers, mechanical stair lifts, wheelchair access, heating, special bedrooms etc. These grants, which were administered by the local authorities, were widely used to very good effect. They allowed the elderly and disabled to continue to use their own homes and gave them a dignity and independence that was their due.However, these grants have now effectively been cancelled. In County Kildare the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government provided funding of €1.05 million for 2004. However, a further €4 million was required to clear the backlog of grant payments. Kildare County Council had no option but to stop accepting applications and to slow down processing the backlog. Those who are aware of the bureaucratic system will know how this is done. For example, it now takes ten months to get an examination by an occupational therapist in County Kildare, and we have no shortage of occupational therapists. The elderly and disabled, and their carers in County Kildare, as elsewhere, must try to manage without the most basic facilities, toilets and showers. Many will not be able to remain at home and will be forced into institutional care at huge cost to the State and to the old and disabled who will be forced out of their homes with all that means.I call on the Minister to provide the funding to clear the backlog for disabled person's grants and to allow them to restart with new cases immediately. I also urge the Minister to place these grants for aiding the disabled on a statutory basis so that they cannot be withdrawn at the whim of a county manager or a Minister. The disabled person's grant did a good job, gave value for money, enhanced the life of the elderly and disabled and must be restored forthwith. If this is a caring Government it will be done, but we will see.I return to the main theme of the motion, which is that means testing for the carer's allowance should be removed. Deputy Penrose has put the case more eloquently than I ever could. If Labour is in Government after the next general election, as is our intention, we will remove the means test from carers. This is how we will show our gratitude to the tens of thousands of carers.

The carers of Ireland are truly the forgotten people of the Celtic tiger. Seán Lemass said that a rising tide lifts all boats. I assure his successors in Fianna Fáil that the Celtic tiger tide has done nothing to improve the lot of carers in Irish society.The most up-to-date statistics we have on the number and position of carers are contained in the 2002 census. Whereas I do not wish to get bogged down in figures, the census allows us for the first time to move from hearsay to facts and figures about carers and those they look after, and is therefore worth some consideration. The question asked in the census regarding carers was as follows: "Do you provide unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long-term illness, health problem or disability, including old-age?" A total of 148,754 people answered "Yes". All those answering "Yes" to this question were classified as carers.Of all carers, about 66,000, or 44%, live in rural Ireland and about 56% live in urban areas. Carers as a percentage of the entire Irish population amount to 4.8%. Nearly two thirds of carers are married, 61% of carers are women and the majority of carers are between 35 and 55 years of age. However, to get a real picture of the lives of carers, it is important to look at the statistic on the amount of time respondents stated they spend providing unpaid care to a relative or friend.Of the 148,000 carers, 57% work unpaid for between one and 14 hours per week, 10% work unpaid for between 15 and 28 hours per week, 5% work unpaid for between 29 and 42 hours per week and 27% work unpaid for 43 or more hours per week. A quarter of all carers are working for 43 hours per week or more with no adequate recompense from the State. The amount which carers are saving the State annually by providing this level of care must be astronomical. If the individuals being cared for in the home had to be cared for in nursing homes, hospitals or other facilities, it would require billions of euro to care for them.Another interesting and alarming statistic emerged from the census. Some 11,744 carers are aged between 15 and 24. Many of these carers are in secondary school or in third level education and may have to spend hours caring for a loved one when they come home from school or college. However, of these 11,000 carers aged between 15 and 24, just 261 of them received the carer's allowance in 2003. Just 2% of these teenagers and young adults got financial aid from the State last year to help them to look after their loved ones. How can Irish society and the Government justify providing no financial support to thousands of teenagers and young adults in these circumstances?The vast majority of the State's carers get little or nothing in return from the State. Let us consider the paltry amount of expenditure on support for carers annually. According to its own statistics bulletin, the Department of Social and Family Affairs spent €183 million on the carer's allowance in 2003 and almost €7 million on carer's benefit, a total of €190 million on financial support for carers. This represents a drop in the ocean compared with the likely cost of transferring the care for the people being cared for over to the State.In 2003, 21,316 people were in receipt of carer's allowance. This represents just 14% of all carers identified in the 2002 census. In other words, the so-called caring Government gave financial support to just 14% of carers in 2003. Just over 1,000 people in County Kerry received carer's allowance last year. Dozens of carers who have been in touch with me in recent months are under severe financial pressure in caring for their loved ones. In many cases, their income exceeds by a small amount the income threshold to qualify for the allowance. I appeal to the Minister to bring an end to such cases by abolishing the means test for carer's allowance. Carers do a job — they may not see it as a job, but as a duty of care — that someone else would be doing if they were not in a position to do it. We should acknowledge that carers want their work to be recognised. We should support them in the tremendous, unselfish, loving and dedicated work they do.When Fianna Fáil Deputies met for a think-in at Inchydoney recently, I am sure they heard Fr. Seán Healy urging that carers be given a greater level of support. I do not doubt that most of them nodded in agreement with Fr. Healy. Did some of them nod in agreement with Deputy McCreevy, however, when he said that Fr. Healy was "spouting rubbish"?

I call on all Fianna Fáil Deputies, especially those who are members of the committee, to support the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Penrose, tomorrow night. Given that they supported the report's recommendations, I cannot see how they can vote against this motion tomorrow night.

The small attendance in the Gallery does not mean that this is not a burning issue, but is a reflection of the fact that those who work as carers find it extremely difficult to get any free time to themselves.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	311	It is as simple as that. Those who encounter such difficulties — those who care for children and young adults with disabilities — are keen that their voices should be heard. They want to be able to come out in force to show the Government of the day, regardless of its composition, that this issue needs to be addressed. Politicians are sometimes not concerned by issues which affect small numbers of people, but they are genuine issues.I should have started my contribution by congratulating the Minister, Deputy Brennan, on his appointment. I did not have the opportunity to do so last week — I think we were both busy. The Minister has an opportunity to do something about the problems faced by carers. When one is in such a position, one should take one's opportunity. If one examines the history of politics in Ireland, one will find that the grand events are not those most remembered. Those who are remembered are those who introduced particular services and facilitated people to live their lives in a better and more comfortable way. I refer to people like Noel Browne, services like free travel and events such as the divorce referendum. Such people and such policies stick out in people's minds. The Minister can help carers to have a life, to enjoy some free time and to have some type of personal space.Some striking figures are relevant to this motion. Some €190 million has been spent on carers, but €500 million has been spent on greyhounds and horses. One has to wonder where the Government's priorities lie. It is clear that it does not prioritise investment in people. A survey asked elderly people if they would prefer to spend the final years of their lives in a secure and nursing home where they can be happy that everything is done for them or in their own communities. Approximately 97% of those who responded said they would prefer to stay in their own communities, as long as they were given the necessary supports, such as the assistance of carers. It is not as if an impoverished country is being asked to provide massive amounts of money. As one of the wealthiest countries in Europe, Ireland can afford to make the necessary changes and should do so.I heard many arguments over many years against giving equal pay to women. It was argued that employers could not afford it and IBEC was said to be outraged by the possibility, but it has become a reality. We can afford it. While women may not be at the exact same level as men, it is no longer argued that employers cannot afford it. Not only can the Government afford to pay carers and to abolish the means test for carer's allowance, it must do it. We cannot afford not to do so.I wish to discuss the simple case of a carer whom I met. Given that we represent people at all levels, I am sure the Minister and other Deputies have encountered similar cases. I refer to the case of a woman aged 83 who was caring on her own for her 85 year old husband. She did not receive any help from the State as the health board did not want to know. Her daughters did what they could but were working at that time. She cared for her husband until he was institutionalised after he broke his hip when he fell out of bed. He died a year later. We cannot afford to let such things happen again. Carers are a vital part of what makes this country a community. The means test has to be abolished to allow such people to care for others with dignity.The mother of a friend of mine developed Alzheimer's disease when my friend was between the ages of 15 and 24. My friend did her best to care for her mother until she had to go into full-time care. Her mother died shortly afterwards, when my friend was about 28. My friend always said she felt cheated that she felt under tremendous pressure during the last few years of her mother's life. She told me that the pressure related as much to finances as it did to having to care for her mother. One will hear such stories over and over again.I am convinced the Labour Party has a different attitude to this issue, as it has to other social issues. Perhaps the Minister will surprise us all by demonstrating a different attitude towards carers. It may be that we are all misjudging him. Maybe the changes he will introduce to make people's lives more liveable will be remembered as part of the history of Irish politics.

I assure Deputies that I have listened carefully to and taken note of the arguments and points made this evening.I would like to make some personal remarks before I deal with the motion before the House. I wish to outline my approach and philosophy to delivering a welfare and social services support system that will reach out to include all who need and deserve our assistance. Most of us — I suppose, all in this House — are fortunate enough to have reaped the benefits of living in an Ireland that has witnessed great surges in economic growth in recent years. That economic performance has allowed us to tackle many of the social and economic issues that in the past scarred this country's reputation as a place of care and refuge. As I have regularly stated in many places, we must keep up that sturdy economic growth by encouraging expansion in business and companies and greater competitiveness. As we have seen in recent days, all the predictions in the newspapers are for continued growth. Some Deputies opposite spoke of Ireland as having been a rich country, but the economy will continue to grow very impressively for some years.That is, of course, good news. However, its true benefits will be seen only if the fruits of that economic growth percolate through to benefit all and not just the few. As I have said many times, our economic progress is not intended to make millionaires of the few while many others face a daily struggle. We can be proud on all sides of this House that we have contributed to making this a booming economy and a vibrant modern country, but we would be prouder if it reached out and lifted up those who, for whatever reason, have been left behind and feel most vulnerable. One Deputy opposite spoke of Seán Lemass's famous assertion about the benefits of a growing economy when he said that a rising tide lifts all boats. In today's Ireland, the economic tide is rising ever higher each year.However, in the great swell of profits, new opportunities and high expectations, the tide has not lifted all who need our help. That is why, as Minister for Social and Family Affairs, I am determined to work with all sides of the House to tackle the areas where people have been left behind. Resources will be targeted on helping those most in need and most deserving. I think of the thousands of carers throughout the country who selflessly sacrifice so much of their lives to look after loved ones, the older people who were central to the building of the new Ireland and the Celtic tiger, those on whose shoulders we now stand who want to spend the twilight years in security and comfort and the widows and widowers who have had to face many difficulties.I did not need to go to Inchydoney to know that my political philosophy was clear in my head. I believed in the political party in which I grew up, and I still do. It was a Fianna Fáil Party that believed in economic progress, but not for its own sake. It fought for the reunification of the country, believed in social justice and took a certain pride in our culture and heritage. That is the political party in which I grew up and spent much of my youth and all my adult life. I say those things to show that there is no conflict between my economic views and my social responsibilities.My late father was a tradesman who ran a small business. He taught me that growing the economy was for everyone's benefit. I always believed that doing so, bringing in companies, making them profitable so that they paid tax and creating full employment were not just for the sake of one or two shareholders or to create a few millionaires. I have fought all my political life to sustain that economic progress so that we could do something with it for people such as my mother, who lives on her own, and God knows how many others like her around the country. That is the purpose of economic growth and that is the philosophy that I grew up with, which probably prevented me from departing to other political parties when the opportunity presented itself.I wanted to make those personal comments tonight to indicate that I will do my best as Minister for Social and Family Affairs to bring whatever skills I have, good or bad, to bear on trying to make a difference to the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people around the country who depend on our social affairs system. I pledge to the House tonight that I will do my best in that context. This is not some Pauline conversion and is not due to some visit to Inchydoney. I have always believed in a growing economy to produce the surpluses that allow us to meet our social obligations. That has always been my belief, and I have been on record in many places over the years as having said that clearly. I am saying nothing new this evening since I have made these comments, to my own party and publicly, many times.Now I will deal with the motion. The increase in the number of older people as a proportion of the population presents challenges and opportunities to Irish society. As we age, we aspire to live at home in dignity in our own community. The same aspiration applies to people with disabilities. Our challenge is to provide services for older people and those with disabilities when and where those services are needed and to tailor them to the individual's need.The Government has been committed to supporting carers and care in the community for many years, and my predecessors have been involved in that. My colleagues in opposition have called on the Government to recognise the value of carers' contribution to society. The Government's recognition of the value of carers' work is evident in several facts. Expenditure on carers' payments increased by 310%, from €46.36 million in 1997 to €190.2 million at the end of last year. The number of carers receiving carer's allowance is up by almost 142% since the Government took office in 1997 and now stands at 22,300. The carer's allowance has been increased by €68.28, or 76%, for those over 66 and by €50.08, or 56%, for those under 66 over the last seven budgets.The Government's commitment to carers is real, and Members may want to consider the following specific measures and innovations which it has implemented in recent years. In April this year, the weekly income disregard increased to €250 for a single carer and €500 for a couple. That increase ensures that a couple with two children, earning a joint income of up to €29,328, qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance, while the same couple, if they have an income of €46,384, can still qualify for the minimum carer's allowance, free schemes and the respite care grant. The annual respite care grant, which was introduced in 1999, increased to €835 from June this year. The amount has increased by a massive 229% over five successive budgets. In addition, those caring for more than one person receive a double respite care grant of €1,670 in recognition of the difficulties they face. That represents an increase of over 550% on what the same carers would have received five years ago.The carer's benefit and carer's leave schemes were introduced in the 2002 budget. Those arrangements provide financial support and allow carers to avail of job-protected leave of absence for a period of up to 15 months. The net result of those measures is that over 55% of the 40,500 carers estimated by the CSO to be caring for more than six hours per day are in receipt of a specific carer's payment from my Department.The Government will deliver much more for carers. The care agenda is a very important aspect of social policy, with major financial and other implications, and I am determined, together with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, to move this agenda on by developing a realistic and achievable framework for the future of long-term care.International studies suggest that healthy life expectancy, that is, the number of years of life that will be free of chronic illness or disability, is increasing. Furthermore, improvements in technology will enable older people and those with disabilities to live independently for longer. Traditionally, older people and those with disabilities have been cared for informally in the home, mainly by women. Increasing participation of women in the labour force will lead to a decline in the number of women available to provide care. In addition, the decline in family size means that there are fewer offspring to provide care.A range of studies indicates that older people would prefer to receive care in their own homes and communities. The challenge is to put in place a benefit and financing system which meets people's needs and is sustainable. In order to address some of these issues, during the summer my predecessor in the Department circulated a consultation document to examine the future financing of long-term care in Ireland. This document aims to focus interested parties on the complex issues which must be addressed in the policy development process. They include benefit design, delivery and cost and financing, which are discussed at length in the report. The document has been circulated to over 70 interested parties including Oireachtas committees, Departments, health boards, the social partners and interest groups representing carers, older people and people with disabilities. My officials are currently compiling the feedback from the consultation process and this will be the starting point for the working group promised in Sustaining Progress. I intend to establish this working group before the end of this year. Parallel with this consultation, the ESRI is carrying out a telephone survey on behalf of my Department in order to explore public attitudes and views on issues related to provision and funding of long-term care of the elderly.With regard to the report of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, The Position of Full-Time Carers, I congratulate the committee on this insight into the needs of carers which it obtained from talking to a range of interested parties. I was interested to read in the committee's report that the greatest need identified by family carers is a break from caring, for home respite and respite for the dependent person. I have already spoken of the respite care grant paid by my Department to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and carer's benefit. I will consider the further improvements in this grant scheme recommended by the joint committee.I also noted that one of the recommendations of the joint committee relating to my Department pertains to improvements in the information available to carers. In this regard, funding of €18,000 has been provided to the Carers Association towards the publication and distribution of a new information pack which will provide information about services and supports for carers and their families. My officials are carrying out a review of the carer's allowance and carer's benefit schemes within the Department. It will consider many of the issues and recommendations raised by the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs in its report, The Position of Full-Time Carers. The review is nearing completion and its recommendations will be considered in the context of the budget.Government policy is strongly in favour of supporting care in the community and enabling people to remain in their own homes for as long as possible. The development of the supports available to carers will continue to be a priority for this Government, and, building on the foundations now in place, we will continue to develop the types of services which recognise the value of the caring ethos and which provide real support and practical assistance to people who devote their time to improving the quality of life for others. I thank Deputy Penrose and his Labour Party colleagues for giving me the opportunity to make these remarks, both official and personal.

I was proud to be with him in Tallaght last Monday when he saw the fruits of his work regarding the Luas line from Tallaght. It was a proud day for him.Some of the Opposition have been mischievous today, but we are all deeply heartened by what we have heard from the Minister. He has clearly put it on the record that with regard to his new brief he will do his best to make a difference. That is what we all strive to do. There is a responsibility on all of us to work with the Minister in that regard and I look forward to doing so. I am proud to be a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs under the able chairmanship of Deputy Penrose, whose work I warmly compliment. I am also the secretary of the Fianna Fáil policy group on social and family affairs. Sometimes it is very difficult to rise above the taunts that arise. I hope this will not be one of those nights.Fianna Fáil backbenchers do their job to their best of their ability. For the next 1,000 days before the general election I intend to bring to the attention of the House the issues of concern to me, as I have been doing since I arrived in the Dáil. I said that to Deputy Penrose today, and when I listened to his speech I sensed the emotion in it. I will not be so emotional, but I share many of his views, as does the Minister.In a world where everyone is competing for resources we must make the case for carers, and I am happy to do so. I recall that when my father was dying, for quite some time, I noticed not only the caring work of my sister but that of many other carers. As public representatives we have a responsibility to take note of carers' concerns. Over the next few weeks, there will be much toing and froing about the budget. Already we are receiving many different submissions. Points will be made about housing, health and education. Deputy Durkan can remind me of many schools in Tallaght, including Kingswood, where repairs are needed. Social welfare however is very important. The previous Minister pointed out on many occasions that she was responsible for making social welfare payments to more than 970,000 people. We must understand the need to continue to make a priority case for such payments.Regarding the needs of carers, we must support the statements made. Deputy Penrose referred to the work of the joint committee. Deputy Carty, myself and other colleagues have on many occasions brought to the attention of that body the different views and concerns we have. Whatever about the politics of the day, other parties may be in Government in 20 years' time, and meanwhile we must simply get on with the job. The Minister has tonight thrown down the gauntlet to those who would say he is not committed to the portfolio he has been given. I appeal to colleagues to give the Minister the space he needs to read into his brief. His speech tonight demonstrates that he will bring to this job all the skills and talents he has evidenced in a long period of public life. Our responsibility and job on all sides of the House is to do our best, and I will not shirk from it.

It is not easy to deal with heckling when one has only five minutes. If I ever need the assistance of the Ceann Comhairle in that regard, I will ask for it.Whatever about the politics of the matter, I hope we understand how important is the role played by carers in our society. We should understand the need to support them at every level, and I hope we will continue to do that.
#JohnCartyFF	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-party	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCartyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I too wish the Minister well, and I welcome him to his new portfolio. I know he will play an important part in looking after the interests of people on social welfare in a caring way.Parents play a major role in the care of the elderly, often getting very little thanks for their efforts. The carer's allowance was first introduced in 1990. There have since been vast increases in payments, while other benefits have also been extended in order to improve the lot of the carer. In extending those benefits, the Government has also improved the lot of those being cared for.Most old people prefer their own homes in their old age, rather than having to go into residential care. Nursing homes provide a good service and play an essential role in care for the elderly. However, for a great number of elderly people, home care is best, and home is where they are most contented. Many improvements could be made in this area over time.The report, The Position of Full-Time Carers, which I was happy to hear the Minister has already read, contains many good recommendations. This report was the work of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs. I am delighted the Chairman of the committee, Deputy Penrose, and five of its members are present in the House. The committee met the representatives of many bodies covering the entire structure of caring. They are reasonable people who do not want much. However, certain demands ran through their submissions such as recognition for their work, abolishment of the means test for carer's allowance, increased resources for home care and, where persons who provide care are recipients of widow's or widower's pensions, that 50% of the carer's allowance should also be paid. These are but some of the recommendations I bring to the Minister's attention. Carers should have recognition for their work and receive adequate training, on a national basis, to help them deal with those they care for. They should have all the back-up services they need and information packs on those services should be sent to each carer.On the abolishment of the means test for carer's allowance, provision has been made in successive budgets for a substantial increase in the disregards. From April 2004 the weekly income disregard was increased to €250 for a single carer and €500 for a couple. The effect of this increase ensures that a couple with two children earning a joint income of up to €29,328 can qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance. A similar couple with an income of €46,384 can still qualify for the minimum allowance, the free schemes and the respite care grant.The means test applied to the carer's allowance is one of the most flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household income. If abolished, it would cost €180 million per annum, a costing which is currently being reviewed in light of new CSO and departmental data. If the Minister continues this progress regarding the means test in the forthcoming budget, it would greatly alleviate the situation. I am sure he will take this into consideration and raise the thresholds.I feel strongly that resources should be made available for home care and a home based subvention should be established. The outgoing Minister stated this was the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. The Minister should liaise with that Department, which is encouraging health boards to introduce personal care packages for older people as an alternative to long-stay residential care. Personal care packages are specifically designed for the individual concerned and could include the provision of a home help service, a home care grant payment, attendance at a day care centre and other services. These packages allow older people and their carers the option to live in their own homes rather than entering long-stay care.The Department of Social and Family Affairs, together with the Department of Health and Children, should monitor the progress of these projects and should discuss the role the carer's allowance and benefit schemes might have in this context. The amount of money spent on subvention by health boards is extremely high. If the two Departments got together and produced a package whereby a subvention would be made available to home carers, a substantial saving could be made and a better service provided for the elderly.I wish the Minister well and hope he takes on board the points made. I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion put down by the Labour Party. I hope it will emerge in the course of the debate that the Government has done more for carers since 1997 than any other Government.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	322	When the carer's allowance was introduced in November 1990, it was welcomed across the board. The weekly payment at that time was £45 and was not intended as a payment for the work done by carers but an acknowledgement of their tremendous contribution. That acknowledgement had not been made previously, certainly not in a financial sense. However, as carers tried to apply for the scheme, much criticism was expressed that it was very restrictive. It was difficult to qualify and few benefited in 1990. All Ministers since then have acknowledged the benefit of the scheme and efforts have been made to expand it. It has been made more flexible in successive budgets, the payment has increased and more people now qualify than ever before.The record on this is clear. In 1991 the scheme was extended to cover persons in receipt of disabled person's maintenance allowance. In June 1995 the payment increased to £62.50, in 1996 to £67.50, in June 1999 to £81.50, in January 2002 to €137.80 and the present rate is €157.80. The scheme has expanded and more people benefit as a result. However, the amount paid bears no resemblance to the contribution carers make. It is not a perfect scheme. It is important the Government continues to expand it and to provide a higher level of payment to carers. It is only natural that people want to be looked after in their own homes and vital that the Government makes every effort to make that possible. People feel better in their own surroundings and the cost to the Exchequer is minimal in comparison to the cost of treating people in hospitals or nursing homes.I listened to the Labour Party criticism of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001.

Stable staff in the horseracing industry tolerated conditions which workers in no other industry would have tolerated. As a result of the investment made in recent years and the appointment of a representative of the stable staff to the new racing authority, we have witnessed a marked improvement in the conditions stable staff now enjoy.Much needs to be done but progress has been made. It is cynical for the Labour Party to target this industry as if we were feeding the horses special nuts and that this is where the money was going. The industry is the biggest employer in Kildare and one of which we can be proud. It is important we acknowledge this and continue the investment. Members treat the horse and greyhound racing industry as an easy target. However, the improvements at horse and greyhound racing tracks were badly needed. Increased numbers of spectators now attend race meetings which have become great social occasions.I congratulate the Labour Party on tabling the motion. I would like the scheme to be expanded and, as the budget approaches, the Government will give serious consideration to this issue.

I congratulate, Deputy Penrose, Chairman of the Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, and its members. The committee spent many long days working over the summer but did not get much media coverage. Furthermore, it was the only committee that did not use consultants. We brought in the real professionals, the people who are affected. I thank every person, every agency and all the carers' organisations who came before the committee. We listened to them. If the then and current Minister had attended the committee, we would not be here tonight.I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Power. I am very annoyed with him but I will hold my temper because we are here to discuss carers, not the bloodstock industry.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Manchester United nearly collapsed. It does not pay a penny in taxation to the Exchequer here, but if the Government imposed a tax of 5% on Manchester United it would pay for all the carers in the country and they would not have to beg resources from the State. It would be a very simple way to obtain the money. Manchester United nearly collapsed and that man's business nearly collapsed because there is so much money going out of the bloodstock industry. Manchester United does not pay a penny in taxation to the Irish Exchequer. Who needs the money more, the bloodstock industry, the manager of Manchester United or carers? Carers need it. I thank them tonight for looking after their loved ones. I thank them for their effort, their interest and their work. When practising politicians see people, mostly women but many men also, coming in with signs of stress on their faces, they know those people are looking after a loved one, a mother, a father, a brother or a sister or somebody with a disability. When they walk into my constituency office, I know they are looking after somebody who is sick or old and I thank very much and tell them that they are doing it because the State has failed.I congratulate the Minister. He is a very reluctant Minister. He reminds me of the bride who did not want to get married. We know what happened to that bride — she got married but she left her husband. I hope the Minister will not leave the Cabinet. Last week the Taoiseach downgraded the Department of Social and Family Affairs. It is a very important Ministry but it was the last appointment to be filled and it is wrong that this should have happened. I wish the Minister well. It is important that he takes this job very seriously because it is vital that we look after the less well-off in society.Tonight we are discussing the issue of carers. Our committee made 15 recommendations, the most important of which relates to means testing. The cost involved would be approximately €180 million. That is only 1.6% of the overall budget for social welfare. In the budget in December the Minister should deal with that issue and give recognition to the men and women who are looking after their loved ones with no monetary help from the State. They should be rewarded. This is not about money, but recognition. That is what every single group that appeared before the committee said. It is not all about money; it is about recognising that carers are doing a job the State cannot do and making small recompense for doing that job. If the Minister does that in December it will be a start on the 15 recommendations made by the committee. I, Deputy Penrose and our Fianna Fáil colleagues worked hard. We listened to the groups who attended. It was heartbreaking to see elderly people coming in to tell us about their cases. It is time the Government listened and did something for them.Regarding the recent meeting in Cork, the way the Taoiseach and the Minister downgraded the Department of Social and Family Affairs is serious because it is an indication that nothing has changed and that the Government does not care much about the less well-off. When the December budget is published, we will see of what the new Minister is made. He must be as strong as he was last week and not do what the previous Minister, Deputy Coughlan, did when, for €55 million, she targeted the most vulnerable in society. He must stand up as he did last week and demand the resources for carers and the less well-off, the people who need them most. The Minister was right, as was his father, when they said we are not here to look after shareholders and that the rich will always get richer. The rich can look after themselves; the poor will always be with us and we must support them, help them and look after them. We must never forget about them regardless of how well the economy is doing.I am sick and tired of hearing about how wonderfully the economy is performing. If the economy is doing so well, why are so many people feeling under pressure? Why do 70,000 children go to school without breakfast every day? It is the result of the 16 savage cutbacks. What are we going to do for the 52,000 families on the housing waiting list? These cutbacks were implemented by the previous Minister. I hope the current Minister learned from that situation.We are here tonight to discuss carers who must be supported. They have made their recommendations. They have come here year after year and lobbied for the resources they need and now is the time to provide give them. Yesterday we listened to the Minister for Finance and Government spokesmen telling us about the record amount of money in this economy. If there is so much money in the economy, carers should be given the resources they need, including the home-based subvention and the travel allowances. The moment there was a downturn in the economy, the first thing to be cut was home help for the most vulnerable in society, the people who need it most.In the past few months the Western Health Board made a decision to cut back on transport to hospitals. People would need to be almost dead now before they will be brought to hospital. The Minister should talk to his colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and direct the health board to return to the old system of bringing the sick and the weak to hospital. People who cannot afford transport should be brought to hospital as happened under the old arrangement. Any spare resources within health should go towards funding home help and looking after those who are caring for people at home. That is a reasonable request. That is where the money should be targeted.Last year the Western Health Board had a large sum of money left over and spent it on seven full days of what it described as conferences but what I call junkets in Galway, Leenane and Connemara. It spent money that should have been spent on carers, the sick and the weak. The money could have been used to bring these people to hospitals. If there was anybody in control, this would not have been allowed to happen. I can stand over that account and it can be checked because it is on the record of the health board. That is the type of country we have. We cannot look after people who are sick and weak. People give up good jobs to go home and look after their parents and the payment they get, the carer's benefit, is just above unemployment assistance, which is only barely above the means upon which anybody could live. That is not right and the Minister will be judged in December. I thank those organisations representing carers and say well done and keep fighting. It is our duty to ensure they get the necessary resources. No one can deny the resources are there and we want them to be given to those carers looking after their loved ones at home.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	340	I thank Deputy Penrose for raising this issue in the House. As the able Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs, he has spent much time in bringing all representative groups concerned together to produce a report on the interests of carers. I welcome Deputy Brennan to the post of Minister for Social and Family Affairs. While it is a Ministry belittled by the media and others, it is a major one that looks after those most in need, from children to the elderly. I wish him well in his new post, not just for his own sake, but for those he serves.Deputy Ring pointed out that the carer's allowance pays a little above the ordinary social welfare allowances. It is mean in that sense. We can all point to how little was paid in 1997 or 1990. However, in 1997 a reasonable family home cost £70,000 while today it costs €300,000. Now both partners in a marriage must earn an income to meet mortgage repayments, the cost of their children's education and all other needs. It cannot be ignored that society has changed and there are fewer people at home to look after elderly parents.Carers need respite to get away for a few weeks. I know of an 88 year old widow, caring for her two adult handicapped sons, for whom the only available respite is by placing them in a home for psychiatric patients. This must be changed to ensure that those who care for 50 weeks of the year receive some break. Recently, I spoke to an individual, caring for a 31 year old son with cerebral palsy, who has never had a holiday in those 31 years. Today another individual approached me inquiring what help was available for the mother of a two and a half year old handicapped child who requires 24 hour care. Although the mother left her job when the child was born, she is not eligible for a carer's allowance, as her husband's income, while not high, is above the threshold. It has been argued that those who are financially secure do not need the carer's allowance. However, our contention is that the allowance is not an alternative to a secure and comfortable income but merely a small recognition of the contribution made. Carers need recognition of what they do as many must make large mortgage repayments.The Minister claims the Government is a caring one. What about support for widowers and widows who must care for their late spouses or their own parents? An individual receiving a widower's or widow's pension can still keep his or her contributory pension while holding down a full-time job. However, if he or she must stay at home to care for a loved one, there is no second pension entitlement. The Joint Committee on Social and Family Affairs suggested such individuals should receive a half pension as some recognition. In a reply from the former Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Coughlan informed me such a move would cost approximately €10 million. With all due respect, Punchestown Equestrian Centre cost €15 million and many other schemes cost more.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	342	This group of people have committed their lives to looking after the elderly and for doing so deserve some recognition. The argument that traditionally no one has ever received a second social welfare payment is always used. Yet, in the majority of cases the widow's or widower's pension is an entitlement paid for through contributions.On means testing, I make no apologies for representing the farming community on this issue. Many small farmers must look after elderly loved ones at home. However, if a small farmer works over ten hours on the farm, he is not entitled to a carer's allowance. When the introduction of the single payment was introduced, common sense prevailed but it has now gone out the window. If the Minister changes the carer's allowance system, he will be long remembered for it.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	343	I thank Deputy Penrose for initiating this debate. I also wish Deputies Brennan and Seán Power well in their recent appointments. The Department of Social and Family Affairs is important to many people, be they pensioners, unemployed, those with disabilities or carers.Those caring for the mentally ill are often ignored. While they may not have the same physical pressures as those caring for the elderly or those with a disability, they must bear immense psychological stress and pressure. Last year, 10,500 people presented at accident and emergency departments having attempted to take their lives. A fifth of that number, 2,100, had presented for the second time in the same year. Can one imagine the stress their carers are under and the lack of recognition and assistance they receive? Approximately 50,000 people have attempted to take their lives but did not present at accident and emergency. Several parents have contacted me as to how to deal with their young daughters who have overdosed on several occasions yet refuse to seek help. Those people, the majority of whom are parents of young people, are under extreme pressure. As no community-based psychiatric facilities are available, no assessments are available to them.While I agree it does not fall within the Minister's direct remit, I will give an example of such a case. I know of a young girl who in May 2000 suffered from depression, but recovered within two months and went on to third level studies. She relapsed into a deeper depression but she was able to resume her third-level studies in October. In May 2002, she became severely depressed and required ECT treatment but did not fully recover. Her parents referred her to St. Patrick's Hospital in Dublin on 13 September. On 18 September, the hospital informed her family she did not have adequate medical insurance. Her mother travelled to Dublin by train and brought her back to Limerick. She was extremely suicidal. She had attempted to take her own life the day after her 21st birthday on 5 August that same year. Her mother brought her to the Limerick Regional Hospital at midnight when they arrived home. Within 12 hours the mother was no longer a carer because the girl took her own life in a shower room in the hospital. I am trying to expose the stress affecting such families in that situation and which is not recognised.
#NedOKeeffe	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-party	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#NedOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	344	I thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, for allowing me raise the important issue of the difficulties arising in the pig industry. I welcome the Minister to the House. I am delighted that she is a Cabinet Minister who is prepared to face her responsibilities in the House. I wish to raise a matter of national importance, the closure of the pig slaughter line at the Galtee Foods Division of Dairygold Co-operative Society Limited in Mitchelstown, County Cork. Galtee Foods has a killing capacity of 10,000 pigs per week. The national kill of pigs is approximately 56,000 per week. The national breeding herd is 160,000 and 60% of the pigs slaughtered in Galtee Foods are produced locally. Its closure will create a national disaster for the industry, similar to what occurred in 1998 which did not affect the Cork area at that time. In 1998, when I was Minister of State, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan and her colleague, Deputy Keaveney, made many representations to me about the difficulties facing small pig producers in the Donegal area. The decision to close the kill line in one of Ireland's largest co-operatives, which is fully owned by farmers, will ensure the demise of many producers around the country and is a wild west decision taken in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland.I am annoyed at the failure of the Government as the regulatory authority to intervene in this decision. Substantial grant aid has been paid to Dairygold over the years, thus creating further wastage of taxpayers' money. I have requested the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate Enterprise Ireland and carry out a forensic audit of its food division. This organisation suffers from the corporate box syndrome for the big boys, especially the plcs, private limited companies, who like to import against Irish producers. The island of Ireland will have no pig industry five years from now if this decision is followed through.The sugar beet industry and the poultry industry are all heading in the same direction. The Minister has a tough task ahead of her. This organisation in Mitchelstown was the only processor in the country with a USDA licence for pigmeat. These processing industries are all peripheral farming activities giving large incomes to farmers and substantial jobs in rural areas across this island. These activities and developments were supported by the Fianna Fáil policy makers for decades. The plant was built in the 1960s with money given by a Fianna Fáil Government under the then Taoiseach, the late Jack Lynch. In the last few decades the ground has been allowed to shift from these commodities, which are being replaced by imports of an inferior nature. Ireland has the lowest priced pigs in Europe but inferior cuts are being imported. This is what is about to happen in the case of Galtee Foods and other plants, with the encouragement of Enterprise Ireland. I ask that the people in the food division of Enterprise Ireland be transferred to other activities and fresh ideas and imagination be recruited.Galtee Foods and Dairygold participated in a food fair abroad recently. The products they displayed were not of Irish origin. For example, Tipperary cheese is German-produced and I ask the Minister to investigate this further. It is claimed in theory that Ireland has a slaughter capacity of 58,000 pigs per week. However, a disaster occurred this week in Galway where Duffy's of Gort was destroyed by fire. It can be seen how marginal the slaughter capacity is at between 55,000 and 58,000. Taking holiday time and all the other down time of the daily work day into account, being practical and using common sense there is not sufficient capacity to slaughter the national kill. This argument was rehearsed many times in 1998 when pigs could not be killed and yet it was claimed the capacity was there. I was Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food at the time. As the Government of the day, we were seriously embarrassed when hundreds of small producers in the Border counties left the industry, having been forced out and totally disillusioned as they could not get their pigs slaughtered.I wish to thank the Taoiseach for meeting with a group in Clonakilty recently to discuss this matter. However, since this meeting no action has been taken. I again appeal to the Taoiseach and the Government not to allow farmers and workers in this region to be sold out.The Government is the regulatory authority of the food industry. The Minister has the power in her hands to regulate this industry. She controls the grants and pays the money to organisations. I ask her to withhold payments until this plant is put back in place. There is no financial need and no justification for its closure. The Department's officials will say that it will continue to process bacon and pigmeat but that is a nonsense. There is no guarantee they will be pigs of Irish origin.I will list the slaughter capacities for the Minister's information. Glanbia slaughters 24,000 pigs at peak; Queally's slaughters 9,000; Galtee Foods, 10,000, and they are on the way out. McCarron's slaughters 3,000; Dromone, 2,000; Ballon, 1,400; Drumlish, 2,200; Duffy's, 1,300; Green Pastures, 1,700; O'Connor's, 448; Cuniffe's, 150. Kyle's in Dublin is about to close and slaughters 300. That is a total of only 51,000 pigs. Some of our pigs are killed in Northern Ireland. We never talk in an all-Ireland context about anything except when it suits us and we are now talking in that context. Subtracting 10,000 pigs from 56,000 leaves 46,000 pigs.Many peripheral plants have no guarantee they will be operating tomorrow or the day after and they account for another 10,000 pigs. It is becoming a crisis. I ask the Minister to contact the chief executive of Dairygold as a matter of urgency. I ask her to get a commitment from him to reopen this plant, work in conjunction with producers and not to take decisions that are not in the best interest of the Irish industry. There is no justification, financial or otherwise, for this wild west decision. There will be more said about this matter in the House before 1 November. I await the Minister's reply.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	345	Ba mhaith liom, ar dtús báire, mo bhuíochas a ghabháil don Teachta as ucht ócáid a thabhairt dom cur in iúil don Dáil cad atá ag dul ar aghaidh. The decision by Dairygold Co-Operative Society Limited to close its pig slaughter line was a commercial one for the society, made in the wider context of Dairygold operations and in accordance with broader rationalisation objectives. I fully understand the huge level of disappointment for any employees and their families affected by this issue. I also understand and share the concerns of pig suppliers and producers to Galtee Foods who have traditionally supplied pigs to Galtee processing plants but are now faced with the prospect of finding alternative outlets for their animals.Since the announcement of the Galtee closure, my Department has maintained regular contact with IFA, Enterprise Ireland and other pig processors, with a view to ensuring that a seamless and streamlined transition of the producer-processing supply chain would be established. There is agreement among the main processing entities and by Enterprise Ireland that sufficient processing capacity is available in the country to absorb the surplus that will arise from this closure.I have been assured that the 9,000 or so pigs that were processed in Galtee on a weekly basis can be satisfactorily accommodated in other plants within the country. This means that there should be no disruption to processing nor to trade and that farmers will have a ready-made outlet to which pigs may be sold, resulting in different processing outlets but no restriction in processing options nor in marketing outlets. I am encouraged by the considerable efforts being made by Galtee, the IFA and other processors to ensure a smooth and orderly transition of the Galtee supply base. This is critical to the future profitability of the entire pig processing chain and will ensure that the transition is managed in the shortest possible timescale and with the best possible outcome for all concerned. It is also critical to the maintenance and continuity of supply to the retail sector and will demonstrate the capacity of the Irish pigmeat industry to respond effectively and constructively to a challenge such as this. I am encouraged that Galtee has indicated its intention to continue to process pigmeat in Mitchelstown, using the valuable Galtee brand name and utilising Irish raw materials.There is never a good moment to announce a restructuring that causes either market disruption or job losses. However, decisions that have broader strategic aims are often critical to maintaining and expanding markets and jobs in other areas. One of the strategic aspects of this closure concerns the national structure of pig processing in Ireland, which, according to the Prospectus study on the pig industry published in 2000, concluded that there was serious over-capacity in the pig slaughter sector and that this burden of capacity was causing inefficiencies.It recommended that rationalisation of existing slaughter capacity must be undertaken if primary processing in Ireland is to remain competitive. This would mean that excess capacity must be removed by plant closures with a commensurate increase in capacity utilisation of the remaining plants.One effect of the Galtee closure is that there should be greater utilisation of slaughter capacity elsewhere, as recommended by Prospectus, which, in turn, should provide a better platform for the Irish pigmeat industry to tackle competition head on from abroad. Anything short of best competitive structures to deal with competition on the home and export markets will deprive our primary production sector of viable and profitable outlets for its produce and reduce Ireland's capacity to maximise the production of top quality products at competitive prices. The decision has been taken for Galtee's own commercial reasons. At this juncture, it is in the interest of all concerned in the sector to ensure there is no resultant disruption in the slaughter of pigs as a whole and that the important producer-processor chain continues to be treated as a fundamental element in the future success of the industry.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I am glad of the opportunity to raise this matter. At the outset, I declare an interest in that my three daughters attended the Cork School of Music, and one still attends as a student. I suppose, therefore, I have a personal interest in the matter. I welcome the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin. I hope it is the start of good habits whereby Ministers answer matters raised. Too often we see Ministers with no relevance to the area in question coming in to give standard answers. I welcome what I hope is the start of a new practice.Before the general election in 2002, and long before that, we were promised by the then Minister for Education and Science a new Cork School of Music. Again in March of this year, that promise was repeated. It is no coincidence that it was just a matter of months before the local government and European Parliament elections. Three Ministers later, we are still waiting for the school. The recent disclosures regarding the future of Jarvis, the company involved in the public private partnership, are alarming. The announcement was made after a protracted five year battle by staff, local representatives and members of the public who correctly recognised the need for a new Cork School of Music. The project was to be the first purpose-built school of music in the country, to be operated by Jarvis Projects as a public private partnership for 25 years, and was similar to other projects undertaken between Jarvis and the Department involving five schools.Last week the Comptroller and Auditor General expressed reservations regarding difficulties with the public private partnership. I do not have the time to highlight the core issues of concern expressed by the Comptroller. Last July I understand the Cabinet was briefed about serious financial difficulties threatening the future of Jarvis. According to newspapers, Jarvis was in negotiations with its banks to reorganise its €287 million debt — Jarvis shares have fallen by 90% in the past 12 months.In the UK, I am told, Jarvis has £4 billion sterling worth of public private partnership contracts and is responsible for managing approximately 100 schools. Newspaper reports have warned that if Jarvis were in serious financial difficulties, it could leave the schools involved in considerable difficulty. Again, Jarvis has issued four profit warnings in recent months.The Comptroller and Auditor General has expressed concern at the manner in which the project has been managed to date. The decision by the Department to choose Jarvis as a preferred bidder before the affordability of the project had been established left the State open to claims for compensation if the project did not go ahead. Jarvis is due to build nine schools in Scotland but a number have fallen through and have cost Jarvis the contract worth almost €250 million.After all the uncertainty and the promises, I am simply looking for a clear-cut statement from the Minister on the situation. I hope she will clear up the uncertainty about the construction of the Cork School of Music. I was in the school with the Fine Gael Party leader, Deputy Kenny, and I was appalled by the substandard conditions. I hope the Minister will make a clear-cut statement about the situation. Cork will celebrate its role as European city of culture next year and at this stage our hopes of having the school built to mark the year of culture have evaporated.I am looking for a statement from the Minister on the current situation and a guarantee that if the arrangements with Jarvis fall through, this school will be built using Exchequer funding. The country is awash with money. The Government owes it to the people of Cork to fulfil promises made before general and Europe Parliament elections. If this school were located in Dublin, it would have been built long ago. I ask the Minister, on her first night as Minister answering an Adjournment debate, to give Cork the school for which it has waited so long. The students and staff deserve it.

This is an important issue. As Deputy Allen is aware, the Government decided last July that the Department of Education and Science should finalise contractual negotiations with Jarvis Projects Limited with a view to commencing construction of the new Cork School of Music public private partnership project. Around the time of the decision, it became apparent that there was some uncertainty about the company's financial position and the Government stipulated that before the contact could be signed, the Department must first be completely satisfied of Jarvis's legal and financial viability in being able to undertake and complete the contract. The Government required two specific measures to be undertaken by my Department before the contract could be entered into with Jarvis. The first measure is in regard to obtaining legal and financial advice on the viability of Jarvis and the second issue was to refer the draft contract terms in regard to debt repayment in the proposed contract to the National Development Finance Agency for consideration.The first issue is being examined by my Department's specialist advisers to the project. In addition, the Department's officials and its advisers are in regular contact with Jarvis and are monitoring closely the present financial issues surrounding the company. In regard to the debt repayment terms, my Department supplied all the relevant information available to date to the National Development Finance Agency and has been in close contact with the senior staff of the agency regarding the matter. Late last week the agency gave its initial advice and that is now being examined in the Department.Clearly, my Department cannot proceed to financial close unless there is a clear indication from Jarvis Projects that it has the necessary financial backing from its funders and that it is in a position to sign the contract. In this regard, I understand that the issues and discussions between Jarvis and its bank surrounding funding of the project are almost complete and that a decision is imminent. All indications are that the decision is likely to be positive.As Deputy Allen has suggested, I make it absolutely clear that the Government is committed to the Cork School of Music project. Once the appropriate financial backing for the project is secured by Jarvis and approved by my Department, our advisers will be instructed to expedite completion of the documents in conjunction with the National Development Finance Agency to allow the contract to be signed as soon as possible. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and I look forward to opening the new building.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	348	I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter and I thank the Minister for making herself available to make her first presentations to the House on two issues which affect my constituency. After her contribution, I think a decision on the first issue is less than certain. On the second issue, the PAGE project, I ask the Minister to reconsider how decisions are made in her Department and the effect of such decisionsThe project for adult guidance in education is Cork's response to a national development plan-funded initiative on foot of the White Paper on Education which outlined the need to provide guidance services for adults from disadvantaged communities, people who had undergone long periods of unemployment and people who were coming out of certain social situations, such as imprisonment, or had undergone traumatic incidents in their lives, such as the effects of residential abuse. Having first been funded in 2000 and since for a number of years by the Department, the project received a letter in December 2002 stating that further to the progress made by the project, the Department would fund it from 2003 onwards. Funding came through in 2003 and to date has also come through for 2004. Unfortunately, a letter was received by the project in December 2003 which asked for the project to be explained in terms of the original contract. Correspondence was immediately sent to the Department and no other contact was made with this project until August-September of this year when a cold letter was received by the project stating that monitoring had taken place and a decision had been made on foot of that. That is unacceptable in its own right in terms of ongoing planning, expectations and the quality of the service being provided, but it was even more unacceptable given that people recognised by the Department as being in need of such a service were availing of it and in view of the Department's lack of a discernible strategy as to how this service could be provided on an ongoing basis.No communication has been made regarding what monitoring took place and what the effect of it was. The people who came down to undertake the monitoring in the interim period had given every indication that they were satisfied with the work being done on the project. Prior to the allocation of funding for the period 2000-05, the Department's analysis was that progress had been made in the earlier life of the project. The Minister needs to ask why this cold decision was made in such a way as to pull the rug from under so many people — those availing of the service as well as those providing it. She also needs to address the question of how the service will be provided from now on. If the White Paper on Education means anything it must mean that guidance services are provided to improve education standards and educational attainment which the conventional education system is unable and sadly, in some cases, unwilling to provide. The success of the project for adult guidance in education in Cork is that it provided such an opportunity for many people. As an elected representative for the area, I would like to know what measures will be put in place to provide such an opportunity for many people whom I believe will not, otherwise, have such an opportunity.I accept the Minister is only a few days into her portfolio but I hope her background in the education system and her experience as an elected representative in the House and at various departmental levels will inform her that this is not the right way to make a decision, either in the short term or in the long term, for meeting the needs of those who are disadvantaged in society. I ask her to try to put this in the context of a strategy and a policy for adult guidance for disadvantaged people, which currently appears to exist on a wing and a prayer. It appears to be operating very much in the shadows and it needs to be given substance. When a system is up and running it is not acceptable for those who provide the system to get a slap in the face from the Department. I would like to see a better approach being taken. Reversing this decision would be a good way for the Minister to begin her Ministry.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	349	I thank Deputy Boyle for his good wishes and for raising this important issue. He will be aware that delegated responsibility for the area of adult education lies with my colleague, Deputy de Valera, although it is obviously one in which I also have an interest. Equally, Deputy Boyle will recognise the expansion of the adult educational guidance initiative service in the past three years where funding has increased from £150,000 in 1999 to €3.2 million in 2004 in recognition of the need that exists.The Department launched the AEGI in 1999 in response to recommendations in the Green Paper on adult education. The service offers information, advice and guidance on an individual and group basis to assist adult learners to connect with learning opportunities in the further education sector. Since June 2004, the initiative consists of 24 projects located throughout the country in urban and rural areas. The projects provide a high quality adult education guidance service to participants on the vocational training opportunities scheme and  literacy and adult community education programmes.Financial support for an adult education guidance project in Cork city was approved by my Department in 2000 on a pilot basis as part of phase 1 of the adult education guidance initiative to address the guidance needs in Cork city. A service agreement drawn up by my Department was signed by PAGE in January 2003. The project is community-based and operates as a limited company. Most of the AEGI projects operate through the local vocational education committees. The funding of each of the adult guidance projects is subject to ongoing satisfactory delivery and evaluation.As part of the ongoing evaluation of the service being provided, my Department became concerned during 2003 that an education guidance service was not being provided to the identified target groups in the Cork area. It was not the case, as Deputy Boyle alleged, that a cold decision was made. The Department decided to place the project on a six-month probationary period and it duly notified PAGE of the decision on 17 December 2003 and of the four conditions to be implemented with immediate effect. Following ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the service being provided to the designated target groups, my Department was not satisfied that the project was fulfilling the terms and conditions of the service agreement signed in January 2003. Accordingly, it was decided not to continue funding the pilot project in Cork city. However, I accept adult learners need the service of the adult education guidance service and the Department will be taking steps in the very near future to make sure that an adequate service will be made available to adult learners in the Cork area. I will keep in touch with the Deputy in that regard.

In the main, it is confined to those over 65 years to help them meet the cost of replacing doors and windows, install dry lining, heating and other small-scale but essential work in their homes.It is unfortunate this valuable scheme is chronically under-funded. Waiting lists are lengthy. In County Kerry the funding shortfall for housing aid for the elderly is so acute that waiting lists for applicants are extremely lengthy. The sole person dealing with applicants in Kerry is now only getting around to dealing with applications submitted in April of this year. This is due to the chronic lack of funding for the scheme from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.What is the point of assessing people's applications when there is no money to allocate to successful applicants? The budget allocated to the Southern Health Board for housing aid for the elderly in Kerry has run out for this year. Only a paltry €1 million was allocated to the Southern Health Board in 2004, an area comprising the counties of Cork and Kerry. Only 27%, or €270,000, of the total sum was allocated to County Kerry. Elderly people in County Kerry, many of them living alone and in poor health, must wait months before they are even assessed.I am currently dealing with an applicant in the west Kerry Gaeltacht who applied for housing aid for essential work on his rotten windows and doors in July 2004. However, I am advised by the health board that it will be 2005 before his situation is assessed, because the 2004 funding has been expended. This is not the fault of the individual dealing with assessments. The health board is only dealing with the first four months of this year, and if that continues, it could be 2005 before those who are applying this month for housing aid for the elderly are assessed. This is totally unacceptable.It is appalling that elderly people who cannot afford basic repair work on their homes are being treated in this way, particularly when we hear every day about all the money that is flowing into the Exchequer. The majority of these people have only one source of income, the old age pension, which is totally inadequate as a means for carrying out repairs in the home.The Government parties have spoken frequently about the need to allow elderly people to live at home with dignity in their later years. This was raised in the previous debate on carers. However, many of our elderly are living in old houses that are poorly heated, badly insulated and run down and for want of a few thousand euro cannot carry out essential repair work. There is also a security issue as often, doors and windows in these homes are inadequate and many people in rural Ireland are living in fear of attack.I have spoken previously in this House about the low level of funding for other schemes, in particular the essential repairs grant and the disabled persons' grant, both of which are administered by the local authorities and often work hand in hand with housing aid for the elderly in the Southern Health Board area. In County Kerry there is a major shortfall in funding for these schemes and in respect of the housing aid budget. This is making the lives of many elderly people a misery.I appeal to the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, and the new Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, to immediately contact the Southern Health Board to ensure there is sufficient funding. They should put the appropriate resources into these schemes to allow the elderly people who have applied for a few thousand euro to make their houses comfortable and safe. I presume the Minister of State would agree with his party's guest speaker in Inchydoney about the need to care for the vulnerable in society. The Government now has an opportunity to do so.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. It was also dealt with today under Question No. 443 in the name of her party colleague, Deputy Wall. I am pleased to have the opportunity to give her an update on the scheme. As the Deputy knows, the scheme was started in 1982 and is funded under the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government to undertake an emergency programme to improve the housing conditions of elderly persons living alone in unfit or unsanitary accommodation. In 2000 the scheme was extended to include the provision of suitable heating systems where found necessary to meet the needs of elderly persons. Since then the direction of the scheme has shifted very much from emergency work and much of its resources are now concentrated on larger projects.The community care departments of the health boards operate the scheme using various mechanisms to carry out the work, including contractors, FÁS and a grant-based approach whereby the applicant employs the contractor. The scheme has dealt with more than 56,000 cases since it started. Just under 2,000 jobs have been completed in the first six months of this year. There has been an unprecedented level of demand for the provision of heating systems since it was introduced in February 2000, with 3,954 applicants provided with such facilities to the end of 2003.The allocations to the boards are determined by a task force from the funding available and are based, not on the geographical spread of the population, but on the statistical returns received from the health boards showing the level of activity within the area. It is not based on population and, accordingly, some health boards do better than others. It is based on returns showing the numbers on the waiting lists, the number of applications on hands and the estimated cost of these applications. Boards, in turn, allocate the funding available to the county divisions within their areas. First round allocations were notified to the boards on 21 January 2004 and a second round allocation for 2004 will shortly be determined and notified to them by the task force, bringing the total to €11.6 million for the year. The original allocation was approximately €11 million, so the second is only €600,000, nationally.

The sum of €11.6 million is the overall figure. We paid out €11 million, so €600,000 is left and the source of funding is the national lottery. Funding levels for 2005 are being considered at present in the context of the Estimates. However, health boards are being requested, on the basis of funding being available next year, to arrange further jobs which will not arise for payment until January or later. They have the flexibility to carry out some work so long as the bills are not submitted until after Christmas.I thank the various groups involved — the task force, the health boards, FÁS and the voluntary bodies associated with the scheme — who have done much good over the years. As the Deputy mentioned the scheme now works hand in hand with the essential repairs grant and the disabled persons' grant. I do not have figures with me for County Kerry, but in the last three or four weeks the Department——

However, in recent weeks while there is a problem in giving extra funding for this scheme because of the sources of funds, approximately an extra €7 million has been offered to county councils under the disabled person's grant and the essential repairs grant schemes. It is up to the individual local authorities to determine the issues on which the money is spent.There is no Department rule which says doors or windows are excluded. That is a matter for the individual council to decide and prioritise. I am not sure whether County Kerry took up the extra money offered to it in recent times. However, extra money under the essential repairs grant and disabled person's grant schemes has been offered to the Deputy's local authority over the last four or five weeks. How it spends that and the flexibility it has will determine whether that money is spent on doors or windows, as it wishes.

The review is examining the progress being made in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for future action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary, for the remaining period up to 2008. The review will also examine the relevance of the strategy in tackling the current nature and extent of drug misuse in Ireland, including emerging trends, and will identify any gaps presenting and how they might be addressed.The review is being overseen by a steering group chaired by my Department and comprising representatives from a number of Departments and agencies involved in implementing the strategy as well as the community and voluntary sectors. PA Consulting Group is assisting the steering group in its ongoing work.A comprehensive consultation process is being undertaken as part of the review. One hundred and fourteen written submissions have been received to date and the consultants are currently considering the issues being raised. Presentations from over 20 Departments, agencies and community groups involved in delivering the strategy have also been made to the steering group and a number of others are planned for October. In addition, five regional seminars will take place throughout October in Galway, Limerick, Waterford, Carrick-on-Shannon and Dublin. A number of focus groups with young people will also be held during October.The consultation process will enable us to get a broad and varied perspective on the strategy and what its future direction should be. In this context, I would not like to pre-empt the outcome — or the independence — of the review given that considerable work and consultation remains to be done. I also believe it would be inappropriate for me at this time to comment on individual submissions, including the issues raised by Citywide. I can assure the Deputies, however, that Citywide's comments will be examined in terms of going forward, as will the views expressed by the other Departments and organisations who have made written submissions and met the steering group.With regard to funding, the Government has already committed substantial funding to the issue of drug misuse. To date, the Government has allocated or spent approximately €80 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in two rounds of plans of the local drugs task forces. In addition over €12.7 million has been allocated under the LDTF premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects, the majority of which are in LDTF areas. Approximately €75 million has been allocated to support in the region of 450 facility and services projects under the young people's facilities and services fund. I can assure the Deputies that tackling drug misuse remains a priority for the Government and that substantial resources will continue to be targeted at the problem over the coming years. I expect the review to be completed in late 2004 or early in 2005.

In that context, the following steps have been taken by my Department to advance the decentralisation process. A dedicated decentralisation unit was set up to manage the programme. The unit is staffed by a higher executive officer and a clerical officer who report to the personnel officer. This unit has prepared and distributed to staff an information pack which includes a wide range of information on decentralisation areas relating to my Department's remit. The unit issues regular bulletins to staff with the most up to date information available on decentralisation and all documentation relating to the issue is made available on the public folders of my Department's e-mail system. A departmental decentralisation committee has been established to steer the decentralisation process within the department. Membership of the committee is made up of senior management and staff. A liaison officer has been appointed to facilitate communication between the Department of Finance and my Department. Special meetings of my Department's partnership committee are held to specifically address issues arising from decentralisation and use is made of such meetings to ensure that staff are kept informed on all aspects of the decentralisation process. There is regular communication between my Department and staff associations through the departmental council process. In addition, work is in hand on the establishment of systems for job analysis and process mapping for each function within my Department to facilitate effective transfers of staff in the future.An initial decentralisation implementation plan for my Department has been prepared and submitted to the decentralisation implementation group.The September 2004 data obtained from the CAF system indicate that 159 civil servants and nine public servants have lodged applications for or expressed an interest in decentralisation to Knock Airport. The number of staff required by the Department for that location is 159.9. In addition, seven civil servants and five public servants have lodged applications for or expressed an interest in decentralisation to Na Forbacha. The number of staff required by the Department for that location is 12.5.

It was agreed at the first meeting of the forum that the members of it would submit proposals in advance of the next meeting in regard to matters that should be discussed in the context of any strategic plan for the Irish language and priority issues that need to be addressed in the short term. These matters will be addressed at future meetings of the forum.

My Department, in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Office of Public Works has played an active role in providing additional assistance to Mayo Council County to enable them to complete necessary infrastructural repairs in the area. A total of €148,115 has been sanctioned by my Department to date for repair works to the graveyard, walls and roads in the area.My Department is also represented on the Pollathomas implementation working group, which was set up in March 2004 and includes representatives of Mayo County Council, the Office of Public Works and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The objective was to bring together representatives of the main bodies involved in dealing with the after effects of the Pollathomas landslides with a view to bringing the outstanding issues to finality. I understand that the working group's report will be available in the near future.

Five of these contracts provide connecting road transport services on the mainland. I have arranged for a full list of these services to be forwarded to the Deputy.I have also made available funding of just over €14,000 to Erris rural link to extend the ferry service currently operating between Ballycroy and Inishbiggle. When this extended service comes into operation, Inishbiggle will have a five day a week return ferry service together with a bus link each day with one of the nearby population centres, those being Belmullet, Castlebar, Westport and Achill Sound. In addition to these services, my officials are currently evaluating applications for a new ferry service to Inis Fraoich in County Donegal and for an increased level of ferry service to Inishbofin off the County Galway coast.In regard to the provision of airstrips on the islands, I hope to be in a position shortly to approve funding for the construction of an airstrip on Inishbofin with a view to commencing air services to the island in 2006. Planning permission for a mainland airstrip at Cleggan, County Galway to serve Inishbofin has also been obtained, as has planning permission for an airstrip on Tory Island.

This is an integral element of my Department's strategic objective of assisting communities, especially those suffering disadvantage and social exclusion.In September 2003 I approved a grant of €105,000 per annum over three years to Business in the Community Ireland, which is a leading organisation in Ireland promoting CSR activity. The grant will assist the organisation in helping the community and voluntary sector enhance its capacity to engage with the corporate sector. The funding will help create an important conduit in facilitating skills transfer from businesses to the community and voluntary sector.My Department is also working in close co-operation with the chambers of commerce to promote corporate social responsibility. My Department will sponsor the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland annual president's awards in early November with a grant of €20,000. The awards will be dedicated to honouring CSR initiatives and will recognise companies which have invested in the CSR area under the headings of community; workplace; marketplace and environment.

In September 2003, I announced some €7.3 million in funding to 56 organisations in the community and voluntary sector over a three year period under schemes to support the role of federations, networks and umbrella bodies and to provide training and supports to the sector. Funding of €1.43 million per annum is being channelled to the anti-poverty networks. Funding of some €1.28 million per annum is being provided for the continuing development of the highly successful community and voluntary fora, established as an important element of the local government reform process.In addition, a consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities was posted on my Department's website on 17 December last. In early February, I formally launched a public consultation and a notice, inviting submissions, was placed in the national papers. The public consultation will inform the development of the forthcoming legislation in this area. This week I was pleased to publish the external report on the public consultation.Deputies will also be aware that an implementation and advisory group, IAG, comprising representatives from the voluntary and statutory sectors, was established to monitor and advise on the implementation of the White Paper. Substantive matters considered to date by the IAG include: the multiplicity of funding sources through which the sector must operate; the designation of voluntary activity units in relevant Departments; accreditation of training in the sector; support for volunteering and the establishment of good practice standards in both the community and voluntary sector and the statutory sector. The White Paper indicated that a review of the IAG should take place after a three year period. Work on this review, which I expect to be concluded shortly, is continuing in my Department.

The functions of the commission are to promote, foster and encourage economic and social development in the western region, defined as the seven western counties of Donegal, Leitrim, Sligo, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare. Its activities involve policy analysis and development, undertaking key regional initiatives and management of the western investment fund.Currently the WDC is involved in a range of projects, one of which is promotion the west region. Under its strategic goal of attracting the inward transfer of skilled jobs and people to the western region, the WDC is currently planning to deepen awareness and a positive perception of the western region as a high quality place to live, work and do business. It is intended to achieve this through the creation of an effective promotional programme for the region which will incorporate the development of a campaign aimed at attracting skilled jobs and people to the region. It will also involve the creation of a website, in partnership with the local authorities, to facilitate access to practical information of relevance to persons relocating to the western region.Another project in which the commission is involved is Knock International Airport. The WDC is currently assisting the airport with its strategy for: its advancement as an international access port and regional development hub; in reviewing the economic impact of the airport on the region; in examining relevant policy issues; and in formulating a strategy for attracting public and private funding for the airport.The commission is also involved in projects in rural development in regard to the community ownership of wind farms. The WDC, in partnership with Brí Nua Community Wind Energy Group Donegal and Mayo Community Wind Energy Group, researched the potential for communities in the region to benefit from the establishment of wind farms. The resulting study, To Catch the Wind, a practical guide and accompanying CD-Rom was published in June 2004. The WDC will continue to work in partnership with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to promote the policy recommendations made in the guide. The WDC plans to explore and facilitate the establishment of a renewable energy advisory group in partnership with key stakeholders and assist in initiating a pilot community owned wind farm project in the region.In regard to organic agri-food, the western organic strategic initiative, WOSI, a private sector-led partnership facilitated by the WDC, is registering as a limited company which will market organics agri-food as a quality banded product. The WDC will continue to raise issues relating to organic agri-food production to inform national organic policy. The WDC is bringing the WOSI model to national discussion as a model for best practice and is recommending its replication in other areas of the country.In regard to economic infrastructure in terms of roads, the WDC is involved in the ongoing monitoring of roads investment in the region. In regard to rail, the WDC continues to work with Iarnród Éireann and the Department of Transport to progress the improvement of rail services in the western region and is participating on the western rail corridor expert working group.In the area of telecommunications, through its involvement in the Information Society Commission, the WDC continues to pursue the issue of broadband services in rural areas. With regard to rural tourism, ongoing support is being provided to the western development tourism programme and the green box projects.The western investment fund, WIF, was established under the Western Development Commission Act 1998. The Western Development Commission, WDC, is the statutory body charged with promoting, fostering and encouraging economic and social development in the western region comprising counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare. As part of this remit the WDC operates western investment fund of €32 million. To date, 60 projects have been approved for assistance totalling €12.7 million. Of this, €9.8 million has been disbursed from the fund to aid 50 of these projects. This has created 791 jobs to date, 541 of which are either strategic or in small to medium-sized enterprises and 250 are in community projects.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	366	I propose to take Questions Nos. 154 and 235 together.As the Deputies are aware, the Dormant Accounts (Amendment) Bill 2004 was published in June 2004, fulfilling a commitment given by Government in December last, following its review of arrangements in regard to dormant accounts funding. At that time, the Government committed itself to maintaining an open, transparent and accountable process for dealing with applications for dormant accounts funding. These commitments have been honoured in the Bill in the following ways: the objectives of the disbursements scheme will remain unchanged; actual disbursements will continue to be within the framework of objectives and priorities set out in the dormant accounts disbursements plan; application processes for dormant accounts funding will be transparent and publicised; decisions on disbursements will be made and publicised by Government; appropriate arrangements will be put in place so that the spend from the dormant accounts fund is clearly separate and additional; and the future role of the board will focus on preparation of the disbursements plan, reviewing progress in achieving objectives and assessing the additionality and impact of spend.As outlined and reiterated during the Second Stage debate in the Seanad, there are compelling reasons, in terms of governance and public policy, as to why this legislation is necessary. First, governance arrangements are less than adequate and there is an absence of a properly developed organisation structure. The scale of funds is such that it is not appropriate to require a part-time chairperson to assume responsibilities for such a large potential spend. It is also evident that the existing arrangements do not adequately support the focusing of spending from the fund with policy priorities debated in this House and approved by Government. If we are serious about tackling disadvantage, we must ensure that available resources are targeted in a particularly focused and sustained manner. It is for these reasons that the Government decided, in the first place, to review the arrangements regarding dormant accounts and, subsequently, agreed to bring forward the draft legislation now before the Oireachtas. It is my intention that the Bill will continue its passage through the Oireachtas and be enacted in due course.With regard to the board's annual report, I am appreciative of the work the board has carried out to date, as documented in the report, and I look forward to continuing to work closely with the board in the future.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	367	The question of provision of funding for specific administrative costs for individual public bodies — regardless of whether these relate to the Official Languages Act or any other service delivery or policy obligation arising — falls to be assessed against formal business cases or proposals submitted as part of the normal annual Estimate and budget cycle and not otherwise. Given its position as the first constitutional language, my object is to ensure that delivery of public services by public bodies, including provision of information about services and activities through the Irish language, is seen as normal and meets the required minimum standards of customer service and corporate governance, rather than an optional extra or add-on.In regard to the Deputy's specific question, I make the point that the obligations that currently stand commenced under the Official Languages Act in relation to publication of documents in both official languages and are those under section 10 of the Act only. Section 10 provides for the simultaneous publication in both official languages of what is in fact a very limited number of key documents such as annual reports, annual financial statements/accounts and documents setting out public policy proposals — examples of this last category would include Green Papers and White Papers published by Departments.These are all key documents by which public bodies account to the general public, to their specific customers and to us as Members of the Oireachtas in regard to how they have in the previous year or how they propose in future to discharge their public functions. There are two official languages spoken in this State and it seems to me — as it did to all parties in this House when we debated this Act as a Bill — right and proper that documents of this nature should be available to the citizen in both languages. I make the point that when we debated the Bill in the House I was requested, but declined, to accept amendments that would have widened quite considerably the range of documents subject to the automatic simultaneous publication obligation.I also make the point that my Department currently ensures and for many years prior to this has ensured the publication in both languages of a much wider range of publications than those covered by section 10 and it does so from within the normal administrative budget voted to it by the Dáil from year to year.

A sum of €55,234 was subsequently paid in 1999-2000. It has since transpired that the company's location and operations were in fact marginally outside the official Gaeltacht boundary.I have been assured by Údarás that, following a review of processes on foot of queries from the Comptroller and Auditor General, appropriate steps have been taken to prevent a recurrence of anomalies such as this. I have also been informed by Údarás that, following an internal review, which took into account the fact that the applicant did not seek to deliberately mislead the organisation and that the project succeeded in creating employment in the area, a decision has been taken not to recall the grant.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I propose to take Questions Nos. 162 and 238 together.Under Partnership 2000 the Government committed itself to identifying 30 priority areas for inclusion in the community development programme. Some 15 of these priority areas were funded in 2003. A further 15 pre-development projects have been approved, in principle, for inclusion in the community development programme. A total of €500,000 has been set aside to fund these projects later in 2004.The Government recognises that local and community development measures are contributing significantly to tackling a range of challenges at local and community level. However, the number and complexity of structures involved in the delivery of these programmes is extensive and complex. With this in mind, a review of the structures employed in the delivery of local and community development programmes has been undertaken. Arising from the review of local and community development structures, the Government has decided that public bodies and Departments should look to existing structures for delivery of new local or community development initiatives. In this regard, the Government also decided that any further community development projects established will be on the basis of maximising recourse to existing structures.Of the 15 pre-development projects included in the programme, 12 have submitted work plans. The Department is currently working with these projects to determine how they can be brought on stream in 2004 in a way which maximises recourse to existing structures.With regard to the funding provided for the administration of the programme, some €20.6 million was allocated to the community development programme in 2004. The amount to be allocated to the programme in 2005 will be determined in the context of the 2005 Estimates.

This was just a one-sentence comment to highlight a point.The media chose to highlight the comment as the main news item of my speech, something that surprised me as I felt that I had made a number of very important points to the audience that I thought were much more central to the issue of the day.

This phase included 17 Leader groups, and following this launch, I can confirm that all 35 spatial Leader groups along with Údarás na Gaeltachta are now implementing the rural social scheme.To date the total number of applications reported to my Department is 997 and 565 of these have been approved by the implementing bodies. This figure is likely to grow significantly before the end of the year.At present there are 285 participants, including supervisors, working on the scheme in counties Cork, Kerry, Leitrim and Roscommon and in the Gaeltacht areas in Cork, Galway, Kerry, Mayo and Donegal. A further three Leader groups have indicated to us that they will be ready to commence participants on the scheme during October, resulting in an additional 250 persons starting on the scheme.

Similar committees were established in relation to the environment, equal opportunities and social inclusion.The mid-term evaluation of the national development plan and the operational programmes highlighted significant issues in seeking to integrate these horizontal principles into the operation of the measures in the programmes. Among the issues cited were: problems of understanding of the overall goals of the principle and how they could be integrated into programme implementation; absence of indicators or other data to capture progress in terms of the principles; and guidance or support to implementing bodies.The review had been carried out by the NDP evaluation unit of the Department of Finance. As a result, new arrangements have been adopted which, it is intended, will make the application of the horizontal principles more effective. Against the background of the review, the Rural Development Co-ordination Committee did not meet in 2004.In terms of looking ahead, in future the Rural Development Co-ordinating Committee will focus on a limited number of measures in the operational programmes, that is, those most relevant to rural development. Following from this, officials of my Department have consulted the managers of the measures. Such consultations have explored how the rural development principle can be better embedded in the measure and considered performance indicators to capture progress in rural development terms. In addition, a reporting template has been provided to the measure managers to facilitate annual reporting by them and easier analysis of progress by the co-ordinating committee.As a consequence of these developments, my Department has also reviewed the composition of the co-ordinating committee and its terms of reference. It is awaiting the receipt of nominations from the various constituents, that is, managing authorities, implementing Departments, the social partners, the evaluation unit and the European Commission. Subject to such input, the first meeting of the reconstituted committee will be held on 11 October next and will meet twice yearly thereafter.

In addition, the LDTFs provide a mechanism for the co-ordination of services in their areas, while at the same time allowing local communities and voluntary organisations to participate in the planning, design and delivery of those services. Demographic changes which may be occurring in local communities are monitored by the task forces on an ongoing basis and can be reflected in the way they implement their action plans.In this context, it is also worth noting that the national drugs strategy is currently being reviewed. The objectives of the mid-term review is to examine the progress being made to date in achieving the goals and actions set out in the strategy and to enable priorities for future action to be identified and a refocusing of the strategy, if necessary, for the remaining period up to 2008. As part of the review, a widespread consultation process is currently under way. The question of drug misuse among non-nationals will also be considered as part of the review.

The Western Development Commission, WDC, is the statutory body charged with promoting, fostering and encouraging economic and social development in the western region comprising counties Donegal, Sligo, Leitrim, Mayo, Roscommon, Galway and Clare. As part of this remit the WDC operates the western investment fund of €32 million.The WIF was established by the Government to fill the equity gap that existed in the western region whereby businesses, communities and other projects had little or no access to private sector risk capital funding mechanisms. A key objective of the WIF is therefore to address this market failure. Another goal is to create a venture capital culture in the region and to demonstrate the potential investment opportunity that exists. This equity gap continues to exist in the western region, with only 6% of the funds invested by the members of the Irish Venture Capital Association, IVCA, going to the western region in 2001. The overall level of venture capital funding fell in 2002 by 40% on the 2000 spend.The WIF provides funding by way of ordinary share capital, preference share capital and loan stock or combinations thereof. The WIF does not provide grant aid. The WIF will contribute to the strategic development of the area through investments in growth-oriented small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, at the start-up-development stage, community owned enterprises and flagship projects.To date, 60 projects have been approved for assistance totalling €12.7 million. Of this €9.8 million has been disbursed from the fund to aid 50 of these projects. This has created 791 jobs to date, 541 of which are either strategic or in small to medium-sized enterprises and 250 are in community projects.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I propose to take Questions Nos. 174, 225 and 229 together.The report by the Health Research Board to which the Deputies refer — Trends in Treated Problem Opiate Use in the Seven Health Board areas outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority, 1998 to 2002 — was launched in early September. The report shows that the numbers in treatment for heroin use outside the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA, have increased significantly in that four year period. As the Deputies may be aware, this is in line with one of the key commitments in the National Drugs Strategy 2001 — 2008, which is to increase the number of treatment places available for drug misusers.While in percentage terms the increase in the numbers in treatment in the regions is considerable, it is important to bear in mind that the vast bulk of methadone treatment continues to take place in the ERHA area. In this regard, the Department of Health and Children, which has overall responsibility for addiction services, reports that at the end of August 2004 there were 7,190 people receiving methadone treatment, of which 95% was in the ERHA area. This overall figure compares with a figure of 5,032 in December 2000 — an increase of over 40%. In addition, it is worth noting that there are 59 drug treatment locations in the eastern region, an increase of 47 locations since 1996, while outside the ERHA, seven treatment clinics have been established.To date, the treatment services in the regions are undergoing a similar pattern to that observed in the ERHA area when treatment availability was expanded, that is, that existing drug users are much more likely to come forward and present for treatment as it becomes more available, accessible and attractive. Accordingly, as the services have expanded so have the numbers in treatment, which is a positive development as it indicates that services are meeting an existing demand.The Deputies should also note that all health boards are working towards increased involvement of general practitioners and pharmacists with the methadone protocol. In July 2001, there were 168 GPs and 233 pharmacists involved in the scheme in comparison with 219 GPs and 317 pharmacists involved at the end of August 2004.In relation to the trends in opiate misuse in the seven health board areas, in particular in counties Carlow, Cavan, Louth, Meath and Westmeath, I assure the Deputies that I will continue to monitor the situation. The programme for Government calls for monitoring the use of heroin, in particular outside of Dublin, and in this regard, the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, is in the process of setting up an early warning system to address this issue.The Deputies should also note that the best estimates on opiate use were released by the NACD last year and research found that there were approximately 2,200 heroin users outside Dublin, although a number of these would be in Wicklow and Kildare which is part of the ERHA region.The Deputies should note that the regional drugs task forces, which were set up to develop appropriate policies to deal with drug misuse in the regions, are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas as well as the range and level of existing services with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. Where opiate use is a problem in particular areas, I would expect that this will be reflected in their action plans coming forward. I look forward to receiving their plans over the coming months.

In the first instance there are many small-scale proposals from RAPID plans that can be dealt with more effectively at local level. To facilitate this, I have introduced a new delivery mechanism, supported by a dedicated fund of €4.5 million in 2004, to progress these proposals. These proposals will be co-funded by the relevant department or local agency under a number of categories, with broad levels of funding agreed at national level.A total of €2 million is being provided for the local authority housing estate enhancement scheme. This scheme is being operated by the local authorities and is being funded on a euro for euro basis, €1 million from my Department and €1 million from the local authorities, through the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. A total allocation of €60,000 has been made to each RAPID area in strand one and each strand two area has been allocated €40,000.Funding of €3 million is being provided for the current year to support the development of playgrounds in RAPID areas, €1.5 million from my Department and €1.5 million from the Department of Health and Children. The total allocation for each RAPID area in strand one is €72,000 with strand two RAPID areas receiving an allocation of €60,000. For both of these schemes, the local authority in consultation with the relevant area implementation team, AIT, have selected the locations for the proposed works.Some €2.2 million top-up funding has been allocated to 73 projects in RAPID areas that were successful under the sports capital programme 2004. All successful projects endorsed by the AIT were considered for top-up funding, with up to 30% additional funding being provided by my Department subject to the total grant not exceeding 80% of project cost or the amount requested by the applicant. I am considering additional measures in consultation with my ministerial colleagues to expand the system of co-funded projects.As regards the larger projects from RAPID plans that have already been submitted to Departments, these will continue to be considered for funding within existing funding streams in each Department. However, I expect that Departments will now be dealing with a smaller number of projects and will therefore be in a better position to prioritise projects and set out timescales for further actions. Work on improving integration and co-ordination of service delivery at local level will continue, as this is a key component of the RAPID programme.There are no plans to establish new RAPID areas. However, Deputies may be aware that Ballyfermot met the criteria for inclusion in the RAPID programme but was omitted from strand one owing to its inclusion in the URBAN II programme. I am examining this apparent anomaly at present.

However, recognising that the drug problem is not confined to LDTF areas, funding was also allocated to four other urban areas — Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow.Approximately €75 million has been allocated to support over 450 facility and services projects in LDTF areas and the four other urban centres under the YPFSF. This includes an amount of more than €13 million, which I allocated in March and August 2004 under round two of the fund to support over 100 services and facility projects targeting young people at risk of drug misuse. Many of the projects for which funding has been allocated to date are also located in RAPID areas. There are no plans at present to extend the YPFSF beyond the areas outlined above.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I propose to take Questions Nos. 186, 194, 198, 218 and 228 together.I refer the Deputies to earlier questions on this matter, in particular to my reply to Question No. 151 and related questions on 4 February 2004, Questions Nos. 100 and 102 on 9 March 2004 and Question No. 127 on 27 April 2004.In implementing the Government decision detailed in those replies, local and community development groups were invited to make proposals for improved alignment of structures in their respective areas. City and county development boards, CDBs, were asked to co-ordinate this process. As indicated in the earlier replies, funding had been earmarked — €3.09 million — to support specific co-ordinated measures arising from this process.Proposals have been received from all CDBs and have been assessed by an external consultant engaged by my Department. As a result of this process, I have approved proposals from Fingal CDB for funding. These proposals were very focused on improving current arrangements with regard to resources, staffing and geographic coverage. There were many other good ideas put forward by the other CDBs. However, they were asked to take a more focused look at their proposals and to resubmit these by 1 October. I intend to have these proposals assessed very quickly with early decisions on funding support. I hope to be able to build on the ideas put forward as part of this process with a view to concluding the review of local and community development structures in the first half of 2005.As well as co-ordinating this process, the role of CDBs in the endorsing of plans prepared by local and community development groups continues. With their close links to the local authority structure, the CDBs can strengthen the democratic accountability of the service delivery agencies and bodies, as well as promoting an integrated approach to service provision at local and community level.As I indicated last April, the first step in the process of restructuring ADM was the nomination of new board members by Government. In the interim the Government nominees have been appointed to the board. My Department will work closely with ADM to develop the changes to the memorandum and articles of association of ADM necessary for the implementation of the Government decision with regard to restructuring the company.In addition, I have made some changes to the community development programme. This programme supports locally-based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities so that they can have a role in decisions which affect them, contribute to a process of change in their areas and improve their quality of life. To this end, financial assistance is provided to projects towards the staffing and equipping of local resource centres which provide a focal point for community development activities in the area and to other specialised projects and initiatives.A total of €20,604,000 has been allocated to the programme for 2004. There are 190 projects included in the programme, of which 175 are in receipt of funding, including five projects in offshore islands. A further 15 pre-development projects have been approved, in principle, for inclusion in the community development programme. A total of €500,000 has been set aside to fund these projects later this year. Arising from the review of local and community development structures, the Government has decided that public bodies and Departments should look to existing structures for delivery of new local or community development initiatives. In this regard, the Government also decided that any further community development projects established will be on the basis of maximising recourse to existing structures. Of the 15 pre-development projects included in the programme, 14 have submitted work plans. My Department is meeting with those groups to determine how their projects can be brought on stream in 2004, in a way which maximises recourse to existing structures.In line with the Government decision arising from the review of local and community development structures, the process of significantly reducing the funding available for intermediaries such as regional support agencies has continued. This serves to maximise the resources available to directly benefit communities. The number of such agencies with which my Department has a contract under the programme has been reduced from 13 to six. The six successful tenders commenced their contracts from 1 July 2004.

However, I expect the programme to include a progress report on current rural development policy issues, implementation of the rural social scheme and the recent draft EU rural development regulation. In view of the pace of change — both at national and EU level — in rural development policy, the agenda is likely to reflect such change and the implications for re-evaluation, as necessary, of current policies.

The €300,000 campaign is being managed on behalf of my Department by Údarás na Gaeltachta. The promotion is aimed at increasing awareness amongst parents of children between the ages of 0 and 5 — and expectant parents — of the advantages of choosing Irish as the main language of the household. The campaign primarily consists of a television and radio advertising campaign, the provision of a website  www.teangafein.ie which offers advice and information, as well as an information booklet and poster which will be distributed in the Gaeltacht. While this initiative has been devised to specifically target households in Gaeltacht areas, it will also be of benefit in encouraging the usage of the language on a national basis.My Department has for long recognised that its transmission from one generation to the next is critical for the survival of the Irish language as the predominant household and community language in the Gaeltacht. It is for this reason that the Department operates a number of schemes and initiatives aimed at the maintenance and strengthening of the language in the Gaeltacht. These include scéim labhairt na Gaeilge, which targets families with school going children in Gaeltacht areas. To further develop its scope and effectiveness, a review of the scheme by my Department is now nearing completion with a view to launching a revised scheme formally in the near future.Funding was recently sanctioned by me to facilitate the piloting of a home visitors initiative by Oidhreacht Chorca Dhuibhne, which will involve the provision of support information and advice on a one-to-one basis to families with young children who reside within the operational area of the organisation.Other measures and initiatives which will help to further develop the necessary support framework for Gaeltacht parents wishing to pass the language to their children include a language planning initiative aimed at further enabling community-based Gaeltacht organisations in developing and implementing measures aimed at strengthening the language at local level; the provision of an additional sum of €1 million in the current year to further enable Údarás na Gaeltachta in the development of pre-school education facilities and youth services; and the implementation of changes to scéim na gcampaí samhraidh trí Ghaeilge do aos óg na Gaeltachta for the purpose of improving the number, nature and effectiveness of recognised Gaeltacht summer camps.The successful outcome of all of these measures is largely dependent on the commitment of Gaeltacht communities and families themselves in ensuring that Irish is transmitted not only as a vibrant and viable language but also as a most important natural resource to the next generation.

There is €9.8 million available to the region under this measure. As measure leader, my Department is a member of the programme steering committee which selects projects and is also responsible for the monitoring and control of the Irish element of projects in measure 1.2.To date, there are nine approved projects under the measure with a grant value of €3.4 million. A further round of applications to the value of €2.85 million will be examined and selected in November. Spend under the measure to date is in excess of €1.3 million.

This officer attends all of the meetings of Comhairle na Tuaithe and of the three working groups set up within this body.These working groups which have met on several occasions are working on the examination of the issues surrounding access to the countryside; the development of a countryside code; and the development of a countryside recreation strategy Comhairle na Tuaithe is now preparing for a national seminar to be held in November to promote and develop its work and to identify key mechanisms and processes to achieving progress. Based on the advice of Comhairle na Tuaithe and wider developments, I will pursue with relevant colleagues in Government any action which may be necessary.

The sub-group's report was received by officials in my Department within the last week and the recommendations contained in it are being examined at present. Following consideration of the report, I hope to be in a position to allocate funding to implement the recommendations in the coming weeks.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	399	As the Deputy may be aware, in May last, the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, produced a report entitled Review of Harm Reduction Approaches to Minimising the Sharing of Equipment Used to Administer Drugs. The report was commissioned in response to action 100 of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 which called for research to be conducted into the effectiveness of new mechanisms to minimise the sharing of equipment, for example, non-reusable syringes and mobile syringe exchange facilities within particular cohorts of the drug using population, that is, among younger drug misusers, within prisons etc.Arising from the report, the NACD recommended that service provision for drug users in prison should mirror the range of treatment and harm reduction approaches which are available in the community. In this regard, the Government has been developing drugs services in prison, including methadone maintenance, over recent years. However, full implementation of this recommendation, in particular in relation to needle exchange, obviously poses serious issues within a prison environment and will have to be very carefully examined. Policy regarding drug misuse in prisons is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.With regard to supervised drug consumption rooms, the NACD report found that the evidence on their effectiveness is inconclusive. This is in line with the conclusions of the National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008, although the strategy did call for this issue to be kept under review and for the results of research, both national and international, to be monitored. The NACD report also acknowledges the view of the INCB, International Narcotics Control Board, that drug consumption rooms violate the provisions of the international drug control conventions to which Ireland is a party. Therefore, the position of the Government has not changed and, accordingly, there are no plans to introduce such facilities.The introduction of consumption rooms would require changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act, responsibility for which lies with my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	400	I propose to take Questions Nos. 199 and 201 together.The National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008 provides for the establishment of ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs, throughout the country. Currently, the RDTFs are mapping out the patterns of drug misuse in their areas — as well as the range and level of existing services — with a view to better co-ordination and addressing gaps in the overall provision. In this context, the Deputies should note that an amount of €500,000 has been provided by my Department, in the current year, for administrative and technical assistance costs incurred by the RDTFs in the preparation of their plans.The work being undertaken by the RDTFs will, when complete, feed into the drafting of regional action plans, which will be assessed by the national drugs strategy team in due course. Where heroin misuse is a problem in particular regions, this can be reflected in the action plans being developed. I am hopeful that all of this work can be completed by early 2005 and that I will then be in a position to bring recommendations in relation to the funding of the plans to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion.The Estimates process for 2005 is currently ongoing and the Deputies will appreciate that the allocations for my Department for next year have not yet been finalised. However, it is my intention that significant resources will be targeted at tackling drug misuse throughout the country and I would expect the RDTFs to be in a position to begin the implementation of their plans by mid to late 2005.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I assure the Deputy that the Government continues to take the issue of drug misuse seriously and will continue to push forward with the implementation of the National Drugs Strategy 2001- 2008.In this regard, one of the principle aims of the strategy is to encourage drug misusers into treatment and the Department of Health and Children — which has overall responsibility for the addiction services — continues to report an increase in the numbers being treated. In this context, it is worth noting that at the end of August, there were 7,190 drug misusers on methadone treatment compared with a figure of approximately 5,000 at the end of the year 2,000 — an increase of approximately 40%.To further emphasise the Government's commitment to implementing the national drugs strategy, the Deputy should note that approximately €80 million has been allocated to implement the two rounds of action plans of the local drugs task forces, LDTFs; an amount of €12.8 million has been allocated under the LDTF premises initiative which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects and; approximately €75 million has been allocated to support in the region of 450 facility and services under the young people's facilities and services fund. I believe that this investment of nearly €168 million in these drugs services since 1996 — in addition to more than €220 million invested in addiction services by the health boards in the same period — could not fairly be characterised as a lack of commitment on the Government's part.The Government continues to be pursue the further implementation of the strategy and earlier this year my Department published National Drugs Strategy 2001-2008: Critical Implementation Path which maps out how the 100 actions of the national drugs strategy are being delivered and timeframes for delivery. I invite the Deputy to examine this publication, which, notwithstanding some difficulties, clearly shows that Departments and agencies continue to make progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. I plan to publish a progress report covering the first three years of the strategy before the end of the year.The Deputy should note that I have initiated a mid-term review of the national drugs strategy. The review will examine the progress being made to date in achieving the overall key strategic goals set out in the strategy and will enable priorities for future action to be identified and a re-focusing of the strategy, if necessary. The review will be completed by the end 2004 or early 2005.

In common with other Departments, my Department submitted an issues paper to the interdepartmental committee identifying the activities to which implementation of the national spatial strategy is linked, the degree to which those activities currently support the implementation of the strategy and the potential for better alignment between these and implementation of the strategy. This is an ongoing process. Issues of particular relevance to the NSS include the following.My Department's CLÁR programme, targeted at particularly disadvantaged rural areas, supports the objectives of the national spatial strategy. The Western Development Commission has developed a strategy for towns on radial routes in the West, to maximise the benefit to the west of the national spatial strategy. A review of support for enterprise, including tourism, in rural areas has been commissioned and is nearing completion.Two major conferences were held during Ireland's EU Presidency on living conditions and quality of life in rural Europe and on islands, mountains and sparsely populated areas. The operation of LEADER+ and the national rural development programme is continuing and, like the CLÁR programme, support the objectives of the NSS.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I look forward to meeting Commissioner designate Fischer Boel in the near future.Negotiations have already commenced at European Council level on the form and scope of the next generation of rural development measures due to commence in 2007. A key feature of the Commission's proposals in this regard is the inclusion of a complete priority axis of measures aimed at addressing the critical social and economic difficulties faced by rural communities experiencing ageing, static or declining populations.While it is early days yet in the negotiations, it is becoming increasingly clear that the detailed provisions of this axis will significantly reflect, in many cases, those initiatives and schemes implemented by my Department, particularly under the CLÁR programme, rural social scheme and LEADER initiative. My Department will have a leading role in advancing this wider rural economy axis under the regulation.EU funding allocations to rural development programmes will be decided as part of the negotiations on the overall budgetary framework for the EU for 2007 to 2013, known as the financial perspectives. Until the budgetary ceiling is agreed it will not be possible to estimate indicative financial allocations to member states, and even less so to individual headings. However, in the meantime, the Commission has signalled that commitments to member states for national rural development programmes will be based on a mix of indicators including past performance. On this basis, following the very successful experience of the LEADER model nationally, it is hoped that Ireland will once again receive a significant share of funding. It must be recognised, however, that in a Union of potentially 27 member states and given the enormous success of the Irish economy, particularly in the last ten years, it will be very difficult to secure funding levels close to those achieved previously.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	409	As the Deputy may be aware, on 1 September last I launched the first Irish review of scientific evidence regarding cannabis. The report, entitled An Overview of Scientific and other Information on Cannabis was published by the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD. The report is part of this Government's ongoing commitment to improving our knowledge base in the drugs field.As I stated at the time, I believe the report shows that cannabis is a complex substance and, notwithstanding the fact that it is not as dangerous as some other drugs, it can have many damaging effects on the physical and mental health of the user, particularly the young and those who are heavy users of the drug.The issue of the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes is primarily one for the Minister for Health and Children. However, as the NACD report points out, studies on the therapeutic value of cannabis have to date been inconclusive. In this regard, there are ongoing research trials in the UK and I look forward to the results of these trials with interest.In any event, I am sure the Deputy will agree that it is vital that we distinguish between the recreational use of cannabis, with all that that entails, and granting a licence for the use of cannabis, or a cannabis extract, for medicinal purposes, under strict clinical supervision.

These are independent companies who deliver the EU funded LEADER programmes under contract to my Department. Sectoral agreements are in place at local level between LEADER companies and the county enterprise boards, the other main funders of small rural enterprise. These agreements aim to eliminate duplication of funding and focus resources on the most promising proposals at county level. A steering committee comprising representatives of my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and both of the funding agencies oversees the operation of the agreements at national level.The county development boards, CDBs, also have a key role in bringing about the more co-ordinated and integrated delivery of local development and public services at local level. The boards, which are led by local authorities which come under the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are representative of local development bodies, state agencies and the social partners. LEADER companies are represented on all relevant CDBs.I draw the Deputy's attention to the position regarding the review of supports for rural enterprise which is the subject of Parliamentary Question reply no. 35 of today's date.

The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, which were established in the areas experiencing the worst levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. More than €80 million has been allocated to the task forces to implement their two rounds of local action plans. A further €12.8 million has been allocated to capital projects under the LDTF premises initiative, which is designed to meet the accommodation needs of community based drugs projects. In addition, approximately €75 million has been allocated to support the work of the young peoples facilities and services fund in LDTF areas and four other urban centres. The main aim of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into recreational facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance misuse.The Estimates process for 2005 is ongoing and the Deputy will appreciate that the allocations for my Department for next year have not yet been finalised. However, I assure the Deputy that it is my intention that significant resources will continue to be targeted at tackling drug misuse throughout the country.

I measc na bpríomh-chéimeanna atá tógtha go dáta: tá €500,000 curtha ar fáil i Meastacháin mo Roinne don bhliain seo chun Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla a mhaoiniú agus tá an tUasal Seán Ó Cuirreáin ceaptha ag an Uachtarán mar An Coimisinéir Teanga le héifeacht ó 23 Feabhra 2004; rinne mé ordú tosach feidhme ar 19 Eanáir 2004 a thugann feidhm don chuid is mó d'fhorálacha an Achta le héifeacht ón lá sin agus ó 1 Bealtaine 2004 i gcás alt 10; agus foilsíodh dréacht de threoirlínte faoi alt 12 den Acht ag tús mí Iúil chun cuidiú le comhlachtaí poiblí chun caighdeáin a sheirbhísí trí mheán na Gaeilge a fheabhsú ar bhealach comhtháite, céimiúil agus aontaithe; cuireadh cóip ar aghaidh chuig gach comhlacht poiblí agus iarradh orthu a dtuairimí a chur ar fáil do mo Roinnse le breithniú.Mar is eol don Teachta, ní foláir, d'fhoilsigh mo Roinnse an leagan daingnithe de na treoirlínte ar an Déardaoin seo chaite, agus d'fhógair mé chomh maith ainmneacha an chéad 25 chomhlacht poiblí atá i mbun dréacht-scéim a ullmhú i gcomhréir leis na treoirlínte sin. Tá scéim mo Roinne féin faoin Acht, a bheidh mar mhúnla do chomhlachtaí poiblí eile, foilsithe inniu freisin.Maidir le hullmhú scéimeanna faoin Acht, ní miste dom a mhíniú go dtosnaíonn an próiseas le fógra i scríbhinn chuig an comhlacht poiblí i gceist ón Aire Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta, agus go bhfuil tréimhse suas go sé mhí ag an gcomhlacht le dréacht-scéim a ullmhú agus a chur faoi bhráid. Caithfear a thuiscint, mar sin, gur beag an líon scéimeanna a bheidh i bhfeidhm sa ghearr-thréimhse.Mar a dúirt mé, táim sásta go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach á dhéanamh ag mo Roinnse maidir le cur i bhfeidhm fhorálacha an Achta ar bhonn chéimiúil. Táim sásta freisin go n-éireoidh leis na comhlachtaí poiblí na dualgais reachtúla a thitfidh orthu go céimiúil faoin Acht a chomhlíonadh agus go deimhin go nglacfaidh said leis an dúshlán le meon dearfach agus sa spiorad ceart. Ar ndóigh, beidh gach scéim dréachtaithe ag na comhlachtaí poiblí i gcomhthéacs agus ar bhonn na n-acmhainní — idir airgead agus foireann — atá acu nó a bheidh ar fáil dóibh le linn thréimhse na scéime. Ní féidir gach rud a bhaint amach thar oíche agus, mar a dúirt mé ón dtús, is í an aidhm atá agam ná go mbeidh feabhsúcháin á mbaint amach — thar thréimhse roinnt scéimeanna, b'fhéidir — ar leibhéal agus ar chaighdeán na seirbhísí poiblí a bhíonn á gcur ar fáil trí Ghaeilge, de réir éilimh.An méid sin ráite, is gnó do na comhlachtaí poiblí féin, ar ndóigh, a chinntiú go gcomhlíonfar na dualgais a thitfidh orthu faoin Acht seo sa chaoi chéanna agus a chomhlíontar dualgais faoi aon reachtaíocht eile.

In accordance with the bottom up philosophy of rural development, the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan. The approval of grants by groups is made within detailed operating rules drawn up by the Department and approved by the EU Commission.The success of the Leader programmes has been in delivering local integrated solutions for local communities, developed by local communities themselves. Most Leader projects are community based though assistance is also provided towards small rural enterprises and training of rural dwellers. Progress has been good in the current round 2001-2006. Since contracts were signed in November 2001 there has been a spend of over €35 million.On Tuesday of this week, I officially inaugurated the appointment, through Comhar Leader na hÉireann, of a small food producer's co-ordinator who will endeavour to tackle some of the barriers inhibiting small food producers. The action plan which the co-ordinator will implement over the next year covers: co-ordination between small food producers and statutory agencies, training bodies etc. training and technical support, farmers markets, food producers information guides to contain information on HACCP, food stamp etc., food awards, food week, accreditation branding and food safety issues. I am supporting this initiative through the provision of €50,000 from my Department's rural development fund.Last week, I announced that I had received confirmation from David Byrne, EU Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection, that member states may adopt EU regulations to provide for flexibility for food consumers. In addition, the Commissioner stated that member states may adopt infrastructural requirements for any food business. These developments should prove supportive of, and encouraging for, traditional and artisan food producers.My Department also engaged Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, in autumn 2003 to carry out a review of enterprise support in rural areas including identifying weaknesses or gaps, if any, in supports and-or their structures of delivery taking account of EU State aid law, the national spatial strategy and Exchequer financial constraints. I expect that the report of this review will be completed in the near future.

It is hoped to have these regulations published at an early date.These regulations, which will be subject to the consent of the Ministers for Finance and Transport, will set down the agreed destinations for connecting bus passenger services and will form the basis for entering into formal contracts in these particular cases.

The regulation is the legal instrument that governs the EU institutions' official and working language regime. The focus in these ongoing discussions with representatives of the other member states and the EU institutions is on securing agreement on the practical modalities in relation to this objective.Once these discussions have progressed sufficiently to clarify the practical options and issues arising in relation to achieving this objective, the matter will return formally to Government. The Deputy will understand why it would not be appropriate for me to make any public comment on the detail of these discussions until they have been brought to a conclusion.

A further three applications are progressing through economic appraisal and when completed will be presented to the steering committee for final decision.At this stage in the programme, it appears likely that there will be a need for a further call for applications to the measure. The full position will become clearer when all applications to date have been fully processed and decided upon by the INTERREG steering committee which will be later this year.

Funding under the scheme can be provided for small scale security equipment designed to strengthen points of entry to the dwelling; for security lighting and for the once-off cost of installing socially monitored personal alarm systems. This year the scheme has been extended to include smoke alarms. Burglar alarm systems are not covered by the scheme. The 2004 scheme was advertised nationwide on 29 July 2004 with a closing date of 13 September 2004.I have indicated that given the nature of this scheme my Department will be flexible and understanding in relation to applications received after the official closing date. My Department is currently engaged in processing applications for the 2004 scheme and grants will issue to community groups at the earliest possible date.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	422	Following the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority and the end of the my Department's involvement in the insurance reform programme, the Department of Finance will have overall responsibility for policy and legislation in relation to the provision of financial services in Ireland.A key initiative in my Department was the establishment of Personal Injuries Assessment Board which I am confident will lead to reduced premia and improve the availability of public and employer liability insurance to the benefit of community and voluntary organisations. By eliminating the need for litigation costs where legal issues are not in dispute, the PIAB will significantly reduce the cost of delivering compensation. The PIAB will also offer speedier assessments to the benefit of claimants.It is generally recognised that litigation costs add between 40% and 50% to the cost of a personal injury claim. It is intended that PIAB will make significant inroads in this figure. PIAB will however carry out a cost benefit analysis of the new system as against the system prior to the introduction of PIAB and this will indicate the reduction in the level of litigation.The pricing and underwriting of insurance is a matter for individual insurance companies and EU law prevents Governments from intervening directly in relation to premium levels. However it is expected that reduction in litigation costs in personal injury claims will lead to corresponding reductions in premium levels.

An implementation team reports directly to the chief executive and progress is reported to the board of the authority on a regular basis.Staff have been briefed on the government decision and discussions have commenced with the staff unions through the authority's industrial relations council. A detailed implementation plan has been prepared in consultation with the key stakeholders and submitted to the Flynn working group. The plan sets out the challenges, opportunities and issues arising for the authority and its staff from the decentralisation programme and sets out indicative timelines for delivery of the programme together with proposed models for continuity of service. Proposals are being formulated for optimal delivery of compliance and enforcement services to all of the country and in particular the south east, greater Dublin area and Border regions.Results from the central applications facility show that there were a total of 51 expressions of interest nationally in Thomastown. A more detailed analysis of grade breakdown and skills is expected shortly, which will facilitate development of the next phase of the implementation plan.Discussions have taken place with the Office of Public Works in relation to identification and procurement of a suitable site in Thomastown and construction of a head office facility for the authority. A detailed specification has been developed and submitted to the Office of Public Works in this regard.

I believe that increased competition and consumer vigilance are the best ways to ensure that markets deliver value for money to consumers.There is legislation in place designed to help consumers to make a conscious decision before they enter a licensed premises. The Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order 1991 requires that the price of alcoholic and soft drinks must be displayed just outside or immediately inside each entrance to a licensed premises.

Participants are offered temporary full-time employment for a period of three years. The fundamental objective of the programme is to prepare participants to progress into mainstream jobs.The jobs initiative is a relatively small programme with an average of 2,100 places available in 2004. To date, eligibility has focused on disadvantaged persons removed from the labour market, that is, long-term unemployed persons in receipt of an unemployment payment and lone parents in receipt of the one parent family payment. Spouses of unemployed persons may also qualify. There are no plans to change the eligibility criteria for participation on jobs initiative schemes at present.

The first round of the scheme covered the period January 2001 to December 2002. The applicant was one of 102 who was not approved for grant aid and he was notified to that effect in August 2001. There has been no further round of the scheme since then.

Where a participant in REPS dies within the period of the REPS contract, the contract is terminated and my Department does not look for a refund of payments already made. In this case, however, because the person named had died before payment issued for the third year of his contract my Department has no option but to seek a refund. Although the original contract is terminated, the widow of the person named is free to apply for REPS in her own right.

Following computer validation, two of the animals included on the application of 25 March 2004 were identified as non-CMMS compliant on the date of application, in that their movements were not recorded on the CMMS database until 24 June 2004. The person named was written to on 4 August 2004 and 6 September 2004 advising that the animals in question would accordingly be rejected from the application and was informed of the right of appeal. To date the person named has not availed of this opportunity.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The person named did not apply for suckler cow premium in 2000 or 2001. In 2000 she held a quota for nine premium rights but did not use it in that year. Under EU regulations a person holding a suckler quota for seven premium rights or more must, except in duly justified exceptional circumstances, use at least 90% of their quota every year otherwise the part unused is withdrawn and transferred to the national reserve. My Department issued a letter to her on 7 September 2000 advising her that she did not use her suckler quota and that if she was unable to do so due to exceptional circumstances she should reply stating her reasons for non use and her case would be considered. She did not reply to this letter and as result her quota was transferred to the national reserve.She applied for suckler cow premium in 2002 but her application could not be processed because she failed to return it after it was sent back to her to be fully completed. She applied for premium on nine suckler cows in 2003 but was not paid because she has no suckler quota. My Department contacted her on 28 July and 8 August 2003 advising her to submit reasons for non use of her quota in 2000. However she has failed to do so. Therefore, as she has no suckler quota she cannot be paid premium under the 2003 suckler cow premium scheme.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The objective of the partnership arrangements is to cater for the establishment of a genuine partnership which entails a substantial involvement in the operation of the enterprise by each of the parties concerned. In order to ensure this, it was necessary to put a limit on the level of off-farm income which can be earned by each participating partner.Advice in this matter was received from representatives of a wide range of interests in the industry. The partnership arrangements operate on a national basis and must accordingly be subject to common rules. At present the limit for off farm income in the case of standard partnerships is €24,000 per annum while that for new entrant — parent partnerships is €22,000 per annum. The regulations also provide for an exemption from these limits in certain circumstances. I will, of course, keep the operation of the current rules, including the level of off farm income under review and will make any appropriate changes where that is shown to be necessary.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The regulations concerning milk production partnerships require that the off farm income of a partner in a new entrant-parent partnership cannot exceed €22,000 during any year. Where this limit is exceeded the partnership cannot remain registered, other than where a specific exemption for that year has been applied for and granted. On removal from the register, the regulations provide that, on application from the parties concerned, the amount of quota to be transferred to each producer and the amount to be sold back into the restructuring scheme, or added to the national reserve shall be determined by the Minister.No such application has been received from the parties in any specific case. On receipt of such an application I will have the matter duly considered. I would emphasise, however, that the new entrant-parent partnership arrangement was specifically introduced to allow sons or daughters of existing milk producers working a holding with a parent to have access to quota under the restructuring scheme.

BSE legislation provides that farmers are compensated at current market value rates for animals that have been depopulated as a result of BSE. Re-population is normally permitted 30 days after satisfactory completion of cleansing-disinfection so the farmer need not be out of business for a prolonged period of time. There is no provision for payment of other compensation in respect of BSE depopulations.In the present case, a number of anomalies have been identified in respect of animals in this herd and recorded on the Department's cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS. Payment cannot be processed until these aspects are resolved.Teagasc provides a special advisory service for herdowners whose herds are depopulated resulting from a national disease eradication programme, for example, BSE. There are no fees or charges for this special service and the service can be accessed by contacting the chief agricultural officer at Teagasc, Kinsealy, County Dublin.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	446	Like all public servants, non-nursing staff in the Southern Health Board have the potential to benefit on retirement from some of the recent changes with regard to public service pensions. Any new rates which might apply would depend on the circumstances of the individual.The information set out as follows provides information on the changes announced in September 2004, to which I assume the Deputy is referring.The cost-neutral early retirement facility will allow public servants to retire early with actuarially reduced superannuation benefits. Workers whose current minimum pension age is 60 will be able to avail of the facility from age 50 upwards, while those whose minimum pension age is 65 will be eligible from age 55 upwards. This facility is being made available to serving staff and the option will be extended to staff who resigned with an entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits as and from 1 April 2004. Superannuation benefits in such cases will be based on pensionable service at the time of resignation reduced, appropriately, to take account of early payment. An outline of the table to be used for this purpose is set out following.The table shows the values for each full year of age; adjustments based on exact age — that is, years and days — will be made when calculating actual benefits due.Members with a preserved age of 60Members with a preserved age of 65age last birthdaypensionlump sumage last birthdaypensionlump sum%%%%5062.482.25558.282.45165.183.95661.184.05267.985.55764.185.65371.087.25867.487.35474.388.95971.089.05577.890.76074.890.75681.692.46179.092.55785.794.36283.694.35890.196.16388.596.15994.898.06494.098.0Integration formula: Public servants with full social insurance get an old age contributory pension, OACP, and their public service occupational pension is reduced to take account of this fact. This process, known as integration, can mean that lower-paid workers get only small public service pensions, or none at all. The calculation formula underlying integration is being adjusted to deliver a boost to the public service pension income of lower paid public servants. Accrual rates under the new formula are 1/200th for pensionable remuneration below 31/3rd times OACP and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit.This revision represents an improvement in rates of occupational pension for lower paid workers, without any requirement to increase contribution rate. The current salary "cut-off point" below which workers and retired public servants will benefit from this revision is €557.67 per week or €29,099 per annum. Persons with remuneration above this level are unaffected. For an employee, therefore, on, say, €25,000 per annum, with maximum service at retirement, the annual increase in pension benefits would be in the order of €1,230 — that is, €23.57 a week. The revised basis of calculation will apply to existing pensioners with effect from 1 January 2004 and all relevant retirees as and from that date.Pro rata integration, as opposed to full integration which applies at present, will apply to part-time public servants and relevant pensioners with full social insurance, as and from 20 December 2001. The terms full and pro-rata integration refer to different methods of co-ordinating OACP with public service occupational pension in the case of part time employees.The new method of pro rata calculation along with the new integration formula will be of significant benefit to part timers. For example, the value of the increase in the occupational pension of a part-time employee on, say, €15,000 per annum, with maximum service at retirement, would be in the order of €3,135 per annum or €60 per week. The revision to the integration formula — see earlier paragraph — may also further increase benefits payable to certain part-time employees.Existing schemes of notional added years will be replaced, for new entrants, from a current date, by a single transitional scheme which will be reviewed in 2015. The commission had recommended the abolition of such schemes. Following discussion with the unions however, the Government has decided to replace the existing schemes with a new interim scheme with a lower maximum award.The calculation of pension on variable pensionable allowances will be based on the best three consecutive years in the ten years preceding retirement, rather than on the three years immediately prior to retirement, as at present. The new system will apply to relevant staff who retire or have retired from the public service as and from 1 April 2004.The current pension interest rate, which applies, in particular, to repayment of marriage gratuities, will be cut from 6% to 4% in respect of repayment due for periods from 14 November 2000 onwards. Implementation of the various changes will commence as soon as detailed guidelines have been prepared and circulated by my Department. The preparation of these guidelines is being addressed, as a matter of urgency, by my officials. Public service pensioners who may have entitlement to benefit from any of these changes, including those who were employed by the Southern Health Board, will have such benefit passed on to them, as soon as practicable. In general, there should be no need for individuals to make application in advance of payment.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I assume the Deputy is referring to excise duty on diesel. Diesel is liable to mineral oil tax, MOT, at a rate of €368.05 per 1,000 litres when used for combustion in the engine of a motor vehicle and at a rate of €31.74 per 1,000 litres in other cases.For MOT purposes, under section 94(1) of the Finance Act 1999 the term "motor vehicle" excludes agricultural tractors, road rollers, off-road dumpers, mobile cranes, mobile well-drilling equipment and mobile concrete pumping equipment which accordingly benefit from the lower rate. All of these exclusions cover vehicles whose primary purpose is not transportation of persons or goods on roads but which are used mainly on construction sites. In addition, the fuel is used not only for propulsion but to power specialised equipment such as cranes, drills and pumps on the vehicles.EU law — Council Directive 2003/96/EC — on the taxation of energy products requires in principle a uniform rate of excise duty on auto-diesel. However, member states are allowed to apply rate differentiation, subject to minimum rates, to various stated categories of product or use including — Article 8 — "plant and machinery used in construction, civil engineering and public works" and "vehicles intended for use off the public roadway or which have not been granted authorisation for use mainly on the public roadway". A number of other Member States avail of this provision.As regards vehicle registration tax, special purpose vehicles which are defined in section 135A of Finance Act 1992 as vehicles "designed, constructed or adapted solely or mainly for a purpose other than the carriage of persons or goods", are exempt. However, if the vehicle is to be used on roads, travelling from site to site by means of its own mechanical propulsion, there is a requirement to register the vehicle. The VRT category in this instance would be €50 — category C vehicle.

The number of bodies, organisations and groups to which the Act applies has increased from 67 when the Act came into operation in April 1998 to almost 400 today. Proposals for further extensions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 are being developed at official level at present. The question of applying the Freedom of Information Act to VECs will be considered in this context.

First time buyers are also exempt from stamp duty on second hand houses up to the value of €190,500 and benefit, thereafter, from reduced rates on second hand properties up to €381,000 when compared to other purchasers.The stamp duty code does not provide exemptions based on the particular circumstances referred to by the Deputy. I have been advised by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government that local authorities are responsible for administering the disabled persons new house grant. Subject to eligibility, this grant is awarded to individuals with disabilities who are forced to buy new dwellings because the previous dwelling did not accommodate the specific needs of the individual. The individual in question may contact the relevant local authority for further information, as well as a grant application, where applicable.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	454	Capital gains tax, CGT, is a tax on a capital gain arising on the disposal of assets. A 20% rate of CGT now applies on the gains arising on the disposal of assets, including land which is the subject of a compulsory purchase order, CPO.It was announced in the 2003 budget that no rollover relief would be allowed for any purpose on gains arising from disposals on or after 4 December 2002. This relief was introduced when CGT rates were much higher than current levels. In effect, it was a deferral of tax to be paid, where the proceeds of disposal were re-invested into replacement assets. The taxation of these gains would take place following the eventual disposal of the new assets without their replacement.The abolition of this relief was in accordance with the overall taxation policy of widening the tax base in order to keep direct tax rates low. Reliefs and allowances made sense when CGT rates were 40% and above. In the 1998 budget, the rate was halved from 40% to 20%. Taxing capital gains when they are realised is the most logical time to do so, and this change brought CGT into line with other areas.In view of overall taxation policy, there are no plans to change the methods by which CGT is calculated on land that has been compulsorily purchased. Accordingly, there are no plans to reintroduce roll-over relief.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	455	Details of the changes published in September 2004 are as follows: The cost-neutral early retirement facility will allow public servants to retire early with actuarially reduced superannuation benefits. Workers whose current minimum pension age is 60 will be able to avail of the facility from age 50 upwards, while those whose minimum pension age is 65 will be eligible from age 55 upwards. This facility is being made available to serving staff and the option will be extended to staff who resigned with an entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits as and from 1 April 2004. Superannuation benefits in such cases will be based on pensionable service at the time of resignation reduced, appropriately, to take account of early payment. An outline of the table to be used for this purpose is set out following.The table shows the values for each full year of age; adjustments based on exact age — that is, years and days — will be made when calculating actual benefits due.Members with a preserved age of 60Members with a preserved age of 65age last birthdaypensionlump sumage last birthdaypensionlump sum%%%%5062.482.25558.282.45165.183.95661.184.05267.985.55764.185.65371.087.25867.487.35474.388.95971.089.05577.890.76074.890.75681.692.46179.092.55785.794.36283.694.35890.196.16388.596.15994.898.06494.098.0Integration formula: Public servants with full social insurance get an old age contributory pension, OACP, and their public service occupational pension is reduced to take account of this fact. This process, known as integration, can mean that lower-paid workers get only small public service pensions, or none at all. The calculation formula underlying integration is being adjusted to deliver a boost to the public service pension income of lower paid public servants. Accrual rates under the new formula are 1/200th for pensionable remuneration below 31/3rd times OACP and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit.This revision represents an improvement in rates of occupational pension for lower paid workers, without any requirement to increase contribution rate. The current salary "cut-off point" below which workers and retired public servants will benefit from this revision is €557.67 per week or €29,099 per annum. Persons with remuneration above this level are unaffected. For an employee, therefore, on, say, €25,000 per annum, with maximum service at retirement, the annual increase in pension benefits would be in the order of €1,230 — that is, €23.57 a week. The revised basis of calculation will apply to existing pensioners with effect from 1 January 2004 and all relevant retirees as and from that date.Pro rata integration, as opposed to full integration which applies at present, will apply to part-time public servants and relevant pensioners with full social insurance, as and from 20 December 2001. The terms full and pro-rata integration refer to different methods of co-ordinating OACP with public service occupational pension in the case of part time employees.The new method of pro rata calculation along with the new integration formula will be of significant benefit to part timers. For example, the value of the increase in the occupational pension of a part-time employee on, say, €15,000 per annum, with maximum service at retirement, would be in the order of €3,135 per annum or €60 per week. The revision to the integration formula — see earlier paragraph — may also further increase benefits payable to certain part-time employees.Existing schemes of notional added years will be replaced, for new entrants, from a current date, by a single transitional scheme which will be reviewed in 2015. The commission had recommended the abolition of such schemes. Following discussion with the unions however, the Government has decided to replace the existing schemes with a new interim scheme with a lower maximum award.The calculation of pension on variable pensionable allowances will be based on the best three consecutive years in the ten years preceding retirement, rather than on the three years immediately prior to retirement, as at present. The new system will apply to relevant staff who retire or have retired from the public service as and from 1 April 2004.The current pension interest rate, which applies, in particular, to repayment of marriage gratuities, will be cut from 6% to 4% in respect of repayment due for periods from 14 November 2000 onwards.Implementation of the various changes will commence as soon as detailed guidelines have been prepared and circulated by my Department. The preparation of these guidelines is being addressed, as a matter of urgency, by my officials. Public service pensioners who may have entitlement to benefit from any of these changes, including those who previously worked for local authorities, will have such benefit passed on to them, as soon as practicable. In general, there should be no need for individuals to make application in advance of payment.

This should be taken into account in comparing numbers with the 1998-99 tax year. It should be noted that a married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.

I would propose to cover only the most recent work in this area, with particular emphasis on the outcome of the Irish Presidency of the European Union.The Irish Presidency continued European Union efforts to promote the implementation of the roadmap. My predecessor conducted an intensive round of meetings with interlocutors from the region. He also visited the region in January and in March and had separate meetings here in Dublin with the Palestinian Foreign Minister and Prime Minister and the Israeli Foreign Minister. We pressed the parties to adopt concrete measures which would advance the peace process.We maintained close contact with partners in the quartet and emphasised the need for a meeting of the quartet at principals' level. This meeting was held on 4 May in New York and was attended by my predecessor. The statement issued following this meeting reaffirmed the quartet's commitment to a negotiated settlement to the conflict resulting in two states, Israel and a viable, democratic, sovereign and contiguous Palestine, living side by side in peace and security.The Irish Presidency also responded to the developments on the ground, particularly Prime Minister Sharon's Gaza withdrawal plan. The March European Council identified criteria that are essential to make a withdrawal acceptable to the international community and in April EU foreign ministers, meeting in Tullamore, issued a statement which reaffirmed the EU's position on the resolution of the conflict and the importance of a negotiated settlement. The European Council in June reviewed developments in the Middle East peace process. It expressed concern at the continuing violence and at the humanitarian crisis in the occupied territories. It welcomed the prospect of Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip, provided that it is implemented in accordance with the elements identified in the conclusions of the European Council in March.The European Council also reaffirmed its belief that the roadmap represents the only route to achieving a negotiated two state solution to the Israeli — Palestinian conflict and called for renewed efforts towards a comprehensive ceasefire.During the Presidency we also encouraged civil society initiatives. In March, the then Minister met promoters of the Geneva Initiative and in April he met Israeli and Palestinian parliamentarians participating in a Glencree Centre for Reconciliation workshop. The Government's position on the conflict was restated most recently in the annual address to the UN General Assembly on 22 September 2004.

However, the EU enlargement process provided the impetus for the most recent efforts toward a settlement, which were undertaken by the UN Secretary General earlier this year. The Government gave its full support to the Secretary General in his mission of good offices. Before and during the UN-led negotiations, Ireland, as Presidency of the EU, maintained close contact with Secretary General Annan and with his special adviser on Cyprus. The Taoiseach, as President of the European Council, and the Minister, Deputy Cowen, also maintained contact with the various parties concerned and encouraged their commitment to the negotiating process and to the achievement of an agreed outcome. The Government worked closely with the European Commission, which provided assistance to the UN Secretary General, including advice on the compatibility of the proposed comprehensive settlement with the laws and regulations of the European Union.At the high level pre-donors conference organised by the Commission in Brussels on 15 April, the Government gave an undertaking that, in the event of an agreed settlement, Ireland would provide specific funding in support of its implementation. I would like to place on record once again our deep gratitude to Secretary General Annan and to his colleagues for their sustained efforts to bring about a settlement based on his proposals.As a result of the referendums on 24 April, the accession to the EU of a united Cyprus on 1 May was not possible. In the light of this, the General Affairs and External Relations Council, under the Irish Presidency, reviewed the situation on 26 April and adopted conclusions expressing the determination to ensure that the people of Cyprus would soon achieve their shared destiny as citizens of a united Cyprus in the European Union. The Council also agreed on the need to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriot community and to facilitate the reunification of Cyprus by encouraging their economic development. It recommended that the €259 million earmarked for the northern part of Cyprus in the event of a comprehensive settlement should be used to promote the economic development of the Turkish Cypriot community. The Irish Presidency subsequently achieved the agreement of member states to a Council regulation on the so called green line in Cyprus, including measures to allow trade across the line.Responding to the request of the April meeting of the Council, the Commission brought forward proposals in July aimed at the economic integration of the island and improving contact between the two communities and with the EU. These proposals are at present under intensive consideration by the member states.On 28 May, the UN Secretary General submitted a comprehensive report to the Security Council on his mission of good offices. He noted that the unsuccessful outcome represented another missed opportunity to resolve the Cyprus problem, and concluded that there was no apparent basis for resuming the good offices effort while the current stalemate continues. At this stage, the process remains under consideration in the UN Security Council.

The VTOS programme was designed for long-term unemployed people with minimal or no qualifications. Training allowances, in lieu of welfare payments, are payable to qualified VTOS students. The number of approved places on the programme currently stands at 5,000, and demand exceeds supply. In these circumstances, I regret that a departure from the VTOS eligibility criteria would not be practical. VTOS eligibility criteria do not apply to post leaving certificate courses.

The case was considered by the School Transport Appeals Board which decided that, "the terms of the School Transport Scheme have been properly and appropriately applied and therefore this appeal is not allowed".Further documentation has been received in my Department since this appeal was considered by the board and the papers are currently being examined.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The number of learning support teachers has grown from 1463 to 1531 over the last five years. I also wish to inform the Deputy that the number of resource teachers has grown from 200 to over 2,500 over the same period. The learning support service was evaluated by the Educational Research Centre on behalf of my Department in 1997 and its report was published in 1998. It made recommendations on the provision of learning support in mathematics. The implementation of these recommendations is contained in the learning support guidelines which issued to primary schools in 2000.I wish to point out that the learning support teachers remit, both at primary and secondary level, includes the teaching of mathematics. All second level schools in the free education scheme have an entitlement to an ex-quota allocation in respect of remedial education since the beginning of the 1999-2000 school year. The general position is that schools with enrolments of 600 or more pupils are allocated a full post; schools with enrolments below 600 pupils are allocated 0.5 of a post. However, schools with enrolments below 600 which were specifically allocated a full post in respect of remedial education by my Department prior to the 1999-2000 school year retain their entitlement to an allocation of a full post. The learning support posts which are enrolment based have fluctuated from 549.5 to 528 whole time teacher equivalents for the period in question. In the same period the number of teaching hours in respect of special needs pupils has increased from 559 to 1,206 whole time teacher equivalents.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	465	The junior certificate school programme, (JCSP), demonstration library project is a three year research project. New school libraries were set up in 11 participating post-primary schools for students up to junior certificate. The libraries are staffed by full-time qualified librarians. Reinforcing the concept of the whole-school approach to tackling literacy problems, the 11 schools are asked to draw up and implement library based strategies to tackle the literacy difficulties experienced by many JCSP students.The research will establish whether appropriate access to books and reading resources through a good library, which caters for the needs of students with literacy difficulties, impacts on their learning experience and allows them to address and overcome these difficulties.An interim report has been finished and a final report is due to be completed by February 2005. The question of the continuation of the project to the end of the current school year 2004-05 is being considered by my Department. The question of future developments in this area will be considered in the light of the report, overall priorities and available resources.

The results of this survey will not be available until March 2005.At post-primary level, the reading literacy of 15-year-old students was assessed in 2000 as part of the Programme for International Student Assessment, PISA. This programme was administered in 27 OECD countries. Ireland ranked fifth overall in terms of mean achievement with just one country, Finland, achieving a significantly higher mean score.At the lowest level of proficiency — level 1 or below — Ireland had a relatively low percentage of students — 11% as opposed to the OECD average of 17.9%. Ireland participated in a second round of PISA during 2003 and the results of this will be released by the OECD on 7 December 2004.

A minority of schools do not offer transition year at all. In others it may be available as an optional programme for some pupils. Some schools, in deciding to offer the programme, require all pupils to take the Programme in accordance with their curriculum provision across the school. In such schools (representing about 30% of the 500 schools offering the programme in the current school year) the programme is compulsory. This decision is made by school management.If a parent is unhappy with matters concerned with the management of the school he or she may make representations to the principal, the board of management and in the case of a VEC school the local Vocational Education Committee.

My Department is currently assessing the role of the visiting teacher service in the context of the level and range of teacher supports now being provided for children with special educational needs. I expect that the review will be completed within the current school term. A decision on the filling of vacancies, including the vacancy in County Galway to which the Deputy refers, will be based on the outcome of the review.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The school referred to by the Deputy was advised of its teacher allocation under the new weighted system on 24 June 2004. An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, SEN, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, as well as those with learning support needs. In addition, it will continue to allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.The weighted system will be made as follows: In the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence SEN and learning support needs. This will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in those categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN.My Department now proposes to devise school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. In order to facilitate the full introduction of the weighted model from the school year 2005-06, my Department has agreed not to redeploy surplus teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process during the current school year. Schools have been informed, also, that they may retain excess part-time teaching hours to the extent that such hours are required for children with low-incidence SEN.In the letter of 24 June, the school authorities were notified that its current allocation exceeds its entitlement under the weighted system. As advised in circular 13/04, schools may retain excess resource hours as identified for the current school year and it would be expected that the needs of the low incidence special educational needs pupils in question can be met from within the current resource/ learning support teaching allocation available to the school. The result of an outstanding application will issue to the school as soon as it becomes available.

The school authorities were informed recently of the outcome of some of the applications and will be notified of the outcome in relation to the remaining applications as soon as they become available. The school was advised of its teacher allocation under the new weighted system on 24 June 2004.An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, SEN, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, as well as those with learning support needs. In addition, it will continue to allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.The weighted system will be made as follows: In the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence SEN and learning support needs. This will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in those categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN.My Department now proposes to devise school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. In order to facilitate the full introduction of the weighted model from the school year 2005-06, my Department has agreed not to redeploy surplus teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process during the current school year. Schools have been informed, also, that they may retain excess part-time teaching hours to the extent that such hours are required for children with low-incidence SEN.The school appears to have excess resource hours under the weighted model of resource allocation. Schools were advised in a recent circular, SP ED 13/04, that they may retain any excess resource hours for the current school-year. However, any additional hours required for children with lower-incidence special educational needs, up to the level of the identified excess should be met from this excess. Only then may additional resource teaching hours be recruited.With regard to the school's applications for special needs assistant support, my Department prioritised applications for SNA support for new entrants and decisions on the majority of these were communicated to schools on 12 August. My officials are continuing to communicate with schools in respect of other new entrant cases as additional supporting information is provided.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	485	I propose to take Questions Nos. 307, 309, 336 and 339 together.The issue of the future of the college, which is the subject of the questions posed by the Deputies, arose in the context of a decision by the trustees of the college that, due to personnel and financial considerations, they were no longer in a position to fulfil the role of trustees of the college.Following discussions between the trustees and my Department, it was agreed that a consultant would be appointed who would meet with relevant parties and prepare a report on the options for the college's future consideration. The consultant's report was thoroughly examined in my Department and the options for the future of the college were set out for my predecessor's consideration. Having carefully considered all of them and having taken into account other factors such as the national spatial strategy, relevant costs in a time of financial constraint, a Government decision to restrict public service numbers, the need to secure value for money and a better allocation of resources, the former Minister, Deputy Dempsey decided that these considerations are best served by the closure of the college and the designation of St. Angela's College, Sligo, as the sole centre for the training of home economics teachers.It was agreed that the closure of the college would be phased over three academic years to facilitate students currently enrolled in the college to fully complete their studies without moving location and to ensure that there was an adequate transition period for staff. Officials from my Department have already met with the trustees and with management authorities of the college to discuss the necessary practical arrangements, including arrangements in relation to the position of the staff of the college. I have no plans to reconsider the decision to close the college.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The higher education grants schemes operate under the Local Authorities (Higher Education Grants) Acts, 1968 to 1992. Under the higher education grants scheme an approved course is defined as a full-time undergraduate course of at least two years duration or a full-time postgraduate course of not less than one year duration pursued in an approved institution.An approved institution is defined to mean a university, university college or other institution of higher education in so far as it provides a course or courses of not less than two years duration, being a course, or courses, which the Minister for Education and Science approves for the time being for the purposes of the Acts.Each Year, the higher education grants scheme specifies a list of approved institutions for the purposes of the Schemes. The approved institutions mainly comprise of public funded third level institutions. In this regard, Griffith College is not an approved college for the purpose of the scheme.There are no plans at present to extend the scope of the student support schemes to private colleges. Any extension to the scope of the grants scheme, to include private colleges such as Griffith College can be considered only in the light of available resources and in the context of competing demands within the education sector.Tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, is available on tuition fees paid to certain private colleges in the State, including Griffith College. Further details and conditions in relation to such tax relief are available from any tax office.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	489	Where a student with special educational needs enrols in a post primary school, it is open to the school to apply to my Department for additional teaching support for the student. I can assure the Deputy that should an application be received by my Department, it will receive full and immediate attention.My Department allocates additional teaching support and special needs assistant support to second level schools to cater for pupils with special needs. Applications for such support are made to my Department by the relevant school authority. Each application is considered on the basis of the assessed needs of the pupils involved and the nature and level of support provided is determined on the advice of the psychological service.My Department has allocated 41.66 additional teaching support hours to the school concerned for the 2003-04 school year to cater for the special educational needs of pupils enrolled, including the pupil to whom the Deputy refers.

The psychologist assigned to the school has already visited the school in September in order to discuss the service to be offered this year. She has also made an appointment to meet the learning support teacher this week in order to discuss how many students need psychological assessment and to agree on a priority list.During the school year 2003-04, the psychologist made ten visits to the school. An eleventh visit was planned but had to be cancelled by the school. This is a high level of service and reflects the priority that NEPS gives to the school's needs. It is expected that the same number of visits will be offered during 2004-05.Five psychological assessments were carried out during 2003-04. Three of these were in respect of applications for reasonable accommodations during certificate examinations. These assessments were carried out within three days of the applications being received in NEPS. The other two assessments related to complex cases. One necessitated three school visits and the other required four school visits. Additional resource hours were not recommended in either case. In addition to individual assessment work, the psychologist has provided consultations and advice in respect of a number of other students.NEPS psychologists are expected to spend approximately 65% of their time in schools on individual case work and 35% on support and development work. Support and development work in this school has focused on screening and early identification of problems, the advantages and disadvantages of streaming and a whole school approach to special educational needs. The psychologist has also offered consultations to any subject teachers who would like them.My Department has allocated 2.5 additional whole time equivalent posts to the school to enable it to provide for students with special educational needs. With regard to other students with special needs who may have applied to transfer to the school, my Department will consider any application that may be made on their behalf.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	492	A working group to review all aspects of the syllabus and examination for the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge was established in 2001. A copy of their report has been published on my Department's website, as has an updated language syllabus for the SCG. Hard copies of the report and of the syllabus will also be available shortly and will be distributed to all Primary Schools, Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge, SCG, candidates, Colleges of Education and relevant Department personnel.My predecessor, announced changes in the structure of the Scrúdú Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge in April of this year. Pursuant to that announcement it was decided that a two-year extension to their period of provisional recognition would be granted to all teachers who held provisional recognition prior to 1 September 2004. In the case of those whose period of provisional recognition lapsed prior to that date, their two-year extension commences on 1 September 2004. A notice setting out this position is published on my Department's website.As this is a blanket extension applying to all teachers who held provisional recognition before 1 September 2004 it is not necessary for teachers to make individual applications. However, letters received from a number of teachers enquiring about their extensions have been replied to setting out the new arrangements.My Department is currently engaged in finalising other new arrangements relating to the Scrúdú le hAghaidh Cáilíochta sa Ghaeilge. Once finalised, details of these new arrangements will be notified to all primary schools by way of circular letter.

As soon as this report is received, further consideration will be given to the matter.In addition, a proposed large-scale building refurbishment project for the school is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme. This project is at stage 4/5 — detail design/bill of quantities — of architectural planning. It has been assigned a band 3 rating by my Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.My Department's officials are currently reviewing all projects that were not authorised to proceed to construction as part of the 2004 school building programme including the school in question with a view to including them as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. I expect to make further announcements in this regard before the end of the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	498	My Department launched a pilot project for modern languages in primary schools in September 1998. The aims of the pilot project included the development of communication skills in four target languages which are French, German, Spanish and Italian, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in schools. To achieve these aims in the project schools the teaching of a modern European language to pupils in fifth and sixth classes was introduced.When the project started, 270 schools were selected for participation. The project has since been renamed as the Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative and there are now 394 participating primary schools. The breakdown per language is as follows: Italian 20, Spanish 66, German 95, French 213.The initiative is administered by Kildare Education Centre and a support structure comprising a national co-ordinator and project leaders — trainers — has been in place since 1998. Project leaders support teachers in participating schools on an ongoing basis through the delivery of inservice which focuses on methodologies and teaching approaches and through school visits.In addition, my Department is involved in ongoing collaboration with the languages departments of the Iistitutes of technology who provide training programmes for teachers. The courses provided cover all of the target languages in the Initiative and the objective is to create a cohort of primary teachers with the necessary skills to teach modern languages in their schools.These programmes have received Higher Education and Training Awards Council, HETAC, accreditation. To date, the 11 institutes have been involved and they have produced 389 graduates across the four languages with a further 88 due to graduate later in 2004.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	499	My Department remains committed to the development of pre-school education. The enhancement of early childhood services in accordance with the White Paper on Early Childhood Education, Ready to Learn, is being undertaken on a collaborative, phased basis and will draw together and build upon the many examples of best practice in early childhood education that have emerged over the recent years. In order to help combat disadvantage and promote education, special emphasis will be placed on the provision of appropriate pre-school education in areas of social deprivation and for those with special needs.To that end my Department supports the Early Start scheme which funds 40 centres that aim to expose children aged three to four years from disadvantaged areas to a positive pre-school environment to improve their overall development and long-term educational experience and performance. The Department also funds 48 pre-schools for travellers which aim to develop children's cognitive, language and social skills, to prepare children for entry to primary school and to provide a foundation for further learning.My Department established the Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education, CECDE, in October 2002 to develop within a three year period, a quality framework for early childhood education and to develop, through active research with existing programmes, targeted interventions for children who have special needs or who are disadvantaged. The centre is currently developing a conceptual framework of early childhood learning and development which will be completed early in 2005.In addition, Ireland recently participated in a major OECD review which assessed quality, access and co-ordination in early childhood provision. This review was published on 24 September and offers a number of important recommendations and observations which will inform policy and programme development in the sector and will assist the work of the CECDE, among others.Early childhood education and care is a horizontal policy issue involving several Departments and agencies. The policy implications of the recommendations arising from the OECD review are under active consideration within my own Department and also by the relevant sub group of the Government's high level working group on childcare and early education.

In the context of the available funding, and the number of applications for that funding, it was not possible to approve all applications received, and only those with an absolute and demonstrated need for additional accommodation were approved.The need for additional accommodation at the school to which the Deputy refers will be considered in the context of a review which is being undertaken of all projects that did not proceed as part of the 2004 school building programme, with a view to including it as part of a multi-annual school building programme from 2005. I expect to be in a position to make a further announcement in this matter later this year.It is also open to the school to apply for temporary accommodation for 2005 under a new scheme recently announced. The closing date for applications under this scheme is 5 November 2004.

An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, SEN, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, as well as those with learning support needs. In addition, it will continue to allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs.The weighted system will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher incidence special needs; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence SEN and learning support needs. This will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in those categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN.My Department now proposes to devise school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. In order to facilitate the full introduction of the weighted model from the school year 2005-06, my Department has agreed not to redeploy surplus teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process during the current school year. Schools have been informed, also, that they may retain excess part-time teaching hours to the extent that such hours are required for children with low-incidence SEN.In relation to special needs assistant support my Department prioritised applications for SNA support for new entrants and decisions on the majority of these were communicated to schools on 12th August. My officials are continuing to communicate with schools in respect of other new entrant cases as additional supporting information is provided.

I further understand that the school in question has six special classes for pupils with special needs. The approved level of teaching staff has been sanctioned for all these classes in accordance with my Department's criteria.In addition, this school was advised of its teacher allocation under the new weighted system on 24 June 2004. Currently, the school has the services of two full-time resource teaching posts, one full-time learning support teacher post and one shared learning support teacher post. The school authorities have recently been informed of the outcome of applications for pupils with lower-incidence special educational needs, SEN. These resources can be put in place immediately and are in addition to the resources mentioned above.

In relation to teaching support, the Deputy may be aware of the new weighted model of resource teacher allocation for pupils with special educational needs who, like the pupil in question, fall within the high-incidence disability categories.It would be expected that the needs of the pupil in question can be met from within the current resource-learning support teaching allocation available to the school. The school authorities were notified accordingly.

Schools have been informed, also, that they may retain excess part-time teaching hours to the extent that such hours are required for children with low-incidence SEN.In the context of the school in question, it would be expected that the needs of pupils who fall within the high-incidence disability categories can be met from within the current resource learning support teaching allocation available to the school. At this stage, the school has received a response to all applications for resource teaching support in respect of pupils in the low-incidence disability categories.

Each instalment of the scholarship can be collected from the grants-bursar's office of the college.Prior to payment of the first maintenance instalment, the student service charge or, where appropriate, the lecture fee, the college is required to confirm to my Department that the student has been accepted on an approved course and registration has been completed.The student support unit of my Department has not yet received official confirmation of registration from the college in respect of the student referred to by the Deputy. My Department has contacted the college in question requesting an early return of the relevant documentation. Payment for the first instalment of the scholarship will issue on receipt of same.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	510	As recently announced, over the remainder of this school year a new school planning model involving published area development plans will be piloted in five areas. Included in the pilot scheme is the north Dublin, south Louth and mid Meath regions which have been identified as rapidly developing areas. The plan for this particular area will include an assessment of the needs of the school referred to by the Deputy.The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that, in future, the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties in an area will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Following the consultation process, individual plans will set out the blueprint for schools' development in an area covering a period of up to ten years.I am confident that this approach to school planning will provide a mechanism to ensure that capital funding is allocated in both a structured and a clearly identifiable manner into the future. Most importantly, all of the stakeholders in education will have the opportunity of having their voices heard in the process.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	511	The school referred to by the Deputy was advised of its teacher allocation under the new weighted system on 24 June 2004.An additional 350 teacher posts are being provided to facilitate the introduction of the new system. This system will involve a general weighted allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, SEN, that is, those with borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability, as well as those with learning support needs. In addition, it will continue to allow for individual allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN. The weighted allocation will be made as follows: in the most disadvantaged schools, as per the urban dimension of Giving Children an Even Break, a teacher of pupils with special educational needs will be allocated for every 80 pupils to cater for the subset of pupils with higher-incidence SEN; in all boys schools, the ratio will be one teacher for every 140 pupils; in mixed schools, or all girls schools with an enrolment of greater than 30% boys, one for every 150 pupils; and in all girls schools, including schools with mixed junior classes but with 30% or less boys overall, one for every 200 pupils.The weighted allocation will enable teaching support to be provided to pupils with higher-incidence SEN and learning support needs. This will obviate the need for schools to submit individual applications for pupils in those categories. Schools may continue to apply for specific teacher allocations in respect of pupils with lower-incidence SEN.My Department now proposes to devise school clusters in respect of allocations to be made under the weighted model. Sanction for the filling of posts will be considered in the context of these clusters and the weighted arrangements. In order to facilitate the full introduction of the weighted model from the school year 2005-06, my Department has agreed not to redeploy surplus teachers from full-time posts via the panel redeployment process during the current school year. Schools have been informed, also, that they may retain excess part-time teaching hours to the extent that such hours are required for children with lower-incidence SEN.

I understand that prior to the Houses of the Oireachtas discussing or approving the draft Order, the matter must first be referred to the Joint Committee on Education and Science for its consideration.In the circumstances it is not possible to give a definitive timescale by which date the draft order would be approved but I expect that it will occur in the near future.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Funding to primary schools for secretarial and caretaking services has increased from the €50.79 per pupil that applied in the 2000-01 school year, to €102 per pupil at present. This represents a doubling of the grant over the period.In relation to secondary schools, the support grant that was introduced under the school services support fund was increased from 1 January last and now stands at €131 per pupil. While provision for support services, including secretarial and caretaking, is a particular focus of this fund, schools have discretion, in line with that available in relation to per capita grants, as to how this additional funding is best utilised in the interests of their pupils. This funding support is provided in addition to the provision made to schools for secretaries and caretakers under separate schemes.The question of any further increases in the level of ancillary services grants will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.

The standard rate of capitation grant for primary schools has been increased from €57 in 1997 to €121.58 per pupil from 1 January last, an increase of almost 113%. In the case of secondary schools, the standard per capita grant now amounts to €274 from 1 January last as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. In the case of disadvantaged schools this increase has brought the total per capita grant to €312. In addition, the support grant that was introduced under the school services support initiative, was also increased from 1 January last and now stands at €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school per annum that was approved in December 2001.The question of further increases in the level of capitation grants payable to primary and secondary schools will be considered as part of the normal Estimates process.

Each school management authority is required to organise its teaching timetable and subject options having regard to pupils needs within the limit of its approved teacher allocation.The rules for allocating teaching resources provide that where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department will consider applications for additional short term support.The school concerned applied for curricular concessions for the 2004-05 school year and following consideration of the application, the Department granted 3.26 wholetime equivalent supernumerary posts. In addition, the school has been allocated 5.78 wholetime equivalent posts to cater for the special educational needs of pupils enrolled and .34 wholetime equivalent posts to cater for Traveller pupils enrolled.An independent appeals committee is available to school authorities that wish to appeal the adequacy of their allocations from my Department. This committee comprises three members with relevant experience and expertise in the area of school planning and timetabling. The school in question appealed to this committee and was granted a further wholetime equivalent post. Decisions of the appeals committee are final.

I have not listed any service provided by my Department where the cost of the service has remained unchanged since then.Communications: I have no responsibility for the level of retail prices in the communications and postal sectors. This responsibility falls within the remit of the independent regulator — the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.In relation to broadcasting, I now set the cost of a television licence based on an annual review of RTE's performance in the previous year. The price of a colour television licence increased from €107 in September 2001 to €152 in January 2004, an increase of 42%.Energy: I have no function in relation to the price of electricity or gas. This function in relation to electricity was transferred to the independent regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation, by the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000, and in relation to gas by the Gas (Interim) (Regulation) Act 2002.Inland Fisheries: Various licence fees are set out below. These fees are reinvested in the management of the fisheries by the central and regional fisheries boards. The licence fees were increased from 1 January 2004 to allow for inflation since they were last increased.The commercial salmon, eel and oyster licence duties and the special local licence duties were last increased on 1 January 1988. The salmon, eel and molluscan shellfish dealers' licences duties were last increased on 1 January 1995. All increases were in line with inflation since the last increase, rounded up or down to the nearest €5.Rod licences were last increased on dates specified in brackets, that is, dates in 1988 and in 1992. Rod licences were increased on 1 January 2003 and again on 1 January 2004 in line with inflation.

In the case of the three agencies under the remit of my Department, these plans contain preliminary risk analysis and plans for risk mitigation which take into consideration the impact of all aspects of the decentralisation process, including the potential for significant staff turnover and loss of corporate memory — expertise and business continuity — business efficiency requirements. These plans will continue to evolve in line with developments.My Department is liaising on an ongoing basis with the agencies involved in relation to the decentralisation process and particularly in relation to project management, risk and opportunity assessment and business continuity strategies, including knowledge management. The overall objective for the Department and the agencies in implementing decentralisation is to maintain and enhance standards of service delivery and to realise opportunities for modernisation and business efficiency and effectiveness as part of the process.

In the case of BIM and the CFB, expressions of interest to date are low. Central developments will have a bearing on trends and developments at agency level in the coming months.The decentralisation implementation plans of the three agencies concerned have signalled the potential for significant staff turnover and loss of corporate memory-expertise, particularly as regards technical, professional and expert functions. The mitigation strategies outlined in the plans include knowledge management and transfer to underpin business continuity. These strategies will continue to evolve in the light of developments at the centre.

This is set out in its commitment for the retention of the post office network in the White Paper on rural development. The operational issues relating to individual post offices are a day-to-day operational matter for the company and one in which I have no function. The post office network has been the subject of a number of reviews in recent years in order to facilitate modernisation of the network and to ensure continued provision of post office services in a financially sustainable way.Under an agreement between the Irish Postmasters' Union and An Post, the conversion of sub post offices from a fixed contract to an agency basis, whereby payments are linked to transactions, is being implemented on a voluntary basis. The key requirement, that a service is provided locally, is being met by the new agency arrangement.An Post has secured additional business for the network, including Billpay facilities for the ESB, phone top-ups through its PostPoint service and a contract with the AIB under which the bank's customers can access their accounts through the network.

A passenger ship is a vessel which carries more than 12 passengers. There are approximately 100 passenger ships operating in or to and from the State. With the exception of one vessel, all passenger ships are privately owned and operated.Passenger ship operators covered by the plan are to establish procedures to manage compliance with the plan. The maritime safety directorate of the Department will be consulting further with the operators of passenger ships to lead them in implementing and monitoring the proposed measures. To operate a passenger ship, the operator must have the vessel surveyed annually by a surveyor from the maritime safety directorate to obtain a passenger ship's certificate. During the course of the annual survey the maritime safety directorate will inspect the vessel for compliance with the plan. The surveyors from the maritime safety directorate will undergo appropriate accessibility training to assist them in carrying out their functions in this area.Each port authority at the international ferry ports of Cork, Dublin, Dún Laoghaire and Rosslare will establish procedures to manage compliance with the plan. The Department will establish a scheme to monitor the compliance of port authorities with the plan.

To this end, we will provide considerable investment in radiation oncology facilities in the coming years.Since 1997, under the implementation of the national cancer strategy, there has been a cumulative investment of almost €42 million in cancer services in the South Eastern Health Board. An additional €1.16 million was provided in 2004 to address service pressures in oncology-haematology, including oncology drug treatments. Ten additional consultants have been appointed for cancer services in the South Eastern Health Board since 1997. The board currently has three consultant medical oncologists, the largest complement of consultant medical oncologists in any health board area outside of the eastern region.At a national level, approval was recently granted for over 130 additional staff and full-year revenue funding of €15 million to open the new radiation oncology department in University College Hospital Galway and to expand capacity at Cork University Hospital. There are currently eight linear accelerators nationally and these developments will provide an additional five. Approval has issued for the appointment of an additional five consultant radiation oncologists and recruitment is under way. One of these new consultants will be based at Cork University Hospital and will have significant sessional commitments to Waterford Regional Hospital. This will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term.As recommended in the report, the national radiation oncology co-ordinating group, NROCG, has been established. The group comprises clinical, technical, managerial, academic and nursing expertise from different geographic regions. The group's remit encompasses recommending measures to facilitate improved access to existing and planned services, including transport and accommodation. The group is expected to develop proposals in these important areas. The group will also advise on quality assurance protocols and guidelines for the referral of public patients to private facilities.The NROCG is currently developing a national telesynergy® network for radiation oncology services. The South Eastern Health Board has advised the Department that a telesynergy® system should be installed in Waterford Regional Hospital. Arrangements are now being made to install this technology at the hospital which will enable the hospital to develop improved linkages with Cork University Hospital and St. Luke's Hospital, Dublin and reduce patient and consultant travel time.The Government in its decision last year on radiotherapy services remained open to the provision of a satellite radiation oncology unit in Waterford. We are determined to deliver enhanced services for the whole population as soon as possible. There is unanimity about the urgent need for significantly enhanced services in the major population centres of Dublin, Cork and Galway. I will keep the question of networked satellite locations under active review.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I propose to take Questions Nos. 366 to 368, inclusive, together.Responsibility for the collection and collation of data on waiting lists and waiting times now rests with the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF. The NTPF is working closely with health agencies and individual hospitals to obtain information on patients and the specific procedure required in each case. Currently, the information collected by the NTPF is collected by hospital and specialty rather than by individual consultant. As the NTPF develops into its new role of collecting and reporting data on waiting lists and waiting times I anticipate that it will examine and address the information requirements of general practitioners.Responsibility for the management and monitoring of out-patient waiting lists rests with the individual hospitals and health boards concerned. It is a matter for each hospital to prioritise its services based on patient need and use its available resources to best effect to ensure that patient services are delivered efficiently and effectively.Waiting list figures reported by health agencies to my Department for the period ended December 2003 included approximately 3,000 patients reported to be waiting for medical, as distinct from surgical, specialties. It was not clear what procedure or treatment these patients were awaiting for. The categorisation of these patients is currently under review.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	563	My predecessor announced last month that it is intended that metric speed limits be in place on 20 January 2005. A metrication changeover board is working to that timeframe. In order to facilitate the changeover it is necessary to amend the Road Traffic Acts to provide for the introduction of new speed limit structures expressed in metric values. To that end I intend to progress the passage of the Road Traffic Bill 2004, published on 11 June last, through the Houses of the Oireachtas shortly. The Bill contains proposals to provide for the application of the following default speed limits on public roads: motorway, 120 kph; national roads, 100 kph; non-national roads, 80 kph; and built-up area, 50 kph.In addition, it is proposed that the range of road speed limits should also contain special speed limits in the values of 120, 100, 80, 60, 50 and 30 kph. It is proposed that these special speed limits could be applied in lieu of a default speed limit by local authorities through the making of special speed limit by-laws or, in the case of special speed limits of 100, 80, 60 or 50 kph, by a county or city manager through the making of a road works speed limit order.In the case of the special speed limit of 30 kph, the legislative proposal in the Road Traffic Bill provides that this limit only be applied by local authorities in accordance with guidelines to be issued by me. These special speed limit application guidelines will set out the criteria that local authorities must have regard to in the introduction of the special low speed limit in residential areas, including a requirement that appropriate traffic calming measures are in place.Following the enactment of the proposed new primary legislation, I will advance secondary legislation to prescribe ordinary speed limits, that is, vehicle-related speed limits, in metric values.

The evaluation was carried out by Fitzpatrick Associates, economic consultants, and was commissioned by Area Development Management Limited which manages the RTI on behalf of my Department.This extension of the pilot RTI will allow a more comprehensive appraisal of the effectiveness of the initiative in addressing the transport needs of rural areas, particularly as many of the pilot projects only became fully operational in 2003. While the National Development Plan 2000-2006 proposed a total of €4.4 million for this initiative, some €6 million has already been provided for it in the two year period ended December 2003 and further funding of €3 million is being provided for the RTI in 2004. Decisions relating to the specific level of funding for the RTI next year will be taken in due course as part of the 2005 Estimates process which is currently under way.

The contactless smartcard-based integrated ticketing system will enable a passenger to use a single ticket on one or more public transport services, by road and by rail, irrespective of the transport operator involved.A first step was the launch in April this year, in conjunction with the RPA, of a smartcard ticketing system by a private operator, Morton's Coaches, on its services. Another important step will be the launch soon of smartcards on Luas services. In addition, it is expected that Dublin Bus, Irish Rail-DART and some additional private operators will follow during 2005. In the meantime, tickets using magnet strip technology are available for travel on Dublin Bus and Irish Rail services and the RPA has concluded a similar arrangement with Dublin Bus and Irish Rail in respect of Luas services.

The 1997 survey data is based on the DTO's own survey carried out throughout the greater Dublin area, GDA, while the 2002 data are based on the travel to work and travel to school data in the 2002 census of population.There are some differences between the data gathered in these years. For example, in 1997 the DTO survey included only those travelling by car, bus or rail, while the 2002 census data also includes those walking, cycling and travelling by motorcycle, van or lorry. In addition, while the DTO's 1997 survey was carried out during the period 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., generally the busiest hour on the transport networks, the 2002 census data relates to all journeys to work and school. Using the CSO journey to work and school data, the DTO has provided a best estimate of total 2002 trips in the GDA in the period 8 a.m. to9 a.m. using the stated departure, arrival and journey times of enumerated persons in the GDA.On the basis of its estimate, the DTO breakdown of morning peak hour journeys, 8 a.m. to 9 a.m., in the greater Dublin area in 1997 and in 2002 are as follows:19972002Car181,000280,000Public Transport69,000113,000Total250,000393,000The Deputy should be aware that these data exclude travel under other modes which embrace those walking, cycling, and travelling by motorcycle, van or lorry.

This is a draft consultation document which outlines my Department's proposals in relation to the ongoing development of accessible public transport services for people with mobility and sensory impairments.The plan covers public transport accessibility issues relating to bus and rail public transport, taxi services and airport facilities. It will be reviewed on a periodic basis and amended and updated as necessary to take account of prevailing regulatory, economic and financial conditions and to take account of the impact of changes in transport technology.In the coming days the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, will be given formal responsibility for overseeing the implementation of the action plan. The main mechanisms for supervising and monitoring the commitments under the plan are listed in section 9 of the document. A senior official in the Department has been given specific responsibility for reporting to me on the roll-out of the plan. The commitments in the plan will be included in the Department's next statement of strategy and progress on its implementation will be included in the Department's annual reports. Progress in relation to the implementation of the plan will feature as an agenda item of the Department's management board. The remit of the public transport accessibility committee, established under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness in July 2000, will be extended to include a monitoring role with regard to progress by the agencies under the aegis of the Department in implementing the plan.My Department has in place service level agreements with the CIE companies which link performance standards and quality of services with subvention payments and capital grants made by the Department to the companies. It is proposed to extend the range of performance targets to include the provisions of this plan, in so far as they pertain to the companies' areas of responsibility.In addition, Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath, Iarnród Éireann and the Railway Procurement Agency have each appointed a senior management executive with responsibility for accessibility matters. Each of these officials will be responsible for delivering on the commitments contained in this plan in respect of the company concerned and for reporting to, and liaising with, my Department in relation to all transport accessibility matters. I understand that Connex Transport Ireland Limited will also appoint a senior official with responsibility for accessibility matters in respect of the operation of Luas.My Department will continue to monitor and review public transport accessibility developments at the State and regional airports. The process of making taxis wheelchair accessible is being addressed by the Commission for Taxi Regulation which was recently established under the provisions of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003.

Under the 1956 Act, all lotteries are unlawful except those which are specifically permitted. Furthermore, under section 22 of the Act, publication of any notice or announcement concerning a lottery, other than announcement of the results of a lawfully conducted lottery, is prohibited. The investigation of specific complaints in relation to breaches of the law is a matter for the Garda Síochána in the first instance.Some prize-winning schemes use premium rate services to generate revenue. In those cases, the prior authorisation of Regtel, Regulator of Premium Rate Telecommunications Services Limited, must be obtained in advance and its code of practice must be complied with.The recommendations of the report of the interdepartmental review group on the review of the Gaming and Lotteries Acts 1956-86, published in June 2000, including those with regard to the conduct of various categories of lottery, are being examined in my Department in light of the proposed legislation to amend and update the Gaming and Lotteries Acts.

The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and, indeed, to support capital developments in the private child care sector. Area Development Management Limited, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering more than 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner, as must grant approvals, to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. This has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which exceeds €30 million. Some €25 million of this is being earmarked for community-based not-for-profit child care groups which provide services for young children in order to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by Area Development Management Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.I have made enquiries and I understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process to which I have just referred. I understand that the recommendations in relation to the allocation of the remaining funding are in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight timeframe. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it may be considered again should additional capital resources become available and if the project has adequately demonstrated that it would merit funding under the programme during the review process. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing work-force will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this particular capital grant application.

These include whether it is reasonable in all the circumstances to conclude that the applicant's stated purpose is the true purpose of the visit and that the applicant will fully honour the conditions of the visa, for example, is unlikely to overstay the length of time applied for or to work without a work permit.The visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in their country of origin, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of remaining in the State. Credibility is central to the visa determination process. Not surprisingly, inconsistencies or omissions on the face of an application can cause the visa officer to conclude that it is not reasonable in the circumstances to grant a visa. The Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. Common examples of previous abuse include individuals who although granted a visa to come on short visits overstayed with a view to establishing themselves permanently in the State, and groups of persons who avail of organised events for the purpose of gaining entry to the State for other purposes.The applications in question were refused because the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied, on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department, that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed evidence of their obligations to return home following their proposed visit. It was also noted that a number of the applicants were under age. However, no evidence was submitted to establish that their parents had consented to them travelling to the State.The Irish sports club sponsoring the applications submitted a letter of appeal on behalf of the applicants. The visa appeals officer, however, formed the opinion that it would not be reasonable to conclude that the applicants would observe the conditions attached to the visas, and the decision to refuse the applications was upheld.

Best practice includes the prevention of drugs being introduced into or used in prisons and this is reflected in the commitment in the Government programme to end, in particular, heroin use in prison and to introduce compulsory drug testing for prisoners where appropriate.In addition, it is policy to provide treatment and rehabilitation for drug users and the Irish Prison Service has been engaged for a considerable period in a process aimed at ensuring access to appropriate health care, including drug treatment, for the considerable number of prisoners at risk due to their substance misuse. In this regard, the Irish Prison Service has actively sought to directly involve community health agencies, both statutory and voluntary, in these developments. There is an ongoing process of providing prisoners with information regarding the risks and education on appropriate prevention strategies.There has been a considerable expansion in the availability of methadone maintenance to prisoners who have been in receipt of this treatment from community agencies at the time of committal. It is intended to further expand the availability of appropriate services throughout the prison system.For many years past, prisoners with a diagnosis of HIV, hepatitis, or other infectious diseases have continued to receive medical treatment while in custody in line with clinical recommendations. This medical treatment is generally in line with that available in the community. It has been long-standing practice to refer prisoners suffering from infectious diseases to specialist hospital services and to act on the basis of the clinical advice received. All such treatment is provided on the basis of informed consent and prisoners are free to refuse treatment, though instances of refusal are rare.To accommodate the Government's policy on drugs-free prisons, appropriate new prison rules are near completion and the Government's policy on illegal drugs use in prison will be published by the end of 2004. It is my intention that early in the new year the Irish Prison Service will implement our new strategy of mandatory drug-testing, addiction counselling and treatment, increased measures to prevent drug usage, and a genuine system of rehabilitation.

Having considered the matter carefully, I was satisfied that the person concerned would not normally be resident in this jurisdiction were it not for his imprisonment in the United Kingdom and, as such, I was not prepared to consent to his transfer to a prison in this country at this time. The individual concerned has recently appealed the decision and I expect to make a decision on his appeal, taking into account all the information received in the case, in the near future.It should be noted that the convention does not confer an automatic right on any prisoner to be transferred, nor does it confer an obligation on any state to comply with a transfer request.

As members of the Garda Síochána have not been exclusively deployed on policing yellow boxes specifically for the Luas line, costs cannot be quantified in this matter.I am further informed that personnel engaged in the city centre initiative and Operation Artery have been given instructions to put greater emphasis on the area of policing of box junctions, as the obstruction of same leads to substantial delays in the movement of traffic, both public transport and private. The same emphasis applies to box junctions on the Luas line. This operation is part of the general traffic operation plan for the Dublin metropolitan region, which aims to maximise the free movement of traffic in as far as is possible.With regard to the question of the RPA, I am informed that the Garda Síochána has no contract with the RPA, or with the company referred to by the Deputy. No funds have been charged to or recouped by the regional traffic division with respect to the operator of the Luas or the RPA.

The project will repeal many pre-1922 statutes, the earliest of which date back to the 13th century, and replace them, where necessary, with a modern law of property that will meet the needs of the 21st century.  It is intended that the project will simplify the law, and improve its presentation, in order to make it easily understood and accessible for practitioners and the public alike; update the law to accommodate changing social, demographic and economic needs, for example, new forms of property ownership; and make the conveyancing of property easier and faster with a view to reducing costs and delays.The functions of the registries are to provide a secure, reliable and effective legal system for registering property ownership and so enable property and related financial transactions to take place in confidence. While the Land Registry provides a state guaranteed title to property, the Registry of Deeds caters for property the title to which is not registered in the Land Registry. Both systems are mutually exclusive.Both the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds are undergoing a process of modernisation. The Government legislation programme which was published on 28 September 2004, makes provision for the publication of a Bill, entitled the Registration of Deeds and Title Bill, which will facilitate digital mapping and the registration of records on computer in the Land Registry and the Registry of Deeds.

Should a further application for grant assistance be received, it will undergo a thorough assessment and appraisal to ensure it meets the criteria of the programme. On completion of the assessment process, it will be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, for a funding recommendation before I make a final decision on the application.It would only be fair to point out, however, that there has been a high level of demand for capital grant assistance under the present strand of the programme. As a result, any capital application received at this stage might well have to await a further stream of funding unless it can clearly show that it is addressing a significant gap in service availability.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I understand from enquiries I have made that an application from this group for a substantial capital grant of over €1.3 million was submitted in January 2004.The equal opportunities child care programme 2000-06 is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. The progress of the programme was commented upon very favourably by the mid-term evaluators of both the regional operational programmes and the National Development Plan 2000-2006 and, following the mid-term review, additional funding of approximately €12 million was made available for the child care measures. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €449.3 million.There has been considerable demand from community-based groups for capital grant assistance under the programme and every county has benefited significantly from grants to provide new and enhanced community-based child care facilities and, indeed, to support capital developments in the private child care sector. Area Development Management Limited, on behalf of my Department, is currently carrying out an extensive review of the programme's capital commitments to date, numbering over 1,100 and at a value of €114 million, to ensure that all the grant commitments previously entered into will be realised. Projects may be awaiting planning permission or the completion of tender processes before reasonable assurance can be taken that they will proceed and, if they do not, the funding set aside can be decommitted and made available to another project. Expenditure under the programme covers the period to the end of 2007 and must take place in a planned manner, as must grant approvals, to ensure that the programme can meet its financial commitments at all times.In addition, my Department has recently reviewed the different budget lines under the EOCP, including the capital programme, to ensure that the most effective use is made of all remaining funding in accordance with the programme's objectives. This has brought to €157 million the total allocation for the capital development of child care under the present programme. At the same time, an extensive review of child care provision on the ground has taken place to identify obvious service gaps, the filling of which will be a priority using the remaining capital funding which currently exceeds €30 million. Some €25 million of this is being earmarked for community-based not-for-profit childcare groups which provide services for young children in order to support their parents who may be in employment, education and training.I intend to allocate the remaining capital funding under this strand of the Government's commitment to child care to address the most immediate service gaps. As a result, all the projects in the pipeline on 30 April 2004 have been reviewed again by Area Development Management Limited on the basis of geographical need, the range of services being offered, value for money and the capacity of the groups to complete a project before the end of the programme in 2007. Those projects which best meet the criteria will receive priority funding from the capital funding which remains unallocated at this point.I have made inquiries and I understand that the application for capital grant assistance in respect of this project has been reviewed as part of the review process I have just referred to. I understand that the recommendations with regard to the allocation of the remaining funding are currently in preparation. If a project is recommended for funding as part of this process, its recommendation will be conditional upon its being able to establish that it can be completed within a fixed budget and a tight timeframe. If a project is not recommended for priority funding at this time, it will be considered again should additional capital resources become available. The allocation of any additional funding which might become available to me will also be allocated on the basis of local need, levels of service being offered and value for money.I do not doubt but that the success of the present strand of the programme and the need to continue to make child care available to support the child care needs of our still growing workforce will support my case for ongoing capital and current funding from Government for this key sector. Indeed, should any additional funding become available before the end of the present national development plan, I would expect that the programme would again benefit from transfers.In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this capital grant application.

Two community gardaí are assigned to the Clonliffe and Ballybough areas. The area is covered on a regular and ongoing basis by mobile and foot patrols by both plain clothes and uniformed gardaí. In addition, divisional mobile units also pay regular attention to the areas concerned.Local Garda management held a meeting with the residents of the area on 28 September at the Tivioli Centre to discuss this issue, among others. Approximately 200 residents attended this meeting. Local Garda management addressed the meeting and assured the residents that Garda resources and a higher Garda visibility would be directed to the areas concerned.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Fitzgibbon Street Garda station will be fully considered within the overall context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country.

Two of her minor children, sons, subsequently entered the State on 31 October 2000 and 30 January 2001 respectively. These minors were considered as part of their mother's application. Following an interview on 1 February 2001 by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, she was refused refugee status in the State. She was notified of this refusal on 25 April 2001 and subsequently appealed this determination to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Following an oral hearing on 3 October 2001, her appeal was rejected and the original determination affirmed. She was informed of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal decision on 26 October 2001.In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed on 29 November 2001 that it was proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her and her children and she was given the following options: to make written representations within 15 working days to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons as to why she should not be deported; to voluntarily leave the State; or to consent to deportation. An application for leave to remain in the State was received from her legal representatives on 19 December 2001.Following consideration of the case under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement), deportation orders were signed on 26 August 2004 in respect of the woman concerned and her two children. Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, requires the Minister to consider 11 factors, including representations received by or on behalf of the person, family and domestic circumstances, employment prospects, and so on, in deciding whether to make a deportation order. Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement) requires the Minister to satisfy himself as to the safety of returning a person before making a deportation order. I am satisfied that all the above requirements were met in arriving at the decision to make deportation orders in respect of this family.The enforcement of the deportation orders is a matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	595	On 31 August 2004 the number of people awaiting an appointment with a solicitor at Kilkenny Law Centre was 98 and the person who is longest on the waiting list has waited seven and a half months. At Newbridge Law Centre there are 243 people awaiting an appointment with a solicitor and the person who is longest on the waiting list has waited 16 months.The Legal Aid Board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network and where waiting times at a law centre, for whatever reason, become excessive, the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action.The board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example, domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priority treatment is necessary to ensure that persons subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with a speedy service. It is important to note that in 2003, priority appointments offered by law centres represented approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status.With regard to the allocation of resources, the level of resources provided to the Legal Aid Board has increased significantly in recent years. For example, in 1997 the grant-in-aid available to the board was €10.656 million. The 2004 figure of €18.388 million represents an increase of almost 73% during this period and I would expect that the funding for the board will be further increased in 2005.

The decision to deport was taken after the woman's case had been fully considered in the context of the Refugee Act 1996 and the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. The woman presented herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the afternoon prior to her deportation without her Irish born child whose whereabouts she refused to reveal. She was accompanied back to her home by gardaí to collect her belongings but still refused to say where her Irish born child was. It was decided that, in the circumstances, the deportation would proceed without the child.It is a matter for parents of a child who is not liable to be deported to make a decision with regard to the welfare of that child if they themselves are deported. Ordinarily, parents have a duty as well as a right to provide properly for their children's upbringing and this duty is recognised by the Constitution. If parents acting in good faith leave their children in the care and custody of another appropriate person, the State will not interfere with those arrangements so long as the decision does not amount to a failure in the duty towards their child, which would justify State intervention.

At the end of their term of appointment, their membership of the committee automatically lapses but they may be either re-appointed for a further term or replaced by new members.The information requested by the Deputy as to whether a member of a visiting committee has ever been removed would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort to research and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources. However, I am not aware of any visiting committee member being removed, without their consent, before their period of appointment has expired, in recent years. The removal of any visiting committee member would involve legal consultation with the Office of the Attorney General as each such case would depend on its individual circumstances.

I approved one of the applications and refused the remaining six.The persons whose applications were refused lodged a request under the Freedom of Information Act on 23 January 2003 for copies of their case files and the reasons for the refusal of their applications. It was the policy in my Department at that time not to release the reasons for decisions on applications for naturalisation. This policy was based on legal advice received from the Attorney General in 1998. In keeping with that policy, copies of the case files were released but the reasons for the refusal of the applications were not.On 22 May 2003, the Information Commissioner decided, on the basis of an appeal to his office by a particular individual whose application for naturalisation had been refused, that section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, which requires the giving of reasons by the head of a body for any act of that body, comprehended the naturalisation process. Having obtained further legal advice, I decided not to appeal against the Information Commissioner's decision and since late 2003, requests under section 18 for the reasons for my decisions in naturalisation cases have been processed in accordance with the provisions of that Act.It is open to the individuals concerned to make a fresh request under section 18 of the Freedom of Information Act to my Department's freedom of information officer. Any such request will be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of that Act.

The launch involved seven Ministers with direct responsibility for the various elements of the strategy.The strategy has been advanced by a cross-departmental group of senior officials reporting to the Cabinet committee and comprises four elements: the Disability Bill 2004, which is the direct responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Fahey, Minister of State with responsibility for disability equality in my Department; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; six outline sectoral plans which are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, Transport, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I understand that each of these Ministers will respond to a similar question to this one in the House in the coming weeks and a commitment to a multi-annual investment programme for disability support services will be announced as part of the Estimates and budgetary process.My Department has overall responsibility for the Disability Bill. It is intended to take Second and Subsequent Stages of the Bill as soon as Dáil time can be arranged. I understand that the Minister of State, Deputy Fahey, will meet the disability legislation consultation group, as promised, in the coming weeks to hear its views on the Bill.Implementation of the provisions on independent assessment of need, service statements and redress in the Bill come within the remit of the Department of Health and Children. The chair of the interim health service executive has established a dedicated group within the interim executive to address transition issues with regard to services for people with disabilities. That group has been asked to also examine the steps to be taken to address requirements arising in the Disability Bill.The preparation of the strategy has been guided by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. The committee will continue in its role as the elements of the strategy are being put in place.

The results of this should be available early in 2005, following which the question of designation will be determined.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	613	Council Directive 91/676/EEC, commonly known as the nitrates directive, has been implemented in Ireland by way of extensive monitoring of nitrate levels in waters, the assessment of the tropic status of waters, the development and dissemination in 1996 of a code of good agricultural practice to protect waters from pollution by nitrates and a range of other measures which operate to protect water quality from pollution by agricultural sources.These other measures include the provision of funding under schemes administered by the Department of Agriculture and Food, DAF, such as the control of farmyard pollution scheme, the rural environment protection scheme and the farm waste management scheme to support expenditure by farmers in meeting measures for pollution control and environmental protection standards. They also include bye-laws made by local authorities under the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts, a wide range of implementation and enforcement actions taken by local authorities under those Acts, the progressive extension of the integrated pollution control licensing system operated by the EPA to apply to a wider range of intensive agricultural activities and the introduction of requirements for compliance with good farming practice in the context of EU-funded direct payments to farmers under agri-assistance schemes administered by the DAF. Under the single farm payment scheme, which will replace a number of existing direct payment schemes from January 2005, farmers will be required to comply with a number of EU legislative provisions including the nitrates directive.Extensive discussions with the main farming organisations and other interests have taken place since December 2001 as to the further implementation of the nitrates directive. In February 2002, my Department issued an information paper on good agricultural practice and protection of the environment which set out the background issues and the preferred approach of applying an action programme to all areas rather than to designated vulnerable zones. Consistent with the approach set out in the paper, the European Communities (Protection of Waters Against Pollution from Agricultural Sources) Regulations 2003 identified the whole territory of Ireland as the area to which an action programme will be developed and applied for the purposes of the nitrates directive.A draft national action programme for further implementation of the directive was prepared by my Department, jointly with DAF and in consultation with Teagasc, and was issued for consultation on 19 December 2003. Some 70 submissions were received from interested parties and a revised draft was prepared having regard to the submissions received. The revised draft was made available on 9 July 2004 to interested parties in a second round of consultation. An independent adviser was appointed to consider the comments received and report with recommendations regarding the provisions of the draft programme.I understand 50 submissions have been received and I hope to receive the report and recommendations of the independent adviser shortly. The draft action programme will then be revised as necessary and submitted to the European Commission. However, it would be inappropriate for me to indicate whether or not any particular amendment might be made to the draft action programme pending receipt of the independent adviser's report. The action programme will be implemented on a phased basis with effect from 1 January 2005 and will operate for a period of four years.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	617	Group water schemes are owned by the group members and all matters relating to the operation and management of schemes, including the setting and collection of members' contributions, are the responsibility of the group itself.The national rural water monitoring committee has compiled a charter of rights and responsibilities for the group scheme sector which sets out, inter alia, consumers’ rights on a supply of water, the right to information and a procedure for dealing with complaints. The charter states that a group scheme should not disconnect a water supply to a member save only where a serious and continued breach of the scheme’s own rules is occurring.The National Federation of Group Water Schemes encourages all group schemes to formally adopt the charter. In addition, my Department stipulates it as a condition of obtaining subsidy towards the operational cost of schemes that groups should have accepted the charter.Following the letter referred to in the question my Department was in touch with the federation and received an assurance that the position regarding necessitous cases will be addressed in the context of the federation's management and development training programme for group water schemes.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I understand that this scheme is being advanced by South Tipperary County Council under the rural water programme. Responsibility for the administration of this programme was devolved to the local authorities in 1997. Under the devolved arrangements, the prioritisation and approval of schemes for construction is a matter for each local authority, subject to overall block grant allocation from my Department. Information on the current status of the scheme may appropriately be sought from the county council.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	621	In April, 2004 grant assistance totalling €2.024 million was approved by my Department for the provision of recycling facilities at Waller's Lot, Cashel, the total cost of which is estimated at approximately €3.7 million, and this funding will be available to the local authority as soon as it is in a position to draw it down. The local authority has also sought approval to borrow the balance of the cost. This application must be considered within the framework of the overall borrowing limit for the local authority sector and on that basis it has not yet been possible to grant approval for the loan. This position is being kept under review.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	623	All local authorities required to do so have adopted, and are in the process of implementing, five-year Traveller accommodation programmes, under the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998. These programmes, covering the period 2000 to 2004, estimated that, nationally, 3,785 units of accommodation would be required during the programmes to meet the then existing need and the additional need of 1,684 units of accommodation arising due to new family formations and other factors. Information from the most recent assessment of housing needs published by my Department in December 2002 indicated that this level of additional requirement was not arising.Under their five-year Traveller accommodation programmes local authorities provide accommodation for Travellers in Traveller specific accommodation such as group houses and halting site bays and in standard social housing. Local authorities also assist Travellers in providing their own accommodation through the shared ownership and tenant purchase schemes as well as the house purchase loan scheme and the special Traveller house purchase grant.The 1998 Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 does not require annual targets to be included in the accommodation programmes. The local authority Traveller programmes did not include such targets or a detailed breakdown of the number of units of accommodation which would be required under the various types of accommodation.The following table sets out a breakdown of the accommodation provided at the end of the first four years of the accommodation programmes 2000 to 2003. In that period, local authorities have provided, or assisted in the provision of, permanent accommodation for an additional 1,369 Traveller families. This includes an additional 487 families in Traveller specific accommodation, 681 families in standard social housing and 201 families in accommodation provided by Travellers themselves with the assistance of local authorities.Local authorities are currently preparing new accommodation programmes to cover the period 2005 to 2008. They have been directed to set annual targets in these programmes for the number and type of accommodation to be delivered for each of the four years of the programmes, across all accommodation types including group housing, halting site bays and transient sites as well as standard social housing. Local authorities are also required to set out annual targets for the refurbishment of Traveller specific accommodation during the programmes.The Local Government Act 2001 includes a provision enabling the Minister to reduce or withhold any grant or any other money due or otherwise payable to a local authority where it has failed or substantially failed to comply with a statutory duty. While there are no proposals, at this stage, to have recourse to this power in relation to the provision of Traveller accommodation, this matter will be kept under consideration in the light of the achievement by the local authorities of the targets set under the new accommodation programmes now being prepared.Local AuthorityGross Demand (Units)No. of Units Provided 2000-2003ShortfallCarlow Co.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I refer to the national waste database reports for 1998 and 2001 published by the EPA, which contain the latest official data on the volume and share of recycling by sectoral source. In addition, the EPA, in its interim waste database report for 2002, published recently, noted a slowdown in the generation of municipal waste, which grew by less than 1% in 2002, together with a 4.5% decrease in the amount of waste going to landfill.The EPA also reported that the recycling of municipal waste has accelerated to almost 21%, representing an 8% increase over the 2001 position. These figures indicate that significant progress is being made towards increased recycling, for which a target 35% recycling of municipal waste has been set for 2013. Packaging waste recycling, at 33% in 2002, is up 7.7% on the 2001 level which indicates that Ireland is on course to attain the 50% recycling target for this waste stream set for end 2005.The aforementioned reports are available in the Oireachtas Library.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	626	Section 15 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997 authorises certain exchanges of information in relation to persons seeking housing who may have been engaged in anti-social behaviour. These exchanges are permitted between specified agencies: housing authorities, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Siochána, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, health boards and approved voluntary housing bodies.These provisions do not apply to private landlords. The relevant departmental circular to local authorities recommends that information about tenants should only be provided to a private landlord through the tenants themselves and with their consent.

A copy of the sectoral plan addressing national objectives and guidelines for access to local authority services and built facilities, as well as to heritage sites managed by my Department has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.I will establish a monitoring committee in accordance with section 46 of the Disability Bill when enacted, to monitor and support compliance with its requirements regarding the employment of people with disabilities in public bodies for which I am responsible.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I propose to take Questions Nos. 464 to 466, inclusive, together.As the Deputies may be aware, the National Advisory Committee on Drugs, NACD, produced a report last May entitled Review of Harm Reduction Approaches to Minimising the Sharing of Equipment Used to Administer Drugs.Arising from the report, the NACD recommended that service provision for drug users in prison should mirror the range of treatment and harm reduction approaches which are available in the community. In this regard, the Government has been developing drugs services in prison, including methadone maintenance, over recent years. However, full implementation of this recommendation, in particular with regard to needle exchange, obviously poses serious issues within a prison environment and will have to be very carefully examined.I would also like to point out that the national drugs strategy 2001-08 sets out a number of actions to be fulfilled by the Prison Service, including actions 21 and 22. These actions provide for the implementation of proposals designed to end heroin use in prisons during the period of the strategy and for the expansion of prison-based treatment and rehabilitation programmes. Progress is being made on the implementation of both of these actions.Policy regarding drug misuse in prisons is a matter for my colleague, Deputy McDowell, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

The Deputy will appreciate that, in the case of this country, there are constitutional considerations regarding private property which do not apply in the UK. I have no proposals, at present, to introduce such legislation here.The recent Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution report on the provisions of Articles 40.3.2° and Article 43 of the Constitution with regard to private property rights considered this issue. The report of the committee included a recommendation to establish a countryside recreation council. The committee recommended an approach along the lines of the Northern Ireland model, where the countryside access and activities network was established. It was felt that such an approach could help encourage joint tourism projects as well as avoid the heavy mapping costs, which were incurred during the approach taken in England and Wales.In view of concerns in this area, in February 2004 I established Comhairle na Tuaithe which includes representatives of farmers and landowners, recreational users of the countryside, tourism marketing bodies, the Heritage Council and the Irish Sports Council.The aims and objectives of Comhairle na Tuaithe are to ensure that all those with an interest and concern in the sustainable development and proper management of the recreational amenities of the countryside are fully consulted on their future management; to develop and update, as necessary, a national countryside recreation strategy; to ensure that all means necessary are used to resolve conflicts that arise in relation to access issues and responsible enjoyment of the countryside; to raise awareness of the benefits to and responsibilities of recreational use of the countryside and to carry out research and training on related issues; and to allow the benefits and management of increased leisure use to be studied closely.The work plan of Comhairle na Tuaithe for its first year involves the following outputs: a seminar on its work; preparation of a national countryside recreation strategy; mechanisms for conflict resolution in relation to access issues and responsible enjoyment of the countryside; and a countryside code.Comhairle na Tuaithe is now preparing for a national seminar to be held in November to promote and develop its work and to identify key mechanisms and processes to achieving progress. I am hopeful that the approach outlined to help bring about a solution through a community based approach will point the way forward. I believe, given our general partnership approach to solving problems, that it is the correct way to proceed.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-10-05 00:00:00	Prelude	630	An Agreed Programme for Government contains a commitment to reform charities law. Responsibility for delivery on that commitment was assigned to my Department.I launched a public consultation in February of this year. The reference document for the public consultation was a Government-approved consultation paper on establishing a modern statutory framework for charities.The 85 submissions which were received in response to the public consultation comprised an overall broad endorsement of the proposals contained in the consultation paper. This positive reaction, in confirming how the way forward should be charted, will inform the development of the draft legislation.An external report on the public consultation was published on 27 September 2004. It can be accessed on my Department's charities regulation webpage at http://www.pobail.ie/en/CharitiesRegulation/.

Similarly, people who live in Northern Ireland who hold a concessionary travel pass can travel free within the North.Under the special cross-Border arrangements, in place since 1995, both southern and northern pass holders can undertake cross-Border journeys free of charge.The introduction of free travel on an all-Ireland basis would enhance the existing arrangements by enabling southern pass holders to make free onward journeys within the North. Similarly, Northern Ireland pass holders would be able to make internal journeys within the South free of charge.There are a number of technical and financial issues to be resolved in order to implement an enhanced all-Ireland free travel system on these lines. These issues will require co-operation between my Department and the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland as well as the participation of the relevant northern and southern transport operator companies.My predecessor, Deputy Coughlan, met the Minister of State at the Department for Regional Development in Northern Ireland last month to discuss enhancements to the cross-Border free travel scheme and to explore the potential for co-operation between our Departments. The discussions addressed options for co-funding the scheme and certain technical issues. I hope to be in a position to make further progress on this matter at an early date.

This came into effect on 1 July 1997.While powers exist to allow health boards to refuse a rent supplement to persons who are either evicted or excluded from local authority housing due to anti social activity, a health board may, having considered the circumstances of each individual case, provide assistance where, in the opinion of the board, the circumstances of the particular case so warrant.Where a local authority tenant is evicted for anti-social behaviour the health board normally liaises with the local authority to assess the most suitable solution to address the person's accommodation needs.

A central section, which manages the website, implements the requests for changes and updates from the scheme sections and these are implemented on a daily basis. Procedures are in place to ensure that website content is kept accurate and relevant and to remove all out-of-date material in a timely fashion. As an example of the timeliness of the content, press releases are posted on the website as soon as they are issued by the Department's press office.

However, 27,229 applications for rent supplement were awarded since the end of January when the new measures came into effect. This figure includes first time applicants as well as people who move to new accommodation.The impact of the measures is being closely monitored. In addition to ongoing contacts between my Department and the health boards, a working group was established under the Sustaining Progress agreement, to facilitate engagement with the social partners with regard to monitoring the impact of the changes to the scheme. The working group, which was chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, included representatives from ICTU and the community and voluntary pillar as well as my Department and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.A study of 498 randomly selected rent supplement applications which were refused since the measures came into effect in January 2004 found that only 11% of the refusals were because of the new measures and many of these cases would have been refused in any event. The group concluded that, based on the examination of the sample cases and discussions with community welfare officers, the new measures were not having any significant, adverse impacts having regard to the design of the measures, including the operation of the appropriate levels of discretion by the community welfare officers.

These schemes included lone parents allowance, deserted wife's benefit and the non-contributory widow and widower's pension for those with dependent children.The scheme is based on the contingency of lone parenthood and the need for social welfare support for parents with children where a person has not secured adequate, or any maintenance from the spouse or the other parent.To qualify for one-parent family payment, a person must have the main care and charge of a child. Generally speaking, this means that the person must show that the child spends the greater amount of time, weekly, with the applicant. Under current legislation, one-parent family payment is not payable where a couple have joint equal custody of a child.My Department's statement of strategy includes a commitment to review the income support arrangements for lone parents. Account will be taken in the review of the research carried out to date, along with policies and programmes pursued in other countries in this area. The appropriate arrangements to deal with joint custody cases will be considered in that context.

She applied for an old age non-contributory pension in her own right in August 2004. Following assessment of her means she was awarded this pension at the maximum personal rate of €154 per week with effect from Friday, 1 October 2004, the first payment date following her 66th birthday. The husband of the person concerned has been requested by my Department to return his pension book for adjustment of the rate of payment so that new payable order books can be issued to each of them at their local post office.

The person concerned was in receipt of unemployment assistance from 27 June 2003 to 28 September 2004. Following a review, a deciding officer disallowed the unemployment assistance claim of the person concerned from 29 September 2004 on the grounds that he is not genuinely seeking employment.The person concerned has appealed this decision and his case is being sent to the social welfare appeals office for determination. It is open to the person concerned, if his means are insufficient to meet his needs, to contact his local community welfare officer, regarding assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme.Under social welfare legislation, decisions on claims must be made by deciding officers and appeals officers. These officers are statutorily appointed and I have no role in regard to making such decisions.

My Department will play an important role in that strategy through the enactment of the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 and through the Department's sectoral plan under the Disability Bill 2004.The primary purpose of the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004 is to facilitate the introduction of a new personal advocacy service for people with disabilities which will be administered by the national information agency, Comhairle. Under the provisions of the Bill, this new service will provide for the assignment of a personal advocate to a person with a disability who is unable or who has difficulty in obtaining a social service without the assistance or support of the personal advocate. The main function of the personal advocate will be to assist, support and represent the person with a disability in applying for and obtaining a social service and also in pursuing any right of review or appeal in connection with that service.The sectoral plans to be drawn up by six Ministers under the provisions of the Disability Bill 2004 form an integral part of the national disability strategy. Under those plans, the relevant Ministers will set out service provision for people with disabilities, the measures to facilitate access to these services and the planned improvements.The Department's sectoral plan was published in outline or draft form in order to allow a period of consultation and discussion with relevant interests before the plan is finalised and laid before the Dáil for approval. The objective of the outline sectoral plan is to ensure that, as far as is practicable, schemes and services provided to people with disabilities operate in a manner which facilitates their full participation in society and meets the mainstreaming principle of the equality agenda.The outline sectoral plan draws on the Department's statement of strategy 2003-05, entitled Promoting a Caring Society, which provides the framework for progressing and developing its services to all its customers within the timeframe of the statement. It gives a brief description of the range of schemes and services designed to meet the income support needs of people with disabilities and covers a range of issues including performance standards for claim processing, supports for people with disabilities to return to work or education, consultative processes designed to proactively seek the views of people with disabilities, physical access to departmental premises, specific measures for visually or hearing impaired customers and the role of Comhairle in meeting the needs of people with disabilities, including the new personal advocacy service to be provided under the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004.The position of people with disabilities will be improved significantly through the introduction of the new personal advocacy service provided for under the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004. In addition, the Department's sectoral plan will provide a focus for the future development of services for people with disabilities coming within the Department's remit and such a focus will become a regular feature of Departmental reporting on its activities and improvements planned for the future.
