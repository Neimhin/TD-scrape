#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	0	The Ryan report implementation plan committed to the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers.  Some 200 of these new posts were in place by the end of 2010, in addition to the backfilling of other vacancies which occurred.An additional 60 social workers are due to be recruited by the HSE in 2011.  These posts are at various stages in the recruitment process.  Last week, in reviewing its overall approach to recruitment, the HSE prioritised some key development posts and decided to process the recruitment of these staff with a view to their taking up employment before the end of the year.  I am pleased to advise the House that the 60 additional social workers have all been prioritised and included in this category of staff to be recruited by year end.  This means that the HSE will be in a position to finalise recruitment of the additional social workers between now and the end of the year.The House will be aware that in addition to the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers, the Ryan report implementation plan also contained commitments to place Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  My Department is finalising legislation to this effect and I am confident that the ongoing recruitment will provide a very sound basis for supporting Children First on a statutory footing.  The additional social workers will be targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to the overall assessment of workloads by the national director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and his team and to support the change programme for children's services which is under way within the HSE and is being managed by its national director.  This change agenda seeks to deliver the best outcomes for children and families through achieving a service delivery model that will address a multi-agency approach to managing the child welfare and protection system; a nationwide consistency of approach in practice; the implementation of Children First guidelines and children welfare protection services generally; the use of standardised definitions, criteria and thresholds for reporting and referrals, including the prioritisation of cases, which varied before; the launch last week of a child welfare and protection handbook for HSE staff and the commencement of training courses for staff, including joint training with the Garda; greater reliance on real-time data on social work referrals and alternative care collated through HSE performance management indicators; the ongoing development of the national child care information system; improved resource allocation responsive to changing needs; and clearer management and budget accountability.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThis reform agenda will lead to a new child and family support agency, which will provide the dedicated focus on child protection.  The implementation of these reforms will allow for the best possible services to be delivered within the resources available.

We all know the importance of increasing the number of social workers to ensure some of the past weaknesses in the care system are addressed.  Following on from the Ryan report, as the Minister pointed out, a commitment was made and additional funding provided to hire 260 additional social worker posts.  In her reply, the Minister stated these positions were prioritised last week.  Does that mean that up until last week these positions were not prioritised?  How many positions remain to be filled out of the 60 for the remainder of the year?  Was the public sector recruitment embargo applied to those positions up until last week?  Was the Minister waiting for clearance from the Government before she could proceed with them?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	2	No, they are at various stages in the HSE recruitment processes.  As the Deputy knows, the commitment is to have these social workers in place by the year's end.  Other recruitments have been going on too.  Up to 168 additional social workers new to the HSE were recruited up to the beginning of September 2011.This process is being managed by Gordon Jeyes, national director for children and family services.  The reason I outlined the change programme in place is because he is managing the best allocation of various posts, given the situation in which he finds himself.  The appointments were always a priority and the process was ongoing in the HSE.  Some have had contracts issued, posts have been accepted awaiting clearance and others are at various other stages of the recruitment process.  It must be noted social workers have been excluded from the public service recruitment embargo.

My question specifically asked for numbers and the stages they were at in the recruitment process.  It is important the Dáil is given an update as to the exact numbers at each stage.The Minister stated 168 additional social workers have been recruited.  Up to 260 were supposed to be recruited, 200 last year and 60 this year.  Have only 168 social workers been appointed so far?  In an earlier reply I received from the Minister, I was informed 200 had been hired last year?  Have we in fact fallen back in this regard?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	4	No, the 200 figure remains for 2010.  At the beginning of 2011, 168 additional social workers new to the HSE had been recruited.  The 200 figure stands, but the other figure relates to people who are new to the HSE.  The plan is for all social workers to be in place — the 200, the 60 and the backfilling of places — by the end of this year.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Perhaps the Deputy will get the information.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	9	In July, I launched the revised Children First: National Guidelines for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  The guidelines deal with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  They emphasise the need to safeguard and protect children, that the safety and welfare of children are everyone's responsibility and that children will have safer lives where everyone is attentive to their well being.  People who work with children across a range of areas must be clear in understanding their responsibility for safe practice and the reporting of concerns.It is important to recognise that the original Children First guidelines have been in place for more than a decade.  In that period, they have been used by the key agencies and their staff involved in the care and protection of children.The Government has committed as a priority to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  It is my intention that the legislation will reflect a broad-based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk.  The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by strengthening the existing system for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.It should be noted that the HSE as the statutory body responsible for promoting the welfare of children has in place a network of personnel to provide training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First.  The HSE is providing a programme of information and training on the new guidance across the country.  This includes the publication of the new child protection and welfare practice handbook, which was launched last week.  The handbook will facilitate implementation of the Children First guidelines and achieve greater consistency in child protection practice throughout the HSE.I am attending meetings with social work personnel and other staff in each of the four HSE regions to promote the Children First guidelines.  We have already held two such meetings with an attendance of several hundred front line staff.  The Garda also attends these meetings, reflecting the close working relationship it has developed over the years with the HSE in protecting children.  Quite a deal of training is under way.  This work has received a positive welcome and it is clear that the revised guidance enjoys widespread support, as I am sure the Deputy has found.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseBeyond the HSE and the Garda Síochána, the Children First guidelines have been disseminated widely, including to every school.  The consistent implementation of the guidelines in every sector is a priority.  My Department is chairing an interdepartmental committee to oversee implementation of the guidance across Government.  I will be meeting this committee in early October.As to staffing resources, the number of social workers was increased in 2010 by 200.  This additional resource will be of particular assistance to the HSE in driving forward the process of implementation.  The necessary funding has been provided to the HSE to complete the recruitment of an additional 60 social workers by year end.  The House will be aware that the Ryan report implementation plan contained commitments to place Children First on a statutory basis and to recruit an additional 270 social workers.  By the end of this year, some 260 of these social workers will have been recruited and, together with the detailed implementation process for the revised guidelines, I am confident that these actions will provide a sound basis for Children First on a statutory footing.

The focus of my question is on resourcing and support staff in terms of the implementation of the legislation on Children First.Does the Minister accept that the number and deployment of social workers are inadequate to deal with the level of reports of children in danger, which will be expanded with other legislation that we intend to see in place?  Where the question arises, there will be a responsibility and a duty to highlight.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	11	I must call the Minister.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	12	On 21 July, the Minister indicated that the 260 additional social worker posts would be filled by the end of this year.  In her previous response to Deputy McConalogue, she did not provide the full data on the numbers currently in place.  She referred to 168 of the posts having been filled.  Deputy McConalogue and I would like to know whether the staff are in place or awaiting placement.  How many of the 168 are in service at present?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Deputy said he supports the legislation to put Children First on a statutory basis.  As I stated before, doing so is not simply about reporting but about inter-agency working.  Just this morning, I attended the meetings of the local children's services committees.  We see at county level that we need those who are working with children to work together.  Inter-agency work is required to give the best and most effective service to children and families.Part of the legislation is about sharing information effectively.  The research indicates agencies should work together but that they must do so in a particular way and well.  They must know precisely what they are trying to achieve.  It is not just about agencies working together but about them working well together to an effective formula.  The legislation is about reporting, sharing information and inter-agency co-operation.If one supports the legislation, one must ask when one would not want a case to be reported.  The Deputy's answer would be that he would want a case reported.  This leads to the question of resources, in respect of which I will put some facts before the House.  There was a €16 million budget overrun in the HSE child and family service in 2010.  The previous Government reduced the budget allocation, by at least €14 million, without saying where the cuts were meant to occur.  There is, therefore, huge pressure on the system.  I have said before I am shocked with some of that pressure.  Social work, child protection and fostering services are under pressure.In the current financial climate, we must examine how we can have more effective management.  As a consequence, I have asked for an audit of what is happening regarding cases awaiting allocation.  I have asked that we be able to compare areas.  Not enough work has been done on data collection to date.  There is a new system in place now so we can get a full picture and base our policy decisions on proper information.

We need capacity within the child protection service and we also need consistency of response, as the Minister indicated in her reply to me and other Deputies on 21 July.  We need to have certainty in that across the State.  In her reply the Minister said a regulatory impact analysis would be carried out and the results presented to the Government.  Has that been done?  What is the current status thereon?Regarding the Minister's shock about discovering the reality in terms of funding support for what is currently available and what we hope to have in place, can she give us any assurance that the establishment of her Department will bring about ring-fencing, even of what is currently provided, such that we will not see a further contraction regarding the commitments made heretofore on child protection services in terms of the upcoming budget?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Deputy knows the current financial position as well as I do.  Like all Departments, mine will be part of the current expenditure review.  A special management audit, led by a leading UK child protection expert, has commenced with a view to ensuring we will have in place appropriate systems to manage the need for a rapid response.  We are examining the sorts of thresholds that should apply in cases coming before the service.  There is considerable demand and resources are an issue.  The director is actively working on this.  We must have consistency of response around the country and must know accurately the demand in different areas.  We are beginning to get figures on this but I must state that some of these figures are unclear with regard to definition.  Some areas with fewer social workers have longer waiting lists than others.  There is much inconsistency and we need to put in place this part of the change agenda.  Then, we can match resources and use them, including social work resources, more effectively.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I  am aware of the matter raised by the Deputy.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has been in contact with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  On 3 June 2011, responsibility for the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 was transferred to me as Minster for Children and Youth Affairs.  I understand that under this Act the inclusion of the National Council for Special Education within the remit of the Ombudsman for Children requires a draft order to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and a resolution approving this order to be approved by each House.  This would be the procedure if it were to happen.  I expect further contact before the end of the year from the Office of the Ombudsman for Children on its remit.  While responsibility for proposing the amendment of legislation relating to the Ombudsman for Children rests with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, responsibility for the National Council for Special Education rests with the Department of Education and Skills.  Accordingly, my Department will consult the Department of Education and Skills and the Ombudsman for Children before finalising a proposal on this matter.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	17	This almost returns to the point the Minister made in her previous reply with regard to the need to have an integrated approach.  The point parents make is that they do not know where their voice is heard.  An appeal against a decision of the National Council for Special Education is adjudicated by colleagues sitting at the next table and parents feel very aggrieved by this.  Our system should always have checks and balances, and this issue affects some of the most vulnerable children in the State.  If they are allocated a special needs assistant or resource hours, by definition they require additional support.Is the Minister disposed to moving the order?  What dialogue must happen with the Department of Education and Skills?  Will it take a short period of time?  In the answers to questions posed, by the Opposition in the main, on the number of special needs assistants we are told if a child requires a special needs assistant he or she will have access to one.  However, a language gap exists because "access to" does not mean a dedicated special needs assistant.  This is why much grievance exists and the parents are being lost in all of this.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I can only agree with Deputy Murphy on the vulnerability of the children and of their parents when trying to access a service.  I fully understand this and appreciate the stresses and the difficulties.  Deputy Murphy asked me to outline how the process for taking responsibility for this area might move forward and where the discussions are going.  The Office of the Ombudsman for Children has stated it will come back to me.  I understand originally it wrote to the former Minister, Mary Harney, on this matter and raised this question.  This afternoon, I will meet the National Council for Special Education and I will discuss this issue with the Department of Education and Skills and the Ombudsman for Children to see how it can be best dealt with.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	19	If this is to happen, does the Minister see it happening by the end of this year or early next year?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I want to stress that at this point, a decision has not been taken.  The Ombudsman for Children will return to me with her proposals after which discussions will take place with the Department for Education and Skills.  I know that Department will have its own plans on how it sees the service developing.  I must have those discussions with the Department as well.The Deputy made a relevant point; the Department of Children and Youth Affairs must be a cross-cutting Department as well.  We must work with other Departments because not all of the issues that relate to children, for example, special needs, are under the direct remit of my Department at the moment, but even if they did not come under its remit, it would be an area on which we should work together.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I thank Deputy McConalogue.  In July 2011, I launched the revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children.  The guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.The revised guidance replaces the original version of Children First which was first published in 1999.  The HSE, as I said in reply to the question from Deputy Ó Caoláin, has a network of personnel to provide training and information on the implementation of Children First.  It is currently implementing a programme of information and training on the new guidance across the country.  That includes the handbook which I am sure the Deputy has seen.  The handbook will facilitate implementation of the Children First guidance and should provide for what I said is needed, namely, consistency across the country.  The increase in the number of social workers should make a difference to that.The Ryan report implementation plan recommended that Children First should be put on a statutory basis and the strengthening of the HSE's child protection services through the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers.  The introduction of 260 of the social workers by the end of this year and the detailed implementation process under way within the HSE and across the Government will provide a firm basis for full compliance with Children First on a consistent basis, in addition to the other work which I have said is being carried out by the director of child and family services within the HSE.  The audit which is currently being carried out should help.The Government has also committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First.  I intend that the legislation will reflect a broad-based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk.  The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by underpinning the existing guidance for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse with legislation.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe Government is committed to a significant programme of reform of our child protection services.  This is intended to achieve national consistency with services across the country delivered according to national standards which will be externally evaluated.  This reform will lead to a new child and family support agency which will provide the dedicated focus on child protection which has been sometimes lacking within the HSE.  The implementation of these reforms will allow for the best possible services to be delivered within the resources available.

It greatly concerns me that I have not been able to get a clear response on the exact number of additional social workers that have been appointed so far this year.  We have been given generalities but there is no specific figure in terms of progress on the appointment of an additional 60 by the end of this year on which a commitment was given.  That concerns me in terms of where we are with resources.I fully embrace the approach of putting the Children First guidelines on a statutory basis.  The objective behind it is to ensure that we provide the best possible services to protect children.  However, in a couple of the Minister's replies today——
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Deputy should ask a question please.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	24	In a couple of the Minister's replies today she stated she will introduce the guidelines and she will see following that how best the resources can be allocated.  She indicated that the audit which is currently ongoing will be a help and the fact that extra social workers are being employed, which is to address other weaknesses in the system, will be a help with mandatory reporting.  That is most concerning, in particular when one takes into account what has been said by experts such as Geoffrey Shannon and the head of children's services, Gordon Jeyes, and others, who have indicated that what we need is a step-by-step approach and we should not run before we can walk.  However, what we see is that the Minister is coming up with plans but with no assessment of the resources and how they will work.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I wish to call the Minister now.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	26	That is not the way this should be done.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	27	It is quite the opposite.  The Deputy's Government made no assessment of the situation and did no audit.  In addition, it left the services in a state where it is unclear precisely what is happening around the country.  The previous Government promised to introduce legislation by 2010 to put Children First on a statutory basis, but did not do so.  Since coming into office, I have worked on the heads of a Bill that will shortly be available.  We have put on the A-list legislation to underpin the Children First legislation.  We have an audit going on so that we get consistent information.  We have a changed work programme within the HSE which consists of a new child protection handbook and new guidance.  The director, along with myself, are meeting all frontline staff throughout the country who are able to attend those meetings to discuss consistent implementation.  That is what I would call taking action to address the child protection system in this country, which is badly in need of such action.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	28	It ill behoves the Minister to attack the previous Government when we should be addressing the current situation.  If her assertion — that no preparation was done before the last Government left office — is her position, surely the onus is on her to assess the resource implications and what would be required before moving on.  That would be in line with what many health service experts have requested.  We have heard that an audit is now being undertaken but in fact no assessment was done in advance.  That was ill judged so we need to take it into account and address it.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Clearly, the priority is to protect children and keep them safe.  That is precisely what we are doing by working for consistency, looking at referrals around the country and ensuring there is an adequate response to them.  In addition, we are putting in place legislation and an implementation plan, which is what the handbook is offering.  That is how to keep children safe, by responding to cases that are currently coming to social work teams throughout the country, and having a consistent approach to managing those cases.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I have been advised by the Adoption Authority of Ireland that it only holds records of adoptions effected since the introduction of statutory adoption in 1952.  It holds no records relating to birth registrations.The Adoption Board commenced a preliminary examination of available records in 2010.  The audit related to records retained by the authority of contact received from persons who have been told and-or believe themselves to be adopted, in respect of whom no adoption record exists.  This indicated that 99 people who have identified themselves to the board or authority as adopted, do not have a corresponding adoption file.Around 50% of these relate to so-called "adoptions" prior to the introduction of the statutory adoption regime under the Adoption Act 1952, which was commenced on 1 January 1953.  This work has continued following the commencement of the Adoption Act 2010, as these queries continue to arise.The authority intends to undertake further work to explore the full extent of the issue.  The board of the authority will then consider possible next steps to contribute to an understanding of the issue, including any advice to the Minister.  It is important to note that the authority has no statutory responsibility in respect of the matter but is extremely sensitive to the issue, as it should be.  Notwithstanding that, it should be noted that in a number of individual cases, where the facts have been available to the board or the authority, it has advised the appropriate authorities in respect of any activities which it believed contravened the Adoption Acts for the relevant period, but that is historic.The drafting of legislation with regard to information and tracing is a priority of mine.  Work is under way in regard to the preparation of the Bill, in consultation with the Adoption Authority, to provide for a structured and regulated way of providing access to information and contact for those affected by adoption.  It is intended that the adoption (information and tracing) Bill will provide for the Adoption Authority to have access to records currently held by a wide range of information services, give the authority an oversight role with regard to the maintenance of adoption records and place the national contact preference register on a statutory basis.  The Bill will also provide for proactive tracing and reunion services by appropriate bodies for adopted adults, birth mothers and birth families, with the Adoption Authority having the overarching responsibility for the service.  I intend to take this legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	31	I thank the Minister for her response as this is a very important issue and I am pleased to know the Minister intends to address it by way of legislation.  My concern would be with regard to the timescale and the emphasis.  I have heard the Minister speaking on the radio on this subject and her input has tended to be on the basis of looking at the issue from the point of view of the adoptive parents perhaps rather than the rights of the child.  There has to be a balance of rights.  However I refer to the rights of the children who were illegally adopted in this State — a figure which is reckoned in tens of thousands.  This is a crime which people have spent their lifetimes trying to address.  The present situation has a number of anomalies which require to be urgently addressed.  For example, if an adoption body is not accredited, it is a private body and nobody has any control of what happens the files of such a body.  These could be burned at any time which would destroy the identities of people who have been adopted and such a body would be free from prosecution.  This situation must be addressed as a matter of urgency.  Many of these files are all over the place and we need urgent action to ensure they are collected and held in a central place and properly audited and stored so that they are accessible.  I ask the Minister to indicate the timescale for this process and to say what powers are being considered in this regard.  Information and tracing is crucial for the citizens involved.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	32	I am aware of the situation described by Deputy Daly and of the calls by adopted persons for access to historical personal and family information.  I completely agree with the Deputy that the files must be preserved intact.  It is essential that those files are maintained in a safe and secure place.  I agree with the Deputy that there should be one authority with overall responsibility for those files.  I am aware of the radio interview to which Deputy Daly refers and in which I made the comment that people should be informed about access to information and that such information should be made available.  However, historical issues need to be dealt with and these must be handled as sensitively and constructively as possible.  A number of legal and constitutional issues arise as to balancing the rights of the adopted person to information as against the rights and in many cases, the expectations, of birth parents to privacy.  We are examining those issues and progress has been made with regard to the Bill.  The heads of the Bill are close to completion.  I am hopeful that this legislation will be progressed fairly speedily.  I understand the personal consequences for individuals of not having this legislation in place.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I ask whether the issue of retrospection and the rights of individuals to access information from a certain date, for instance, will be addressed in the Bill.  The HSE is excluded from this process and is excluded from requests under freedom of information legislation nor does it seem to have the administrative capability to provide access to information.  Is this issue being dealt with in the proposed legislation?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I wish to examine as comprehensively as possible the issues raised by Deputy Daly.  I will consider international best practice and given our constitutional and legal constraints I will consider what precisely can be done with regard to the Deputy's query.  The current contact register goes a certain way.  It is clear many people will seek this information and we want the process to be as comprehensive as possible and to include supports for the individuals.  This has been the practice in other countries.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	35	I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 74 together.The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established on 2 June 2011 by the Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs (Alteration of Name of Department and Title of Minister) Order 2011, made under section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939.  The effect of this order also gave responsibility for the Family Support Agency to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  On 3 June 2011, a further order made under section 6(1) of the Ministers and Secretaries (Amendment) Act 1939, entitled the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (Transfer of  Departmental Administration and Ministerial Functions) Order2011, transferred responsibility for the following legislation to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs: the Adoption Act 2010; subsections (1)(d) and (2) — in so far as they relate to the young people's facilities and services fund — of section 2 of the Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2007; the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002; the Protections for Persons Reporting Child Abuse Act 1998; and the Youth Work Act 2001.The order also provided for the transfer of responsibility from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs for the following functions: promoting the development of integrated policy frameworks to enable the development and implementation of cross-departmental strategies to secure the well-being of children and young people; conducting, commissioning and publishing research and building an information base to inform the development of policy and service delivery for children and young people across relevant Government agencies and non-governmental organisations; developing, monitoring and supporting the implementation of play, recreation and youth policies; overseeing the development, improvement and monitoring of policies and structures to promote and enable participation by children and young people in decision-making on matters that affect their lives; and providing and administering preschool early childhood care and education scheme.  Responsibility for the National Education Welfare Board was transferred by the national education welfare board order from the Minister for Education and Skills to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs in May 2011.It is intended to transfer responsibility for the Child Care Acts 1991 to 2011 from the Minister for Health to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, with effect from 1 October 2011.  Before the Child Care Acts could be transferred, Part 4 of the Child Care (Amendment) Act 2011, which provides the legislative basis for the provision of information and documents by the HSE to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and creates a safe channel of communication for sensitive information from the executive to me as Minister, was required to be commenced.  This was commenced on 8 September 2011.In the context of the preparation of legislation to establish the child and family support agency, consideration is being given to any additional legislative provisions required by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs to be included in that legislation.  In the meantime, protocols for consultation between the Minister for Health and myself will be put in place, subject to our agreement.It is intended that responsibility for children detention schools, Part 10 of the Children Act 2001, and for remand places under section 88 of that Act will transfer from the Minister for Justice and Equality to me as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  It is intended to transfer these responsibilities by a transfer of functions order.  I will consult with the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Finance as to the appropriate timing of the transfer.  In the interest of administrative efficiency, it appears most appropriate that the transfer of responsibility will take effect on 1 January 2012 to coincide with the financial year.  However, the Irish Youth Justice Service staff will move to my Department in the coming weeks.  Protocols for consultation between the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs will be put in place subject to our agreement.

As we are now six months into this Government, it is very important that the legislation to complete the establishment of the Department and the transfer of powers from other Departments proceeds as quickly as possible.  When does the Minister expect that the work she has outlined in her response will be completed?  The Act establishing the child and family support agency will be key to the operation of the Department.  Where does that stand currently and when will the Bill be published and go through the Dáil?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	37	The Deputy can see from the fairly detailed reply I have provided that quite a number of the functions have been transferred.  One function regarding youth justice is outstanding and, for budgetary reasons among others, it is intended that will be transferred on 1 January.  We will work jointly on this because it is not being transferred in its entirety.  Part of the work relating to the Garda diversion programmes will stay with the Department of Justice and Equality.Establishing a new agency is a complex task.  I have set up a task force, which has met and is working on establishing a new child and family agency.  I do not have a timeframe for the task force for that but it is creating the vision for the new agency in association with the Department and myself.  We are examining the transfer of responsibilities from the HSE.  This is a period of change and it will not happen overnight.  I do not have a precise timetable for the establishment of the agency because it is a complex task.  I will attempt to examine the governance issues first and try to put the legislative base in place that will be needed by the agency as soon as possible in order that we can move forward with the legislation.

I am particularly concerned that in reply to a question I posed about inter-country adoption, specifically in regard to Vietnam, the Minister stated she has "no responsibility to Dáil Éireann in this matter".  The reply does not even suggest the question has been transferred to the Adoption Authority of Ireland.  I participated in many Question Times with the Minister's predecessor, the former Minister of State with responsibility for children, Mr. Barry Andrews, addressing inter-country adoption issues, including with specified countries such as Vietnam, and they were always dealt with by him.  I point this out because this reply signifies a deterioration rather than an advance in terms of the new Department's establishment.  Will the Minister clarify the position?Another disallowed question related to the national vetting bureau.  While I acknowledge the facilitating Bill has been moved to the Department of Justice and Equality, nevertheless given its focus on one of the important areas in the context of child protection, surely the Minister would be willing and able to respond on that legislation.  I had other questions disallowed but these two replies have vexed me most.  I am interested to know what the Minister can do about this for the future.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I will follow these questions up and correspond directly with the Deputy.  I am happy to answer questions in the House in regard to Vietnam.  Significant progress has been made in recent weeks in efforts to establish diplomatic relations with Vietnam on the adoption issue.  I intend that I will answers questions relating to Vietnam in the House and I will correspond with the Deputy directly regarding his question.The vetting legislation is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Minister will bring the legislation to the House.  My Department has been involved in the preparation of the Bill.  I can only assume the Deputy's question was transferred because the Minister for Justice and Equality will bring the legislation to the House but, as he rightly said, it impacts on child protection.  I am particularly keen that issues relating to vetting are dealt with as soon as possible for a variety of reasons, not least because it will aid the protection of children and will help agencies who are currently experiencing delays.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	41	Yes.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	42	The third and final report of the Joint Committee on Children and the Constitution, JCCAC, deals with the rights of children under the Constitution, and the statute and case law concerning adoption, guardianship, care proceedings, custody and access to children.  It sets out a proposed wording for a constitutional amendment to strengthen the rights of children. As Deputies will be aware, the programme for Government states that the referendum on children's rights is a priority, and that the wording will be along the lines of that proposed by the joint committee.  Work is under way in the Office of the Attorney General to develop a draft wording for consideration by me and my Government colleagues.  The previous Attorney General identified certain unintended consequences attaching to the joint committee's wording.  The development of a revised wording will seek to resolve these issues while staying as close as possible to the joint committee wording.  On receipt of a draft wording it is my intention to consult with other Departments and seek approval from Government for the proposed wording, with a view to holding the referendum next year.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I reaffirm my support and that of my party for the introduction of this legislation and proceeding to referendum before the people.  Has the Minister any idea at this point when in 2012 we will see this legislation published?  It is committed in the legislative programme for 2012.  It is a vague period of time; a full 12 months.  Can the Minister be more specific?  Will the draft wording be published in advance of the actual legislation in order to not only refer to other Departments and Cabinet colleagues but require the full support of the Houses of the Oireachtas?  That is a position I want to arrive at and I would be very interested to know if we will get the draft wording in advance and have the opportunity to feed back to the Minister on it.Regarding the work towards wording that somewhat measures up to that recommended by the all-party committee, has the Minister confidence that we will realise wording that is an advance on that first mooted by the former Government?  Can she give us some sense of the ongoing work within the office of the Attorney General?  Is progress being made on this issue?  Is there real proactivity, and when does the Minister expect that she will be able to move to the next stage of this process?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	44	The Deputy knows first hand how complex this area is but I assure him that active work is being done to resolve some of the difficulties.  It is a complex task.  Real concerns were expressed by the previous Attorney General.  There was concern about some unintended consequences in terms of the demands on the State.  It is a question of seeing how we can resolve those.  In advance of that I have not made decisions on some of the issues the Deputy raises but I welcome what he said regarding all-party support.  The ideal position would be to have all-party Oireachtas support for this referendum.  That would be my intention and I intend consulting across the Houses on the development of the approach to the referendum.  At this stage I am focusing on ensuring that we get a wording and then preparing the necessary legislation.

Will we have sight of the draft wording in advance of the legislation to facilitate the referendum?  Can the Minister confirm that that is the case?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	46	I have not made a decision on that but I would want to consult as widely as possible.

Along with Deputy Ó Caoláin I would welcome if the wording can be published in advance.  My only disappointment about this issue which I have expressed previously is the approach the Opposition parties took on it last February to have the referendum on the same day as the presidential election but I assure the Minister that those of us in my party understand the complexities involved and will work with her on the matter.  I urge her to try to progress the work to ensure we have this issue before the people next year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	48	In reply to the comments by both Deputies, while the wording and the constitutional challenges are complex the intention is simple.  It is to have greater protection for children and emphasise that in the Constitution.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	49	There are no plans at present to increase the level of qualifications required under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme.  However, interim arrangements which applied in the 2010-2012 start-up phase will no longer apply from September 2012.  Under the interim arrangements, possession of the four core child care modules of the FETAC Level 5 award have been accepted as qualifying a pre-school leader under the programme, provided that the person concerned is working towards the achievement of a full level 5 qualification by September 2012.  From that date, all pre-school leaders will be required to meet this criterion in full.The literacy and numeracy strategy, however, which was launched by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in July of this year, contains a commitment to increase the qualifications required for staff working in State-funded ECCE services at some stage in the future.  Clearly, this will require assurance that appropriate ECCE training is available to child care staff.In this context, the workforce development plan for the early childhood care and education sector identifies the way forward in terms of upskilling the existing workforce and ensuring that those who enter the workforce in the future are appropriately prepared for their role.  It also identifies career paths and progression routes for those who choose this area of work and provides clarity regarding the core skills and knowledge essential to practice effectively in an ECCE setting.  The implementation of the plan is being overseen by the early years education policy unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located within my Department.One development associated with the implementation of the plan is the publication of new common award standards for awards made by the Further Education and Training Council, FETAC, at levels 4, 5 and 6 on the National Framework for Qualifications.  The changeover to the new award standards is a very positive and welcome development.  They promote consistency in quality, content and delivery of programmes of learning leading to these awards nationally, their practice focus ensures that graduates are fully prepared to enter employment upon graduation and their structure ensures that core knowledge and skills are developed across all levels of qualifications which in turn allows for the establishment of clear professional pathways into and through the profession, which is something many of the staff employed in these services have been requesting.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	50	Go raibh maith agat a Aire for that reply.  The early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme is one of the developments in the child care sector which has been a shining light in terms of progress.  What was a relatively realistic investment is reaping great rewards in terms of ensuring that every child, regardless of the means of their family, is getting preschool education.The first full year of the scheme was 2010-2011 but the scheme only began in early 2010 and therefore has been developing in the past two years.  It has progressed a good deal in that way but the key is not just the provision of the time and a preschool service for children.  It is also about the quality, as I have no doubt the Minister is aware, particularly attention to ensuring that the Síolta framework for early childhood care is promoted and is not just a document.  It is important also that the Aistear curriculum is developed at preschool because we are at an early stage of this programme and its pre-eminence in terms of its potential for young children within the Minister's Department must continue.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I agree with the Deputy on the opportunity the ECCE scheme presents in that 95% of our three to five year olds are attending these services, and quality is of the utmost importance as well as top quality training for the staff delivering the service.  In that regard, another important element on which I am sure the Deputy would agree with me is to involve the parents where there are opportunities to do so.The scheme is a good place for parents to have the opportunity to discuss their children's development and progress.  The services need to be encouraged to involve parents as much as possible.  We certainly want the two quality frameworks the Deputy mentioned, Síolta and Aistear, to be implemented and adhered to throughout the country.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	52	On a related matter, is the Minister aware that cuts in recent years have disproportionately affected the provision of child care facilities through community-based providers, that is, under the community development programmes?  Many of those who work in the area are already low paid, which is most regrettable.  I believe one of the fault lines is that they are not allowed to access collective bargaining.  That is just an example.  Perhaps the Minister has already done so, but will she address the matter with the Minister for Finance?  There should be an entitlement to access collective bargaining on the part of low-paid workers in child care provision, particularly in community-based facilities, which is where the overwhelming majority of those involved in this essential work are based.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	53	Access to child care is something we want to preserve and develop.  As the Deputy said, the previous Government decided about three years ago to close down the capital funding in the area.  Nevertheless, we must continue to address the issue, and at the very least be aware of the demands that exist given our increased population and increasing birth rate.  We need to be sensitive to the demands in this area.  I am keen that we have a rigorous analysis of what the demands are going to be.  That is one response to what the Deputy said.  Perhaps he will correspond with me directly on the other matter and I will examine it.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	54	I assure the House again of the Government's ongoing commitment to early childhood care and education.  The ECCE scheme, which Deputy McConalogue mentioned, was introduced in January 2010 and provides a free preschool year to all eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  Almost every preschool service in the State is participating in the programme, so it is available to children in all areas, and some 63,000 children or 94% of the eligible age cohort availed of the programme in the 2010-11 preschool year.  In 2011, the ECCE programme is expected to cost €166 million.  Services participating in the programme are required to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within the Síolta framework for early learning and they are also encouraged to implement the Aistear curriculum, which has been developed for children from birth to six years.My objective is to develop the ECCE programme incrementally over the term of this Government.  However, all programme funding is considered in the context of the annual Estimates and budgetary process and I must operate within the financial constraints under which the rest of the Government is operating.  As I have just said, a key element of this development will be to support the implementation of the workforce development plan by the early education policy unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located within my Department.  In addition, I will be collaborating closely with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in implementing the recently launched literacy and numeracy strategy.  Early intervention is crucial and the strategy provides for a range of actions to be undertaken by my Department to support preschool children and their families.  I have been impressed by the work that is going on throughout the country in relation to early intervention.  It is increasingly evidence and research based, which is a good thing.  We are seeing programmes that have been tested and which we know have a good impact and support families properly.It would be extremely helpful to many children if a second preschool year was provided.  It would probably be particularly beneficial to children with special needs, who can currently avail of the preschool year on a pro rata basis over two years.  I would like to be in a position to deliver on this, but as I said, I must operate within the financial constraints under which the rest of the Government is operating.  I assure Deputy Wallace that the ECCE programme will continue to be evaluated and developed as resources permit.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I thank the Minister for her answer.  I realise that money is scarce and the Minister is constrained, but she will know that a report by the OECD in 2009 showed that we spend a lower percentage on the education of children under six than any other country in Europe.  It is a fact of life that we have underestimated the importance of investment in children at the earliest stages.  Even if the overall spend cannot change, we need to consider rebalancing spending with a view to greater investment in children in the early years.  As the Minister admitted, all the research shows that such spending is the most productive of all.  Every euro spent on children under six years of age saves the State €8 in the long term.  That is dramatic.  Surely it would be a great investment on the part of the State to spend more money on the early years.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I certainly take the Deputy's point.  He does not have to convince me of the importance of early intervention and support and quality child care.  The situation has improved greatly in recent years and the ECCE programme, which 94% of children are attending, as I said, is certainly beneficial.  I would like to see more resources in the area.  In July, at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children, I indicated my objective over the coming years to seek to develop further the free preschool year in early childhood care and education.  As the Deputy well knows, we are in an extraordinarily difficult financial situation and my Department is subject to the expenditure review, as are all other Departments.  However, I would like to work towards further development as resources permit.  It would certainly be beneficial.  I will discuss the matter with the Department of Education and Skills, but there are serious fiscal constraints on all of us and I must operate within them.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Aside from the social benefits, it is still just 15 hours a week.  To add to that, parents are already in a difficult place financially, yet child care in Ireland is among the most expensive in Europe.  We put the lowest funding into it of any country in Europe and the costs are among the highest.  As an aside, I commend the Minister on her speech at the Amnesty briefing yesterday, which was very good.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	58	I thank Deputy Wallace.  There is no doubt that Ireland was slow to develop comprehensive child care, but great progress has been made in the past number of years, primarily thanks to EU funding but also because of some national funding.  Further developments in the area are hugely constrained despite the worldwide evidence because financial resources are limited.  However, I assure the Deputy that I am personally committed to the area and I will seek to see whether resources can be made available, perhaps in the first instance to accommodate children with special needs and give them some extra time.  I accept that the ideal would be to have a second year and I will progress work on that, but we are operating within tight financial constraints, as the Deputy knows.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	59	My Department is involved in ongoing and productive dialogue with the youth sector through the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, NYWAC.  This committee comprises a chairperson and 32 members drawn equally from the voluntary and statutory sectors involved in the administration and provision of youth work programmes and services.  Thirteen nominees from the National Youth Council of Ireland, NYCI, and four from the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, are represented on the committee.The committee's main role is to advise me on matters relating to the development and coordination of youth work policies, programmes and services.  The committee meets on average every two months and provides a forum through which specific issues can be addressed and progressed.  I met recently with this advisory committee and with representatives of a wide range of youth organisations, including Foróige, Youth Work Ireland, Irish Girl Guides, Catholic Youth Care and Ferns Diocesan Youth Service.One of my key aims for youth policy development will be to ensure optimum use of all the financial and human resources available.  It is striking how many people work as volunteers in the youthwork sector; there are around 9,000 professionals and 60,000 volunteers.  The development of my Department's policy on young people will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, co-ordination and impact in youth policy and provision to ensure quality outcomes for all.The Department is in the process of commissioning a review of international best practice in the area of youth development and youth support.  The findings from this work will inform my Department's policy objectives and future funding provision with the aim of ensuring that young people engaging in youth services derive maximum benefit.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I thank the Minister for her comprehensive reply.  Does she agree that in these straitened times, it is particularly important to focus on the support services for young people?  Does she also agree that it is a good time, financial difficulties notwithstanding, to ensure the advisory bodies and youth support services she communicates with regularly are updated to enable the Minister and the Government to make value judgments on the issues facing young people?  This is not an attempt to pretend these are the first youths to appear on the face of the earth but an effort to respond to the challenges that are emerging, particularly the negative challenges.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I take the Deputy's point.  We are all aware of the threats posed to young people by alcohol, drugs and unhealthy lifestyles.  We must get to grips with the challenges posed by consumerism, the media and new technologies.  There is a number of things I am doing on the development of youth work and I am going to ensure we have a national youth development policy because we have no comprehensive youthwork policy in place at the moment.  I am also looking at the 2001 youthwork legislation.  Deputies familiar with this area are aware that many of the provisions of that legislation have not yet been implemented.  Youthwork funding streams have not changed since the 1980s and we must examine the most effective use of the funding being given to youth bodies.  In many areas there is duplication and there is clearly work to be done to streamline the money and projects being done with young people.  It is now more important than ever that organisations are not duplicating work, with multiple funding going to similar projects.  This area needs to be rationalised and we must examine those funding streams.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	62	I welcome the Minister's remarks about reviewing the youthwork sector and updating the youthwork legislation.  Will the Minister join me in calling on local authorities, State agencies and other bodies to make available properties and facilities for youth clubs, youth organisations and sporting organisations?  Facilities are a huge issue.

We must engage and have more dialogue with those at the coalface of support provision for young people, particularly those at risk.  It must be done on the basis of recognising that a little can go very far.  It was well exemplified last evening on the programme "Secret Millionaire" on the visit to Muirhevnamore in Dundalk, my neighbouring constituency.  That is an example of how small sums of money can make a tremendous difference and at the end of the day, save the Exchequer vast sums of money by avoiding anti-social behaviour and the prospect of a lifetime of crime and imprisonment for many young people that we wish to avoid.

It might be better to increase the number of those meetings in the present climate.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I can only agree with Deputy Stanton, it is a point well made.  Access to facilities and resources is a huge issue.  We have seen buildings that could be used by local youth clubs and organisations that are empty in the evenings, the very time when they could be available to such organisations.  I will pursue that with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government to see if we could make progress on the issue.I will take Deputy Durkan's point on further contact with the youth organisations but I assure him there is ongoing contact with all of the organisations.  There is a budget for the youth sector in 2011 of €60 million and we must ensure it is spent effectively to give us the best youth services we can get at this time.  I agree with the point made by Deputies that this is a particularly stressful time for many young people and youth organisations have an important role to play in getting services to these young people.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	66	In March and July the leaders of eurozone countries held two special summits to agree urgent measures to tackle the financial and economic crisis.  After both meetings, announcements were made that a line was being drawn under the crisis.  Every day it becomes more obvious that the crisis is getting worse.  Half measures impress no one and the lack of cooperation between European leaders is undermining confidence.  Having taken the decision not to meet or contact any eurozone leader before the July summit, the Taoiseach's policy in the last two months has been to stay equally silent.  As far as can be checked from public records, this seems to be the longest any Taoiseach has gone without holding a major bilateral meeting on urgent European Union business.  The Government has not taken a position on the Franco-German proposals for a new European treaty and has accepted the European Central Bank's attitude to non-sovereign bondholders without even meeting the ECB president.  Proposals are appearing in the media but nothing concrete is emerging.  Given the urgency of what is happening with Greece, as well as Spain and Italy, will the Taoiseach state exactly what Ireland's position is on these fundamental matters?  Does the Taoiseach agree that an early summit is now needed?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The Deputy is right that there were summits in March and July and decisions were made at those summits and those decisions will be implemented by those who attended.  For its part, Ireland is working to fulfil those conditions.  The Bill giving legal effect to the changes made in July is going through the House and there is a Finance Ministers' meeting scheduled for Monday.  The timetable for that may change and may be expanded.While Deputy Martin continuously comments on lack of contact between European leaders, the result achieved since July in both the EFSM and EFSF speaks for itself in that the range of interest rate reductions brought about have secured substantial savings for the Irish taxpayer.The agenda being pursued by Ireland, which has been articulated by the Minister for Finance at a number of meetings, is being considered by the European partners.  It is to put other propositions in place to reduce the overall cost of debt here.  The Minister has pointed out that the promissory note that was signed off on by the previous Government in respect of Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society contained a sleight of hand that is very costly to the Irish taxpayer.  No interest was to be charged until 2013 when the interest rate will be penal, at over 8%.  The Minister has pointed out to the IMF and EU that dealing with a range of propositions in that area would be beneficial for the country.I agree that it is necessary that European leaders discuss these issues in a comprehensive fashion.  The first thing they must do is implement what was agreed in July.  A big decision is to be made in Germany on Thursday, we are dealing with it here, the Greek Prime Minister is spelling out what his Government wants to do and the Italian Prime Minister has implemented an austerity programme.  The countries who signed on for decisions have a duty in their respective Parliaments to implement those decisions.  A meeting is fixed for EU Heads of Government.  I am not sure of the date of that meeting but it is fairly soon.

After six months of not having had a single bilateral meeting with a eurozone leader, the Taoiseach should put aside his election speeches about the major diplomatic initiatives he was about to undertake.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	74	Debt sustainability is at the core of solving the crisis.  Reductions in the interest rates, which were agreed at the start of the year, are finally being fully implemented.  They are welcome but there remains the issue of outstanding debt.  If discussions are taking place about writing down sovereign Greek debt, there should be no problem with doing the same for non-sovereign and unsecured bank debts.  That goes to the core of the issues.The European Central Bank stopped us doing this last year because of supposed contagion risks.

The Taoiseach has broken his election promise about "Not another red cent".  Will he now agree to intervene personally and discuss that core issue with the President of the European Central Bank?  The Taoiseach supported the president's appointment without question.  It is time he had a substantive engagement with him on the core issue of our debt, given that discussions are going on at present about Greek sovereign debt.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	97	The Government placed a cap of €500,000 on bankers' pay.  Some of us argued for a lower rate, given the awful distress of people. Tá a fhios ag an Taoiseach go bhfuil na gnáth daoine ag cur suas le méadú costais ar bhia agus ar thaisteal cé go bhfuil an Rialtas ag leanúint leis ag cur billiún euro isteach ins na bainc.When I asked the Taoiseach this question in May, he did not rule out the possibility of AIB breaking this cap of €500,000, which is an obscene amount of money to pay anyone.  In response, he said he had never seen people so frustrated at the carry-on of bankers but he did not rule the possibility out.  Last weekend, the Minister for Finance confirmed that AIB has, indeed, asked for permission to negotiate a salary of more than €500,000.  Will the Taoiseach tell AIB, and the Dáil, that the Government will, under no circumstances, allow this?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	98	I answered this on a previous occasion.  The cap is in place at €500,000.  I said it would want to be a truly exceptional case to warrant breaching that.  I have not seen evidence of any exceptional case.

The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said that many members of the public will still regard these levels of payment as excessive, particularly having regard to the role played by many senior bankers in creating our current economic crisis.  AIB has a cheek to ask for authority to negotiate a salary above €500,000.

I ask that he reverse the fuel cuts for vulnerable older people.  The Taoiseach knows that these people have served the State well for many years, in particular in the 1980s when they took a major hit in terms of taxes.  We heard earlier on in this House that €500,000 is to be paid to senior bankers at a time when we are taking €3 or €4 in terms of fuel allowances from our senior citizens.Does the Taoiseach agree with Age Action Ireland that it is unacceptable to target these people and that to do so is highly dangerous?  Does he share my concerns that many older people could over the next few months die from cold-related illnesses such as pneumonia?  Why did the Taoiseach and Government cut the free electricity and gas units allowance under the household benefits package by 25% and 20% respectively?  Is the Taoiseach aware of the huge gas and electricity price increases in recent weeks and that many of our senior citizens are scared?  Does he know that recently electricity prices increased by 12% and gas increased by 20%?I ask that the Taoiseach reverse these cuts as a matter of priority.

I share the Deputy's concern for all our elderly people.  While I am not sure of the weather forecast for next December-January, obviously if this winter is as cold as it was last winter people will suffer.  The position is that the Minister for Social Protection found, upon taking up that portfolio, a whole series of decisions made but nothing to back them up.  Obviously, the comprehensive spending review and analysis of it will have to ensure some measure of priority for the protection of our elderly citizens.  The Minister for Social Protection will, in so far as is possible, see that that happens.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	132	I referred earlier to the people earning €500,000 per annum at a time when we are taking €2 or €3 from senior citizens.  Has the Taoiseach been visited at his clinic and office by senior citizens expressing concern about these cuts?  I have.Is the Taoiseach aware that cuts to the telephone, electricity, gas and smokeless fuel allowances will cost the average pensioner €265.20 per annum?  That is a lot of money to many senior citizens.  I ask that the Taoiseach seek in preparation of the budget to maintain social welfare payments to older people at current levels.  This could be a matter of life and death for many older people.  Approximately 2,000 senior citizens are directly affected by these cuts.  This figure was provided by the voluntary sector who deal with senior citizens on the front line.  I ask that the Government continue to assist these 2,000 senior citizens who will be at risk.Will the Taoiseach stand up for older people and reverse these cuts now?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	133	No, I cannot reverse these cuts now.  Not alone have I been visited by a number of people, I have visited people whose situations are quite serious.  In regard to the drafting of the budget, the Deputy is aware of the overall figures and will have an opportunity during the course of the debate on the budget to put his points.  The Ministers for Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, Social Protection, Health and others will, in consideration of the Estimates, take into account the difficulties and plight of many of our elderly citizens, as it is being brought to their attention on a regular basis.The situation is that decisions of the previous Government in respect of unspecified cuts have had to be dealt with.  Preparation of budget 2012 will take into account in the best way possible and within the constraints available to us, the protection and respect of our elderly citizens, in particular those living alone or in difficult circumstances which arise for a variety reasons.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Requests for use of the ministerial air transport service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office.  Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need for and purpose of travel, the destination, the availability and suitability of other travel arrangements and other logistical details.  Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point.Screened requests are then submitted to me for my consideration and approval, if deemed appropriate.  Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the office of the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or Air Corps.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	135	The Taoiseach when replying to Deputy Finian McGrath earlier said "No, I cannot reverse these cuts now" but——

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	141	The Taoiseach knows the point I am making and should not be dodging questions.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I do, but the Deputy needs to be clear about it.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I tabled this question prior to the summer recess, following the fiasco in regard to attempts to transport 14 year old Meadhbh McGivern to London for a life saving liver transplant.  There was a whole series of blunders in that regard.  Tá a fhios againn go bhfuil sí níos fearr anois.  Le cuidiú Dé, beidh sí maith go leor de thoradh ar an surgery.  Was consideration given at that time to using the Government jet?  Could it have been put at the disposal of the McGivern family?  Would the jet be placed at the disposal of a family in similar circumstances?I understand from a news report that during the past week the Learjet took part in an air show in Malta.  What was the cost to the taxpayer of participation in that air show of a jet that is not apparently available to assist citizens?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The Deputy asked two questions.  What happened in the Meadhbh McGivern case is to be deeply regretted.  Deputy Adams is aware that the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, recently published its report into the failed transfer of Meadhbh to the UK on 2 July for a liver transplant.  A key recommendation of that report is that a national aeromedical co-ordination group be established to implement its findings.  I believe that is appropriate.  The Learjet was used to transfer Meadhbh to the UK on 15 September.  The Learjet has been made available on previous occasions for missions of mercy or for medical reasons.  We must now move on to implementation of the recommendations of the HIQA report into Meadhbh not being transferred to London on time on the first occasion.  I hope, as we all do, she makes a full recovery.  I saw reports that a transfer back to Ireland was refused.  While not a doctor, it seems to me that an aircraft with 300 other people would not be a suitable place for a young patient in her condition.  If there is a request for her transfer back to Ireland, it will be granted.The cost for the participation of the Government jet in the Maltese air show came to €13,095.  This is based on 6.7 hours return flying at an average hourly direct cost of €1,940.  This is not a request that comes across my desk when I deal with ministerial transport.  The reason for the participation in the show was because the Maltese authorities supported us in transporting Irish citizens out of Libya to Valletta.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 to 5, inclusive, together.The Cabinet committee on social policy met on 21 September.  No other Cabinet committee meetings have been held since 22 July 2011.  However, the Government and the Economic Management Council have met several times.  Meetings of five Cabinet committees are scheduled between now and the end of October.Each Cabinet committee is supported by a senior officials' group, generally chaired by an assistant secretary in my Department and with membership drawn from the relevant Departments.  As in previous Administrations, supporting Cabinet committees is a core function of the relevant policy division in my Department and is undertaken in addition to other responsibilities of the staff involved.A second Secretary General has been appointed in my Department, whose responsibilities include managing support for the Economic Management Council, which has the status of a Cabinet committee, and reporting to the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on matters relating to the council.  No staff have yet been assigned on a full-time basis to that committee.  It is supported by staff from my Department with assistance from other Departments as appropriate.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	146	Today some 394 patients are lying on hospital trolleys across the country.  The largest number consistently is at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, County Louth.  Last night 48 citizens were on trolleys.  Over the summer, there were many reports on the long delays in filling vacancies for junior doctors.  Some recent reports have stated some junior doctors from abroad had to return home due to long delays in processing their registrations.  Did the Cabinet health sub-committee deal with these issues during the summer recess?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	147	When the Government took office, we originally did not establish a Cabinet health committee.  However, due to the importance of the issue in question, a health committee date has been set for the next fortnight.  It will focus on this and several other issues.  Over the summer, the Government, the Minister for Health and the Economic Management Council have been active on this issue.I have visited several hospitals myself and spoken to patients on trolleys.  It is always regrettable that this occurs.  The special delivery unit, established by the Minister for Health to examine waiting lists and patients on trolleys, has made some interesting preliminary findings which will require a co-ordinated plan to be put in place to see such backlogs do not arise as they have consistently done so over the past 20 years.  I have also visited Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda.  It is trying for patients to be left on trolleys, often in uncomfortable positions.  Those at the front line of the health services do extraordinary work in dealing with a legacy and a structure inadequate for our current needs.  Over the time ahead, this will be a priority matter for the Minister for Health.  The Cabinet health committee will receive reports on several issues from the Minister, the HSE and so forth and we will have an opportunity to discuss those matters in the Chamber.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I am astonished a Cabinet health committee has not even been established yet.  I was in the Chamber when its establishment was announced with a great brouhaha.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	149	It was not announced with a great brouhaha.  After a review of the Cabinet sub-committees, I considered there should be one for health and we set it up.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	150	There are 400 people on hospital trolleys.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	151	Yes, I accept that.  An extraordinary amount of money is spent on the health system.  Last week, nurses on a ward I visited informed me the wastage in their hospital is extraordinary.  The Deputy has a part to play in resolving these issues.  The Minister for Health and the Cabinet health committee will focus on these issues.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	152	What is the function of the Cabinet sub-committee on health?  How does it relate to the responsibilities of the Minister for Health and the HSE?  The committee was established to underline the urgency of the needs of the health service and deal with the dramatic and disastrous effects of health cutbacks.  It beggars belief that it has not yet met when hospitals across the country are suffering traumatically from the swinging and savage cuts imposed by the HSE on the Taoiseach's watch.  The Taoiseach referred to wastage in the health services, as if it were a cover for the dreadful crisis that exists in them.  The Government cut the number of beds in Blanchardstown hospital by 20%.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	153	These are matters more appropriate for the Minister for Health.  This question relates to Cabinet sub-committees.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The problem is that doctors and other health staff are treating too many patients and have been told to cut back.  This is Alice in Wonderland stuff.  Who is going to bring sanity to this?  Who will restore the services that have been cut, so that our health services are safe for patients?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The health committee meets on Wednesday, 5 October.  Its purpose is to provide political oversight of the Government's programme to change the structure and nature of the health service to ensure it is fit for purpose in 2011 and onwards.  This programme will also achieve greater efficiencies, a far more effective level and a better quality of service both for those who work on the front line and, in particular, patients.  The forthcoming meeting will also be an opportunity for the sub-committee to focus on the oversight of delivering priority services for the Government.Apart from this, over the summer I called together the Department of Health and HSE for a barnstorming session about several health issues.  The committee was set up at the end of June and it will meet in October to provide a political oversight of the decisions being taken by the Minister for Health.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	156	Which Ministers are on this committee?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	157	The Minister for Health and his two Ministers of State, Deputies Kathleen Lynch and Shortall.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	158	A Cabinet committee means it is composed of Cabinet Ministers.  It cannot be a Cabinet committee if it just comprises one Minister and two Ministers of State.  By definition, it should involve several Departments.  Will the Taoiseach clarify what other Ministers and Departments are on this committee to implement the health service commitments in the programme for Government?  The programme and the Fine Gael general election manifesto committed to changing completely the funding model for hospitals in the coming months.  Hospitals were to lose their secure funding and move to a per capita system.  This is a fundamental, substantive and radical change.  It beggars belief that the Cabinet sub-committee on health has not met to consider this issue or the commitment’s implementation.  There is no urgency attached to the implementation——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	159	We are on Question Time.  Could we have a question, please?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	160	We are and I will put my question.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	161	The Deputy's Government had no Cabinet sub-committee on health at all.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	162	That there has been no meeting illustrates that no urgency is attached to the implementation of the proposal to change the funding model.  I suspect there is no real commitment.  Will the Taoiseach clarify this point?
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	163	The Deputy did not commit to abolishing the health boards, but that is what occurred.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	164	Neither the Minister for Health nor the Government have an idea as to how to bring about the health insurance model they touted during the election campaign.  It was to be the panacea for all of the ills of the health service.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I remind the Deputy that this is Question Time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	166	Does the Taoiseach agree that there is a lack of genuine commitment to the idea?  There was no depth or substance behind it, as revealed by the facts that the Cabinet sub-committee has not met and, judging by his answers, the Taoiseach does not know who its members are.  It is far from a satisfactory situation.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	167	We are on Question Time.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	168	Why is the sub-committee being delayed and will the frequency of its meetings be increased in the coming months to prepare for the dramatic commitment in the programme for Government?  I disagree with the fundamental principles of the Government's proposal.  It is a dramatic overhaul.  May I revert on Question No. 5 after the Taoiseach has answered my supplementary questions on Question No. 3?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	169	Yes.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	172	I chair the committee on health.  The Minister for Health is its convenor.  It is also attended by the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for primary care, Deputy Shortall, and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability, equality and mental health, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  They are the members of the committee.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I thank the Taoiseach.

This party and the Labour Party have a programme for Government.  It is very clear in respect of health and we intend to implement that over the lifetime of the Government.  Even Deputy Martin will understand that, after six months, it is impossible to shift the leviathan that is the health service in a way that will answer all of the questions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	189	The sub-committee could meet at least once.  It has not met.

We have a lot of committees to deal with and a lot of meetings to attend.  This is a priority and the Minister for Health has been focused on that since his appointment and will continue to be so along with his two Ministers of State and the members of this committee as part of Government.  Deputy Martin will have his opportunity to have his say here.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I asked about the proposal in the programme for Government regarding a fundamental change in the funding model for the health service in terms of each hospital's secure funding.  The Taoiseach did not answer my question.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thought the Deputy was asking about the Economic Management Council.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I asked about the reason for the delay in the health sub-committee meeting and whether this means the programme's proposal will be delayed.  The hospitals' funding model is a substantive issue.Turning to Question No. 5, the Government has made much of the Economic Management Council, so much so that many Government briefers, including the Labour Party's briefers, have stated that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, is jealous of its members because he cannot get on it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I asked about the committee's structure.  The House is not allowed to examine its work or its structure.  The economic division of the Taoiseach's Department, which was open to parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests, seems to have been moved out and replaced by the Economic Management Council, which can hide every aspect of its work behind Cabinet confidentiality.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	231	This is Question Time.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	233	Does the Taoiseach not agree that this is the exact opposite of the transparency and accountability promised in the Government's programme?  How will the roles of those co-ordinating the work of this Cabinet sub-committee differ from the roles of those who co-ordinate other sub-committees?  Will the Taoiseach agree to make its work open to parliamentary questions and freedom of information requests?  He can do so.  There is no reason for it to be a Cabinet sub-committee.  He could change its status if he wanted to do so.  I ask him to do so in the interests of transparency and accountability so that we might ask questions about the economic work of the Department of An Taoiseach.  The Dáil used to be able to do this but can no longer because that work has been subsumed within the Cabinet sub-committee.  That we cannot ask parliamentary questions or make freedom of information requests means there is no accountability.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	234	The Deputy is well aware that the confidentiality of discussions at Cabinet and Cabinet committees is protected by Article 28.4.3° of Bunreacht na hÉireann, which states:The confidentiality of discussions at meetings of the Government shall be respected in all circumstances save only where the High Court determines that disclosure should be made in respect of a particular matter—i in the interests of the administration of justice by a Court, orii by virtue of an overriding public interest, pursuant to an application in that behalf by a tribunal appointed by the Government or a Minister of the Government on the authority of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into a matter stated by them to be of public importance.These are the circumstances in which the confidentiality of discussions at Cabinet committees can actually be broken.  In the light of constitutional provisions, the well established precedent in regard to questions on Cabinet committees is for the Taoiseach to answer matters of a factual nature.  It is important to note that this is part of the requirement of the Constitution.  The Deputy was on this side of the House for 14 years and would not answer anything about Cabinet committees or anything else.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	235	This is pathetic.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The programme for Government made all sorts of commitments about transparency and accountability.  I asked the Taoiseach a simple question.  Will he open up the work of this council to the Parliament via parliamentary questions?  It is his decision, his choice.  I do not need any further recitation of the Constitution.  I am well aware of it.  The Taoiseach chooses to hide the economic work and move it to a Cabinet sub-committee on economic management and so forth.  It is the Taoiseach's decision, not anyone else's.  He should not keep mentioning ten years or the like.  He made the choice and the promises.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	238	Deputy Martin made choices, too.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	239	Will he agree to open up the work to the Dáil?  "Yes" or "No"?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Have we got an answer?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	241	I will tell the Deputy why.  The Economic Management Council is attended by myself and the Tánaiste, the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is backed up by Secretaries General from appropriate Departments and senior officials from Departments depending on the issues that are under discussion.  It is a very effective way of streamlining business to bring to the Cabinet, where decisions are then made.  These decisions obviously become public and the Deputy has an opportunity to debate them arising from opportunities in the Dáil and elsewhere.Rather than have interminably long Cabinet meetings discuss everything, the Economic Management Council, the agenda of which is determined by the Tánaiste and which is now supported by the appointment of a second Secretary General, streamlines the work on very important issues that are then brought before the Cabinet.For instance, if the Economic Management Council decides on an issue, its decision goes to the Cabinet for approval.  If approved it becomes a Cabinet decision and once that is made public, the Deputy is entitled to ask questions about it, comment on it and debate it in the House.  I hope that clarifies what we are doing in that room.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That does not answer the question.

While the Taoiseach may have the right to maintain Cabinet confidentiality regarding the activities of the Economic Management Council — I have asked questions on this several times — we are in a very grave financial and economic situation that is very fluid.  We and the public read daily about the next twist or turn in the economic and financial crisis in Europe and how it may have an impact on us.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Will the Deputy ask his question?

When the Cabinet makes decisions, as the current one is doing, they are made public and the House then has an opportunity to raise them, either during the Topical Issues debate or during other appropriate debates in the Dáil, or at meetings of Oireachtas committees.  Perhaps the Deputy would like to participate in the Cabinet discussions himself, but he cannot do so yet.  He may have to wait a while.  In so far as it is possible to answer the Deputy's question——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 to 16, inclusive, together.I attended a meeting of the Heads of State or Government of the euro area in Brussels on 21 July.  The meeting was convened to consider the financial stability of the euro area as a whole and future financing of the Greek programme.  We took important decisions in three key areas: improving Greek debt sustainability, addressing the risk of contagion and committing to improve the eurozone's crisis management.  We agreed to support a new programme for Greece and, together with the IMF and the voluntary contribution of the private sector, to cover fully its financing gap.  The agreed official financing of an estimated €109 billion will be designed, notably through lower interest rates and extended maturities, to improve decisively the debt sustainability and refinancing profile of Greece.We also agreed important enhancements to the EFSF.  It will get more flexibility to intervene in the areas of precautionary assistance; recapitalisation of banks through Governments, including in non-programme countries; and secondary market interventions in exceptional circumstances on the basis of an analysis by the ECB.  Member states are now engaged in the process of legislative change needed to enable the new arrangements to enter into force.  For our part, the necessary Bill was passed last week and now has been signed.  The measures agreed in July were based on a clear acknowledgement that the Greek situation is different from that of other countries and required an exceptional response, including as regards the participation of the private sector.The decisions made at the meeting will mean that the EFSF will lend to Ireland at a significantly reduced rate.  This will apply not only to moneys yet to be drawn down, but also to future interest payments on existing loans.  This is a saving in the order of several billion euro over the term of the loans.  In this regard, I very much welcome the decision of the European Commission to propose that loans under the EFSM will come with zero margin.The meeting in July recognised Ireland's resolve to press ahead with implementation of our programme, and expressed its strong commitment to our success.  We tasked the President of the European Council, in close consultation with the President of the Commission and the president of the Eurogroup, to make concrete proposals by October on how to improve working methods and enhance crisis management in the euro area.  This work is now being advanced, including through bilateral consultations at official level.With regard to corporation tax, there was no new language agreed at the meeting.  We agreed to engage constructively in what I expect to be a very long debate on the Commission's CCCTB proposal, and more generally in the structured discussions on tax policy issues provided for within the framework of the euro plus pact.  There was nothing new in this and the Government's position on the substance of the matter has not changed in any respect.In the period since the end of July, there has been significant and ongoing engagement at Minister for Finance level and through associated euro area structures in giving effect to the measures that we agreed.  I will meet several colleagues when I attend the meeting of the Eastern Partnership in Warsaw later this week.  The next meeting of the European Council is scheduled for Brussels on 17-18 October.  It will discuss economic policy, including, I anticipate, any developments regarding the eurozone, preparations for the G20 summit and climate change.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Given that Questions Nos. 6 to 16, inclusive, are grouped, I would like to be as fair as possible in calling Deputies.  Deputy Gerry Adams, whom I call first, tabled Questions Nos. 6 and 7.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I object to the Taoiseach's lumping together so many questions.  It happens so often.  I have specific questions on Questions Nos. 6 and 7.  Have there been discussions with our European partners about the centralisation of fiscal powers?  Has the Government ruled out this development?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	275	I have had no discussions with European leaders on fiscal powers.  There have been quite a number of meetings and contacts between Ministers for Finance and officials dealing with the technicalities of the decisions made in July.  They were signed off on recently at official level and confirmed by the ECOFIN Ministers.  The answer to the Deputy's question is that I have had no discussions about the centralisation of fiscal powers.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	276	Will the Taoiseach give a very clear commitment that he will rule out the Irish Government going along with the centralisation of fiscal powers?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	278	With respect, the Taoiseach must know what it means because it has been proposed by some of the larger states.  Having taken monetary power, they want to take fiscal power.  It has been proposed by the French and Germans, and the Taoiseach needs to stand very firmly against it.  He should take the opportunity to decide on this now.  He should pretend we are talking about taking money from old people.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I do not contemplate any such move.  The Deputy is well aware of the fluidity of the debate, both in and outside Europe, on Europe's difficulties.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	280	This is a fundamental question concerning sovereignty.  One reason the Economic Management Council has nothing to discuss is because it has ceded so much economic power to the European Union and International Monetary Fund.  It is very clear that the Government is standing with the bankers.  Has it taken the opportunity, given what is happening in the eurozone and the crisis, to tell the relevant authorities it will not pay the €31 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide?  The Government is committed to pay €7 million on 2 November.  This would build approximately 200 schools or create 8,000 jobs.  I do not understand it.  Last week, I was in New York and met very senior Wall Street stockbrokers who were astounded the Government was not burning the bondholders and that it pays all of this money to a toxic bank.  These people trade in their sector.  As we see the eurozone crisis deepening, is it not time for the Taoiseach to seize the moment and for once stand up and state we will not pay the money?  The Government is committed to removing €3.6 billion from the budget and at the same time will give €3 billion to Anglo Irish Bank.  What does the Government owe Anglo Irish Bank?
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	281	It was a commitment of the previous Government.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	283	Who Deputy Adams meets in New York is his own business.  All I can state is that the Minister for Finance has pointed out quite clearly that from his discussions with Mr. Trichet and Commissioner Rehn the question of burning senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank is something they would not contemplate.  When this was mentioned in Greece, the contagion immediately spread to other larger economies, as Deputy Adams is well aware.  What was signed off by my predecessor was a promissory note to Anglo Irish Bank and INBS for €30 billion, that is, €3 billion over each of ten years——
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	284	Wow.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	285	——with no interest to be paid until 2013 when the blended rate will be at more than 8%.  The extent of moneys that might be saved by the State, while quite substantial at approximately €100 million in the case of Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, is much smaller than what could be achieved through the agenda now being pursued by the Minister for Finance, which is to deal with an extension of time and maturity in respect of the promissory note which was signed off by the previous Government.  The savings there could be far more substantial than risking the enhanced reputation the country has achieved in the past six months internally in Europe and externally in the wider world from economic, business and political perspectives.  It is a balance of looking at the risk to what we have achieved in the past six months and where we want to go.  We want to be able to return to the bond markets ourselves and borrow at appropriate rates and be in charge of our economic future, which is the intention of the Government in implementing our programme.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The Taoiseach just stated that Mr. Trichet, who is the President of the European Central Bank, told the Minister for Finance he would not contemplate the burning of the bondholders and specifically that the €3.5 billion to be paid to unsecured Anglo Irish Bank bondholders by the end of June had to be paid.  What is the point of the Taoiseach going to EU summits if it is not the political leaders, supposedly elected by the people of Europe, who make the decision but bureaucrats at the European Central Bank who obviously represent the interests of the major European bankers, bond dealers, hedge funds and the rest of it?  Does this not turn what is supposed to be democracy on its head?  In July, did the Taoiseach discuss with Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy the issue of €3.5 billion?  The Minister for Finance stated categorically in Washington in June that Anglo Irish Bank was a warehouse of debt and speculative investment and the Irish people should not pay.  Did the Taoiseach follow up this by stating to Frau Merkel and Monsieur Sarkozy that the Irish people do not owe this money and that we will not pay it?
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	287	We know what the question is; the answer is another thing.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	288	The selfsame bureaucrats of whom Deputy Higgins speaks fund the entire Irish banking system to the tune of almost €150 billion at a 1.5% interest rate and his own salary is paid out of it.  It is important to attend meetings of EU Heads of Government because agreement was reached on our proposal that interest rate reductions be applied.  The savings that have and will emerge from this are very substantial.  Of course in the general discussions that have taken place the Minister for Finance has been very vociferous about the problem of Anglo Irish Bank and raised the matter long before he came into government.  However, the consequence of dealing with it in the manner spoken about by Deputy Higgins became evident very abruptly in Italy when it was mentioned in the case of Greece.I am not sure what is the opinion of Deputy Higgins but the country has changed direction and there is now a very different reaction to us internationally, which is far more favourable.  Political leaders in Europe look at this country as possibly being the first to emerge from this economic challenge with an enhanced reputation and heading in the right direction to be in charge of our own economic destiny.  I remind the Deputy that at the end of the day, the ECB and Mr. Trichet have been very favourably disposed towards Ireland and its citizens and €150 billion at 1.5% is a very substantial contribution from people whom Deputy Higgins claims are just bureaucrats.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The point is that there would be no need for tens of billions of ECB funding if the policy of the predecessor Government now being followed and implemented by the Taoiseach——

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I do.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	293	The Taoiseach stated in opposition to my demanding the non-payment of the €3.5 billion, which the Minister, Deputy Noonan, stated should not be paid, that we should look at what happened when there was a threat that this might happen in Greece.  What happened?  The sharks in the financial markets ratcheted up interest rates for Italy and Spain and terrorised the political leaders of Europe who all fell on their faces in front of them.  Who runs Europe?  Is it a dictatorship of the markets, as the Taoiseach just indicated he cannot make sovereign decisions because he fears unelected unaccountable entities in the financial markets?  Is this not what the Taoiseach is stating?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	294	It was not Europe which downgraded the United States.  The markets have their own way of making their impact, obviously with devastating consequences in some cases.  I remind Deputy Higgins that the amount of unguaranteed residual bonds in Anglo Irish Bank is €3.46 billion, comprising €2.86 billion from Anglo Irish Bank and €600 million from Irish Nationwide.  A voluntary burning of these bondholders might, depending on the price offered in any LME, liability management exercise, and taken up by the bondholders, raise approximately €100 million.  As I pointed out, the savings that might be achieved in dealing with the extent of the promissory note would be of a far greater proportion than this and would not destroy the rising credibility and enhanced reputation that Ireland has achieved with our European colleagues and internationally in the past six months.

I agree with what Deputy Adams stated on the unsatisfactory nature of grouping all of these questions, which are on quite different topics.The Taoiseach is spinning a great yarn about the international response to Ireland and our approach.  The bottom line is that the response to Ireland is due to the fact that very severe budgetary measures were taken which hurt many people and which were politically unpalatable.  The budget passed last year included a correction of approximately €6 billion.  The international response to this has been——

It has nothing to do with what the Taoiseach did since he came into power because he has taken no substantive decision on anything.  It is wrong of him to keep pedalling and spinning this yarn.

Does he agree that the core issue is again about what politicians told the Irish people in a fundamental communication?  I told people in advance of the election that there could not be a unilateral burning of bondholders.

The Tánaiste said that it would be Frankfurt's way or Labour's way.  I will put the core question to the Taoiseach again because I did not get an answer.  Does he not agree it is now on the agenda?  Perhaps he cannot comment publicly but it is being talked about openly all over Europe and internationally that Greek sovereign debt is up for discussion.  That is something we never contemplated in terms of a major burning of sovereign bondholders.  That appears to be on the agenda in Greece——

In response to discussions both with Commissioner Rehn and Mr. Trichet, the question of writing down debt in respect of senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank is something that when it was mentioned in the case of Greece had an automatic spill-over in respect of the Italian economy and the situation arising there.  The Minister rightly pointed out that he would reflect on the discussion but that a far greater opportunity for this country exists if we can do something about the promissory note.  Perhaps Deputy Martin might like to explain to me why no interest rate was applied on it for two years, which is only going to apply as a blended rate of over 8% from 2013.  Why did he not tell that to the people in the beginning?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	332	We did.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	352	——concerning the consideration of reforms to the governance of the EU and the eurozone.  Instead, the Taoiseach is feigning ignorance as if he is not contemplating anything or there is nothing going on——
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	353	Deputy Martin should leave out the padding.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	354	——but that is happening.  Will the Taoiseach answer me as to what preparations and submissions he has made about those fundamental issues?  This House at least should have the opportunity to debate it.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	355	There is nothing going on.  Does Deputy Martin remember who said that?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The Taoiseach has repeatedly dodged my final question and he has used freedom of information legislation to avoid answering it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Will the Taoiseach specifically answer the question on the corporation tax issue?  He must show us the exact deal he rejected in March.  He must show us the text of the Van Rompuy position he rejected in March.  We must contrast that with the deal from last July.  What is the difference between the two?  I asked the Taoiseach in Parliamentary Question No. 14 the differences between the text agreed by the Taoiseach at the July meeting of eurozone leaders concerning Ireland's corporation tax and the text proposed in March.  It is a simple question which could be answered if the Taoiseach were to publish both texts.  That would be the end of the matter.  Let the people judge.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	363	He made a proposition.  He did not circulate a text generally to leaders in respect of what Deputy Martin is talking about.  He made a suggestion to deal with a particular problem but that was not accepted.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	364	Does the Taoiseach acknowledge what he said previously?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	365	That problem has been dealt with and Deputy Martin and his colleagues should move on and deal with the crisis.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	366	The Taoiseach said in the House on the record that he did circulate a text.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	367	I am sorry, but Deputy Martin should not interrupt.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	368	In respect of Deputy Martin's comment about propositions for the next Heads of Government meeting, before that meeting on behalf of the country I intend to participate fully in a comprehensive discussion about what opportunities we might propose in a European sense that will help our colleagues in the European Union and the eurozone to deal with this particular crisis.  As I pointed out to Deputy Martin, the issue that was raised in the Financial Times in January of this year in respect of the rate of margin of the fund was first raised by Ireland and was eventually carried through by a decision both of the European leaders and ECOFIN.In respect of Greece and the current position, I expect that every country that has signed on for the conditions in July will go ahead and implement them, as we have done and are doing in this country.  As the position evolves we will reflect on changing issues around the world but we will contribute a number of proposals that we think are important.  They will come through my Department, the Ministry for Finance, the EMC and the views of our colleagues around the table because there are issues that would be opportune for this country to put forward and we will voice those articulately.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	369	An intergovernmental conference must be called.  That is basic in terms of treaty change.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	370	The Heads of Government are meeting.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	371	What is the formal Irish position?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	372	No.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	373	If Deputy Martin has a supplementary question he should ask it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	374	The Taoiseach acknowledged in the House before the summer that there was a text in existence.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I call Deputy Boyd Barrett.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	376	He is now saying there was not even though he acknowledged previously that a text was produced by Mr. Van Rompuy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	377	Mr. Van Rompuy did not.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	378	He cannot keep on changing his story.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	379	He did not circulate a text.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	380	The Taoiseach said that Jean-Claude Trichet ruled out the possibility of bondholders taking some of the burden of a crisis they created.  Let us be clear; it is they, the bankers and others, who created it.  Did he explain why?  What is the rationale for saying that we cannot force bondholders, the financiers and the speculators, to bear the burden?  The Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong, but from what he is saying it seems to me that the reason is because it might spread the contagion into the rest of Europe.  Is another way of putting that simply that what they are doing is defending the interests of German, French and British banks which are in fact responsible for the problem?  In one sense is it in our interests or in the interests of dealing with the crisis as it is not to acknowledge that they are partly to blame for it and that they must share the burden?  In these talks with either Jean-Claude Trichet, the eurozone leaders in general or the EU-IMF, I wonder if there is any discussion about the fact there is a serious body of opinion — not left-wing opinion but main stream opinion, including Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman in The Irish Times today, and the UN Committee on Trade and Development — which is saying the overall policy of prioritising bailing out banks and bondholders has a big cost attached because it imposes austerity on ordinary people.  It is not just causing extreme suffering but is also strangling the real economy.  It is contracting demand and the entire package will fail because the measures being taken to prop up the bankers and bondholders are ensuring there cannot be economic growth or recovery.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	381	Could the Deputy ask the Taoiseach a question?
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The question is whether there is any debate.  Does the Taoiseach put that point to Trichet or the rest of them — that there is a serious body of opinion saying not just that it is unfair but that we are committing economic suicide?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Of course there is a discussion about these things and that is why, in part, ECOFIN ministers have been meeting regularly over the summer.  It is also a fact that, as the situation evolves and changes rapidly here, at the end of the day politicians will have to make decisions in respect of their governments and collectively within the eurozone and the European Union.  That is why each government has a responsibility to implement the decisions taken at the meeting in July.  Ireland is doing that.  As these discussions continue and as the situation changes, everything is discussed, from the crisis in particular countries in Europe and the impact of this infecting banks if one writes down debt from senior bondholders.  However, at the end of the day politicians and leaders have to make decisions.  In so far as that is concerned, we will contribute our part.Nobody has been discussing with me the question of a new treaty for Europe.  We have the Lisbon treaty and my view is that should be fulfilled and on a co-operative basis we should implement what we have to do to re-establish the primacy of the European Union, in which I believe very strongly.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	384	In effect, is the ESM and the souped-up EFSM with corresponding or connected centralised economic governance criteria — the so-called six-pack — not a new treaty?  It will centralise economic policy as a condition of bailing out countries and give more control to unelected and unaccountable central European authorities to dictate economic policy to countries that are in these mechanisms.  The Taoiseach is not directly answering the question as to whether there is any discussion at all about these serious voices which are saying that the austerity strategy may not just be unfair, as many of us believe it is, but also counterproductive.  Is there any discussion of that or acknowledgement that these people might have a point?

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Is there any discussion at all on that?
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	392	Will the Taoiseach please reply to that?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	393	The Lisbon treaty set out its conditions clearly and they have been adopted by all the countries.  The europack-plus and the six-pack are voluntary commitments involving voluntary co-operation.  Participation is a matter for each individual country.  Of course, everybody agrees that the indigenous economy here has been very flat for a long time, but it is important to note that the projections for next year are that we will see for the first time an increase in employment and growth.  In so far as the preparation of budget 2012 is concerned, we are taking almost €5 billion out of the economy in what is a very difficult situation.  Despite the fact that the interest rate reductions will provide almost €1 billion in savings to the Irish taxpayer annually, that does not mean we can turn our backs on sorting out the problem with our public finances.  As has been pointed out on many occasions, we are going to do that in respect of getting the debt level down to 8.6%.  We are not able to put a figure on what that actually means until all the Revenue and tax information comes to hand.I agree, however, that it is necessary to stimulate the indigenous economy, which is why the Government made its decision in respect of PRSI, VAT reductions, the minimum wage and a range of other issues.

I have never come across more people who actually want to get stuck into creating their own business, employing people and getting on with it.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	398	As regards the European Central Bank, why has the Taoiseach not sought a proper meeting either with the outgoing ECB president, Jean-Claude Trichet, or the incoming one, Mario Draghi, to deal with these fundamental issues?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	399	The Minister for Finance spoke to Mr. Trichet on a number of occasions at recent meetings.  I always speak to him when the EU Heads of Government meet.

He went off to meet him specially and had a serious discussion with him, as well as with Commissioner Rehn.  Obviously, when the new ECB president is appointed, we will arrange to meet with him.Written Answers follow Adjournment.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	404	No.  Before agreeing that No. 10, Supplementary Estimate for Public Services [Vote 42], should be taken without debate, will the Taoiseach give the House an assurance in regard to Ms Teresa Treacy of Clonmore, County Offaly, who is in Mountyjoy jail at the behest of a powerful semi-State company, the ESB?  This is totally inappropriate when there is an alternative.  Will the Taoiseach intervene to ensure this situation is resolved urgently?

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	426	I do not ask for a debate, I want to give the reasons for my opposition to the proposal.  We asked last week for a debate on the eurozone crisis and this crisis trumps anything on the agenda for today or tomorrow in its urgency and importance.  I find it extraordinary that this Parliament is the last place to debate and discuss the eurozone crisis when the entire world, at this stage, is discussing it and some fundamental questions regarding the eurozone which pertain to Ireland, are on the agenda while this House is not discussing it.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	427	That has nothing to do with the Second Stage of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	428	It is a question of the allocation of time.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I do not care what the Deputy thinks.  It has nothing to do with the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	431	Deputy Martin can seek a debate on the Order of Business.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	432	I call Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  Has Deputy Ó Snodaigh a difficulty with the Insurance (Amendment) Bill?

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	434	I suggest the people on the backbenches have a rest, please.

I find it strange that tomorrow's business is being ordered today when there will be an Order of Business tomorrow.  I note the proposal that Second Stage of the Insurance (Amendment) Bill shall be brought to a conclusion tomorrow at 6 p.m.  I object to the guillotine and also to the fact that tomorrow's business is being ordered today.  I am also concerned that all too often, the opening speaking slots are now being reduced to 15 minutes on a number of Bills, in place of the previous arrangement of 30 minutes.  I acknowledge the opening speaking slot can be shared.  With regard to this Bill, a spokesperson might only want to speak for 15 minutes and that is his or her choice, but the reduction of time should not become common practice.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	436	I call Deputy Boyd Barrett on behalf of People Before Profit.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	437	I also object to the guillotine being imposed on the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  I spent an hour at a Department of Finance briefing this morning trying to get my head around the quagmire of the collapse of Quinn Insurance and this Bill is yet again a case of the ordinary policyholders having to bail out this failed entity which is tied up with Anglo Irish Bank bondholders and all the rest of it.  Policyholders will be forced to pay a significant levy for at least the next ten years or so.There is no provision in this Bill to go after the €200 million in personal wealth which Seán Quinn gave to his children, yet ordinary people will be carrying the can.  In that context, it is outrageous that something as important and as complex as this Bill should be rammed through the Dáil in such a short time without sufficient time for a debate and then to have a guillotine imposed on it.  I urge the Taoiseach to give proper time and not to impose a guillotine on this matter which has far-reaching consequences for many citizens.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I call Deputy Joe Higgins on behalf of the Socialist Party.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	439	It is very objectionable that the Government begins this new autumn session in the same way as it went about its business during the first session of this new Dáil, with guillotines virtually every day.  The same parties when in opposition were highly vociferous for many years against the Fianna Fáil Administration, for the same type of guillotines.  What has changed?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	441	There is a different way of doing this.  The Taoiseach did not even ask to see how many speakers might wish to contribute to a particular Bill and then make an estimate on that basis.  He has proposed the blunt weapon of the guillotine and it is not acceptable.This is another bailout on the backs of ordinary people for the machinations of the sharks in insurance and high finance and it deserves to be teased out in great detail.  I fully agree with the objections to this guillotine.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	442	It is time for people to get real.  I refer to the question raised by Deputy Martin in respect of a debate on the eurozone issue.  The European financial stability Bill was debated here until late last Tuesday and Wednesday and this provided an opportunity for everyone to contribute.  I have asked the Chief Whip to arrange a two-hour debate on this issue next week.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	443	Two hours?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	444	Yes.  If the Deputy was listening to me instead of texting on his phone, he would know that last Tuesday and Wednesday we discussed the European financial stability Bill until late.  I say to Deputy Higgins and Deputy Boyd Barrett, who come in here and bleat away every day about the ordinary workers——
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	445	They are just following what the Taoiseach did last year.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	446	——that the sale of Quinn Insurance to Liberty will be raised in the High Court on 4 October and the question will be asked as to whether provision has been made in law for this levy to be paid.  If the Minister for Finance had allowed this collapse, the cost would have been something of the order of €2 billion.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	447	That assumes there were no alternatives.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	448	I remind the two Deputies who comment about the ordinary workers that 1,600 jobs are being protected in this case, in the Border counties and these are ordinary workers.  It is about time that people faced that reality.  This Bill has to go through the House.   Second Stage will be dealt with today and tomorrow evening, Committee and Remaining Stages will be taken from 6 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.  We can have Deputy Martin's debate on the eurozone and listen to his proposals next week.  This is the reason for the urgency in dealing with the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  The 1,600 jobs are of critical importance and the reduced saving brought about by the Government decision is very considerable.  The reason for the quick passage is that the matter comes before the High Court on 4 October.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I will put the question.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	451	I remind Members that only three minutes remain on the Order of Business.  Any private discussions should take place outside the Chamber.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	452	The Taoiseach indicated in his previous response that he would allocate two hours for a debate next week on the eurozone crisis.  I reiterate my disappointment that our request last week to facilitate a debate this week on the euro crisis was not met.  It is incredible that the entire world is discussing the crisis and we, as a national Parliament, do not seem to have the facility to do that.  It reflects badly on the Executive and those who table the agenda that they cannot allow for a reasonable debate.  It is regrettable that we are not having that debate this week.  Will the Taoiseach ask the Chief Whip to have a meaningful dialogue with the other Whips regarding the length and the organisation of the debate next week and, if possible, to include a question and answer session on key issues?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I repeat that it is opportune for Opposition Whips to raise requests at the Whips meeting.  The House sat late on both Tuesday and Wednesday evenings last week to discuss the financial stability Bill——
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	454	That is a separate issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	456	That was urgently guillotined.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	458	We wanted it this week.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	460	Will there be questions?

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	462	We have called for a debate on the euro crisis for the past two weeks.  I raised this with the Taoiseach two weeks ago and he promised me a debate.  He referred me to the my party Whip.  Deputy Ó Snodaigh raised it at the Whips' meeting.  Deputy McDonald then raised it in the House last week.  We have ended up bringing the Government kicking and squealing to the House to have this debate.  It is not good enough, as this is one of the biggest crisis facing the EU.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	463	I am glad the Deputy has succeeded in getting it raised.

He can have a debate next week, put a structure to it and have his Whip raise at the Whips' meeting the time he requires.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	467	Deputy Boyd Barrett is not a member of Sinn Féin and Deputy McDonald is not the party Whip.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	468	The Taoiseach announced a by-election in Dublin West on 27 October, which means the writ needs to be moved and ministerial orders made.  I notice today with some alarm that the poles are rapidly filling up with posters of the growing list of presidential wannabees, which might indicate that in Dublin West there will be no space for the peasants if the Taoiseach delays.

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	470	That is not a matter for the Order of Business.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	471	Will the Government move the writ and put the process in place this week?  Laochra Fáil can do it but they seem to be a little hesitant at the moment.  Perhaps they will announce their intentions here but the people of Dublin West are anxious to begin the debate.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	472	We are out of time in accordance with Standing Orders.  The Taoiseach will make a quick reply.  I cannot do anything about it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	473	If the by-election is to be held on 27 October, the writ must be moved between tomorrow and 6 October.  We have changed the regulations in order that by-elections will be held within six months of being caused.  However, this by-election has resulted from the unfortunate death of a member of Fianna Fáil and Deputy Martin's party will be given the opportunity to move the writ in accordance with precedent.  I understand he will possibly do that on Thursday.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	474	That has not been decided.  It will be within the period.

#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important topic.  I have raised the issue of fuel laundering and fuel abuse on many occasions.  Fuel smuggling and fuel laundering has been a problem here for many years but since the beginning of this year in particular when the sulphur content in off-road diesel was reduced, which made it much more difficult to detect illegal fuel, it has reached epidemic proportions.The extent of the problem was illustrated when one of the fuel laundering operations uncovered this year was believed to be making a profit of €100,000 per week.  Between 2005 and 2011 I understand nine illegal operations were uncovered.  Up to June this year five were uncovered and I believe there have been more uncovered since then.  One uncovered had the capacity to launder up to 18 million litres per annum, with a loss to the State of €9 million.The question also arises as to how this fuel finds its way to the public.  It is being sold in service stations that are rented on short-term leases.  With a duty difference of almost 40 cent per litre, up to €15,000 per tanker is being made by these illegal operatives.  These operations have been taken over essentially by criminal elements that have moved from the drugs trade or other criminal undertakings but the effects on the people who are upholding the law, paying their taxes and giving employment is that hundreds of jobs are being lost in the legitimate industry as a result of this activity.The solutions to this problem are a detection method; a DNA tracer to be put in place; and an audit trail to find out where the fuel is being bought and to whom it is being sold.In regard to fines and penalties, an issue arose this year where a garage was closed for one day and fined €3,000.  If these people are making €14,000 a tanker that is not a very punitive sentence.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	480	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to speak on this important issue of fuel laundering.  This problem was recently brought to my attention by several forecourt owners and a major petrol supplier in my constituency of Meath West who informed me that approximately 15 to 20 filling stations which closed and have since reopened are now selling laundered diesel.  The same forecourt owners now state that their turnover on petrol and diesel has diminished significantly as a result of the availability of laundered diesel throughout Meath West.Statistics given to me suggest that in Ireland alone there are 120 to 150 diesel laundering providers throughout the country costing the State a possible €200 million to €300 million in lost taxes per year.  These illegal suppliers are selling the laundered diesel at a profit of 40 to 45 cent per litre and are selling petrol, which has been bought legitimately as petrol cannot be laundered in the same manner as diesel, at cost price.  As they say in the business, petrol is a loss leader and is only a means to encourage customers onto their premises to buy the illegal laundered diesel and to spread the word among the general community that it is available for sale.  This washed diesel is detrimental to the engine of any vehicle, rendering the engine useless if used over an approximate period of time, for example, 12 to 18 months.The forecourt owners in my constituency have said that if this practice continues their business will fall under even more stress and it will eventually result in the loss of staff at the very least.  Revenue and customs officials are doing their best to address this problem but as soon as one illegal supplier is closed down another takes over the closed facility and the cycle of events commences again.In the light of the evidence of the great extent of this illegal activity I sincerely hope that better control can be gained over this problem, whether by putting more dyes into the diesel or examining the possibility of having one form of diesel available in the market.  Having spoken at length to the forecourt owners, business people and members of the general public in my constituency who have been directly affected by the effects of laundered diesel I urge that this matter be given further consideration by the Government and every effort made to eradicate the availability of this illegal laundered diesel.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	481	I thank both Deputies Butler and O'Mahony for raising this important issue that affects not just the people in the constituencies both Deputies referred to but adversely affects the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to raise tax legitimately and keep in business those suppliers and producers who are paying their taxes legitimately.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for the collection of mineral oil tax and for tackling the illicit trade in fuel products, that they are very conscious of the threat to the Exchequer posed by the laundering of markers from mineral oil.  Marked gas oil, commonly known as green diesel, is subject to mineral oil tax at a rate of €88.66 per 1,000 litres, while the rate for auto-diesel is €465.70 per 1,000 litres.  In addition, marked gas oil is subject to the lower VAT rate of 13.5%.  The resulting total tax differential is around 50 cent per litre.  As the Deputies rightly point out, there is enormous advantage for those people who deal in this illicit trade.This differential offers a very significant incentive for "oil laundering", that is, the removal of the chemical marker from marked gas oil to facilitate illegal use as auto-diesel.  This is a particularly serious offence, carried on by organised criminal gangs.  It carries a maximum penalty of €126,970 or five years imprisonment, or both.  Any equipment used for oil laundering and any vehicle found to be transporting laundered fuel is liable to forfeiture.As with other illegal activity, it is not possible to provide a reliable estimate of the extent of oil laundering activity. The Revenue Commissioners, who are responsible for mineral oil tax and the control of mineral oils, are tackling this issue on a number of fronts.There has been ongoing extensive enforcement action, which has led to the detection of oil laundries and the prosecution of individuals and companies involved.  To confirm what Deputy O'Mahony said in his opening remarks, in 2010 four oil laundries and over 288,000 litres of laundered oil were seized.  Also in 2010, nine retailers were found dealing in laundered oil, and eight haulage companies were detected using laundered oil.  There were four convictions for laundered oil offences.Already in 2011, eight laundries have been detected and more than 300,000 litres of laundered fuel have been seized.  There have been 11 arrests resulting from these operations, and eight tankers and 19 other vehicles have been seized.  Several retailers and haulage companies have also been implicated.  One can see in the difference between the figures for 2010 and 2011, even with the incomplete information we have for this year alone, the very substantial rise in this activity even in a 12 month period, to which the Deputies have referred.Revenue has played an integral role as part of a cross-Border multi-agency organised crime task force which has been set up specifically to deal with the illicit trade in mineral oil in the Border area.  The multi-agency operations are planned to supplement the normal ongoing level of Revenue detection and enforcement activity.  Since its inception this combined force has successfully targeted a number of illegal operators in the Border area.

First, will the Minister indicate if extra resources have been allocated this year to the detection of these sites and service stations?  Second, regarding the fuel, what is the up to date scientific diagnosis?  Has science overcome the detection problem, which was increased because of the low sulphur level in diesel?  Has it caught up with that?  Is illegal fuel more detectable than it was six months ago, for example?  If not, we still have a problem.
#RayButler	unknown-#RayButler-party	unknown-#RayButler-dob	unknown-#RayButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	485	The Minister for Finance said that a laboratory in Sligo is starting to look for better quality dyes to put into the diesel.  Does he know any more about that?  There are environmental concerns because much of the laundered diesel is washed through the Turkish sand that is coming into the country in container loads, all of which has to be dumped somewhere, so that will have to be looked into.  I agree with Deputy O'Mahony that the hands of Revenue and Customs and Excise officials are tied because of cutbacks and the fact that they need more staff.  In my area, the problem is getting out of hand and we will lose many jobs because legitimate petrol stations will close.  I have heard concerns about the issue from people who have visited my constituency office.  Business has gone slow at a petrol station on the Dublin Road and the owner is worried that he will go out of business if the situation continues.  Fuel laundering is having a knock-on effect throughout the country.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Deputy O'Mahony made a crucial point on the science of the subject and asked, given that these substances can be washed through, whether we are any closer to developing a means whereby we can be confident that the diesel people buy is the diesel they expect.  It would be wrong to say we have resolved the issue, but we are working closely with all concerned to come up with a solution.  Licensing is an important issue and we have made sure that licences have been revoked or refused on the basis that we cannot stand over the authenticity of the supplier concerned.  That is another important aspect.Both Deputies asked what more can be done.  In discussions with the Revenue, the Minister is considering measures in the context of the upcoming finance Bill to strengthen further the controls relating to all aspects of mineral oil trade.  Where further measures are considered necessary, they will be put in place.  There is a high level of co-operation between the Revenue and HM Revenue and Customs in the UK.  Increased co-operation is the order of the day.  I am not going to second guess that and go into further detail, but I assure the House and the two Deputies who raised this important issue that high-level co-operation is taking place between all agencies on this island to stamp out this practice, and this co-operation will increase further to ensure we deal with this scourge.  I assure the Deputies that, even in these difficult times when the Revenue, like any public sector organisation, is finding it difficult to meet requirements because of the number of people employed in the public sector, we are determined to stamp out this practice and use every measure we can, in co-operation with our colleagues in the UK, to beat the problem.  I thank the Deputies for highlighting this important issue.

At the outset, I extend my deepest sympathy once again to the family of Dean Regan Russell.  Words cannot express the grief of a family that loses a young child in such a tragic manner.  I salute the courage of this family, who have bravely spoken out in order to help prevent the deaths of other children.I attended Dean's inquest at the Dublin Coroner's Court last Friday at the invitation of the family and it was a most harrowing experience.  The coroner found that Dean Regan Russell, aged 23 months, died in Crumlin children's hospital after a fatal accident at his home in Tralee in January this year.  He found the toddler had been strangled by the looped cord of a window blind.  Dr. Farrell stated this was not the first such child fatality and he was prompted to repeat his previous call for this type of blinds to no longer be manufactured.  He stated that the configuration of looped cord has, in his experience, caused the deaths of several infants in the Dublin area alone.  He described it as a dangerous design and undertook to contact all relevant authorities to reiterate the recommendation that such blinds should no longer be manufactured and are a danger, a recommendation that I emphasise he has had to make previously.  The European Commission has become aware of ten such fatal accidents involving children aged between 15 months and 36 months.  They occurred in Ireland, Finland, the Netherlands, Britain and Turkey in the period 2008 to 2010, and in the US 119 fatalities involving corded window coverings are reported to have occurred since 1999.When the Minister, Deputy Bruton, replies, he might refer to the draft standards for window blinds that have been issued for public comment by the National Standards Authority of Ireland.  The closing date for comments was 23 September, which was last Friday, the very day of Dean Regan Russell's inquest.  As I said in my submission, the draft standards are inadequate and should be withdrawn.  In light of the coroner's findings, the standard required is that looped cords for blinds should no longer be manufactured and their sale in Ireland should be prohibited in law.  Simple alternative designs are readily available.I reaffirm the call for the banning of looped cords, a call I have made at the request of the bereaved family of Dean Regan Russell and on behalf of others bereaved in this way.  If the Government took this course, which I commend to the Minister, we would become a world leader in this aspect of child safety.  I will certainly continue to press for this outcome.  In the meantime, I ask that we urge people with looped cords on their window blinds to cut them and apply tassels or other simple safety devices to prevent children from being endangered.  I observe that this type of cord is widely used here in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the interest of setting a good example, perhaps the same should apply here.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	492	First, I sympathise with the family of Dean Regan Russell and indeed with Deputy Ó Caoláin, who I know is a close family friend.  I cannot begin to imagine what an impact this has had on the family.As the Deputy knows, both the National Consumer Agency and the National Standards Authority of Ireland have a role in the matter.  The National Consumer Agency has primary responsibility for non-food consumer safety, and it has been campaigning to achieve safer standards since 2002.  It was at the agency's initiative that the 2009 standard that is in place was brought in, and on foot of that it placed a warning on its website, followed it up with a consumer guide on safety, wrote to 222 manufacturers and retailers, ran a nationwide market surveillance campaign and visited 97 retail outlets.I understand from the reports that the allegation is that the products that were sold in 2010 were not in compliance with the 2009 standard, but I mention those facts to give Members a picture of the effort that was put in at that stage.  People have recognised that the existing standard is inadequate.  That is what prompted the request for a revision of the standard.  It does not cover made-to-measure blinds and various other cases are excluded.  A new standard is being developed and the closing date for comments was extended to give people a chance to make further submissions.I am told that the difficulty with the call for prohibition from the coroner, the family and indeed Deputy Ó Caoláin, which I can understand, is that Ireland cannot unilaterally introduce such a ban.  It would have to obtain approval from the European Commission and other member states, and the advice I am receiving is that such approval is unlikely to be granted because work is being undertaken on improving the standard.  The best approach is to have products installed with the safety features that make them safe rather than to ban a particular type of blind.  That approach is being pursued here, limiting the risks from loop chord mechanisms by requiring manufacturers to fit risk prevention measures in the design and by supplying proper safety advice with the product.  I am advised that the prohibition route is not open to Ireland for unilateral action.  The approach being adopted is to make all products safe.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I thank the Minister for the reply but it is a great disappointment.  It beggars belief that we cannot take the simple and reasonable steps to protect young children, a number of whom have lost their lives in this jurisdiction, particularly after the coroner made his informed recommendation on Friday.  Must we wait for others across the European Union to recognise the real dangers involved?  It is most regrettable we cannot take the required steps and be world leaders in child safety measures.I ask the Minister to review the decision and to examine the information he gave us today to see if there is not a way to impose an alternative design on the manufacturers.  It is not a case of putting them out of business; far from it.  Undoubtedly, however, easy adjustments can be made to remove the loop from the blind chord.  That is the key danger.If we were talking about a defective car, would we for a moment to say that we would not arrange for the recall of defective cars because we had to wait for some other jurisdictional call for said to happen?  If defects were found in a range of vehicles provided in this country, we would take the required step to ensure they were recalled to enhance road safety, not only of the owner and user but of all road users.  Why would we not apply the same thinking for this particular danger that exists in the homes of countless numbers of our citizens, if not in all our homes?  The alternative is readily available.  Manufacturers will not be at any greater expense and we will have removed a real threat to infant children and would be applauded internationally for it.  I recommend the proposition for that reason.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	494	A process of consultation on the new standard is under way and I will ask that the Deputy's comments are taken into account.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	496	The complication is that many of these products were sold in accordance with the standards then prevailing.  It is not open for the Government to call unilaterally for a recall of products issued in accordance with the standards that then prevailed without entering into compensation issues.  We would be talking about huge numbers being recalled and I am not sure that is feasible.The advantage of going the European route is that these standards will apply to every manufacturer and every product that comes into Ireland will be covered.  The National Consumer Agency will police this and oversee it.  The new standard will incorporate the safety measures that make looped blinds safe; that is the important thing.  They will not allow a product to continue to be manufactured if it does not adhere to the safety standard that Deputy Ó Caoláin and I and every other parent want to see.I will take into account what the Deputy said because he has every reason to make a strong plea and I will ask that his submission be closely reviewed in the process to see what we can do.  Those, however, are the constraints that make it difficult to do what the Deputy proposes.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	498	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this issue for debate this afternoon.  I also thank the Minister for being here in person to take it.A curtailment of the ambulance service in west Cork is being planned by the HSE.  It is introducing plans to remove ambulance cover from both Skibbereen and Castletownbere between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m. and to replace the service with two rapid response cars.  Neither car will have patient carrying capability and will be manned by a single paramedic.  The effect of this action will be that a population of more than 82,000 people in the wider west Cork area will be serviced by just two ambulances, one in Bantry and one in Clonakilty, from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. seven days a week.  To say this is causing considerable stress is an understatement, not least given the overstretched ambulance service that already exists in the area.  There is a strongly held belief that this action will endanger lives.There is one ambulance for every 37,000 people in the country.  The withdrawal of 24 hour cover in Skibbereen and Castletownbere means this figure will rise in west Cork to one ambulance for every 57,000 in County Cork.  It is unacceptable in the 21st century that such a situation could prevail.  I appeal to the Minister to reverse the decision.I acknowledge the second phase of the proposal from the HSE will restore the 24 hour ambulance cover in Castletownbere.  While I welcome that move, it negates the reason for removing cover from the area in the first place.  I question the logic of restoring cover in Castletownbere but not in Skibbereen, which is the second busiest, and occasionally the busiest, 999 ambulance station in west Cork, second only to Clonakilty.  If Skibbereen loses its 24 hour cover, it effectively means the vast area from Rosscarbery west to Mizen Head will not have a service after 8 p.m. seven days a week.  This will have an adverse impact on people in Leap, Glandore, Union Hall, Castletownsend, Skibbereen, Baltimore, the islands, Ballydehob, Schull, Goleen and Crookhaven.Another key issue to consider in the context of this proposal is that the SouthDoc service in Skibbereen closes at 11 p.m., meaning that if a GP is needed after hours, a doctor would have to come from Bantry, 30 km away.  The HSE has a target time of ten minutes as a maximum time for treating a trauma casualty on-site before transporting him to hospital.  The withdrawal of 24 hour cover from Skibbereen will mean that in respect of advance paramedics or ambulance after 8 p.m. or doctors after 11 p.m., this target time will not be met.Heaping more pressure on the situation are future plans by the HSE to shut the minor injuries assessment unit in Bantry Hospital at night.  All trauma patients will have to be taken to Cork city during these hours, leaving a minimum three hour absence of ambulance cover from the west Cork area.  In the recent Roscommon case, the closure of the casualty department was offset by the provision of extra ambulance cover.  The opposite will happen in west Cork, where ambulances will be taken out of service while the minor injury unit in Bantry is closed.  There are honest fears about this and I appeal to the Minister to look at this sympathetically.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	499	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.The HSE has confirmed to me that no ambulance stations are closing in Cork and Kerry.  The opposite is true, as stations move to on-duty status and away from on-call.  This means highly trained paramedic crews will be on-site in the stations to respond to calls rather than having to go to the station when called out.  It also means that resources can be deployed dynamically, based on need and demand patterns, rather than simply by location, producing more flexibility and responsiveness.  This will produce better response times for the people in the Cork and Kerry area and a better service.Skibbereen will, under the new system, move to full 24 hour on-duty cover.  Paramedics will be present at all times, with an on-duty ambulance during the day and an on-duty rapid response vehicle at night.  The dynamic delivery model means that an on-duty emergency ambulance will be available from within the region as required.I note that ambulance staff sought the elimination of on-call working, that it has already been reduced from 44 hours to 16 hours per week and that it will continue to decrease on a phased basis as part of the improvement of services and response times in the region.  There are ongoing discussions with staff on implementing the proposals, including Skibbereen.  The HSE and unions are committed to this process.The national ambulance service proposals are phased. In phase 1, stations in east Cork with night time on-call will have crews rostered on-duty 24-7 and 365 days a year.  The more rural stations of Castletownbere, Kenmare, Bantry, Skibbereen and Caherciveen will be in later phases.  The service will be evaluated after each phase.Current evidence suggests patient outcomes can be improved by better treatment and stabilisation at the scene, followed by ongoing treatment and transport to the most appropriate centre, even if that means longer transport times.  On-duty service will enable a modern emergency response service involving paramedics, advanced paramedics, community first responders and GP out-of-hours services working together to respond to emergency situations.  This approach is consistent with international best practice and will ensure compliance with HIQA response times and quality standards.On-duty rostering is one of several service enhancements.  Other developments include improved arrangements for control and dispatch, practitioner deployment and inter-hospital transfers.  All of these will allow the national ambulance service to provide a better, safer, more comprehensive and more efficient emergency ambulance service to the people of Skibbereen and to the Cork and Kerry region as a whole.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I thank the Minister for being here in person and I thank him for his reply.  However, I refer him to the second paragraph of his reply.  He states:Skibbereen will, under the new system, move to full 24 hour on-duty cover.  Paramedics will be present at all times, with an on-duty ambulance during the day and an on-duty rapid response vehicle at night.  The dynamic delivery model means that an on-duty emergency ambulance will be available from within the region as required.That is simply not the case.  That information is inaccurate.  The official who drafted that response is, at worst, lying and, at best, grossly ignorant.  The story is as I outlined in my contribution.Does the Minister agree that removing an ambulance from a geographic area as expansive as west Cork will endanger lives?  Would the Minister, or any other Deputy, if he were suffering a heart attack, prefer to see a car with one individual in it to an ambulance with trained paramedics?  We are at least 90 minutes from Cork city.  What the HSE is proposing will endanger lives.I would be interested in meeting the official who drafted the Minister's response.  If this is believed, the same individual would believe the tooth fairy.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	501	I will address both points.  I stated that an on-duty emergency ambulance will be available within the region as required.  I did not say it would be available within the area.  Regions cover larger areas.  Perhaps that is what the official who drafted the reply means.  Nevertheless, I would be happy to arrange a meeting between the Deputy and the individual who drafted the reply.  I am not in the business of giving disinformation to the House.  If the information is not accurate I would take a serious view of that.Second, the concept of the golden hour is 40 years old and comes from military field medicine.  All international experience and experts, and our own emergency department consultants and specialists, are clear that it is far more important to receive appropriate treatment in a bigger centre than to receive immediate treatment at a smaller centre where the full skill-set may not be present.  That we now have paramedics on-site to commence treatment while an ambulance is on its way makes a huge difference to outcomes for patients.  Paramedics and advanced paramedics are a great addition to the service and will result in many lives being saved rather than the reverse.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I welcome the Minister to the House to take this issue.  It is very topical, given the threatened industrial action in the mid-west region.Earlier this year, the Minister addressed the annual conference of the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  He clearly and concisely outlined his vision of the importance of nurses in the delivery of front line services in health.  He also said he was conscious of the importance of working together and of listening to nurses and those who provide front line services.  In view of what is happening in the mid-west and of the concerns expressed in Beaumont Hospital and University Hospital Galway, it is evident from his inaction that the Minister is not listening to the nurses or to representatives of those providing front line services, who are expressing grave concern about overcrowding in accident and emergency departments and patient safety.As I looked at Deputy Reilly's website and at old press releases dating from his time as Fine Gael spokesperson on health, I got tired of reading press releases headed "Reilly slams".  Reilly was continually slamming the Minister and the HSE.  He was doing nothing but slamming at that time. He has now been Minister for six months.  I am a fair and reasonable person, but the Minister's only major press release, PR or media hype in that time was about the sacking of the board of the HSE.  He subsequently stated that he was assuming personal control of policy and budgetary parameters.  Now the HSE is consistently being fingered as being responsible for budgets and for the management of hospitals.  There is a disconnect and a failure of the management chain between the Department of Health, through the Minister, and the HSE.  It is evident that his proposals, made with wild abandon, to abolish the HSE and set up new management structures is not working.The Labour Relations Commission, LRC, has offered to intervene tomorrow in the industrial action in the mid-west.  The front line service providers, to whom the Minister said he would listen, are clearly stating that patient safety is at risk.  They say shortcuts will be taken and there is a major concern about accident and emergency services in the mid-west and in University Hospital Galway.  The closure of the accident and emergency department in Roscommon is putting added pressure on other accident and emergency departments.I do not mind a volte-face or a U-turn, but the Minister is embracing reconfiguration with the zeal and enthusiasm of a latter-day convert.  Every day, he is driving this reconfiguration, sometimes without discussion with local communities.  This is evidenced by the comments of Deputy McCarthy about the reconfiguration of ambulance services in west Cork.It is time the Minister took a hands-on approach.  He must not wash his hands of this issue.  He should roll up his sleeves and get involved, as he said he would do, in ensuring a proper chain of management from the Department of Health, through the Minister who would be accountable to the House, to the HSE.I am also disturbed by the Government's lack of urgency in dealing with health issues.  The Minister established a Cabinet sub-committee on health which has never met.  It is six months since the Government came into being but the Cabinet sub-committee on health has never met.The Minister must be honest about the commitments he has made.  His policies are not working on the ground and patients' lives are being put at risk.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	505	There was an overrun of €70 million in our hospitals from last year.  We are trying to retrench the runaway and out of control budgets in our hospitals which occurred during the first three months of this year under the watch of the previous Government either by intent or through neglect.  On top of this, to address the financial morass in which the previous Government left the country we must take almost €1 billion out of the health system, keep the service running and put in train a reform programme.I put it to Deputy Kelleher that this industrial action serves no useful purpose.  I am concerned about the further stoppage planned for tomorrow and urge the INMO to reflect on the impact this action will have on the general public and on patients in particular.  I find it hard to reconcile that the nursing unions are taking this industrial action given they are parties to the public service agreement which focuses, in particular, on the need to deliver services in the changed circumstances in which, thanks to the previous Government, we now find ourselves and on co-operation between management and unions.The shared focus of all those working in the health service should be on safeguarding front line care in the face of our continuing very serious economic situation.  The Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick was €16.2 million over budget at the end of July 2011 and has had to take measures to reduce its spending, including a prohibition on staff overtime and the hiring of agency staff.  As in all areas of the economy and the public service, we must focus on solutions, including efficiency, flexibility and innovative working in order to maintain our public services in the face of economic crisis.Industrial action by any group will simply exacerbate our problems and, in the case of nurses, may impact negatively on patient care.  In recent months, I established a special delivery unit, SDU, under the leadership of Dr. Martin Connor.  The SDU is working to unblock access to acute services by improving the flow of patients through the system.  It is focusing initially on emergency departments and will be working to support hospitals in addressing excessive waiting times for admission to hospital.  The SDU is due to submit a report on the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick to me on Thursday.  I look forward to the co-operation of all health service staff with the special delivery unit, which is aimed at ensuring that patients receive safe and appropriate service when they present at our acute hospitals.In the case of Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick, it is vital that we focus on solutions, including the introduction of new rosters and redeployment of nurses to areas of greatest need in the hospital.  New rosters become even more important in light of the need to maintain and improve services in a financially constrained context.  As regards pressures in the emergency department, it is clear that risk issues arising from overcrowding should be regarded as a problem with which the entire hospital must deal.  Hospital management cannot accede to a demand that no extra beds should be put up in wards.  This is provided for in the escalation policy and represents a lesser risk than allowing an unsafe build up of trolleys in the emergency department.

Are we questioning the validity of the INMO to raise serious issues of concern with regard to patient safety?  It has tried everything else and now believes industrial action is the only way it can get the Minister to listen to its concerns in respect of the serious shortcomings that are now evident in the health services.  The Minister can engage in all the historical debates he wants about how we got where we are.  When in opposition, he knew where we were and gave many commitments in that regard.  Political choices are being made every day by this Government.  The Government made the political choice not to burn the bondholders and to provide funding for job creation but has made no political choices in regard to the critical area of patient safety and health provision.  The only political choices it has made in this area relate to increased capacity and ensuring reconfiguration of hospitals throughout the country is expedited while not ensuring proper procedures and extra facilities are put in place in the context in particular of University Hospital Galway, which the Minister, amid fanfare, also visited.I wish the special delivery unit and Dr. Connor well.  However, it is evident from what is happening in the North that this will run out of steam very fast.  While in the short term it might assist in addressing hospital waiting lists, the situation in Northern Ireland illustrates it will not work in the longer term.  The special delivery unit informed the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick of its proposed visit well in advance.  It is clear that management of the accident and emergency department was changed in advance of that visit.  Staff have told me there were few hospital trolleys on the corridors at the time of that visit because of the forewarning by the special delivery unit of its visit.  The Minister should refer the Mid-Western Regional Hospital Limerick to the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, which should undertake a full audit of it in the context of patient safety.  Nurses are not taking industrial action for the good of their health rather they are doing so for the good of patients.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	509	The Deputy's suggestion that we should send HIQA into the hospital until such time as the SDU report is available and the actions recommended therein are taken is nonsense.  If there is a need to send HIQA in following that report, consideration will be given to the matter.  It is to misunderstand what the SDU does to say that it must make a morning raid in great drama.  Its purpose is to examine, analyse and issue recommendations to support management and staff of the hospital.  I have no doubt it will make those recommendations.  As I said earlier, I cannot see how taking industrial action will improve or make safer the situation for patients.The Secretary General of the Department of Health, Mr. Michael Scanlan, received a letter today from Mr. Fergal Hickey, President of the Irish Association of Emergency Medicine, the salient part of which states:Many Irish hospitals are overcrowded.  The fact that they or the HSE choose to manifest all of the overcrowding in the emergency departments is inappropriate, clinically unsafe and inequitable.  There is now irrefutable international and national evidence that preferentially condensing all of a hospital's overcrowding into one single clinical area, the emergency department, increases the risk of avoidable death and harm not only for those hospital in-patients who remain in the emergency department because no bed is available for them but also for emergency department patients who can be discharged and those who do not wait in the ED to be seen because of excessive delays.  A better, fairer, safer way to treat all patients during times of emergency department overcrowding is by implementing a simple patient care practice used successfully in other developed health care systems, namely, the full capacity protocol.  Full capacity protocol is an internationally validated protocol.  The IAM believes strongly that the full capacity protocol, FCP, is a reasonable measure and fair approach to the significant dangers created by overcrowding of emergency departments.  One or two additional patients admitted to multiple hospital wards at times of significant emergency department overcrowding is much safer and more clinically just for all patients than is allowing tens of additional patients to be detained for more than six hours in a single dangerously overcrowded compromised emergency department.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	510	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves Ireland's participation in an EDA Category A Project on Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) Protection and an EDA Category B Project on Maritime Surveillance (MARSUR) pursuant to section 2 of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.I will provide some brief information on the reason the Government is presenting this motion and approving Ireland's participation in these two projects.  In commending the motion to the House, I will briefly outline the function of the European Defence Agency, EDA, and the background to the two programmes in which Ireland wishes to participate.Following the Government's approval, Ireland joined the EDA when it was established during the Irish EU Presidency in 2004.  Ireland participates in the framework of the agency and I represent Ireland on the EDA steering board along with defence Ministers of all participating EU member states.Since its inception, the EDA has made significant progress on the development of many military capability projects and programmes in support of EU crisis management.  The primary reason for Ireland's participation in the EDA, is to support the ongoing development of Defence Forces capabilities for international peace support operations.  One example is improved communications and network systems for use on the ground in operations.The two projects identified, chemical biological radiological and nuclear, CBRN, and maritime surveillance networking, MARSUR, will further contribute to Defence Forces capability development.  I fully support the Defence Forces participation in these projects.  Pursuant to the provisions of the Defence (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 I am seeking Dáil approval for Ireland's' participation in them.The joint investment programme on CBRN has been initiated between the EDA, the European Commission and the European Space Agency.  Intelligence-based threat assessments at national, EU and international level, all indicate an increased likelihood of terrorist organisations and insurgencies using chemical, biological or radiological agents, against both military and civilian targets.  Apart from possible international threats, there are also potential national threats in this area.  It is recognised that non-state actors and organised criminal groups could develop the capability to use improvised CBRN devices.Regardless of the source of any CBRN hazard, an attack or exposure could inflict major casualties amongst security forces, emergency responders and unprotected civilians.  There is also the potential for CBRN hazards to arise from accidents or natural disasters as was the case following the tsunami in Japan recently.One of the primary reasons for our involvement in the CBRN area is to ensure the safety and improve the capacity of the Defence Forces operating in a CBRN environment.  The scope of the EDA project on CBRN ranges from the identification of emerging technology to CBRN protection as an operational capability.  The programme will involve research, technology development and demonstration activities.The MARSUR project will facilitate a group of interested member states joining together to further develop a recognised maritime picture, RMP, exchange network.  New developments will include modifications to improve data exchange, allowing for secure exchange of confidential or sensitive information, using data from a range of systems and covering different maritime areas.  The nature and level of information exchanged is determined, monitored and controlled by each participating member state.In developing the RMP exchange, network, the European Union, including Ireland, will be better able to combat drug trafficking, smuggling, illegal immigration and migration and international terrorism.  Better exchange of information will also play a part in protecting maritime trade, the maritime environment and natural resources.The MARSUR network also has a role to play on the economic and industrial front.  Ireland's maritime area contains natural resources with a potential value in excess of a trillion euro including mineral deposits, fossil fuels, marine life, fisheries and wind and wave energy.  Marine transport leisure and tourism, seafood, renewable ocean energy and marine biotechnology are niche areas that can contribute to Ireland's economic recovery and are, therefore, worth protecting.Ireland's involvement in this project will enhance information sharing and knowledge transfer between member states and build working relationships based on mutual trust with other European agencies at the operational level.  Through our involvement in drug seizures, success depends on the co-operation of our national and international partners.The cost of participating in the two projects will be met from the proposed allocations for the Department of Defence.  Participation in the CBRN project will be approximately €150,000 over four years while participation in the MARSUR project is estimated at €105,000 over three years.Both projects will deliver benefits in enhancing Defence Forces capabilities.  The CBRN project will offer the Defence Forces access to research, studies and developments arising from the project that will complement work undertaken and investments made over the past several years by the Defence Forces.  Participation in the MARSUR project will play a major part in the fight against drug trafficking, in the protection of our natural resources and in safety and security at sea.

The Minister has outlined the benefits of both initiatives.  The MARSUR project is of particular interest to me as I believe we have failed to maximise the value of our maritime resources.  As the Minister stated, participation in this programme will allow us to gain information about fisheries stock management, as well as the better use of our maritime resources such as wind and wave energy production.  Given the extent of our coastline, we have a serious problem with illegal drug importation.  Any project that can assist us in tackling this problem must be supported.The nuclear accident in Japan earlier this year highlighted the type of non-terrorist attack threat posed by natural disasters outside our control.  We must ensure Ireland plays its role in European investigation of such events.Even ten years on from 9/11, chemical weapons are a threat to the world and to Ireland, regardless of its neutrality.  It would be criminal for us to decide to distance ourselves from any efforts to tackle this threat.
#JonathanOBrien	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-party	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-dob	unknown-#JonathanOBrien-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I welcome the opportunity to discuss this motion today.  The draft schedule of this week's Dáil business circulated last Thursday had this issue down for approval without debate which would have been regrettable.  As I have always stated the importance of discussing all defence motions, I welcome the decision to have a debate on the motion.The motion at first glance seems to be innocuous enough.  Most Irish people would agree Ireland should be involved in chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear, CBRN, protection.  Sinn Féin has always been opposed to nuclear energy for safety reasons and it will continue to oppose the use of nuclear energy.  On checking the EDA website to get some background information I noticed this quote:Despite arms control agreements and initiatives, some nations and some non-state actors continue to acquire chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear capabilities.  This trend is most pronounced in areas of chronic political instability where the EU may be called upon to mount operations.Additionally there have been many instances of terrorist and other ad hoc groupings that embrace CBRN technologies as a powerful means of pursuing their interests.To address these risks, the EDA, in its own words, has been successfully tackling CBRN capability development issues since the beginning of 2006 with good and tangible results.The maritime surveillance project asks Ireland to sign up as willing participants to monitor "activities, associated with and occurring in the maritime domain, which could impact on the security, safety and environment of the European Union and its member states".  In 2006 when this project was officially launched, the aim was to create a network whose overall goal was to avoid duplication of efforts in this area by using existing naval and maritime information exchange systems.While we all agree on co-operation to tackle illegal drug importation and human trafficking, I am more than uneasy with the term military co-operation.  The question always remains "co-operation with whom exactly?".  A 2008 document on the EDA website concerning EU-NATO collaboration and the role of the EDA gives us some insight into this question.  It states:The fact that EU member states that are also NATO allies have only one set of armed forces and must optimise their available resources means that coherence between the EU and NATO is an absolute necessity.  The two organisations simply must co-ordinate their activities.  Existing NATO standards, concepts and military requirements should be used wherever applicable.Regarding CBRN issues, this document further stated: "With regard to chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear threats, the EDA mainly focuses on biological threats while NATO focuses on the chemical threats."It is obvious the EDA, through the CBRN and MARSUR project, is all about the EU being a vital part of the NATO infrastructure.  For this reason, Sinn Féin will oppose this motion.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	513	I oppose the motion.  The European Defence Agency, EDA, is about promoting the arms industry.  This is not appropriate for any state that is interested in promoting peace.  It is certainly not appropriate for a state that claims to be militarily neutral.  On any moral ground, we should have nothing to do with a body that was set up for the sole purpose of promoting, developing and expanding the arms industry.  Will the Minister or anyone justify the arms industry to me?  An obnoxious trade, it is concerned with developing ever more sophisticated means of killing people.  It is ironic that Members of the opposite side of the House and members of former Governments often get up on their high horses to denounce violence as being morally obnoxious while supporting Ireland's involvement in an agency whose sole purpose is to assist the companies that specialise in producing lethal weapons.It is an issue of great concern that the EDA's executive recently told the European Parliament that unmanned drones will be tested in Europe's civilian airspace by 2012.  Some of these will be bought from Israel, which has been testing them against Palestinians.  According to some estimates, these barbaric instruments have killed as many as 7,000 innocent Afghani men, women and children in horrific bombing raids on villages and towns.  It is beyond me why we would have anything to do with an agency or policy that promoted the use of such weapons.There is no question but that I will oppose the motion.  Will the Minister or anyone on the Government side justify support for the arms industry?  What is good about it?  What possible benefit does it have to humanity and the world?  When people are homeless and jobless and lack adequate health and education resources and when there is extraordinary poverty in the world, is it not obscene that Europe and Ireland want to promote an industry that takes resources from those areas humans need to survive and prosper and use them to develop industries designed to produce the means to destroy human life?  It is beyond me.I will oppose the motion strongly.  If the Government has any shred of moral sensibility or commitment to the notion of Ireland as a neutral country, we should stand out against the development and expansion of the EDA, which is nothing more than an agency to promote the interests of arms companies that profit from death.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I am sure we all feel better for that.  I thank Deputy Calleary for his considered and constructive contribution to this debate.  The issues we are dealing with are of importance.  I never fail to wonder at what particular world Deputy Boyd Barrett inhabits.  He has yet again given us an example of his contrived, selective ideological outrage.  I presume he approves of our engagement in peacekeeping.  I presume he approves of the Defence Forces engaging in the Lebanon to try to maintain a degree of peace and contribute to a troubled region so that a part of might not be engaged in conflict.  I presume he approves of the work done by individuals such as Colonel Mike Beary of our Defence Forces who is trying to train members for an army in Somalia to protect the existing Government there and end the slaughter by the Al-Shabaab group.  I recall Deputy Boyd Barrett, in his detestation of NATO, believing that the residents of Bin Ghazi should be left to be slaughtered by Colonel Gadaffi's forces when the French and the British intervened to try to prevent the murder and mayhem that Colonel Gadaffi intended.  If we lived in an ideal world, no one would have guns, but it seems to be his perception that, when the Defence Forces are engaged in serious peacekeeping operations, they should be equipped with water pistols rather than any meaningful military supports of any description.This project is not about armaments, their manufacture or spreading them around the world.  In the context of EDA programmes, Ireland participates in the joint investment programme on force protection.  This is a research and technology programme that focuses on technologies for protecting EU armed forces against threats such as snipers, booby traps and improvised bombs.  Force protection involves measures to protect defence forces engaged in peace support and crisis management operations overseas.  It is one of the main factors considered when undertaking any operation.  As such, the development of enhanced capabilities in this area is one in which our Defence Forces have a great interest.  It was only last week that a report was published about the circumstances in which three members of the Defence Forces tragically lost their lives in 1989 as a consequence of an improvised explosive device.  Are we supposed to send our Defence Forces out untrained, helpless and without modern technology to ensure that they can properly engage——

This State and its Defence Forces have a constructive contribution to make in this regard.These projects are not just important in these areas — I thank Deputy Calleary for his support again — but also in intercepting those who try to bring drugs ashore in this country and in dealing with those engaged in terrorist activities.  It may be comforting to Deputy Boyd Barrett to take the view that we should have no security forces of any description and should leave ourselves liable to the State being used by terrorists to launch an attack on London during the London Olympics.  Perhaps we should have no intelligence gathering of any description.  This is not the role that I intend the State to play, nor is it the role that the Government intends to play.The projects that I have brought to the attention of the House also offer potential for Irish-based enterprises and research institutes to participate in the development of new technologies and to create commercial opportunities to exploit these technologies in other markets.  Enterprise Ireland will promote and manage any aspect of Irish research and development participation in these two EDA projects in association with the Department of Defence and within the scope of its functions and areas of competence as well as providing for our engagement at the frontiers of technological development.  What has been proposed to the House also creates the potential for some additional employment in worthwhile projects in this State.  I commend the motion to the House.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."I welcome the opportunity to address Dáil Éireann today on the Insurance (Amendment) Bill 2011, which was published on Tuesday, 13 September 2011.  At the outset, I wish to outline the main reason it is necessary to have the Bill passed speedily by the Oireachtas.  The joint administrators of Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL, hope to conclude the sale to Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Limited, a joint venture between Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank on 4 October and they are to report to the High Court that day to give effect to this.A key requirement which will have to be demonstrated to the court by the joint administrators is that there is a commitment in place from me, as Minister for Finance, to advance the necessary funds to the insurance compensation fund in the following weeks.  A precondition of such an advance is a recommendation from the Central Bank that such funding is required.  At present, there is €40 million in the fund, and the Central Bank has advised that in order for the joint administrators to be able to meet their financial obligations in the last quarter of this year, €280 million will have to be provided to the fund and has accordingly recommended that I make the necessary advance.  However, as Deputies will appreciate, before I can make such an advance the proper legal basis has to be in place, thus explaining the urgency of the Bill.  Approval from the High Court for the deal will complete an important milestone in the administration process, which will see the sale of QIL completed and ensure the future of the workforce is secure.The main reason for amending the legislation is changes in EU law in the non-life insurance sector since the fund was last used.  The Attorney General advised that our existing legislation was not compatible with EU law and should be amended.  Accordingly, the Bill proposes to amend the Insurance Act 1964.The Bill comprises ten sections, the main elements of which are set out as follows.  Section 1 is the definitions section, and the purpose of this provision is to acknowledge that the principal Act is the Insurance Act 1964.  Section 2 amends section 1 of the principal Act, which is the definitions section of that Act. The purpose of this provision is to introduce a number of new definitions to section 1 of the Insurance Act 1964 and update the existing definitions for "authorisation", "policy" and "insurer".  These will allow the scope of the scheme to be extended to cover all insured risk in the State, except specific excluded risks.Section 3 amends section 2 of the principal Act, which deals with the insurance compensation fund.  This a technical provision and its purpose is to make a number of minor cross-referencing changes to section 2 of the Insurance Act 1964, consequential on the amendments made in this Bill.Section 4 deals with payments out of the fund in respect of insolvent insurers.  The purpose of this provision is to replace section 3 of the Insurance Act 1964 and to introduce a number of new sections.  These provisions are designed to facilitate payments out of the fund to policyholders with regard to risks in the State where an Irish authorised or an EU authorised insurer goes into liquidation and the approval of the High Court has been obtained for such payments.In more detail, section 3 provides context for sections 3A and 3B and also sets out the limitations to the payments which can be made from the fund.  These limitations replicate what is contained in the existing legislation, the most important of which is that payment from the fund under a policy shall not exceed 65% of that sum or €825,000, whichever is the less, in the event of payments being made to policyholders after the liquidation of an insurer.Under the new scheme, policyholders will be covered by the fund in respect of "risks in the State."  The principal factors which will determine whether a risk is a "risk in the State" will be whether insured buildings are located in the State; whether insured vehicles are registered in the State; in the case of short-term travel insurance — whether the insurance was taken out in the State; and in most other cases whether the habitual residence of the policyholder is in the State or, in the case of legal persons, whether the establishment of the policyholder is in the State.Section 3A provides for the liquidator to make payments from the fund to policyholders of Irish authorised firms.Section 3B provides that if an insurance undertaking in another member state goes into liquidation and policyholders in relation to risk in the State are affected, that the accountant of the High Court can make an application to the High Court on their behalf and can distribute any sums due to such policyholders.Section 3C provides for the continuation of the administration provision as set out in the Insurance Act 1964, but prospectively intends confining the availability of funding from the ICF to firms under administration which conduct a large percentage of their overall business in Ireland, that being, 70% averaged over the three years before the appointment of the administrator.Section 5 is the repeal of section 4, grant to fund by Minister, of principal Act.  The purpose of this provision is to repeal section 4 of the Insurance Act 1964 which the Office of the Attorney General has advised is obsolete as it relates to a specific insolvency in 1964, namely the Equitable Insurance Company Limited.Section 6 is an amendment of section 5, advances to the fund by Minister, of principal Act.  This is a technical amendment designed to make a cross-referencing change to section 5 of the Insurance Act 1964.Section 7 deals with contributions to the fund.  The purpose of this provision is to replace section 6 of the Insurance Act 1964.  The section sets out the conditions for the levying of insurance companies in relation to the ICF.  The key elements of this provision are: the Central Bank continues to be responsible for assessing the fund to determine if it needs financial support; the bank determines the levy to be placed on insurers where funding is required and notifies them; and it requires all insurance companies to be levied in respect of risks in the State under the new scheme.Section 8 repeals section 31, the insurance compensation fund of the Insurance Act 1989.  Section 8 of this Bill is a technical amendment and the purpose is to repeal section 31 of the Insurance Act 1989, which made amendments to section 3 of the 1964 Act.  Those amendments are now obsolete as they are superseded by section 4 in this Bill.Section 9 relates to saving.  The purpose of this provision is to provide a saving mechanism and to ensure that any liquidations or administrations commenced before this Act comes into effect will continue to be subject to the old rules.  This is the standard convention that a company under administration is protected under the rules that applied when the company went into administration.  The effect of this is to ensure that Quinn Insurance Limited remains under administration as if this Bill had not been introduced.Section 10 is a standard provision, which provides for the Short Title of the Act.  I would like now to elaborate on the main reasons for the Bill.  When the administrators were appointed their main task was to carry on the business of Quinn Insurance Limited as a going concern with a view to placing it on a sound commercial and financial footing by carrying out the necessary restructuring and setting in motion a process to sell the business.  During this time they were also required to establish what the underlying financial position of the company was and in particular whether sufficient reserves had been put aside to meet its future liabilities.  Consequently, by the time the announcement of the sale of Quinn Insurance Limited to Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Limited, LMDI, was made on 28 April, the joint administrators were in a position to indicate that Quinn Insurance Limited had suffered losses of €905 million in 2009 due largely to operating losses in the UK market and a write down in the value of assets.  Further related losses in 2010 are expected to be €160 million.  At the same time the joint administrators indicated that there was likely to be a call on the insurance compensation fund in the region of €600 million.  This figure has however been revised upwards to €738 million in recent weeks, because of an increase in the outstanding claims reserve which was required after the finalisation of the 2010 actuarial review by Quinn Insurance Limited actuaries.Deputies should note that the increased call upon the insurance compensation fund concerned me in case the company's eligibility for insurance compensation fund funding might be leading to a less rigorous approach being adopted to the settlement and payment of claims.  It was important that I be satisfied that the appropriate systems and processes were sufficiently robust to ensure that the call upon the fund is kept to an absolute minimum.  In that light, I asked the State Claims Agency, which has specialist skills in the area of claims management and reserving, to undertake a review of the processes at Quinn Insurance Limited and in particular to have a look at the claims management process.  The State Claims Agency has almost completed its review and in its interim report has reassured me that the claims management process is operating effectively.  It indicated that reserving had improved considerably since the joint administrators took over the running of the business, but there was potential for improvement in some other areas.  In summary, it felt that the increased call upon the fund, as a result of various actuarial reserving reviews, was appropriate.Currently, under the Insurance Act 1964, all policyholders of Irish authorised firms are covered by the insurance compensation fund whether they are located in Ireland or in other EU member states.  The legislation also provides that all such companies are required to be levied whenever there are insufficient funds in the insurance compensation fund to meet a particular demand such as the Quinn Insurance Limited deficit.However, because of changes in EU law since the fund was last used, it was necessary to get legal advice on this legislation, in particular the application of the insurance compensation fund levy on insurance companies.  The primary issue we wanted clarified was whether Article 46 of the Third Non-Life Insurance Directive, 92/49/EEC, which precludes a member state from applying an indirect tax or parafiscal charge on insurance risks outside of its jurisdiction was relevant to the application of the insurance compensation fund levy.  The Attorney General concluded that it was relevant, and that any levy which was applied on insurance companies in terms of risks outside of the State in the context of an administration or a liquidation would appear to infringe Article 46.2 of the directive.  In light of this she advised that a levy can only be applied in respect of those risks located in the State.  The outcome of this advice is that we cannot apply the insurance compensation fund levy to international risks, and as a result our legislation must be changed thus explaining the amendments being made to Article 6 of the 1964 Insurance Act in this Bill.I have also decided to amend the scheme so that, as far as possible, risks outside of the State are no longer covered by the fund.  Failure to do this could result in Irish policyholders having to fund a deficit resulting from the failure of an Irish authorised insurance company which conducts the bulk or all of its business outside the State.  In addition, I have decided to use this legislative opportunity to broaden the scope of the insurance compensation fund to cover all insured risk in the State.  That will protect policyholders in this country who take out cover with companies authorised in other EU member states and who are not currently covered by the existing scheme and therefore ensures that all domestic policyholders have the same level of protection in a liquidation situation, whether the policy is taken out with an Irish authorised firm, or a firm authorised elsewhere in the EU.For the moment, I have decided to exclude health insurance from the scope of the scheme, because the main player in the market, VHI, is not authorised by the Central Bank and is therefore outside the scope of the general body of insurance legislation.  In addition, the placing of an additional 2% on health insurance premiums at a time when there has been a significant increase in people not renewing their policies because of the difficult economic climate concerns me.It should be noted that I propose to maintain the administration provision as set out in the Insurance Act 1964, but prospectively intend confining the availability of funding from the insurance compensation fund to firms under administration which conduct a large percentage of their overall business in Ireland, that being 70% averaged over the three years before the appointment of the administrator.  The purpose of the restriction is to prevent Irish policyholders being burdened with paying for the administration of an insurance business which conducts all or the bulk of its business outside of the State, in circumstances where it is not possible to levy the premiums of foreign policyholders because of Article 46 of the third non-life directive.In conclusion, I reiterate the importance of the swift passage of this amending Bill, in order to ensure that I can advance the necessary funds to the insurance compensation fund in the next couple of weeks.  It is important to keep in mind that any advance by the Exchequer to the fund will be classified as a financial transaction and as such is not seen as expenditure, and therefore does not affect the general Government deficit and our targets under the EU-IMF framework.  Indeed, an appropriate market rate of interest will be applied to this advance which means it will marginally improve the general Government balance.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I welcome the opportunity to make a contribution to this debate on the Bill.  I am dissatisfied with the way in which the legislation is being handled.  We have to rush it through both Houses of the Oireachtas over a short period because of the High Court date on 4 October.  The sale of Quinn Insurance Limited to the Liberty Mutual-led joint venture was announced back in April, yet here we are on the eve of an important court date putting through the necessary legislation to ensure that the insurance compensation fund is adequately recompensed to deal with the losses on Quinn Insurance's books.  Essentially, the levy is proposing to put a charge somewhere in excess of €700 million on policy holders.  In truth, however, it is an open-ended commitment because we do not know for sure what the full extent of the losses are on Quinn Insurance's books.  The Department's briefing note refers to this legislation facilitating a levy of up to 2% on the insurance industry, but it is a levy on policy holders.  We all know that so we should call it as it is.  It is a bit like saying the pension levy is a levy on the pensions industry when, in all cases that we are aware of, it is being passed on to pensioners and future pensioners.  If this particular levy is approved by the Oireachtas, it will land on the doorsteps of ordinary policy holders through the renewal of their motor, home and other policies.I have read the report of the Seanad debate which took place two weeks ago.  The Minister's contribution then was most interesting, as were the contributions of Senators.  It is fair to say, however, that the level of awareness — not just among public representatives but also among the general public — of this impending 2% levy is very low.  It is a matter of concern that people are unaware that this is coming down the tracks and will hurt them.  The cost of policy renewals is rising and this levy will only make the situation worse for those who are already struggling to make ends meet.  The Attorney General has advised the Minister that our existing legislation is not compatible with EU law.  It is therefore necessary to amend the Insurance Act 1964 to change the scope of the insurance compensation fund from one which covers the risks of policy holders of Irish authorised insurance companies to one which covers all insured risk in the State except for certain excluded risks.  In effect, under the legislation all insurance policies taken out in relation to risks in the State come within the remit of the scheme.The legacy of Quinn Insurance Limited is at the heart of this Bill, as is, to put it bluntly, the mismanagement of Quinn insurance over a number of years.  That has now landed the State and every policy holder with a bill that is unknown, but is currently estimated at €738 million.  In the Seanad two weeks ago, the Minister indicated that it was only €720 million.  When the joint administrators first announced the sale of Quinn Insurance Limited they estimated it would be €600 million.  Even in that short period we have seen the overall bill increasing.  The joint administrators are hoping to conclude the sale of Quinn Insurance Limited to Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Limited- a joint venture between Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank — on 4 October.  They need to report to the High Court on that date in order to give effect to this.  As the Minister has said, they must demonstrate to the court that there is a commitment from the Minister on behalf of the Government to advance the necessary funds to the insurance compensation fund in response to a request from the Cental Bank, which is the competent authority.  That particular fund currently has only €40 million and the Minister has outlined in some detail the scale of the losses that were incurred at Quinn Insurance.I accept the need to put this debate in the context of job retention.  We all want to see the jobs at Quinn Insurance retained, which is a policy priority for all parties in the House.  Some 1,600 jobs are at stake and generally the employees welcome the sale of Quinn Insurance to the new joint venture as a means of preserving and protecting the existing jobs which are so important in the Border counties and elsewhere.  We all support the need for policy holders to be protected.  We do not want a situation where policy holders are loading claims with insurance companies in respect of incidents that happened some years previously and then find that the insurance company is not able to meet the requirements of a valid claim.In April, the joint administrators indicated that Quinn Insurance Limited has suffered losses of €905 million in 2009 due largely to operating losses in the UK and a write-down in the value of assets in regard to the company's investment in Quinn Property Holdings.  The 2010 losses are expected to be some €160 million.  I read with interest the contribution of Senator Jimmy Harte in the Seanad about the business model that Quinn Insurance was pursuing, including the aggressive undercutting of its competitors' pricing policy for premia.  He made the point that ordinary people were asking how Quinn Insurance could do business at a figure that was one quarter of what massive companies such as Hibernian, Norwich Union and AXA — which have been in the business for 200 or 300 years — were offering.  That is a question for the regulatory authorities.  To be fair, the Financial Regulator, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, identified and quantified the problem, and put a process in place to deal with the legacy of that.  Just as with our banking system, however, we must ask the hard questions as to how this situation was allowed to develop.  I would be the first to acknowledge that.We also need to acknowledge the potential cross-contamination of Seán Quinn's investment in Anglo Irish Bank and the €2.8 billion that he and his family owe to that bank concerning the share gamble they made.  For example, Quinn Insurance made a loan to the family to facilitate the purchase of some of those shares.  There is an element of cross-contamination.  While the losses we are examining are substantially related to operating losses, they are also attributable to the reduction in property values.  Quinn's investment in the property sector has also impacted on the losses and has increased them significantly.  At the time, the administrators felt the losses would be €600 million, then €720 million and now €738 million.  People really want to know where this will end.I am disappointed and disturbed to see that there is no sunset clause in the Bill to set a date by which we are committed to ending this levy.  Quantifying the cost of future claims in insurance is an extremely difficult task because of the tail effect.  Claims can come in many years after incidents have taken place.  It is important to give people some direction or assurance as to how long this particular levy will be in place.  If the deficit is in the region of €740 million, the Minister indicated in the Seanad that the levy will bring in about €65 million per year, so we are looking at this levy being in place for 11 or 12 years.  That issue is at the centre of this Bill and it needs to be addressed.I welcome the involvement of the State Claims Agency concerning the processes that were being employed at Quinn Insurance.  The agency's feedback and reporting is very helpful.It will have found what the administrator found on Quinn's books, that sufficient provision was not made for claims and hence, this levy is being proposed to cover claims in the system and future claims.  We need to ask hard questions about the deal being proposed by the joint administrators for the sale of Quinn Insurance to the Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank joint venture.  Is this the best possible deal for the Irish taxpayer?  What is Liberty Mutual bringing to the table?  I know it is making some investment and a commitment about job retention.  However, I refer the Minister to his reply to a parliamentary question last May:I have had no direct dealings with Liberty in relation to the transaction, including the issue of the future of all existing job-holders, however, I am informed by the joint administrators that aside from the redundancies in Manchester, all the 1,570 jobs in Quinn Insurance Limited have been protected for at least two years.What is the status of that commitment from the Minister?  It is a welcome commitment but even if it stands up, two years is not a long period of time.  It seems that the State is underwriting to an unlimited extent all the losses incurred by Quinn Insurance.  Liberty Mutual is making an investment and it is taking on board a company with a large customer base, even though many customers have moved on to other providers.  The legacy liabilities of that business have been taken care of for Liberty Mutual.  What is the upside, the benefit, for the State, in the event of that business becoming successful once again?  Anglo Irish Bank has a minority shareholding and I presume if the business does particularly well — as is to be hoped — Anglo Irish Bank will recoup more of the money it lent to Seán Quinn and his family for the purchase of the shares.  This is one benefit that is obvious but I am not convinced that we are necessarily getting the best possible deal.  It should be put on the record of the House the exact details of what Liberty Mutual is bringing to the table and what are the explicit commitments it has made regarding the retention of jobs in the Republic and in Northern Ireland.  In the event of the business succeeding, will there be any compensation from the company to bridge the deficit in the insurance compensation fund or will the bill be entirely laid at the feet of Irish policyholders?  This is the key question.What other options were considered for plugging the hole in the insurance compensation fund?  The Minister has made a decision to pass on this cost to the insurance industry which will, in turn, pass it on to policyholders.  We need to have a debate on whether any other options were considered.  The 2% levy comes on top of an existing stamp duty levy of 3%.  I understand that in 2010 that stamp duty levy took in approximately €110 million.  Does the Minister intend to retain this levy and in effect, create a 5% levy on all insurance policies?  This is an important question for which the public will want an answer.  Has the Minister any plans to reform the insurance compensation fund?  Is he giving the insurance industry a completely free hand as regards passing on this levy to policyholders, as was done in the case of the pensions levy?  I note with interest his comments about the health insurance policies.  For obvious reasons, he has decided to exclude health insurance policies because of the status of the VHI.  Is this status subject to change or to be reviewed by the Minister in the short term?  This would have an impact on many more people.I look forward to engaging with the Minister on Committee Stage.  I am disappointed at the short time allocated to consider this Bill which will impose a charge of somewhere north of €700 million but we do not know the full extent of the liability on the Irish policyholders and many hard questions need to be asked and answered and that is what we are here to do.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	523	During the last Dáil, when Fianna Fáil tried to rush legislation through, there were loud protests from both Fine Gael and Labour and rightly so.  It is unfortunate that despite all the promises of new politics and parliamentary reform from his party during the general election, the Minister is seeking to rush through this important legislation and this is not good enough.  Good legislation requires good scrutiny and good scrutiny requires the allocation of adequate time to prepare, question, debate and amend what is put before us.  When any Government attempts to railroad through legislation one must ask why the parliamentary process is being denied and why there is not adequate time to ensure the proposal is an appropriate and proportionate response to the issue at hand.The cynic in me is always suspicious that the intention of the Government is to avoid scrutiny for fear of what it may reveal.  This is particularly the case when it comes to the out-workings of the placing into administration of Quinn Insurance by the Financial Regulator.A fortnight ago, Senators were given less than two days to read and absorb this Bill, all Stages being taken in a single session.  Having read the Official Report of the Seanad debate, it is clear that no Senator felt able to comment adequately on or support the Bill.The Government has proceeded with this legislation in an unacceptable and deeply undemocratic way.  The treatment of the Dáil is little better.  Amendments were to be submitted before the Second Stage debate had even taken place, a demand that is both procedurally inappropriate and politically unacceptable.  When one considers the financial implications for the taxpayer and for hundreds of thousands of insurance policyholders across the State, this cavalier approach by the Minister to the parliamentary process is outrageous.It has been widely reported in the media, and referred to by the Taoiseach and the Minister today, that the Minister is under pressure from Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank to ensure this Bill is fully enacted by 4 October, in advance of a High Court appearance by Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank to close the sale of Quinn Insurance.  This is a reckless way to treat legislative process and it is certain to result in bad law and a bad result.The entire Quinn Insurance saga is littered with bad practice and questionable behaviour.  My colleague from Cavan-Monaghan, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, will deal with this matter in more detail during his contribution.  However, I wish to place on record Sinn Féin's view that serious questions need to be answered regarding the way in which the Government, the Financial Regulator and the administrators have handled the issue of Quinn Insurance.  Already, some 1,000 jobs have been lost in a region of the country with a history of high unemployment.  These jobs were lost on the watch of the Financial Regulator and his appointed administrators.  There is a need for a short public inquiry into the manner in which both the administrators and the Financial Regulator behaved, if we are to ensure any level of public confidence in the outcome of this saga.This Bill raises more questions than it answers and at this stage, Sinn Féin is not in a position to support it.  Sinn Féin is not, in principle, against amending the current shape and size of the insurance compensation fund and nor are we, in principle, against the imposition of a levy on all insurance risk in the State in order to fund future requirements.  However, in determining whether to support this Bill, it is important to understand the background to its drafting.  Following the placing of Quinn Insurance Limited into administration by the Financial Regulator negotiations between representatives of the administrator and the US insurance giant, Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank, commenced.  The sale of Quinn Insurance has been agreed in principle and will be subject to a High Court hearing on 4 October.  If the sale of Quinn Insurance to Liberty Mutual and Anglo Irish Bank proceeds, the insurance company will be split into two entities.  The first entity, comprising of the Irish policy book of the company, will continue as an ongoing concern run by Liberty and Anglo.The second entity, comprising of the policies held in the North of Ireland and Britain will be administered by Liberty Mutual but funded with a payment of up to €720 million from the insurance compensation fund.  The fund will pay the policyholders who are outside the State.  The request for this money was made by the administrators to the Central Bank.  However, as the compensation fund currently only contains €40 million, the Government is proposing changes to its size and operation to meet the request by the administrators.  Officially €720 million — this figure may increase — is to cover payments on policies to customers of Quinn Insurance in the North of Ireland and Britain.  However, like so many aspects of this story, things are not that clear.  It appears that assets from Quinn Insurance of more than €400 million were used as security against loans for the same value from Anglo Irish Bank for other commercial activities pursued by the company.  As a result, bondholders with Anglo Irish Bank effectively have a hold on this portion of Quinn Insurance's insurance book.  Liberty Mutual, seeing this as a liability, is insisting that the Government and the insurance compensation fund fill the gap.  Happy to oblige, the Government is seeking to place a 2% levy on all non-life insurance policy holders in Ireland to fund the capital requirements of Quinn Insurance.In order for the Anglo Irish Bank bondholders to relinquish their claim on the €400 million of assets at Quinn Insurance, they have been offered a pay-off of €200 million.  Put another way, €200 million of the €720 million requested by the administrator will effectively be used to pay off senior bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, after the compensation fund moneys are lodged and become part of the general assets of the company.  As the compensation fund currently only holds €40 million and the proposals in front of us to day will only raise €65 million a year, the Government  proposes to advance €400 million, of money it must borrow from the EU and IMF, over the next two years plus a market interest rate to the compensation fund.  At no stage, even up to now, has a rationale been provided to this House for the request for these funds or a justification as to why the Minister is acceding to this request.Why is this money not being provided by Liberty Mutual as part of the purchase of Quinn Insurance?  Why are the Government and the directors of Anglo Irish Bank not exploring burden-sharing, if not outright burning of the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank  who have a hold over the assets of Quinn Insurance?  Why are taxpayers and, ultimately, insurance policy holders being asked to foot the bill to pay off senior bondholders who lent recklessly to Anglo Irish Bank, which in turn lent recklessly to Quinn?  No matter what sophisticated financial semantics are used to describe this sorry affair, it is hard to see it as anything other than yet another bailout by the public to a toxic bank, its bondholders and a major US insurance company.  If this is not the case, then the Minister has a responsibility to outline in fine detail why this money is required and why the only source of this money is the taxpayer and policy holders with other insurance providers?  There is no guarantee in any of this that €720 million will be the maximum drawdown required as a result of the Liberty Mutual-Anglo Irish purchase of Quinn Insurance.  Nor is there any guarantee that the State will recoup the entire €400 million cash it will advance in 2011 and 2012.I am also concerned about the involvement of Anglo Irish Bank in all of this.  Like most people, I understand that Anglo Irish Bank is no longer a trading bank, but an empty shell holding and servicing its toxic debts.  Can the Minister explain the involvement of Anglo Irish Bank in this enterprise and why, as I understand it, the bank will retain a 24.5% share in the company after it is sold to Liberty Mutual?  I am also unclear as to the impact of the technical changes to the insurance compensation fund.  The legislation proposes to apply a 2% levy on all non-life insurance policies in the State.  However, if my reading of the Bill is correct, only companies with 70% or more of their business in the State could apply to the compensation fund while in administration.  What level of risk does this represent to policy holders with companies that have less than 70% of their business in the State?  Why does the Bill provide cover for all policy holders in the State if their provider goes into liquidation, yet restricts access to the compensation fund to only certain providers if in administration?  It is important that there is clarity on this matter as those who will be contributing to the fund through the new 2% levy have a right to know whether they will be able to benefit if their provider goes into administration.In addition, while we are being told that the increased contributions to the compensation fund are to cover future eventualities in the insurance industry, the reality is that the first €720 million will be used to repay the State and cover directly the requirements in Quinn Insurance.  This means that for anything up to ten or 11 years, the compensation fund will not be in a position to service any other insurance company that faces difficulties.  This means that policy holders with other insurance providers will have to pay an additional 2% on their premium for the next ten years, during which time they will have no protection via the compensation fund if their provider falls into difficulty.I want to repeat once again that the way the Minister has brought this legislation to the House is deeply unsatisfactory.  Both the origin of the legislation and its content beg a litany of questions which must be answered before the legislation passes into law.  Worse that this, however, is that the Minister is trying to present what is nothing more than a bank bailout under the cover of a measure that he says is designed to protect ordinary policy holders.  Some would say that this is downright dishonest.Sinn Féin will support any Bill that protects policy holders in Quinn Insurance or any other insurance provider.  At a time of great economic uncertainty and volatility, people have a right to know that their policies are protected to the greatest degree possible.  Sinn Féin will also support any Bill that protects the employees and policy holders at Quinn Insurance.  However, we are not opposed to the sale of Quinn Insurance if all other options have been carefully assessed and shown to be without merit.  Nor are we opposed to the reform of the insurance compensation fund, as long as it meets these crucial objectives.  However, what the Minister has put in front of us today does not deserve support from any Member of this House.  On that basis, Sinn Féin will oppose the legislation, unless serious amendments are made to it on Committee Stage.  However, given the truncating of the debate, I understand that will not be permitted and that only approximately an hour will be provided for Committee Stage.There are genuine questions that need to be answered.  They have not been answered in the Seanad nor in the Minister's opening remarks.  There is a lack of knowledge within these Chambers and outside as to what is happening and as to the untold story of the bondholder that has a part of the Quinn asset book.  Basically, that bondholder is being paid off, using our money.  This is money that will be borrowed by the EU-IMF to pay off the bondholder, but will be recouped through applying a 2% levy on every person with an insurance policy, other than a health policy, in this State.  That is unacceptable.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	525	I too am appalled at the indecent haste with which this Bill is being proposed.  I understand that this is to meet a deadline of 4 October, which was imposed by people outside of the House.  This is an attempt to cover the losses that were accumulated by Quinn Insurance.The levy of 2% is a significant amount.  I am old enough to remember when the PMPA went bust and the levy for that was introduced and for how long it lasted.  This 2% levy will apply to every person in the country with an insurance policy.  This is a critical issue at a time of such financial stringency and lack of funds for businesses and everybody.  The levy will affect those with car, house, travel and every other kind of insurance policy, but particularly business insurance.  As a person with a small business, I understand that insurance costs have risen.  We had 40 years to get them down, but over the past number of years the fat cats in the insurance companies have used every excuse, including the weather, the ash cloud and anything they can, to revert to previous charges.  Prices have been increasing over the past number of years and this levy will be the straw that will break the camel's back.Nonetheless, we must address the situation and the problems we face as a result of poor management by personnel and leaders of Quinn Insurance.  I would also question the joint administrators.  From information I have from the Border region, Liberty Mutual has been hovering over Quinn Insurance for a long time.  It is not coming in to rescue it, but for the rich pickings.  It does not care about other important parts of the Quinn group, parts which are important to the infrastructure and economy of the Border region.  Liberty Mutual is in it for the rich pickings it can make for itself and is dealing with the scandalous rogue bank that created part of the problem initially with its funny games and movement of money and shady loans.  We understood from news bulletins that this bank would be removed and would no longer operate in this country.     The name was taken down from the bank's headquarters not far from this building some time ago, yet the Government is now applying a levy on taxpayers to protect Anglo Irish Bank and its senior bondholders once again.  It stinks from the high heavens.A report will be made to the High Court before 4 October.  Legal opinion should be sought on whether that date can be put back because this is too serious an issue.  The public cannot take any more.  The Government's response is to fire another levy on them, raise taxes again and make more cuts to protect the rotten banks and businesses that ruined this country.  We are walking  blindfolded into this again.  The former Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, was criticised in the House for decisions he made.  We were all part of those decisions and we have seen where the indecent haste got us.  I compliment the Minister and the Government on renegotiating interest rates downwards but they should make haste slowly and investigate properly.  As Deputy Doherty said, a swift inquiry should be held, possibly by the Oireachtas rather than a tribunal, because we will become an even greater laughing stock in Europe and the public will be even more angry otherwise.We do not know when the levy will cease because we have not been given facts and figures.  We do not know how much will be needed.  A sum of €700 million has been mentioned but there is only €40 million in the pot.  The fund will increase through this levy but the Government could increase the levy again next year if it is not coming up to scratch.  It will drive people out of business and policyholders will be unable to renew their insurance, which will create more problems down the road.  All the while, Anglo Irish Bank, that despicable bank, lurks in the background sucking more of the lifeblood out of taxpayers.  This is outrageous.  The Quinn Group was eager to go after the rich pickings in the insurance industry for a number of years.  It got in and now we are told the insurance aspect will be the saviour.However, this raises the issue of the role of administrators and receivers.  It is a sorry mess and the administration is not delivering what it is supposed to.  It is not fair, just or satisfactory in any shape or form.  It must also be opposed.  I am opposed to the Bill.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	526	One of the key issues is the extension of the insurance compensation fund to deal with losses of the Quinn family.  A large percentage of insurance losses result from speculative gambling on the property market by the family and, in effect, the legislation provides for the transfer of those gambling debts on to the shoulders of hard pressed taxpayers and working people who need to insure cars, homes and so on.  As previous speakers pointed out, this is the third time a private company has been bailed out by the State — Equitable Life in the 1960s and PMPA and ICI in the 1980s.  The original levy was not discontinued when PMPA's historical liabilities were run down but, instead, was replaced with a stamp duty to which the Government proposes to add a Quinn Insurance levy.  Clearly, that is a disgrace and should be condemned by all.I would like to concentrate on one aspect of the legislation.  It proposes that the insurance compensation fund would cover all insured risk in the State with the exception of a number of excluded risks.  It then defines one of those as a risk relating to a building in the State.  Will the Minister address the Homebond issue in this regard?  He may be aware that householders will take to the streets tomorrow to protest outside Homebond's offices because it has opted out of its liability under a structural guarantee against major defects and has said it will not honour offers made to residents in that regard.  Is this an insurance policy or not, given it was sold to people on that basis?  Were people tricked into taking up this policy?  Payments come out of the insurance compensation fund for insolvent insurers and, therefore, this issue is relevant.People bought their houses in the belief that Homebond offered them a structural guarantee against major structural defects for ten years.  The homeowner had no choice in that regard as he or she was obligated to go down that route.  He or she did not have the option of choosing the insurance route.  It was provided to the developer and the Irish Home Builders Association.  It is a consequence of the light touch regulation that existed.  The banks legitimised Homebond by mandating that people to whom they were giving loans had to have a Homebond guarantee before they were able to avail of the mortgage.  Warnings were issued repeatedly from 2000 onwards that the company was significantly underinsured.  The Law Society issued a warning in 2000 while Grant Thornton and others produced reports in which they warned the society that this was a potential major liability, yet nothing was done.I would like the Minister to address this because between 30,000 and 50,000 houses have fallen victim to heave inducing pyrite, a defect that costs between €40,000 and €50,000 per household to repair.  A claim would result in a liability of between €1 billion and €1.5 billion.  If Homebond is deemed to be insolvent and the pre-2008 insured members are deemed liable for heave inducing pyrite resulting in major structural damage, who will pay the bill?  Is the Minister exposing the State by bringing this under the insolvent insurers scheme?  If not, why not?  He can offer a compensation fund to Sean Quinn and his family to defray their gambling debts but the victims of Homebond who did nothing other than a buy a home in good faith that they thought was fit for purpose have to pay the cost of heave inducing pyrite.  There is no compensation fund for them.This more than anything else exposes the Government's record and the double standards it is applying.  The Minister is rushing this legislation and that is not on.  It will be exposed in the eyes of the public for what it is.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	527	When the debate concludes, there will still be many unanswered questions and that is a dangerous way to proceed.  Bills will drop through people's letter boxes following the Bill's enactment with a levy on them.  That will then result in the same reaction a similar measure produced in the 1980s.  I recall the failure of PMPA and the constant reminders in my bank statements year after year that I was paying a levy to bail out a private company.  The credit union movement has done good work assessing the amount of disposable income available to households.  A significant number of households have a tiny amount of disposable income and they are cutting out costs such as home insurance.  The difficulty is that a levy such as this will push those who are on the brink over the edge.Individual policyholders will pay for this and I do not understand how history is repeating itself.  I recently looked back over newspaper reports from the 1980s and 1990s.  Reference was made to administrators and so on.  A Fine Gael-Labour Party Government was in power in the mid-1990s and it is interesting that the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is present because his brother reported to the House on the issue at the time.  The PMPA administrator estimated in 1994 that the company could cease to be dependent on the compensation fund based on an existing annual 2% levy within a certain number of years.  Each family paid on average £100 in insurance levies.  PMPA was estimated to have a shortfall of £200 million.  Doing even a rough assessment one could say that over the lifetime of the levy fund for this insurance company alone it will be somewhere in the region of €400 per family.  It was interesting that the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, ICI, liabilities were not known.  So much of what is happening now is history repeating itself.  Asked at a press conference if the State was not simply baling out a private company, the then Minister for Finance, Mr. Dukes, stated that the Government was insuring against major disruption in the insurance market.  The tone was the same against ICI in that if the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, a wholly owned subsidiary of Allied Irish Banks, had gone into liquidation, that could have had consequences for the bank itself.  It is a pity it did not.  They were saying that a bank would have an inability to borrow if it was exposed in this particular way and that if a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank collapsed, the terms on which the bank itself could then borrow money could be immediately affected.  The same threatening language was used then in terms of trying to rush legislation through and creating a sense of fear and insecurity.  Clearly, the workers in Quinn are being used as a softener to rush this Bill through the House to ensure there is some certainty about their jobs.The key point is how this keeps happening.  Why were there not adequate funds in this insurance fund?  My understanding is that insurance companies employ actuaries who do assessments and make sure these things can be avoided, yet that industry is the one we are talking about.
#JohnHalligan	unknown-#JohnHalligan-party	unknown-#JohnHalligan-dob	unknown-#JohnHalligan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I move:That Dáil Éireann:recognises:the unacceptable fact that the current rate of unemployment is 14.5%;the crushing toll that persistent job losses, mounting unemployment and heightening emigration levels are having on ordinary Irish people and the desperate need for honesty when addressing this crisis and those affected by it; andthe particularly devastating impact of recent job losses on areas such as Waterford City and County which have not only seen the direct impact of job losses due to closures of companies such as Waterford Crystal, the Iron Foundry, ABB Transformers, Teva Pharmaceuticals, GlaxoSmithKline and, most recently, TalkTalk but have also experienced the secondary impact that the removal of such vital industry has on surrounding and supporting industries;condemns the present Government for:opting to make good the gambling debts of unguaranteed bondholders at a time when desperately-needed State funds should be invested aggressively in job stimulus initiatives;undermining the right of workers to a fair day's work for a fair day's pay with the introduction of a deeply flawed National Internship Scheme that allows employers to recruit often skilled, qualified and experienced individuals into entry and non-entry level positions which in no way, apart from their €50 per week rate of pay, bear any resemblance to an internship; andintroducing a piecemeal and tokenistic jobs budget and initiative aimed more at producing headlines than creating true growth in employment levels; anddemands that the Government:restore the right of workers to a fair day's work for a fair day's pay by immediately addressing the deep flaws in the National Internship Scheme;return sanity to the commercial rental sector by eliminating the presence of upwardonly rent reviews in the Irish economy;abandon its commitment to pay back the gambling debts of unguaranteed bondholders and instead use State funds to implement a truly effective jobs initiative that promotes education, training, entrepreneurship, meaningful support for the small and medium enterprises (SME) sector and the development of a genuinely ‘smart economy'; andhonestly deliver on its commitment to ‘Get Ireland Working'.I am sharing time with a number of Members from the Technical Group.I did not get an opportunity last week to thank the Minister for his visit to Waterford in an attempt to try to stop the closure of TalkTalk.  I genuinely mean that.  I did not get an opportunity last week because before the Minister came into the House, I was turfed out of the Dáil for a week, as the Minister is probably aware.On a serious matter, the latest report on the economy issued by accountants, Ernst & Young, states that it could be 2022 before employment regains even 2007 status.  That is a fairly damning report.  It also states that 54% of all those out of work and without a decent income have been in that position for well over a year or more.There has been a 170% increase in youth unemployment in the past two years and there is huge despondency among the youth.  All one has to do is speak to youth organisations and read reports of those who deal with youths who are facing the terrible consequences of unemployment and not being able to be employed, despite whatever qualifications they might have.  The latest statistics also show that only 20% of all FÁS trainees in the past two years have managed to get some form of work.Whatever way the Minister looks at all these figures, which indicate that almost 500,000 people are unemployed, they are damning statistics, especially on the previous Government's policies, but they do not look too good for the current Government's policies in dealing with the huge unemployment levels.  For instance, a report from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul stated that the vulnerable are on the verge of despair and that in 2010 it received a 35% increase in calls seeking its assistance.  All such agencies go on in the same manner.  Barnardos talks about increased sourcing of loans from loan sharks, more children going hungry or waiting longer for treatment for illness, and so on.  I could go on.  What it comes down to is that it is unsustainable to have almost 500,000 people on unemployment benefit.Many of those job losses are a direct result of austerity measures put in place by the previous and current Governments.  Further measures, and we are talking about cuts of €3.6 billion or even more, will further drive down spending and drive the economy further into recession, which will stop growth and inevitably lead to more job losses.If we examine the current spending figure in this economy, we can see that hundreds of thousands of people are restricted in terms of spending because they have restricted power.  I refer to people in low income groups, people on social welfare and so on who cannot spend into the economy and therefore cannot help the economy grow.  Thousands of others are paying down debt.  That is their first priority and therefore they cannot spend into the economy.  Many who are able to spend into the economy, and the statistics show this, are saving because of an uncertain future.  All of that is taking money out of circulation.Does the Minister accept that if people do not spend and money is taken out of circulation, the consequences are that people earn less, buy less, products are not sold and this ultimately leads to job losses?  That is evident in clear statistics which indicate that from 2010, almost 1,200 small business were deemed insolvent.  Thousands more were shedding jobs, with thousands more close to the edge, so to speak.  As people buy fewer commodities, all those companies let people go, and that is a consequence of reduced spending.  Our argument is that we cannot reduce unemployment by curtailing spending.  In fact, we will increase unemployment.  That has been shown in economies throughout the world.Regarding small businesses, all the evidence from the banks is that 50% of businesses were refused credit last year and the year before by banks who could have kept people in jobs.  That is in spite of all the promises the Government made and commitments made by the banks.Surely sound economics at this stage would be to encourage people to spend and not to cut.  That generates growth, encourages people to spend in the economy and creates jobs, which will take people off unemployment benefit and reduce the billions of euro we are paying out on unemployment benefit.The Minister's answer to this is, for instance, the speculative cuts in overtime and anti-social working hours.  The Minister made an announcement some months ago and as a result, 240,000 low paid workers in industries such as hospitality, cleaning, agriculture, hairdressing and so on will face pay reductions.  Their working rates and overtime rates will be cut.  They will not get the full rate for the anti-social hours they work.  The Minister announced that he was reversing the €1 cut in the national minimum wage.  All that will do is drive down spending.The Minister's answer to this problem is the internship scheme, which is deeply flawed.  It undermines the rights of workers to a fair day's pay for a fair day's work.  No one will tell me that this scheme will not be used to employ part-time workers instead of employing full-time workers .  Why would they not take someone off social welfare and give them €50 and perhaps later let a full-time worker go?  There is no question that this will happen, and there is some evidence that it is happening already.On the Minister's job creation proposal, 20% of people who did FÁS courses last year barely got any sort of employment.  People do not want schemes.  They have enough schemes.  They are looking for full-time jobs.  It is a question of value for money with FÁS.  It must be remembered that it spent €645,000 on junkets some years ago.  That is what it did with some of the money we put into it.What are the alternatives?  It costs in excess of €20,000 per year to keep someone on social welfare.  Over three years, it could cost the Government €80,000, given the cost of statutory redundancy, stamps, social welfare, fuel allowance, medical cards and so on.  The programme for Government states:Job creation is central to any recovery strategy.  Every person who leaves the dole and goes back to work reduces the deficit by an estimated €20,000, spends on average an additional €15,000 on goods and services and also reduces the risk on the banks' mortgage books.That is pure and simple.  Is there no thinking outside the box?  Why can we not use that money to take people off unemployment, perhaps by giving it to a small business to enable it to sponsor a worker?  That is one way of reducing the deficit.The Minister for Finance astonished and to some degree confused people a couple of months ago when he urged people to spend to help the economy grow.  That is what we are proposing tonight, and other Deputies will discuss how we should create jobs and so on.  No economy will grow by cutting.  We have to urge people to spend, and we can only get them to do that by giving them a decent wage so they have spending power in the economy.  We can then reduce unemployment rates substantially.  We must remember that keeping someone in unemployment costs €35,000 a year - I put the Government's own figure to the Minister again.  That does not make sense to me.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I am fairly certain that the Minister understands that business requires investment and stimulus if it is to thrive  That is its nature.  I was in business for 30 years — I am still in it, just about — and I know it is difficult to function without access to money.  We all agree that the lack of jobs is a major problem.  When I hear the Government say that one of its primary aims is to create jobs, I am glad to hear it.  I cannot see how austerity will create jobs, and if we continue being dictated to by Europe, I do not think things will change much.  We all know that unemployment causes huge social problems and that we get a poor economic return from it.  There are problems with it right across the board.  The Government's initiative of reducing VAT for the catering industry gave it a big boost.  I can tell the Minister that from having the wine bars.  It has been a huge help in the past few months and it has really made a difference.  That stimulus measure is to be welcomed because it is positive, but the general theme from the Government and the previous Government has been the opposite.  Austerity is the opposite to stimulus and investment.A fellow called Dave Kohlbeck asked to meet me recently.  He has a company called Cleanair Products Limited.  He initially worked for a multinational company so he has access to export markets.  He is into anti-allergy bedding, which sounds unusual, but seemingly there is a good market for it.  It helps with dust mite allergies, asthma and other sinus problems.  He came up with a business plan.  All he needed was a loan of €40,000 and he promised to employ six people in the first year and ten people within three years.  He went to the credit union first, thinking it would be his best bet, and it was really impressed.  It said that it really liked his business plan but the regulator has stopped it giving money to businesspeople for the moment.  He told me that some credit unions are being allowed to do that but some are not.  I do not understand that and I have not had a chance to look into it.  Next, he went to AIB and Bank of Ireland, but they could not even tell him why they were refusing him.  That will not be a shock to any of us, because we know the banks are more or less closed when it comes to lending to business.  He went to the South-East Enterprise Platform Programme and the people there were positive and helpful, but they had no money to give him.  All the avenues are closed to him.  I do not know what he is going to do.  He is putting the small amount of savings he had from his last job into trying to put his company on a level where he can look ahead and start to develop the business.  He has invested his own money in it, but he needs the €40,000 to get it off the ground and make it work.  I do not see how the country will recover if we do not help people like this guy, who is prepared to stick his neck out, be entrepreneurial and go for it.  He is full of beans and really energetic.  The State has to see that it is in its interests to give such people a leg up.Unfortunately, many people are suffering because of the austerity they are experiencing, especially the less well off in society, who are certainly feeling the most pain.  I understand the Government's actions are being dictated very much by European policy, but it can make some decisions.  Sadly, it has decided to accept lock, stock and barrel what the Europeans are throwing at us.  I have always been pro-European, but I have been following what is happening in Europe very closely for the past few years and I am not so sure any more.  Europe was a great thing for us, but I am not sure that will continue.  I am not convinced it will survive in its current form because it has become so big and powerful — it has become problematic and unmanageable.  Listening to what the Germans have to say, I think they are coming to the same conclusion.I will read from a good article by Paul Kingsnorth in The Guardian on 25 September.  He looks back on a book written 50 years ago by a fellow called Kohr, and he also quotes the book.  It is difficult to believe it was written 50 years ago:Drawing from history, Kohr demonstrated that when people have too much power, under any system or none, they abuse it.  The task, therefore, was to limit the amount of power that any individual, organisation or government could get its hands on.  The solution to the world's problems was not more unity but more division.  The world should be broken up into small states, roughly equivalent in size and power, which would be able to limit the growth and thus domination of any one unit.  Small states and small economies were more flexible, more able to weather economic storms, less capable of waging serious wars, and more accountable to their people.  Not only that, but they were more creative...Bigness, predicted Kohr, could only lead to more bigness, for "whatever outgrows certain limits begins to suffer from the irrepressible problem of unmanageable proportions".  Beyond those limits it was forced to accumulate more power in order to manage the power it already had.  Growth would become cancerous and unstoppable, until there was only one possible endpoint: collapse.We have now reached the point that Kohr warned about over half a century ago: the point where "instead of growth serving life, life must now serve growth, perverting the very purpose of existence".  Kohr's "crisis of bigness" is upon us and, true to form, we are scrabbling to tackle it with more of the same: closer fiscal unions, tighter global governance ... more economic growth.  Big, it seems, is as beautiful as ever to those who have the unenviable task of keeping the growth machine going.This shouldn't surprise us.  It didn't surprise Kohr, who, unlike some of his utopian critics, never confused a desire for radical change with the likelihood of it actually happening.  Instead, his downbeat but refreshingly honest conclusion was that, like a dying star, the gigantist global system would in the end fall in on itself, and the whole cycle of growth would begin all over again.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Private Members' motion on behalf of the Technical Group.  It is a worthwhile and timely motion, coming against a background where we are rapidly approaching 500,000 people unemployed, with companies like TalkTalk moving abroad to low cost economies, doing what multinationals do, spending time here before moving on to where they can make even more profit.We will probably be accused during the debate on the motion of not coming up with ideas or proposals for how we can create jobs.  I will use my time tonight to give three examples that can make significant changes and could be policies the Government could pursue at very little cost and that would create confidence in the economy and perhaps encourage people to create jobs, shrinking the dole queues instead of growing them.  There is no doubt that the current path, where we insist on paying back unguaranteed bondholders and doing what the EU-IMF tells us, will lead to longer dole queues.We should encourage people to set up businesses and work on their own.  I come from a region in the north west where one in five people at work is self-employed.  During the election and since we have all met with self-employed people who now have no work but are not entitled to any benefits under the social welfare system.  The Government should change the PRSI regulations to allow self-employed workers to pay an extra PRSI contribution that would eventually entitle them to jobseeker's benefit if they end up unemployed.  This would be a compulsory measure and would be self-financing because there would be a lead in time before people are entitled to benefit.  Ordinary PAYE workers must have 52 contributions in the previous two years before they are entitled to any benefit.  The self-employed who pay into this system would take time to accrue the benefit and if they then needed the benefit, it would be self-financing or, at most, at a very low cost to the Exchequer.  The self-employed already pay a contribution but it should be doubled from 3% to 6% and made compulsory.  There is already a voluntary scheme in place for the self-employed to pay extra contribution, but very few avail of it.  When things are going well people do not think something will go wrong and they will need something to fall back on.  By changing the PRSI contribution system, we could create a limited safety net for those who take the step to create a job for themselves.  We could also put in a place a system where those self-employed who employ more people could pay a reduced personal rate, encouraging them to take people on and leading to employment growth.  That system would go a long way to creating confidence and boosting small businesses, reducing the dole queues and stimulating the economy.A study entitled "Creative Edge" was carried out by the Western Development Commission, looking at the seven north-western counties, including Donegal.  It has shown that by helping creative companies in the north-west region to export their services and products, 17,000 jobs could be created.  All it takes is for Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and the other State agencies to work with those companies to show them how to export their services.  This scheme would not need internship programmes where people provide free labour; it would simply show these companies how to develop their businesses, creating 17,000 jobs in the north west alone, not to mention the impact such a scheme would have on a country-wide basis.We could also develop a wood for energy and home heating industry.  Already people are working in this area and we have all the necessary natural resources.  We do not need subsidies, we simply need to show people this can be done.  Projects are already under way that demonstrate how this can be developed.  The Western Development Commission has estimated upwards of 1,000 jobs could be created in the western region by developing supply chains and the industry.  It would also have the added benefit of offsetting imports of home heating oil.  We import €1 billion worth of home heating oil but we produce five times more wood and biomass than we would need to heat the entire country.  By expanding this area we would develop an indigenous industry, improve the balance of payments and move away from oil dependency while creating more jobs.Some of these ideas would provide stimulus for the economy, producing jobs at very little cost, with no need for fanfare about internship programmes or fancy announcements about 100 jobs here or there.  Instead, in every community across the State we would create five or six new jobs, providing a boost to the economy throughout the country.  I ask the Minister to take these ideas on board and bring them to fruition.  He has the ability and the tools to do it and it would be to all our benefit.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I also welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important motion and I compliment my colleagues on putting it together.  I also am glad the Minister is here because I know he is interested in and concerned about the blockages that stop companies from taking people on or that stop people from working.As a small businessman, I know every small business would take on one or two more people if they were encouraged.  That would make huge inroads into the dole queues.  Unemployment leads to utter devastation, with 95% of people only wanting to do a decent day's work for a decent day's pay to provide for their families.  We all hear stories about fraud and how much money unemployed people are getting.  Those on middle incomes are getting more frustrated.  I have personal experience of people going on a three day week and finding the system immediately favours them.  They get six days pay for a three day week and get three days social welfare.  That anomaly should be dealt with.  That is bad enough but then there are all the bonuses the person in employment does not get, all those fringe benefits for those on low incomes.  I know of companies who let workers go on a three day week after 25 years working with them and when the work picked up, they did not want to come back because the other system suited them.  It favours the black economy because they will do nixers or work for €100 cash.  That is a complete blockage and I ask the Minister to check that.TalkTalk treated the workforce and the State agencies disgracefully.  Those were all IDA-led jobs.  Earlier we were debating the Bill that is being rushed through to protect Quinn Insurance.  This will cost between €700 million and €850 million.  We had to save the jobs but 1,500 jobs divided by that sort of money is costing a lot.  That is not the end of it; there will be further austerity as John Citizen is forced to pay a levy on every insurance policy.This is a further punitive measure that will stymie businesses which, as the Minister knows, are on their knees.  They cannot take that kind of increase.  Where is the wisdom in putting that kind of money into shoring up a disgraced bank?  I still have an interest in it.  Bondholders are still being protected.  A rich-picking insurance company has seen the success of Quinn Insurance and wants that part of the company.  Anyone can see through that.An EU fund was available to help redundant Dell workers.  We have a huge inability to change the system, which should be caught by the scruff of the neck and shaken.  I heard an official from a State agency today who was unable to answer questions as to why that fund was not drawn down and how so few people set up as self-employed.  The questions were left for someone else to answer.  It is an outright disgrace to give that kind of money to create 250 jobs.  I compliment agencies on creating jobs but that is not a good return on State spending.  Departments and agencies are not pulling their weight.We got carried away in the good times.  Social partnership drove business out of the country.  That is why TalkTalk and other companies are leaving.I did not support the cut in the minimum wage and I compliment the Government on restoring it.  It must be viable for someone to go to work.  It costs money to go to work.We must cut out red tape.  This is not happening because vested interests have their hands clasped around those interests.  The Health and Safety Authority, the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, and agency after agency which have chief executives and regional offices throughout the country are a crying disgrace.  Instead of walking into business premises, flashing cards and telling employers that employees should be paid one rate five minutes before midnight and a different rate five minutes after midnight, NERA should offer help.  The agency should be renamed the national employers and employees support agency.  We do not need another quango to frighten the life out of businesses.  We need a change of attitude from top to bottom.  The people who manage these agencies are not in the real world.We have too much legislation.  Employees' rights legislation was introduced in the 1950s, when it was badly needed.  Since then, however, we added more levels on top of the original legislation.  Any self-employed person who employs six people will need a book-keeper and someone to manage the various regulations and agencies.We need employment stimulus.  Most business people start small.  Tosach maith leath na hoibre.  Anyone who starts a business must have vision and passion.  Many small businesses have gone to the wall because we did not have a proper construction Bill.  When big companies went out of business there was no protection for the small firms, who were not paid.  Human tragedies resulted from that.  When a small firm goes out of business the employees get unemployment benefit, and rightly so, but the employer gets nothing.  How will such small employers find the courage to start up again?  They have ideas but they cannot get a shilling from the banks.  This and the previous Government produced plans and reports on how much they would spend on job creation.  The banks do not have the money, or if they do they are not lending it.  Something must be done about this.  Why would a person with initiative and ideas face the ordeal of setting up a business again?  He or she would be persecuted by many of the State agencies.  Why would a self-employed person who was forced to close through no fault of his or her own start again?  If we kill initiative we will take a long time to develop it again.We must focus on keeping the jobs we have.  We must stop the haemorrhage, cut out the red tape and encourage people rather than discourage them on a daily basis.  Small business people are frustrated, blackguarded and not supported in a meaningful way.  I am not looking for special favours.  I am simply asking that people with initiative be allowed to carry on, grow their companies and create better employment.  Most business people value their workers and treat them properly.  In that way they create a better rapport.  Everything is better when people are happy working together and driving forward.It was heartening to be at the ploughing championships last week and to see the farming industry, which has come out of a huge depression, buoyant and in good form and about to spend, if farmers can get the money.  Finance is the big problem.The Minister knows my views.  I appeal to him to release the shackles on enterprise and cut out at least half of the red tape.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I suspect that the Minister would agree that unemployment, particularly at the levels we are now witnessing, is unacceptable and that it must be everyone's priority to do something about it.  It is demoralising for people who were working and who want to work to find themselves dependent on social welfare and with no prospects of getting back to work.  They face the difficulty of meeting mortgage repayments, paying bills and trying to live a dignified existence, but they also face the demoralisation of not working.  Unemployment will create a social cost if we do not deal with the problem quickly.  We are all familiar with what mass unemployment over a long period led to in the 1980s, when serious damage was done to communities across this city and the entire country.  We all understand that and how urgent it is to deal with it.  Any talk of success, improvement, recovery or being on the right track means very little if we do not address that problem quickly.I am sure the Minister would also agree that getting people back to work has to be central to any sustainable economic strategy.  One cannot grow an economy with this number of people unemployed and dependent on social welfare, considering its cost to the Exchequer.The strategy employed by the Government, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, if I understand it correctly, is the following.  We nurse the banks back to health.  We need them because, no matter how awful they were or how badly they misbehaved, without them we cannot get credit back into the economy.  We must accept this necessary evil of nursing them back to health.  We must cut costs in order to make ourselves competitive, grow exports and get ourselves out of the mess we are in.  That seems to be the strategy being articulated by the Government for dealing with the current economic crisis, but there is a major flaw in the logic of this strategy.It is apparent if one looks at the effect of the austerity strategy over the last couple of years.  Things have not got better.  They have got worse on all those fronts.  The focus on nursing the banks back to health has not produced a release of credit into the economy.  We can all see this.  No money is going from the banks into small businesses, despite our huge efforts to recapitalise the banks and nurse them back to health and the enormous austerity people have had to suffer to do this.Unemployment has not got better.  It has got worse.  There is no sign of significant economic growth.  There has been a small improvement in the export situation but, given the contraction in the rest of the economy, exports are too small a proportion of our economy to drag the country out of recession or to make up the ground necessary to get all those people back to work.The view that the current strategy is not working is not coming only from the Technical Group or from the left, or even the extreme left or whatever term is used to ridicule us.  The UN Conference on Trade and Development produced a report in the last couple of weeks.  It states:A shift from fiscal stimulus towards fiscal tightening is self-defeating, especially in the most developed economies which were severely hit by the financial crisis.  In such a situation a restricted fiscal policy may reduce GDP growth and fiscal revenues and is, therefore, counterproductive in terms of fiscal consolidation.It goes on to say that the fiscal imbalances were not a driving factor of the current crisis rather, they were a result of the crisis.  Getting the books balanced is not the issue because the books are unbalanced because of the financial crisis.  It further states that public bail-outs of financial institutions accounted for a large portion of the deficit, reflecting a conversion from private into public debt.The UN is saying that it was not profligacy in public spending that created the deficit rather, it was the taking on of the private debts of the bankers.  It states public opinion and policy makers should not trust again those institutions, including rating agencies, to judge what constitutes sound macro-economic policies and management of public finances.  The reduction in growth promoting fiscal expenditure may lead to a decline in future Government revenues that would be larger than the fiscal savings obtained by retrenchment, with negative consequences for long term fiscal and debt sustainability.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	534	The UN states that, as an alternative, increases in spending on infrastructure, social transfers or targeted subsidies for private investors tend to be more effective in stimulating the economy because they directly lead to job creation, purchases and demand.The argument for stimulus and investment rather than austerity and a focus on bailing out the banks is being put forward by the UN.  It is also put forward in today's The Irish Times by Mr. Paul Krugman, one of the most prominent economists in the world.  I do not understand why the Government, EU authorities or IMF will not even debate this alternative strategy given the obvious failures of the strategy of austerity and bank bail-outs.The Minister may say that we have no choice because we are a small economy that is bankrupt and dependent on EU money and that even if the Government agreed with me or with this analysis of the UN there is nothing we can do about it.  I put it to the Minister that there is.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, told us recently that our deficit is €15 billion.  He said that if we do not do what the EU tells us we will be left with a deficit of €15 billion.  The Minister accepted that the €15 billion includes the interest repayments on the loans, which on an annual basis is roughly about €4 billion or €5 billion, leaving a deficit of approximately €10 billion or €11 billion.  If one considers that our social welfare budget is approximately €21 billion, it would be reasonable to suggest that half of that results from people who are unemployed but do not want to be unemployed.  It is costing us €20,000 per person to keep people on the dole doing nothing when they want to work.

That is the reason we have a deficit.  I am not suggesting people should work for their dole payments.  Clearly, they must be given better wages than that but the extra money could be, for example, made up from the remaining €5 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund or by putting a small tax on the super wealthy.  If we combine this with the current social welfare budget we could put people back to work doing things such as developing the agri-food sector, sustainable energy, generic medicines and the vital infrastructure of the country.  Why can we not try that approach?

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I thank the Deputies who tabled this motion, on which we have heard an interesting range of contributions.  It would be impossible to do justice to all that people have said.As pointed out by Deputy Halligan, it must be recognised that the Government inherited an appalling situation from the previous Government.  We are spending 40% more than we are raising in revenue.  That is the reason we do not have options involving an easy fiscal stimulus.  We are already spending vastly more than we take in.  We cannot borrow from anywhere but one source, namely, the EU and IMF.  The previous Government's policy resulted in the collapse of the banks and public finances, the loss of 350,000 jobs and a collapse in our competitiveness.  Previously, we were the fourth most competitive economy.  We have now slumped to 29th position.  We lost 31% in our cost competitiveness in export markets.  For six years in a row, we lost export market share.  That is the recipe of economic collapse created by the previous Government and inherited by this Government.There has been a decisive shift in emphasis.  This Government has not been all about nursing along the bad loans of the past or about fixing the public finances.  The first action of this Government was a decisive shift in the tone and direction of the debate through the introduction of a jobs initiative.  Deputy Wallace acknowledged that the VAT cut has had an impact.  Other people have told me the PRSI cut has also had an impact.  Despite the criticism of JobBridge, 4,000 employers are now offering quality employment.  I recently visited VMware in Cork, a significant multinational company which is not alone taking on people from this scheme but is investing €15,000 of its own money in training them.  This should, because of the nature of the enterprise — cloud computing — guarantee them a job either with VMware or another company.It is not true to say that this Government has been continuing on with what the previous Government did.  We have restructured the banks.  We have created pillar banks that have loan to deposit ratios, that are recapitalised and are in a position to lend.  However, as Deputy Wallace said, that does not mean they are lending.  We are confronting that issue, in part by setting targets, which, disappointingly, the banks have not been hitting, and by deliberate interventions.  We will shortly be producing a temporary partial loan guarantee scheme to address the type of needs referred to by Deputy Wallace, namely, the person trying to set up a business but who cannot get €40,000 to do so.  This scheme will not be finalised until later in the year.  The constituent to whom Deputy Wallace referred could have gone to the credit review office of John Trethowan who is overturning half of the banks' decisions in respect of loan refusal in such situations.  There is a need to confront the banks.  Deputy Wallace or others should advise the person concerned to do that.We will also shortly be introducing a micro-finance scheme which will be open to small start-ups who cannot get access to funding.  Micro-finance is available in most European countries but not in Ireland.  It will fill a gap.  There are continuing problems in terms of people accessing credit, which we need to address and in respect of which we need to develop a policy.  We are only six months in office.  The banks have been cleansed of much of the material that needed to be disposed of, namely, external overseas loans.  We now need to manage our banking system into a position whereby it can lend leading to export-led recovery.I recently visited the United States.  Bankers there often refer to themselves as bankers whose expertise is in lending into the green economy.  These banks specialise in that area, know how the sector works, understand the dynamic of it and invest in and lend to companies that can build a future in that area.  We do not have that level of expertise or hands-on ability within our banking structure.  We will have to rebuild that.  That is part of the transformation that has to happen if we are to have a banking system that is fit to drive a small open economy seeking to expand its export performance.A number of speakers said that this Government is all about cutting costs.  Governments do not create jobs.  We need long-term viable enterprises to create sustainable jobs.  When a Government spends 40% more than it raises in revenue, it is not in a position to put people back to work through massive spending schemes, as suggested by Deputy Boyd Barrett.  Such an option is not at the disposal of a Government that has had to go to the lender of last resort to keep the show on the road.Instead, we must concentrate on how we can build a strong export-led recovery and confidence in our economy so that those who could invest will invest in it.  This is the challenge we face.  The first step is to get cost competitive.  Anyone who pretends Ireland is sufficiently cost competitive is fooling himself.  The National Competitiveness Council has stated that in business costs such as water and waste Ireland is one of the most expensive countries.  A heap of services, many of which are provided by the public sector, need to become competitive.A change in this regard is starting, nonetheless.  The National Competitiveness Council reported recently costs are improving with Ireland now 10% more competitive that it was two years ago.  A turnaround is happening with exports strong over the past two years and market share is being rebuilt by young dynamic companies.  There was an increase of 50% in the number employed in high potential start-up companies supported by Enterprise Ireland in the first half of this year.While the Deputies opposite might be right in claiming the jobs initiative is not enough to restore full employment, this is all about rebuilding confidence in the economy.  Other countries will admit Ireland is confronting its public finances.  The Government has renegotiated the bailout deal with the EU which makes the debt sustainability much stronger as we are not paying exorbitant interest rates for the moneys on which we rely.  The most creative and dynamic multinationals are choosing Ireland as the place to do business, as seen in yesterday's jobs announcement from Twitter and today's from Dun and Bradstreet.I share Deputy Pringle's concern that Irish companies are not sufficiently accessing new export markets.  Returning to the Department after 14 years, I was disappointed to learn the share of Irish indigenous exports has not increased since 1997, remaining at 10% of total exports.  We need to drive these companies.  This will involve securing finance for them so they do not have to sell off because they have hit their ceiling and cannot expand.I am not understating the scale of the challenge that faces us.  I agree with Deputy Boyd Barrett that as a society we must decide employment is our priority.  It will, however, be driven by enterprise and not a free-spending strategy from the Government.  We cannot afford such a scheme in the first place and in any event they tend not to work.  We must rebuild a strong enterprise economy that is more creative, competitive and effective in winning and opening markets.  The Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs is addressing these areas.  The Ministers of State at my Department, Deputies Perry and Sherlock, are focusing on small business and innovation.  I believe, with much effort and patience, we can turn this economy around.  We can create the strategy to change the economy around, one based on prudent management of our resources, a willingness to reform the way public resources are managed and driving enterprise and creativity through every sector.
#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	541	Unemployment must be the major issue of concern for all Members.  It is somewhat unfair that this motion refers to the jobs initiative as tokenistic.  I cannot see what is tokenistic about a major reduction in VAT and PRSI rates for employers of low-paid workers.  I doubt those paying for these tax cuts through the levy on their pensions would regard it as tokenistic either.  The results from the initiative have also been promising which validate its direction and target.  In the hospitality sector, the falling costs in VAT, PRSI and changes to the wage-setting mechanisms have resulted in a reduction in prices charged and, accordingly, an increase in tourists visiting Ireland.  In the restaurant industry alone, it was recently announced it saw an increase of 500 jobs in just two months.  Exports have grown, particularly in the high-value food area.  This is all being underpinned by the drive to contain and reduce business costs.I accept the motion's point that unemployment is our largest challenge as it is a real economic tragedy.  If we do not stabilise the downward trend in employment, the reduction in spending power in the economy will simply reinforce this downward spiral.  An unemployment rate at 14% means no family has been unaffected by the demoralising effect of unemployment.Our economic recovery depends on a world recovery and Ireland being competitive enough to sell into that world.  Regarding the latter, it is acknowledged Ireland has made progress in driving down costs.  While achieving a world recovery is not in our control, preventing one is.  The world financial crisis is at its most acute with market sentiment fragile and near to imploding.  The last thing Ireland wants to do is be a catalyst for causing such an implosion.  That is why I am surprised Members opposite call for burning the unguaranteed bondholders.  I dearly wish when the bank guarantee was given in 2008 and when Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in 2009, a stand had been taken to distance taxpayers from responsibility for those unguaranteed bonds.  No one lobbied harder than Fine Gael to make that stand.  However, conditions have changed.  Ireland is in a bailout situation, a bankrupt country dependent on the lender of last resort as the Minister stated earlier.  There are conditions to the bailout which must be observed even though we may not like them.  Now, with the financial markets in such a fragile state, is not the time to renegotiate this.  It is irresponsible to talk about burning the bondholders when one sees the contagion effect of a possible French bank meltdown arising from the recent suggestion that Greece may default.Deputy Pringle referred to changes to the PRSI arrangements for self-employed people who lose their business.  They must be afforded protection under the social welfare system.  The JobBridge programme needs to be amended to cater for young graduates.  Originally, the GradLink programme was to be incorporated into the internship programme, but few young graduates are eligible for the latter.  We cannot forget about them and I would like to see the programme tweaked to allow some of them to avail of it.  Young graduates, particularly science graduates, lose their skills quickly if they are not employed.  Worse yet, they could emigrate.  We cannot afford to lose them.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I welcome the opportunity to respond to the motion.  The second paragraph lays an implicit charge of dishonesty at the Government's door.  Even on a cursory analysis, this charge does not amount to much.  It is more of the unfortunate, empty rhetoric and bogus claims we have come to expect from Members on the benches opposite, albeit with some notable exceptions.From day one of this national Government, we have all set about the task of dragging the country out of the mire, as the Minister correctly stated.  We have been up front and honest with the people about the scale of the challenge ahead.  We have rolled up our sleeves and got stuck into the business of getting Ireland back to work.  As we all know only too well, people have suffered from the recklessness of the banks egged on by successive Fianna Fáil Administrations.  It is every Member's job to get the country back on its feet.As Deputy Mitchell stated, the jobs initiative, the targeted cut in VAT rates and the decrease in PRSI charged on employers have led to shoots of recovery in, for example, the tourism market.  Lest we forget, the number of visits jumped by more than 9% between May and July.  GDP expanded by 1.6% in the second quarter of the year.  An even stronger increase has been recorded on an annual basis.  Taken with the first quarter's figures, last week's data show that a recovery is under way.We extracted over the course of several weeks a significant saving on the bad bailout deal surrendered by the former Government last year, yet this annual saving of several hundred million euro to the people we all represent does not attract a mere mention from the Opposition.  Everyday we battle to restore Ireland's reputation internationally.  Arguably, this is working well.  For example, last week Reuters stated: "Irish GDP jump offers rare euro zone bright spot".  Last Friday, David Cottle of The Wall Street Journal wrote: “Ireland achieving quiet success”.  The day before in the same newspaper, Eamon Quinn wrote: “Celtic Tiger purrs”.  These headlines were unimaginable a short six months ago.Lest we need to be reminded, our sovereignty was pawned off less than a year ago.  We are in what amounts to a wartime situation.  We need more of the Churchillian spirit.

I accept that the Opposition has a duty to perform.  All I ask is that it do so constructively and honestly.  Even a cursory perusal of the motion leads me to the sad conclusion that a large number of Members on the benches opposite, with some exceptions, inhabit what I would charitably call a solution-free zone.  I do not doubt for one minute that Deputy Boyd Barrett and his colleagues are all concerned with the crisis of joblessness, but the 460,000 plus people who are out of work demand a sustainable recovery, sustainable jobs and realistic solutions to the problems they face.  Many Deputies agree that none of the empty rhetoric in the House to date and in the coming weeks and months will pay the bills or feed the families of the people we represent.
#PaudieCoffey	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-party	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-dob	unknown-#PaudieCoffey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Technical Group's important debate on unemployment levels.  I respect the views of every Deputy, as every view is worth consideration, but we must propose realistic solutions.I will correct the motion's flawed wording.  For example, it names Waterford companies.  While they have suffered job losses, not all of them have closed, which is contrary to what is stated in the motion.  Waterford Iron Foundry is now Waterford Stanley and employs 120 people in the city.  There is a great deal of spin-off employment in the various stores it supplies.  My brother lost his job at Teva Pharmaceuticals last January, but it continues to employ 415 people in the city.  The motion refers to the company as being closed.  Despite the more than 200 redundancies at GlaxoSmithKline in Dungarvan, it still employs 570 people and maintains a presence in the constituency.  While there have been a number of job losses in those companies, they have restructured.  It is important that the Government does everything within its power to ensure that the remaining jobs are protected.  Job protection is now as important as job creation.The motion contains flaws.  I am also disappointed by the small number of constructive proposals it contains.  A negative motion, it offers no solutions to unemployment and takes cheap shots at the national internship scheme and the jobs initiative, which are getting people off the live register and returning young people to employment where they can gain experience that will stand to them and keep them in the workplace for the near future.There is no magic solution to the problems we face.  We must be realistic, accept that the country is on its knees and put our shoulders to the wheel to ensure it can recover and get back on its feet.  The Government has inherited an economic mess.  The legacy of Fianna Fáil Governments sees Ireland with unprecedented levels of indebtedness, a property bubble propagated by reckless policies, an unregulated banking sector and the erosion of competitiveness by unsustainable policies.  Consequently, our international reputation has been destroyed.  One of the first actions by the Government upon taking office was to get out there internationally to try to restore our reputation.  We are beginning to see positive results.In the mid to late 1990s when Fine Gael and the Labour Party were last in government, we were creating 1,000 jobs per week.  We need to revert to the fundamental policies of job creation, sustainable employment and competitiveness.  Unless we do so, nothing good will come of rewinding the clock two or three years to a false economy dependent on people selling properties to one another.  Our economy has an annual deficit of €19 billion.  We have a job to do and will do it with a social conscience to lessen the impact as much as possible.  However, we need to balance our books and prove to international investors that we can do so.  We need to regain control of our finances.Last week, I attended an event at Merck Sharp & Dohme.  It has made an additional €100 million investment in research and development.  I was told by its general manager that, of the five pharmaceuticals it was developing globally, three were being developed between Clonmel, Waterford and Ballydine.  Two were for insomnia and the third was for diabetes.  Research and development is the type of sustainable employment that we need to encourage.Recently, Bausch & Lomb invested more than €100 million in its plant in Waterford city.  Genzyme, a pharmaceutical company employing more than 500 people, is celebrating ten years in the city and will invest more than €125 million in its expansion.  Boston Scientific in the south east employs 575 people and is making an investment of €26 million.Many members of the Technical Group proposed in their election manifestos to raise corporation tax rates.  If we did so, we could not sustain these levels of employment in large companies in the south east.  We would drive many of those companies and jobs out of the country.  Our proposals need to be realistic.I welcome the attendance of the Minister of State, Deputy Perry.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, supporting enterprises, research and development, innovation and indigenous industries, the potential of the agrifood sector and food sciences and exporting our expertise in these areas can be exploited to the full.  We do not need to return to where we were two or three years ago.  We need to return to where we were in the mid to late 1990s when we were creating sustainable jobs on a weekly basis and when our economy's fundamentals were sound.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	546	I welcome this timely assessment of and opportunity for reflection on the Government's record to date.  It challenges the record of our first six months in government, from what we have done to what some Independents perceive we have not done.  Anyone who makes an honest assessment of the economy recognises the need for growth, as it is the only means of establishing stability, creating jobs and, in turn, repaying our debts.If we cannot achieve economic growth, we will fail miserably in our objectives, as set out.  Anything else is only a distraction from the truth and is not worthy of much further comment.  The Government's record, as outlined by the Minister and others, stands on its own and does not need to be reinforced by me.I take issue with the condemnation of the present Government.  The motion condemns the "present Government" for "opting to make good the gambling debts of unguaranteed bondholders".  I do not understand why the motion should condemn the "present Government".  The problem is not the fault of the present Government.

I ask the movers of the motion to recognise that.  The Opposition should recognise the efforts being made by the present Government to deal with the repayments, including those we cannot handle and those we are challenged to deal with.There is ongoing debate on the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes that commit the State to pay in excess of €3 billion per year for the next ten years and some €17 billion in additional interest.  This arrangement was signed off on by the previous Government, not the current one.  Notwithstanding the actions of the previous Government, the present Government has set about, very successfully, renegotiating many aspects of the EU-IMF deal.  Some of the best estimates to date on the actions that have been taken by the Minister for Finance show that up to €9 billion can be saved over the lifetime of the repayments.  In addition, there is hope that the arrangement pertaining to the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes can be renegotiated, and that a much better, fairer and more sustainable deal can be achieved by the Government.

It is not for us to aspire to defaulting.  This is not a starting position from which a Government can set out.  What we can do is make our debts more manageable, have a sustainable economy and deal with the real issues.  There is a money system, we bought into it and must move with it.  We rely on the funding of the ECB and, therefore, telling it we will not pay our debts will not get us out of the hole we are in.  We have achieved savings of nearly €7 billion through agreements with junior bondholders.  These are very significant changes by any standards.Consider the phrase, "honestly deliver on its commitment to ‘Get Ireland Working'".  I do not know why there should be a reference to honesty or dishonesty.  The wording is peculiar, to say the least.Many in the Technical Group have argued against austerity and stated it is not a good measure.  The opposite to austerity is what we had, and it was exemplified by the Bertie Ahern and Charlie McCreevy schools of economics.  These got us into the position we are in and are certainly not the solution.  Austerity is good provided it is equitable and targeted equally at all those who can bear it most.We can be either a forward-looking, strong, competitive country with a positive attitude or a negative country that desires to default.  I began by saying growth in the economy is very important and that we need to inspire confidence in the economy.  The negativity from the now absent Technical Group is not helpful, constructive or positive.  It will not get us to where we need to be.

I could not help being struck by the last speaker's contribution in which he said he did not want to take us back to the era of Mr. Charlie McCreevy and Mr. Bertie Ahern.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	553	This year, more than 3.1 billion will be at work in the world at large.  This is a greater number than ever before, yet there is a pervading sense of crisis over jobs.  This is because there are now 205 million people officially unemployed in the world.  A high percentage of these are under the age of 25.  It is often overlooked that the quality of the jobs available seems to be in decline, especially for routine white collar workers in rich countries.  This country is no exception to what is happening in the rest of the world.  More than one in every seven jobs, or approximately one in six, created during the Celtic tiger era has disappeared in recent years.  Official unemployment is now edging towards 15%, which figure does not count people on schemes, those who have gone back to full-time education because they cannot get a job and, more important, people who are emigrating.  The Department of Finance estimates that net emigration between April 2010 and April 2012 will reach 120,000.  If anything, this is understated.Approximately 15,000 fewer people are at work than in the last quarter of 2010.  One in every three people under 25 is out of a job.  What is most significant is that more than one in two unemployed people, or effectively 60%, have been jobless for more than a year.  That is scary.  Just two years ago, that figure was only one in five.
#PeterMathews	unknown-#PeterMathews-party	unknown-#PeterMathews-dob	unknown-#PeterMathews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	554	Why is that?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	555	The devastating human, social and economic consequences of long-term unemployment need no elaboration.  It is very difficult for an individual who has been unemployed for more than 12 months to get back into the workforce.  It is very difficult and costly for the agencies of the State to get that person back into mainstream employment.  There have been a number of studies on this, all of which have come to the same conclusion.  The most recent detailed study of the recession and job losses suffered in Japan, published last year, found those who experienced long periods of unemployment in their early careers now account for almost 60% of cases of severe and chronic depression in the country, often leading to suicide or attempted suicide.Ireland is relying on exports, but exports are very slow burners when creating jobs.  The Minister extolled the success of the Government in regard to exports.  Statistics show we have recovered about 75% of the export market we lost during recent years, but global volumes of trade have returned to their pre-crisis peaks, which means we have actually lost market share.  It gives me no pleasure to say the export figures for July show a very significant downturn, which is extremely worrying.  That is due to the economic ill-health of our trading partners, which I freely acknowledge.  The Members on the other side of the House, who used to sit here, never acknowledge that.  We have a small, open trading economy, as all speakers on the Government side have said, and naturally our performance depends on the economic health of our trading partners.As acknowledged on all sides of the House, there are steps we can take.  It is true we have regained some competitiveness since 2008.  That said, many cost increases have been as a result of cyclical rather than structural factors, for example, subsidies for major energy consumers and currency fluctuations.  The problem is that if the structural barriers preventing costs from adjusting to lower growth are not removed pretty quickly, recent competitiveness gains will be rapidly eroded once the economy starts to recover.  Given Ireland's reliance on trade and the open nature of its economy, international cost competitiveness is a crucial determinant of our economic well-being.The Government has identified all the areas where it needs to take action pretty urgently in this regard.  We read about the impending legal services legislation, in respect of which there are reported divisions in Cabinet.  I hope that is not correct.  Although the areas of energy costs, utilities costs, rent, rates, insurance, and so on have been identified clearly, we are still awaiting action.  I hope that, having given the Government a fair period of grace over its first seven or eight months, we will see early action on many of these fronts.There is also the question of credit.  There is a credit famine in the country and we discussed this matter today at a meeting of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Social Protection and Education.  We were told one can appeal to a credit review committee but when we asked the departmental officials how many cases had been referred to this committee we were told the number was 100 cases, which is laughable, and that 30 of them were successful.  This is a drop in the ocean.  The fact is a credit famine exists.I realise the Government has heavily recapitalised the banks, and the banks are now in a position to extend lending to business at a realistic level.  However, they are not doing so.  The Government has announced two impending initiatives — it has been announcing them for the past eight months and I hope we will see them shortly — which are the micro-finance initiative and the partial credit guarantee scheme.  The figures we have heard they will cover are minuscule and are just the tip of the iceberg.  Recently, I spoke to business people in the UK, which has a far more extensive partial credit guarantee scheme, and it is not working.  The UK is experiencing exactly the same credit problems for businesses as are experienced here.There is much we can do with regard to innovation in areas such as digital games, cloud computing and life sciences.  The Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has pointed out to us on many occasions that programmes exist which trundle along but there now needs to be a step-change in how we approach these matters.  I know of many SMEs which, because the domestic market is flat, have been trying to break into the export market but no assistance or encouragement is available for them.  There is no mentoring or organised system for receiving advice.  We should consider a MABS-type system for small businesses.  It is in the Government's power to take various other initiatives at relatively little cost.I will not get into a debate on the effectiveness or otherwise of the jobs initiative.  All I will state is that it had some effect, particularly in the sectors of the tourism industry at which it was targeted, but the sad reality is that unemployment has increased by approximately 25,000 since the jobs initiative was announced.  We all know that finance for the jobs initiative was secured by raiding private pension funds.The centrepiece of the jobs initiative is a reduction in VAT.  I was the first person to reply for the Opposition when the jobs initiative was announced, and I stated in so far as stimulating the economy was concerned a number of studies indicated that a scatter-gun VAT reduction is the worst way to go about it.  I quoted the experience of Gordon Brown's Government, which was the previous Labour Party Government in the UK, which reduced VAT substantially.  The result was disastrous; it created no jobs and plunged the country further into debt.  We have not plunged ourselves further into debt; we have plunged private pensioners who have been saving for years further into debt.If we are to get a grip on the problem and take action which is in our own power to take — I recognise all of this is heavily influenced by world factors such as what will happen to the euro — we must look to the next budget for a far more radical approach than the approach we have seen to date from the Government.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	556	I thank the proposers of the motion for giving us an opportunity to discuss what is one of the most important issues facing the Government and the House.  It is right at this stage that we have a general review of the jobs budget or jobs initiative — I will not get into parsing the words.  What was sold at the time of the election was that when the now Government parties came to power they would introduce appropriate measures, bring a budget before the House within a set number of days and set about resolving the jobs crisis.Deputy O'Dea referred to the jobs initiative, has largely been a failure.  The Government pinned much of its activities, resources and efforts on the tourism sector at a time when that sector was recovering.  The Government set its targets against one of the lowest levels tourism had seen for many years, largely influenced by the ash cloud which occurred the previous year and which had skewed numbers completely off target.  It would be a trick to suggest that growth rates in excess of 10%, 12% or 15% would be the result as that was happening in any event.  The extent to which the VAT reduction in particular has had on activity is marginal.  To boil it down, the simple fact of the matter is that the 4% reduction in VAT on a meal for two would not pay for a cup of tea for one afterwards.  This is the minuscule effect it has had on the tourism sector.As Deputy O'Dea stated, the measure will remove €800 million from the pockets of pensioners over a full year period.  These are people who genuinely spend money, but if they are frightened and uncertainty is created about their future they will not spend.  It is my view, and over time statistics will bear this out, the net effect of transferring wealth from pensioners to the VAT reduction will be a destabilising effect on the economy, because money is being taken from those who spend.  A little confidence would have allowed these people to continue to plan for their future and spend as they always have done.  This is a real issue.During the course of the election campaign, the Government parties attacked the previous Government for the introduction of the travel tax.  We had reduced it to a relatively nominal figure and were using it to support and promote the activities of Fáilte Ireland and Tourism Ireland with regard to attracting inward investment.  The Government parties stated they would abolish it, set about doing so but have so far failed in the attempt.  It has failed to achieve success with the airlines and has failed to convince them of the necessity to attract greater tourism levels.  It has failed to meet their demands and needs.I have sat on the other side of the House and I accept airlines are difficult to deal with, particularly one which is among the largest in Europe.  They do not negotiate easily and they certainly do not assist Governments.  The Government parties seemed to be on their side when they were on this side of the House and made it sound very plausible and easy, that all the airlines needed was tender loving care and, lo and behold, the bedrooms of Ireland would be filled with tourists from overseas.  The Government has not succeeded in doing this.  It would be nice if we had a little humility and acceptance with regard to the issues that have had to be faced.I will remind the Government of the historical context in which it fought the election and what was included in the programme for Government.  There was much talk about the strategic investment bank, which would be the panacea to create jobs.  I have not heard much about it recently.  The Government has spoken much about banking and the implementation of the banking strategy we put in place——

I commend the Technical Group on bringing the motion before the House.Jobs, the lack of jobs and our efforts to create and retain jobs are issues that have a real impact on the lives of ordinary people right across the State, whom we know are struggling.  The political choices made by successive Governments have ensured that.  In truth, we have a crisis, which this Government thinks it can cut its way out of.  The austerity measures being planned by the Government, and prescribed by the previous one, have resulted in hundreds of thousands of people being unemployed and wondering which bills to prioritise: the weekly grocery bill, the visit to the doctor, the child care fees, the ESB bill, the gas bill or the back to school fees, including uniforms, transport, books and registration, not to mention the rent or mortgage.  Many people now find themselves in a situation where they have no disposable income at all.  Many are faced with having to make a choice as to whether to call a plumber, visit the doctor, pay house insurance or simply to put food on the table.While the Government dithers around the edges with a jobs budget-cum-initiative, more and more people are being dragged under the water.  Having more than 470,000 people out of work is a national emergency.  A total of 60,000 young people emigrating is a moral disgrace.  It cannot be allowed to continue.  Our best and brightest are boarding planes and ships on an hourly basis.  We are losing a generation of bright, energetic and gifted young people because of a lack of action on jobs.  We need real and meaningful solutions.It is time for the Government to re-evaluate its course of action.  It is time for it to get its priorities straight, to get this country back on its feet and to start to make the right choices for the people of this State.  People want to work.  They have a right to work.  Article 15.1 of the EU Convention on Human Rights tells us that we have a right to engage in work and to pursue a freely chosen or accepted occupation.  This country needs a job creation and stimulus package if we are to fulfil these obligations.  We must provide people with opportunities.  Successive Governments have failed to do that.  They have consistently relied on short-term measures which we all knew were destined for failure.Sinn Féin warned that the construction sector was over-inflated.  We demanded pre-emptive intervention for workers in vulnerable sectors of the economy.  We warned that economic growth was being driven by domestic consumption rather than exports.  Nothing was done.  There is an epidemic of wrong choices and inaction in this country when it comes to job protection and creation.  Small and medium enterprises need to be able to access money.  They need to be able to access credit.  We need them to be able to get paid.  There is without doubt a better way to protect and save jobs.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Literacy and Numeracy Strategy was launched by my colleague, the Minister for Education and Skills, in July of this year. The Strategy's publication is a milestone in the development of the early years sector in Ireland, as it recognises the central role played by experiences in early childhood in the development of literacy and numeracy skills.Early intervention is crucial and the Strategy provides for a range of actions to support pre-school children and their families, to be undertaken by my Department. These actions include encouraging and supporting the upskilling of early childhood care and education (ECCE) practitioners. A key element of this will be to support the implementation of the Workforce Development Plan by the Early Years Education Policy Unit of the Department of Education and Skills, which is co-located within my Department. The Workforce Development Plan provides a framework for ensuring that personnel working in the ECCE sector have access to accredited training, enabling quality and standards in ECCE services to be continuously improved.As the Free Preschool Year has just completed its first full year of operation, we have also begun to collect data on the scope and nature of practice in ECCE settings. A number of research and development activities are planned to inform the optimum strategies through which to progress the objectives of the literacy and numeracy strategy in early childhood settings.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	580	My Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector. These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by Léargas — The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce — the President's Award.Funding of €60.954m is available from my Department to support the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth work sector.  Youth work programmes and services are delivered to young participants in the various programmes by some 1,100 youth work staff and by a volunteer base of over 60,000.  As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to the development of a new youth policy framework which my Department is currently progressing. Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people.I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across departments and services and will set out the priorities, rationale and criteria for future funding programmes.  It will also accommodate issues relevant to young people within the 10-24 age range in informal or out-of-school settings that fall within the remit of my Department.  The overall aim will be to clarify and enhance coherence, connectivity, coordination and delivery in youth services and related out-of-schools services for young people and to ensure such provision is both quality and outcomes based.Ensuring quality service delivery is an ongoing priority for me. My Department is at present progressing two quality standards initiatives in the youth area that will help ensure an improvement in good practice, that services are outcomes focussed and that the young people involved are deriving the maximum benefit from being involved.  The developmental and supportive nature of the National Quality Standards Framework for youth work (NQSF), introduced in January 2011 on a phased and incremental basis, gives youth organisations and services the opportunity to articulate their youth work practice through a structured framework and to review, assess and continually develop this practice.  The NQSF applies to all staff-led youth work organisations, services, projects and programmes funded by the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department.In addition to setting national standards for "staff-led" youth work projects and organisations, my Department, having consulted widely with young people, volunteers, youth work staff and the National Youth Work Advisory Committee, is now finalising a set of best-practice standards for volunteer-led youth clubs and groups.  The overall aim of these standards will be to support some 1,580 clubs with some 89,000 members in creating and providing quality developmental programmes and activities for young people in safe and supportive environments and to ensure that there is a connection and continuity with the standards that exist for staff-led youth provision.

The need for follow up action will be informed by the findings of the national audit.The HSE's National Director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, is also at my request engaging directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns.  Mr. Jeyes will report formally to me on progress in this regard.

The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by raising societal awareness of child abuse and the need to better safeguard children.It is my intention that the legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk. My Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in developing the best legislative means to underpin Children First. My Department will also be working with other relevant Government Departments and agencies, including professional regulatory bodies  in formulating legislative proposals. With regard to relevant professional regulatory bodies, my Department has written to these bodies seeking their input and meetings are in the process of being arranged.I am particularly interested in benefiting from the experience of these bodies with the implementation of the Children First Guidelines over the last decade. This experience will inform the implementation of the recently published revised Guidance and the Children First legislation which is planned to further strengthen implementation. I would hope that the legislative proposals which I will bring forward in this regard enjoy widespread support in the interests of protecting vulnerable children.

The inaugural meeting took place on September 15th last, and the second meeting was held just last week.The Task Force will advise my Department in regard to the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, and will base its work on best practice in child welfare, family support and public administration; consistent with the Government's public sector reform agenda.In relation to the Agency it has been asked to:Propose a vision and the principles to guide operations;Advise on the appropriate service responsibilities, and the delivery of same;Review existing financial, staffing and corporate resources; and propose a methodology for resource allocation;Propose an organisational design and operating child welfare and protection service model;Prepare a detailed implementation plan;Identify the main priorities and core relationships required;Oversee the implementation and monitor progress, pending establishment of the Agency.The Task Force is currently finalising a detailed work programme and has established a number of sub-groups to assist it in its work.  It is envisaged that the Task Force will meet on a fortnightly basis with sub-groups meeting in between.  The Task Force's work will inform preparations for the new Agency, including the drafting of legislation.

The draft standards will then be amended based on feedback received from the consultation and the final draft standards will be forwarded to me for approval early next year.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	585	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 80 together.My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and service providers engaged in addressing the problem of youth homelessness met at the end of May,  to assess and review the current demand for services, the progress made to date under the  Youth Homelessness Strategy 2001 and the need to address any outstanding service deficits. This workshop was very beneficial in getting the views of stakeholders and arising out of the priorities identified on the day, work will commence shortly on a high level review of the 2001  strategy. This review will form the basis for the development of an implementation framework to address youth homelessness over the next 5 years.It is appropriate that some ten years after the National Strategy for Youth Homelessness was developed in 2001, we review progress and set new targets. A review of progress in 2008 by the HSE in conjunction with other agencies found that significant progress had been made, especially in interagency co-operation, early prevention and an ‘out of hours' service. A standardised system is in place whereby gardaí can access an appropriate place of safety for children found to be at risk out of hours under Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. The service is designed to ensure that children presenting as ‘at risk' outside of normal working hours are provided with an appropriate emergency place of safety, thereby reducing or eliminating social admissions of children in an acute hospital setting.In addition, a pilot out-of-hours social work service is being tested in two locations as provided for in the Implementation Plan published following the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse.It is acknowledged that there remain serious information deficits with regard to the number of children accessing services. Work is under way to improve the quality of information on the number of young people under 18 years who are homeless, and to establish what areas of the service are working well and where further improvements are needed. The review now being undertaken by my Department will address these requirements.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	586	The introduction of a missing children's hotline has been the subject of discussions between my Department, other Government Departments and prospective service providers including NGOs.  The notification of a missing child is a matter for the Garda Síochána, and accordingly I am in contact with  my colleague Mr Alan Shatter TD, Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence in seeking to jointly achieve the establishment of this service.In the current financial it is essential that the most economic approach possible is taken to providing any service.  I would hope that a partnership approach can achieve a cost effective solution to the implementation of this important initiative and my Department is committed to seeking to achieve this outcome.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	587	Tackling child poverty is a priority for Government and a key goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007- 2016, coordinated by the Department of Social Protection. Children are more likely to be poor if they are living in lone parent households with low  labour market participation and dependant on income support. The Government programme sets out a framework to achieve real and sustainable economic growth, increase employment and protect the most vulnerable in society.As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, improving children's outcomes is a key objective. Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those that are aimed at low income families, are important priorities in my Department to enhance children's opportunities for social and educational development and to support parents undertaking training and participating in employment. The network of 107 family resource centres  that are funded by the Family Support Agency, under the remit of my Department, also have an important role in this regard. These programmes will inform the Government's plans to develop an area based approach to child poverty.My priority, as Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, is to enhance the role of early intervention and support programmes for the most vulnerable children and their families in the context of the new Child and Family Support Services Agency.My Department works closely with other departments and agencies with shared objectives to secure better outcomes for children and young people. In particular, my Department works closely with the Department of Social Protection which is charged with the development of appropriate social protection policies, including in respect of children affected by poverty. My Department is represented on the Advisory Group on Tax and Social Welfare established by the Minister for Social Protection  to examine issues to do with the interactions of the tax and welfare systems so that they provide good incentives for parents to take up and remain in work and thereby contribute to the reduction of poverty and child poverty, in particular.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Section 45 of the Childcare Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view in relation to each person leaving care as to whether there is a "need for assistance" and if it forms such a view to provide services in accordance with the section and subject to resources and that all young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care or high support, are entitled to an Aftercare Service based on their assessed needs. The core eligible age range for aftercare is 18 years and up to 21 years which can extend until the completion of a course of education in which he/she is engaged up to the age of 23 years of age. A total of 1,051 young people were in receipt of aftercare nationally at March 2011.  The breakdown between male and female was 46% and 54% respectively.Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young persons need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education. One of the key features of Aftercare support is to advocate on behalf of young people to promote their development as a fulfilled adult in their community.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.The HSE National Aftercare Service is  underpinned by a National Policy and Procedures Document which has been developed in cooperation with the key stakeholders including the voluntary sector agencies involved in Aftercare provision and my Department. The policy commits to promoting and achieving the best outcomes for young people leaving care and in ensuring consistency of support to these young people.The HSE National Policy on Aftercare is being rolled out nationally under the watch of the HSE's Aftercare Implementation Group, which includes representation from the HSE, mental health, family service and disability service, as well as representation from the voluntary sector and a young persons representative from Empowering People in Care (EPIC).I am acutely aware of the challenges facing the aftercare service, the need for information required to plan the services; the need for consistency across all areas; the need to follow up with young people who may at first reject its services and the need to link in with adult services as necessary. To accommodate such challenges funding was reviewed in 2011 to support the recruitment of ten additional aftercare workers. Additionally funding was provided to EPIC to develop a national advocacy and support service for young people in care, leaving care and aftercare.

In reviewing its overall appointment and recruitment the HSE, last week, prioritised some key development posts and decided to process the recruitment of these staff with a view to their taking up employment before the end  of the year.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that 60 additional social workers have been prioritised and included in this category of staff.  This means that the HSE has confirmed that it will be in a position to finalise the recruitment of  the additional social workers between now and the end of the year
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	590	I propose to take Questions Nos. 68 and 71 together.My Department provides a range of funding schemes, programmes and supports to the youth sector.  These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by Léargas — The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce the President's Award.This funding supports the delivery of a range of youth work programmes and services for all young people, including those from disadvantaged communities, by the voluntary youth sector.  Youth work programmes and services are delivered to young participants in the various programmes by some 1,100 youth work staff and by a volunteer base of over 60,000.  The main objectives of the Youth Affairs Unit in my Department are to develop and implement coherent, coordinated and relevant youth policies and strategies to support the youth sector in providing effective non-formal education and developmental opportunities for young people through which they can enhance and develop their personal and social skills and competencies.To support this work, the Youth Affairs Unit of my Department has a budget in 2011 of €60.154m on current expenditure and €0.8m on capital expenditure.  In the context of the Government's Comprehensive Review of Expenditure, and in the context of the development of a youth policy framework that is currently being progressed, my Department is reviewing the allocation of funding with a view to ensuring more efficient management and value for money as well as ensuring that the funding provided is both quality and outcomes focussed.  It is intended, in particular, to review the current spread of funding available across multiple sub-heads and schemes which reflect responsibilities having historically been allocated across a number of Government Departments and which may be unnecessarily complicated in the context of the new Department of Children and Youth Affairs.

The strategy will build on Our Children — Their Lives, Ireland’s first children’s strategy which was published in 2000 and it will cover the period from 2012 to 2017.The new strategy is being developed in a holistic way to comprehend the continuum of the life course from infancy, through early and middle childhood, to adolescence through to early adulthood, in keeping with my Department's responsibilities for children and young people. The strategy will have a specific focus on the aspects of growth and development that are unique to each time period and the policies and services that need to be prioritised at each stage to secure good outcomes for children and young people.The new strategy for children and young people will be the overarching framework under which policy and services for children and young people will be developed and implemented in the State. Early childhood care and education is a key commitment in the Government for National Recovery programme.  The future direction of early childhood care and education policy is set out in recent policy commitments developed by my Department with the Department of Education and Skills such as the free preschool year in Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme, Síolta, and Aistear, the Workforce Development Plan for the early education sector and the recently launched National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy.  I intend to build on these initiatives in formulating  a national plan  for the development of early childhood care and education.It is clear from both the research evidence and what children and young people have to say that there are a number of new and emerging issues which are impacting upon their lives. Prominent social policy concerns relate to childhood obesity and child poverty and it is evident that aspects of consumerism are impacting on children's experience of growing up. Children and young people participating in Dáil na nÓg have voiced their concerns about being negatively represented in the media and they have spoken about the pressures they experience to conform to idealised body images portrayed in media. The impact of consumerism, in its various forms, has been identified for further investigation in my Department's work to improve data and research on children lives. The development of  the new children and young people's strategy  provides an opportunity to focus on these issues and how they may be addressed to improve the experience of  growing up in Ireland for this and future generations of children.It is anticipated that the new children and young people's strategy will be published mid 2012.

The immediate and the ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA) relating to accommodation, medical and social needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991. Where children are identified by An Garda Síochána, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.The Implementation Plan on the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009, contained a commitment that the HSE would end the use of separately run hostels for separated children seeking asylum and accommodate children in mainstream care, on a par with other children in the care system. In accordance with this commitment, the HSE phased out hostel type care for separated children seeking asylum and since January 2011, hostels have  not been used  to accommodate unaccompanied minors. Instead each child is cared for in a  registered care placement or equivalent.The HSE has developed a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.

An audit was undertaken last March and the HSE has provided the following information based on this audit.A total of 1,051 young people were in receipt of aftercare nationally at March 2011.  The breakdown between male and female was 46% and 54% respectively.Aftercare provision incorporates advice, guidance and practical support. An individual holistic needs assessment identifies a young persons need for accommodation, financial support, social network support and training and education. One of the key features of Aftercare support is to advocate on behalf of young people to promote their development as a fulfilled adult in their community.  The most important requirements for young people leaving care are for secure, suitable accommodation as well as further education, employment or training.Finally, information on the numbers of aftercare workers employed and their location is not currently accessible and I am informed that the HSE is in the process of collecting this data.

Included within that sum is €0.8m for capital funding under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.The Young People's Facilities and Services Funding (YPFSF) was established in 1998 to assist in the development of preventative strategies/initiatives in a targeted manner through the development of youth facilities, (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Applications for funding under the YPFSF are made through the relevant Development Group which determines the suitability of proposals against priorities identified for the area and funding is allocated to relevant projects taking account of this advice amongst other criteria.The Fund is now under the remit of my Department and currently operates in 22 areas — 14 Local Drug Task Force areas, (12 in Dublin, Bray and Cork) and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and the towns of Carlow, Athlone, Arklow, Dundalk and Wexford.Since it was established in 1998, the Government has allocated approximately €201m under the Young Peoples Facilities & Services Fund (YPFSF) to assist in the development of youth facilities (including sport and recreational facilities) and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug abuse problem exists or has the potential to develop.  Approximately €69m has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of over 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.My Department is assisted in its assessment of the need for facilities for young people under the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, by the National Assessment Committee which includes representatives of other Government Departments, community and voluntary representatives, a representative from Dublin City Council and from the City of Dublin Youth Services Board (CDYSB).  The role of the NAC was to ensure that local plans and projects approved for funding addressed gaps in provision at local level.In addition to funding provided through the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund, a national competitive youth café development scheme was initiated in 2010 with an allocation of approximately €1.6m from Dormant Accounts funds. Under the competitive scheme, which was operated for my Department by Pobal, a total of 48 existing youth cafés received funds to improve and augment existing facilities. These funds were paid out in early 2011. In a separate strand of the scheme development funding of up to €95,000 per location was awarded to a total of 16 new youth café projects. The latter will finance the opening of a completely new facility in each case and the 16 locations are spread throughout the country. The new facilities can be expected to come on stream gradually from late 2011 up to the end of 2012 depending on the scale of individual projects. Pobal will monitor progress on the delivery of each new facility and report back to my Department in due course. The scheme is an excellent example of a significant benefit being achieved for local communities from a relatively small amount of investment by the state.

A number of significant structural and legislative changes are key to effecting such reform.  This includes the establishment of a new agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE and reporting directly to my Department. Work on the establishment of the agency is under way and will include the preparation of primary legislation to create the new agency.The Government is also committed to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First, the national guidance on the reporting and management of child welfare and protection concerns.  The need for such legislation was also highlighted in the Implementation Plan prepared following the publication of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. The Government is attaching a high priority to the preparation of this legislation. I am pleased to report that good progress is being made in this regard.In July 2011, I published the new Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on the 15th July, 2011 which gives direction to the identification, investigation, assessment, reporting, treatment and management of child abuse.  I would hope that the implementation of both the revised Children First Guidance and the legislation which will underpin compliance will provide an opportunity to raise societal awareness of physical, sexual and emotional abuse and the need for everyone to play their part in protecting children.In addition to the above, my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence is finalising legislation which will put the vetting of employees on a statutory footing and also allow for the sharing of soft information as part of the vetting process. The Minister is also progressing legislation on Withholding Information on Crimes against Children and Vulnerable Adults.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	597	Arising from the publication of the Report of the Commission of Investigation into the Diocese of Cloyne in July 2011, the Government committed to a series of measures designed to significantly strengthen the existing legislative, policy and practice framework in the area of child protection. The intention is to ensure that child abuse in Ireland, be it clerical, institutional, within or outside the family, is strongly and decisively tackled, and that children are properly safeguarded.I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence on this agenda and we are making significant progress in this regard.In July I launched the revised Children First National Guidance for the protection and welfare of children, and last week I launched the HSE’s accompanying ‘Child Welfare and Protection Practice Handbook’ for use by all social workers and other relevant practitioners. The Handbook complements the Children First   Guidance and sets specific protocols for HSE social workers, gardaí and other front line staff in dealing with suspected abuse and neglect. The objective is to ensure that safe and effective child protection practices are operated across all organisations and sectors that work with children.I have received Government approval to put the Children First Guidance on a statutory basis and my Department is currently working with the Office of the Attorney General in developing the necessary legislative approach. Children First will also be supported by an assurance framework which will include strong emphasis on inspection and the need to provide demonstrable evidence of implementation. In the case of the health sector, the remit of the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) is being expanded to include oversight of the HSE’s Child Protection services, including the operation of Children First.  HIQA is currently developing standards to allow for inspection of the HSE’s child protection services.My colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence is bringing forward legislation which will put the vetting of employees on a statutory footing and also allow for the sharing of soft information as part of the vetting process. Minister Shatter is also introducing legislation on the withholding of information relating to crimes committed against children and vulnerable adults.The range of measures which I have described forms part, in my view, of a strong and necessary Government response to the Cloyne report, and one which must be complemented by the Church authorities having regard to the very serious failings identified by the Commission of Investigation. The HSE's National Director, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, is also at my request engaging directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns.  Mr. Jeyes will report formally to me on progress in this regard.It is important that the Church authorities' actions to safeguard children, like those of all organisations, are fully and transparently in conformity with the Children First Guidance and their own protocols. I understand in this regard that the National Board intends publishing its completed reviews of dioceses on an ongoing basis.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	598	In July 2011, I launched the revised Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  It emphasises the need to safeguard and to protect children.  Among these are that the safety and welfare of children is everyone's responsibility, that children will have safer lives where everyone is attentive to their well being.  People who work with children across a range of areas understand their responsibility for safe practice and the reporting of concerns.It is important to recognize that the original Children First Guidelines have now been in place for over a decade.  These Guidelines have over the period been used by the key agencies and their staff involved in the care and protection of children.It should be noted that the HSE as the statutory body responsible for promoting the welfare of children has in place a network of personnel to provide training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First.  The HSE is currently providing a programme of information and training on the new Guidance across the country.  This includes the publication of its Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook which I launched last week.  This Handbook will facilitate implementation of the Children First Guidance and achieve greater consistency in child protection practice throughout the HSE.  I am currently attending meetings with social work personnel in each of the four HSE regions to promote the Children First Guidance.  An Garda Síochána are also in attendance at these meetings reflecting the close working relationship they have with the HSE in protecting children.  The welcome from social workers at these meetings  for the Handbook has been extremely positive. and its clear that the revised Guidance enjoys widespread support.Beyond the HSE and An Garda Síochána the Children First Guidance has been disseminated widely, including for example to every school in the country.The consistent implementation of the Children First Guidance in every sector is a priority.  My Department is chairing an Inter Departmental Committee to oversee implementation of the Guidance across Government.  I will be meeting this Committee in early October.The Government has also committed, as a priority, to the introduction of legislation to underpin Children First. It is my intention that the legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk. The objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by strengthening the existing system for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	599	The Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS) is the official source of both employment and unemployment estimates for the State. The information the deputy referred to is presented in the table below. As with any sample survey, estimates from the QNHS are subject to sampling variability meaning that changes in the level of estimates of a relatively low order of magnitude may not be statistically significant. Another point to note is that, in the case of relatively large populations, such as the number of persons working in a sector of the economy, some level of movement is expected. To emphasise these points it can be noted that in recent years there has not been any quarter where decreases were recorded for all sectors despite the heavy loss in employment overall. Similarly during the period covering 2004 to 2007, a period when employment was growing rapidly, there was no quarter where increases were recorded for every sector. Therefore the CSO would caution against over-interpretation of short-term movements and rather suggest that a focus on the underlying trends be kept to the fore in any detailed analysis of the data. A clearer interpretation can be seen in the overall movement of the estimates of total employment. The quarterly fall of 3,200 in the seasonally adjusted employment series is the lowest reduction recorded since early 2008. To put that in context the highest quarterly reduction recorded in employment was a fall of 76,700 persons in the first quarter of 2009. We can similarly note that the rate of increase in unemployment has been slowing in recent quarters. With that noted, up to the second quarter of this year it remained the case that employment continued to fall and unemployment continued to rise. Future estimates from the QNHS, along with other estimates of economic activity, will be needed to allow us to draw conclusions about the ongoing state of the labour market.Economic sector(NACE Rev. 2)Apr-Jun 09Jul-Sep 09Oct-Dec 09Jan-Mar 10Apr-Jun 10Jul-Sep 10Oct-Dec 10Jan-Mar11Apr-Jun11

Generally, under the terms of the Civil Service Superannuation Schemes, retiring staff are entitled to a lump sum payment and a retirement pension which is based on their length of service and final pensionable remuneration.  Further details regarding retirement benefits for civil servants are available at www.cspensions.gov.ie.Retiring staff receive a retirement lump sum of  3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1½ times pensionable remuneration.  In general, staff who were recruited prior to April 1995 and pay the modified rate of PRSI receive a pension of 1/80th of pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.  Staff who were recruited after April 1995, receive a pension which is integrated with the State Pension (Contributory).  The formula for the calculation of the pension is 1/200th of pensionable remuneration up to 3 1/3rd times the State Pension, and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit, per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.

We deliver our aid programme in cooperation with Governments, local communities, NGOs, and key multilateral partners including the UN and EU.  Ireland will play a strong role, in cooperation with our partners, at the forthcoming international meeting on Aid Effectiveness, which I will attend in Busan, Korea in November.  In reviewing the aid programme most recently, in 2009, the OECD noted that Ireland is an international leader in making aid more effective.  I am determined that we will build on that reputation at Busan.Irish Aid is strongly focused on development results, identifying specific objectives and results against which all programmes are assessed and evaluated.  All development aid funding is disbursed in line with these specific objectives.  Proposals are rigorously appraised by Irish Aid staff as well as by an independent external Programme Appraisal and Evaluation Group using a number of criteria, including quality of intended impact, sustainability, cost effectiveness and efficiency in the use of resources.  Where funds are provided to Non-Governmental Organisations, it is a fundamental condition that annual audited accounts are provided to us.Programmes in receipt of funding from Irish Aid are subject to regular internal and external monitoring to ensure that the intended objectives and goals are being accomplished.  These arrangements ensure that Ireland's development funding reaches those most in need, and supports the improvement of national systems of accounting and auditing in the countries where we work.Irish Aid programmes are evaluated and audited by independent experts as well as by Irish Aid's Evaluation and Audit Unit. The Unit's work is also reviewed by the independent Audit Committee of my Department.  These evaluations and audits provide assurance that funds are used for the purposes intended and have a particular focus on poverty reduction outcomes and value for money.The OECD has found that "the structure of Irish Aid's programme ensures that the capacity and policy benefits of programme aid are achieved whilst improvements in the quality and accountability of public financial management together with rigorous oversight ensure that Irish funds are correctly used."While we are working in some of the most difficult environments in the world, I am satisfied that the assessment, monitoring, evaluation and audit systems which Irish Aid has put in place provide the best assurance that development aid funding is being used for the intended objectives.

We also provide funding to both Palestinian and Israeli civil society organisations focusing on human rights issues.    Ireland is also a strong supporter of the UN agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA), which provides vital social services, including health and education, to five million Palestinian refugees.  Work is now under way within Irish Aid, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, to finalise a new strategy for our programme of support to the Palestinian people.  This strategy will reinforce the priority Ireland attaches to meeting the needs of the most vulnerable Palestinians and will involve a particular focus on education, an area which will be vital in assisting individual Palestinians and Palestinian society as a whole to achieve their potential.While the Government does not at present provide direct funding through Irish Aid to the agricultural sector in Palestine, Irish funding to both the Palestinian Authority and UNRWA indirectly supports the implementation of Palestinian policies on rural development and food security, as set out in the Palestinian Authority's National Development Plan 2011-2013.

The programme is clearly focused on the fight against extreme poverty and hunger, and concentrated in some of the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa.  The Programme for Government underlines our commitment to the UN target of spending 0.7% of Gross National Product (GNP) on Official Development Assistance (ODA).  Despite the difficult economic environment, and the pressure on aid budgets across the developed world, we remain committed to the 0.7% GNP target.It has been suggested that legislating for ODA allocations and the 0.7% commitment would ensure that Ireland meets its international ODA commitments and protect annual ODA allocations.  I expect that the issue will arise in the context of the consultations with the public and interested organisations under the review of the White Paper on Irish Aid, which is now under way.Over the coming years, it is clear that decisions on the annual allocations for the aid programme will have to be taken within the overall budgetary framework and the fiscal constraints on the Government.  As Minister with responsibility for trade and development, I will make the strongest possible case for funding for development cooperation.  I will also ensure that Ireland's aid programme continues to focus rigorously on the achievement of results and provides strong international leadership in making aid more effective, for the ultimate benefit of the world's poorest people.

A letter communicating Ireland's ratification of the SAA was sent to the Council of the European Union on 23 September 2011.  The EU-Serbia SAA will come into effect once all EU Member States have ratified the agreement.  Currently, eight Member States are still in the process of completing their national ratification procedures.  Articles 14-17 of the Agreement, which deal with regional cooperation, are a crucial part of the SAA . They require Serbia to actively promote regional cooperation and to commit itself to the development of good neighbourly relations, including through free trade.  Similar obligations apply equally to other Western Balkans countries which have concluded Stabilisation and Association Agreements with the EU.Serbia and Kosovo have been engaged in an EU-facilitated dialogue since March 2011 following on from a joint EU-Serbia resolution at the UN General Assembly last year.  The talks led to agreements on a number of practical matters including civil registry, freedom of movement and acceptance of university and school diplomas.  Tensions escalated in northern Kosovo in late July in connection with customs controls at Kosovo's border with Serbia.  Ireland and its EU partners appealed to both sides to show restraint.  At a further round of Belgrade-Pristina talks on 2 September, agreements were reached on customs stamps and cadastral records.  We welcome the fact that the talks were reconvened and that it was possible to reach agreement on a Kosovo customs stamp.Ireland is a member of the board of Regional Cooperation Council (RCC), based in Sarajevo, which brings together all the countries of the Western Balkans and their neighbours and aims to promote cooperation in the region.  Since the RCC was founded in 2008, Ireland has contributed almost €200,000 to it in furtherance of our national objective of enhancing cooperation in the Western Balkans.   There have been improvements in regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations involving Serbia in recent years. Notable examples of this include: the establishment of the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue; the March 2010 resolution of the Serbian Parliament condemning the Srebrenica massacre; the joint attendance of the Presidents of Serbia and Croatia at a ceremony in Bosnia-Herzegovina in July 2010 to mark the 15th anniversary of the massacre; and the visit of the Serbian President to Vukovar in Croatia in November 2010 to commemorate victims of a siege by Serb forces.  In July 2011, President Tadic   paid the first official visit by a Serbian President to Bosnia-Herzegovina.I welcomed the arrests this summer of Ratko Mladic and Goran Hadzic by the Serbian authorities, and their swift transfer to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in The Hague for trial.  The arrests represented an important step in addressing the appalling atrocities committed during the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 1990s.  Their trials in The Hague will help to further the cause of true reconciliation in the Western Balkans region.On 12 October, the European Commission will publish its annual report on the EU Enlargement process, which will assess the progress of all the countries of the Western Balkans on key benchmarks, including their shared obligation to develop regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations.  I look forward to receiving the report of the Commission on progress made by Serbia and all the countries of the Western Balkans in their preparations for accession to the European Union.

The only real solution is the full opening of the land crossing points between Israel and Gaza.  Ireland, along with our EU Partners, continues to press for a full opening up of the border crossings into Gaza to allow unimpeded flows of humanitarian aid, and normal commercial and human traffic, as clearly called for by UN Security Council Resolution 1860 of January 2009.  It is also clear that the genuine humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza cannot be met through flotillas or land convoys attempting to bring aid through Egypt.  Aid carried to Gaza port or transported through the Rafah crossing can only meet a tiny and symbolic fraction of the territory's needs.  The full opening of land crossings is required to enable any semblance of normal life to resume in the territory. I recognise that Israel is entitled to prevent the transport of weapons and genuinely military materials into Gaza, and therefore to check cargoes in this context, but other goods and materials should not be impeded.I recognise the humanitarian motivations of those attempting to transport humanitarian aid to Gaza.  However, as I have previously stated, I cannot encourage participation in any project which would involve Irish citizens engaging in actions which could lead them into real danger.  My Department's travel advice is quite clear in recommending against travel to Gaza, including by sea.  We also continue to press the Israeli Government to do all possible to facilitate those wishing to transport humanitarian goods to Gaza while my Department will also continue to provide all possible consular services, where necessary.I would observe that a more effective means of providing humanitarian aid to Gaza would be to do so by donating to UN agencies such as UNRWA, which have established means of transporting aid to Gaza.

Records of tax reference numbers must be kept by the contractor and be available for inspection where requested by the Revenue Commissioners.Where payments exceed €2,600 in any 12 month period the sub-contractor will be required to produce either a current tax clearance certificate or a current C2 certificate.  It should be made clear to sub-contractors that payments under a contract are at all times conditional on compliance with these requirements.  It will be the responsibility of the relevant contractor to ensure that any sub-contractor employed by him complies with these requirements.  In all cases contracting authorities must ensure that contractors have complied with these requirements.It should be emphasised in the case of sub-contractors in the construction, forestry and meat processing industries that, in the absence of a C2 certificate, tax must continue to be deducted at source at the rate of 35 per cent in accordance with Section 531 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997 as amended not withstanding the fact that a tax clearance certificate has been furnished under these arrangements.

I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that it is estimated that €1,446 million was collected from the Income Levy in the calendar year 2010.  However, as is normal, it would have been expected that the total Income Levy liability for the income tax year 2010 would be higher at €1,710 million and the difference would have been collected in 2011/12.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the estimated full year yield to the Exchequer, estimated by reference to 2010 incomes, of confining the Income Levy to all income earners earning in excess of €30,000 per annum, and double that amount for married couples, would have been of the order of €1,405 million.These figures are estimates from the Revenue tax-forecasting model using actual data for the year 2009 adjusted as necessary for income and employment trends for the year 2010.  They are therefore provisional and may to be revised.

The additional full year yield from existing taxpayers from reducing the existing thresholds by 25% and applying the proposed rate of 35% to the additional amounts thus brought into charge is estimated to be of the order of €50 million.  Revenue do not receive information on gifts and inheritances which currently do not have to be declared so it is not possible to estimate the potential yield if such benefits were brought into the tax net.  These estimates are based on transactions recorded in 2010, the latest year for which the necessary detailed information is available.  It should be noted that these estimates are based upon an assumption that there would be no behavioural impact from these changes, which could lead to a less than expected impact on Exchequer yield.  In addition, the realisation of any estimated yield from an increase in taxation on assets related to property is subject to movements in the value of such assets currently occurring in the economy.

Also for the purposes of the Code "regulated entity" means a person who carries on a business of providing one or more "regulated activities".The Code does not apply to regulated entities when:providing services to persons outside the State,providing Markets in Financial Instruments Directive Services,providing the services of a "moneylender", within the meaning of the Consumer Credit Act 1995,carrying on the business of reinsurance or reinsurance mediation,carrying on the business of a "bureau de change" or "money transmission", within the meaning of Part V of the Central Bank Act 1997,if such firm is a credit union, when providing services for which it does not require to be authorised by or registered with the Central Bank,carrying on the business of entering into hire purchase agreements, orcarrying on the business of entering into consumer hire agreements.The Central Bank has advised me that its registers contain individual registers for all financial service providers and collective investment schemes regulated by it.  A consumer wishing to do business with a financial institution may check, by using a link on the Central Bank's website and inserting the company name in question, whether or not that institution is regulated by the Central Bank.

A comprehensive programme of bank recapitalisation and restructuring is currently under way following my statement on the future banking landscape in Ireland at the end of March last.  The essential detailed assessment and planning work to meet this objective will be accelerated once the Government's key objectives for the renewal of the banking system, which are ahead of schedule, have been completed.  This assessment will include the strategic investment bank's relationship with the two pillar banks and the time line for its establishment.As regards the support of small and medium enterprises in general, the restructuring of the domestic banking sector creates capacity for the pillar banks to lend in excess of €30 billion over the next three years in SME and other important sectors.  This is in excess of Central Bank estimates of the likely demand for SME and mortgage credit over this period.  Both pillar banks are concentrating on the Irish economy and need to issue credit to make profits and rebuild their balance sheets.As the Deputy may be aware, the Government has imposed lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks for the three calendar years, 2011 to 2013.  Both banks will be required to sanction lending of at least €3 billion this year, €3.5 billion next year and €4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.

She also spoke about the Confidential Freephone 1800 295 295 for reporting tobacco smuggling or sale of illicit tobacco products.  The challenge with these approaches is how to get useful information while minimising the opportunity cost to Revenue and the impact on compliant taxpayers.With a view to improving the value, Revenue is currently discussing with some business/trade bodies the provision of a template form which their members can complete and submit through the body, thereby protecting their identities if they wish.Reports of suspected evasion/fraud should provide as much detail as possible particularly in terms of location, names, addresses, telephone numbers and vehicle registrations.

Work is proceeding at the EU level on this with an initial focus on the extractive sector.In parallel, the OECD, through the work of the Development Assistance Committee, is seeking to enhance transparency and accountability of MNEs including an examination of the feasibility of introducing full disclosure through country-by-country reporting.While we are supportive of the efforts of the EU Commission and the OECD in this area , we are also pragmatic in recognising the inherent difficulties in advancing the issue, because of the many  stakeholders involved including the International Accounting Standards Board and MNEs themselves which have very real competitive concerns.I want to assure the Deputy that we will continue to work with our Partners on this issue but equally we would not wish that this issue would deflect attention from other very important transparency issues such as Exchange of Information and facilitating developing countries in their negotiations with MNEs.

As part of its review of all tax expenditures, the Commission on Taxation examined the relief for patent income to determine if its continued operation was justified on cost benefit grounds. The Commission found that the relief had not had the desired impact on innovation and R&D activity and that, despite various refinements to the scheme over the years, it was not a particularly well-targeted measure providing good value for money.The R&D credit scheme provides a more direct and effective incentive for enterprises to innovate and invest in R&D activities and the scheme has been enhanced considerably in recent years to make it one of the most competitive of its kind anywhere.I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that information in relation to claims for patent income exemption is derived from corporation tax returns and income tax returns. Based on the information that has been provided in the tax returns for the tax year 2009, the latest year for which the necessary detailed data are available, the total cost to the Exchequer of the patent income exemption was €72 million, of which approximately €16 million was associated with claims from companies.I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that statistics on the amount of patent income exemption claimed by multinational corporations is not separately available. However, it is likely that many of the larger claims of patent income exemptions by companies are claimed by large multinational companies.Data for the year 2010 is not yet available as the bulk of tax returns for that year are not yet due.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that based on claims for capital allowances on the income tax returns and corporation tax returns for 2009, the latest year available, the notional cash flow saving to the Exchequer of limiting capital allowances available to business at €2 million in a tax year could be in the region of €1 billion if applied to all existing and new claims.    The estimated cash-flow yield does not take account of any potential additional yield from applying the proposed cap to claimed but unused capital allowances which have either been brought forward from prior years or will be carried forward into future years as losses and are no longer separately identifiable as capital allowances.Neither do the estimated savings take into account the potential substantial loss to the Exchequer of taxes such as Corporation Tax, Value Added Tax and PAYE as a result of the probable disincentive effect the proposal would have on businesses investing in large capital projects. For example, as capital expenditure on plant and machinery is generally written off for tax purposes on a straight-line basis over eight years, the proposed cap would impact on any project in excess of €16 million.Furthermore, no account can be taken of any possible changes made to corporate structures which could result in an effort by businesses to maximize their use of capital allowances restricted as proposed.It would be more difficult to quantify the saving to the Exchequer if the proposal were confined to new expenditure only as there is insufficient data on the timing and quantum of such expenditure to allow for a meaningful estimate to be made.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Ireland has a good cordial and professional relationship with both the ECB and the European Commission. The relationships are built on mutual trust, openness and a cooperative and collegiate approach to issues that arise.In relation to the Bank Guarantee I understand that in September 2008, the then Minister for Finance, after consulting with the Governor and the Regulatory Authority, had formed the opinion that there was a serious threat to the stability of credit institutions generally, and that the provision of financial support was necessary, in the public interest, for maintaining the stability of the financial system in the State and to remedy a serious disturbance in the economy of the State.   In his report on events at that time Professor Honohan states "It is hard to argue with the view that an extensive guarantee needed to be put in place, since all participants (rightly) felt that they faced the likely collapse of the Irish banking system within days in the absence of decisive immediate action. Given the hysterical state of global financial markets in those weeks, failure to avoid this outcome would have resulted in immediate and lasting damage to the economy and society. There would have been additional lost income and employment surely amounting, if it could be quantified, to tens of billions of euros."The Governor's report contains a detailed account of event leading up to the provision of the Guarantee including in relation to the advice that would have been received by the Minister from the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.  Paragraph 8.19 of the report in which the Governor states that the clear consensus of those bodies was that the problem being experienced by the domestic credit institutions was essentially one of liquidity rather than solvency as a consequence of a world-wide "financial tsunami".  In addition in his discussions with the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service on 15 June 2010 the Governor stated that the Minister would not have been aware of solvency concerns relating to the banking system because the Financial Regulator did not have solvency concerns.As the Deputy is aware the Central Bank is independent in the performance of its functions and in its dealings with the ECB. I can not comment on what was communicated between the Central Bank and the ECB.

It is NAMA's practice to use secondees only on short-term specialist assignments where this is the most cost-effective option available.  One of the three is on secondment from the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency examining NAMA's database regarding stock suitability for social housing.The other two have been provided to NAMA by Knight Frank property consultants and Olswang, a leading UK law firm. The Knight Frank secondee is assisting with processing the final property valuation reports and the Olswang secondee is a specialist UK banking solicitor.The cost of procuring the services of the secondees is a confidential commercial matter between NAMA and the firms concerned but I understand that they are being provided to NAMA on a cost recovery basis.Knight Frank is one of 24 firms on the Real Estate Valuation Panel, all of which have received work from NAMA. It has also been appointed as receiver for 9 properties owned by Derek Quinlan. Olswang is one of 31 firms on the 42-firm Enforcement and Re-financing Panel to have received work from NAMA.NAMA advises me that those firms which do not supply secondees are not disadvantaged, given the small number of secondees required by the agency.

Placing such a charge on mobile telephone masts could deter service providers from erecting new masts in areas where coverage is bad.  Consideration would also have to be given to the possible impact within the communications sector and on our communications infrastructure of such a proposal.I have been informed by ComReg that there are approximately 4,500 mobile telephone ‘sites', consisting of a mix of masts and building mounted sites.  The potential yield from such a tax would obviously be dependent on the rate applied per mast or site.  Mobile telephone companies are already subject to VAT at 21% on calls and text messages.  Any further charges would probably be ultimately passed on to the user.I have no plans to introduce such a tax.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I assume that the Deputy is referring to the employer PRSI charge on share based remuneration introduced by the previous Government, which I abolished as part of the recent Jobs Initiative. Following the announcement that I made on the 18 March 2011, which clarified that PRSI would only apply to share based remuneration that was subject to a written agreement entered into after 1 January 2011, it was estimated that the employer PRSI element would have yielded approximately €1.8 million in 2011.   In my view, the introduction of the employer PRSI charge, by increasing costs for employers, had the potential to seriously damage the economy, particularly in terms of making Ireland less attractive for foreign direct investment, as many FDI firms use share based remuneration schemes. While it is not possible to estimate the number of jobs that will be protected, or created, as a result of the abolition of the charge, the danger of job losses or a reduction in our attractiveness for investment, far outweighed the yield that could be achieved from it.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	635	As announced under the Jobs Initiative, a second reduced VAT rate of 9% was introduced on a temporary basis in respect of certain services and goods mainly related to tourism for the period 1 July 2011 to end 2013.  Specifically the 9% rate applies to restaurant and catering services; hotel and holiday accommodation; various entertainment services such as admissions to cinemas, theatres, certain musical performances, museums, art gallery exhibitions and fairgrounds/amusement parks, the use of sporting facilities; hairdressing services; and printed matter such as brochures, maps, programmes, leaflets, catalogues, newspapers and magazines.   The introduction of the 9% VAT rate is aimed at contributing towards boosting tourism and the creation of additional jobs in that sector.  The measure has received a very positive response from the tourism sector and a recent press release from the Restaurants Association of Ireland, for example, reports the passing on of the new rate by the majority of members surveyed. Of course compliance by business in reducing prices is key to the success of the initiative and this will be kept under review and will be evaluated before end 2012 in order to determine its effectiveness in aiding the industry.  If it is shown that the VAT reduction has little or no effect in aiding the industry then the measure is open to being reformed or abolished. In addition, checks on the correct operation of VAT, including the rates of VAT applied are integral parts of Revenue's audit and compliance programmes.The measure is estimated to cost €120 million this year and €350 million in 2012 and 2013.

The total interest cost for the State for all tranches of the Anglo and Irish Nationwide promissory notes is circa €17 billion with annual repayments of €3.1 billion per annum.  These annual repayments reduce over time as the various tranches of the promissory note are repaid.  The final payment on the promissory note of circa €0.1billion will be made on 31 March 2031.

Rather they are available, along with the funds sourced from revenues such as tax revenue, non-tax revenue and capital receipts, to fund overall expenditure.  Accordingly, there was no one tranche of borrowing that was undertaken solely for the purpose of funding the Promissory Note payments to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society.  The draw downs of funds so far under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support have been used for a range of different purposes including of course the general running of the day-to-day operations of the State.  It is difficult therefore to isolate precisely the exact cost of the interest payments on the borrowing undertaken to fund the Promissory Note payments.  However, for illustrative purposes, on the basis of the original 5.8% blended average interest rate which applied to borrowing under the Programme, the interest costs on borrowing of €3,060 million would be just under €180 million per annum.  In light of the recently agreed reduction in interest rates on funding available under the Joint EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support however, the estimated interest cost on such borrowing reduces to approximately €115 million per annum.

The figures for General Government debt for the years 2007-2010 as well as the latest published estimate for 2011 from the April Stability Programme Update (SPU) are set out in the table below. General Government debt is the standard measure used within the EU for comparative purposes.  General Government debt is a gross measure and it does not allow for the netting off of cash balances or the value of the assets in the National Pension Reserve Fund. My department is currently reviewing its macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts in the light of later data.  These forecasts, which will include revisions of debt projections, will be published in next month's Pre-Budget Outlook.  As such the information in the table for 2011 may be revised.200720082009201020111General Government Debt47.479.8104.8148.1173.0as % of GDP25%44%65%92%109%as % of GNP29%52%79%115%137%2Budgetary requirement not related to banking1.612.720.618.015.1as % of GDP1%7%13%11%10%as % of GNP1%8%16%14%12%3arecapitalisation and other direct banking measures4.00.77.63bIssue of the promissory note30.90.6as % of GDP2%20%5%as % of GNP3%25%6%Notes on the table1.  GDP and GNP for 2007-2010 are CSO estimates published in the National Income and Expenditure 2010. The GDP and GNP for 2011 are Department of Finance forecasts from the time of the SPU publication in April.2.  At the time of the SPU, it was assumed that Exchequer funding of some EUR10 billion would be required as part of the recapitalisation of the banking sector.  The actual figure will be below this estimate, and while not finalised, is likely to be approximately EUR6.5 billion.The banking measures in the above table comprise all injections into banks which affect the General Government debt. It should be noted however that capital injections that are made from the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) do not affect the debt and are not included in this note.  (In 2009 there was a frontloading of the 1% of GNP Exchequer contribution to the NPRF for 2009 and 2010.  This was made to part-fund the recapitalisations of Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland in 2010.)It should also be borne in mind that the fees paid over to the Exchequer from the Bank Guarantee Schemes, which totalled EUR1,333 million and 2010 and EUR599 million so far in 2011 reduces somewhat the debt level in those years.The full EUR30.85 billion in promissory notes were added to the General Government debt in 2010.  The service of the promissory note through the annual cash payment from the Exchequer in the years after 2010 does not affect the General Government debt directly.  Interest due on the promissory notes, however, increases the debt and is shown in the table.

The research was conducted in 2010 and the report was published on the Revenue and Department of Finance websites in early 2011.Neither I nor the Revenue Commissioners are aware of any suggestion that the research is significantly at variance with international peer reviewed published literature on this topic, or that any questions have been raised about the methodology.  If the Deputy has information to support these views, the Revenue Commissioners would welcome it.I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the report fully documents the methodology, the econometric model and the data sources used and it is therefore open to any researcher seeking to replicate or validate the results.  The research follows an internationally established methodology to examine the factors determining cigarette consumption.In general, the findings are consistent with existing Irish and international literature in measuring the main influencing factors on smoker behaviour.  A key difference identified is that the sensitivity of consumption of cigarettes to price changes in Ireland is found to be higher than average.  However, this finding is consistent when the relatively high price of cigarettes and the level of consumption of untaxed cigarettes in Ireland are considered.  This issue is examined in detail in the paper.

The scheme for Qualifying Specialist Palliative Care Units was not commenced and thus no cost was incurred.All other such schemes have been abolished, subject to transitional arrangements for certain schemes where projects were already in the pipeline.  However, due to their nature these reliefs continue to impose ongoing costs on the Exchequer in terms of tax foregone.

This report will make initial recommendations on strengthening the regulatory framework for credit unions.  The Commission will submit its final report to me by 31 March 2012.On the issue of lending restrictions, as Minister for Finance, my role is to ensure that the legal framework for credit unions is appropriate for the effective operation and supervision of credit unions.  The Registrar of Credit Unions is responsible for administering the system of regulation and supervision of credit unions provided under the Credit Union Act 1997, with a view to the protection by each credit union of the funds of its members and the maintenance of the financial stability of credit unions generally.  The role of the Registrar of Credit Unions in the regulation of credit unions is an independent one.From time to time, the Registrar is required to act to support the prudential soundness of individual credit unions, to maintain sector stability and to protect the savings of credit union members.  Such actions, including lending restrictions, are reviewed by the Registrar over time on a case by case basis.  The number of restrictions imposed by the Registrar has increased over the last two years in light of the difficulties faced by parts of the credit union sector.  The type of lending restrictions imposed takes account of the particular business profile and financial position of the credit unions concerned.

These are set out in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU).  As they are primary balance targets, they exclude Exchequer debt interest payments. They also allow for the exclusion of expenditure related to the banking sector recapitalisations and adjust for over/under-performance in Exchequer tax revenues and PRSI receipts, compared to the targets set out in the TMU.  We have adhered to the first three of those targets which were set for end-December 2010, and end-March and end-June 2011.  The next target set is for end-September 2011.  The July 2011 TMU also set targets for end-December 2011 and initial targets for end-March and end-June 2012.  The next revised TMU (October) will then set an initial target for end-September 2012 and so on.It is also important to note that under the revised Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP) Recommendation issued by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010, Ireland's General Government Deficit must not exceed 8.6% of GDP in 2012.

An emergency is deemed to be a situation which poses an immediate risk to health, life, property or the environment which is sudden, unforeseen and requires immediate action and in the case of a school if not corrected would prevent the school or part thereof from opening.As the scope of works for this project is outside the terms of the Emergency Works Scheme it cannot be considered for emergency funding.  The school has been informed of the decision.

Applications are processed in date order of receipt and every effort is being made to process these applications as quickly as possible.  Applications received in mid-November 2010 are currently being processed.The priority of my Department's Payroll Division over the past 2 months has been to ensure that replacement teachers and special need assistants being appointed for the 2011/2012 school year are placed on payroll for payment.  This process is now nearing completion.  Over the coming weeks, extra resources will be assigned to try and ensure that special needs assistants that are made redundant will have their claims for payment processed as quickly as possible.

Given the sensitivities associated with land acquisitions I am not in a position to comment further at this time. The acquisition of the site and the delivery of the school building project will be considered in the context of the capital budget available to my Department for school buildings generally.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	653	The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs) for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special educational needs.  The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.  This now includes a requirement for the NCSE to have regard to an overall cap on the number of SNA posts.Having considered all of the applications for SNA support received before the initial deadline for applications of 19th May 2011, from mainstream primary and post primary schools, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) has now advised all mainstream schools of their SNA allocations for the 2011/12 school year, taking into account the number of valid applications for SNA support and the assessed care needs of the children concerned.As not all applications for SNA support can be made in advance of the school year, in order to prudently manage this valuable but limited resource, the NCSE and my Department decided that 475 of the 10,575 posts should be retained in order to allocate them over the coming school year in cases such as emergency, appeals, acquired injuries or new school entrants with special needs care.In relation to special schools, the existing levels of SNA support in special schools have been maintained in the first instance, in order to assist and protect the most vulnerable children, with a review currently taking place.   The 475 retained SNA posts will be used to respond to emergency case; additional needs identified arising from the outcome of the review of Special Schools and further emerging demand from schools before the end of the school year.The NCSE expects to respond to emergency cases on hand within the coming weeks.  The outcome of the special school review is expected early in the school year.  Other demands from mainstream schools will be responded to up to the end of the school year.  Through these arrangements it is expected that the majority of the posts will have been allocated by early in 2012.It is expected that schools, before requesting any review of their SNA provision, will be in a position to demonstrate that they have made every effort to manage their allocation of SNA posts to best effect.

In addition, funds were allocated to the schools in question under the Summer Works Scheme and the Emergency Works scheme.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will continue to be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.However, in light of competing demands on the capital budget of my Department it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe, at this time, for the progression of this project to tender and construction.

Of the 40 new schools, 18 will now be in the Dublin area as the new post primary school for North Dublin/South will be located in Balbriggan.It is intended to provide 12 new primary schools and six new post-primary schools across Dublin.  Details of all the new schools to be established are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.  The table shows the locations of the Dublin schools for the Deputy’s convenience.A number of these new schools have opened in temporary accommodation but the majority of the schools will not need to open until at least 2014 with some of the schools not being required until 2016.

A small number of new technological universities, with their own legislative framework and a distinct mission that is faithful to the ethos of the technological sector, working with existing universities, institutes of technology and other education providers, can enrich the diversity and quality of the Irish higher education landscape.I have asked the Higher Education Authority for its formal advice on performance criteria to be used in an independent assessment process for any future applications for designation as technological universities.  A consultation process on draft criteria is being undertaken by the Higher Education Authority and will be completed early next month.  It is understood that the Higher Education Authority hopes to sign off its formal advice to my Department at its November meeting of the Authority.  I will expedite consideration of the advice with a view to publishing the criteria before the end of December.Once a process is in place it will be open to institutes of technology to come together to make applications for consideration for re-designation, including those in the south east.  All applications will be considered under an independent assessment process.

Although there has been a significant increase in requests for estimates of pension entitlements from staff in the last number of months there is no way of knowing at this time how many of these requests will translate into actual retirements. Staff wishing to retire prior to 29th February 2012 have been asked to give the Department a minimum of three months notice of their intention to retire.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	661	In July the Government announced the establishment of SOLAS as a key element in the integration of the Further Education and Training sector. The SOLAS Implementation Group, which I am chairing, was set up to implement the changes.The Group is preparing an Action Plan, including the area of organisational mission, which will be the subject of consultation with stakeholders before finalisation. Given the complex elements involved, including appropriate legislation, it is expected that the process of establishing SOLAS will largely be completed by the end of 2012.In the meantime, FÁS continues to have responsibility for the apprenticeship system. In order to ensure that apprentices are given as many opportunities as possible to support the timely completion of their apprenticeship, FÁS has taken a number of initiatives to enable registered redundant apprentices, including final year apprentices, to progress and finish their apprenticeships:Redundant apprentices are now permitted to progress to their next Off-the-Job Phase of their apprenticeships even though they have not yet completed their previous on-the-job Phase.FÁS is providing a temporary Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme whereby FÁS approved employers in the public and private sectors will provide redundant apprentices with training and assessment on-the-job including at Phase 7 of their apprenticeships. The maximum period of placement is 12 weeks at Phase 7.FÁS will be introducing shortly a Competency Determination Scheme for the trades of Brick & Stonelaying, Carpentry & Joinery, Electrical, Plastering and Plumbing. This scheme is for redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1 to 7 of their apprenticeships, but who do not meet the requirement of having completed the statutory 4 years (208 weeks) in employment.Redundant apprentices who pass the competency assessment will receive an exemption from this requirement thereby enabling them to complete their apprenticeships and qualify for the award of the FETAC Advanced Certificate — Craft. Competency assessments are currently being scheduled.Redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phase 1 to Phase 7 (or Phase 7 Equivalent assessments) of their apprenticeships excluding the trades of Brick & Stonelaying, Carpentry & Joinery, Electrical, Plastering and Plumbing, but who have not completed the statutory 4 years in employment as apprentices may be granted an exemption from this requirement by validating their competence under the Recognition of Prior Learning Scheme. FÁS will invite eligible redundant apprentices to submit a portfolio of evidence of trade related work experience gained at home and/or abroad and/or trade related further training and/or education undertaken during periods of redundancy. The granting of exemptions is based solely on the portfolios of evidence submitted to the Redundant Apprentice Accreditation Committee.Redundant apprentices who are granted an exemption will be considered to have completed their Apprenticeships and thereby qualify for the award of the FETAC Advanced Certificate — Craft.Léargas has provided support to FÁS for apprentices to complete on-the-job training with assessment with employers in Germany and Finland. In the period 2009/2010, over 100 apprentices have undertaken this programme and FÁS has received approval for a further 43 redundant apprentice placement in 2011/2012.My Department along with FÁS will continue to explore ways to support and assist all apprentices progress and finish their apprenticeships.

Wicklow VEC, however, it has not been possible to date to progress this proposed acquisition due to the complexities associated with the site identified.The progression of all large scale building projects, including a project for this school, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme with due regard to the demand for increased education provision at both primary and post primary level in the coming years.The delivery of these new schools, together with extension projects to meet the demographic demand, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years. The current status of all projects on the school building programme may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I recently met with educational book publishers, representatives of parents' organisations and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul regarding the cost of school textbooks. Subsequently, the publishers devised a voluntary Code of Practice and, while I welcome the Code as a significant step in the right direction, I believe that more should be done to reduce the price of textbooks.Accordingly. I have proposed to the representatives of the textbook publishers: that the cover price of the most popular textbooks should be reduced; that a significant discount should be given to schools which purchase textbooks in bulk, in line with the discounts given to retailers of textbooks; that the practice of combining a conventional textbook and workbook in a single volume should be ended to allow students to re-use a textbook; and that support materials should be provided to teachers online, to minimise ancillary printing costs. While respecting the position that educational book publishers are independent private companies not under the direct control of my Department, I intend to meet with their representatives again to progress these issues.I am also keen to examine if there are ways to encourage schools, via the book grant scheme, to establish or maintain book rental schemes as I believe this to be one of the most effective ways of lowering the burden of the cost of school books. I have invited the National Parents Councils at primary and post-primary levels to provide me with examples of good practice of book rental schemes. Drawing on these and other examples, I intend to publish advice to schools on how best to establish and maintain textbook rental schemes in schools well in advance of the beginning of the next school year.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	664	I propose to take Questions Nos. 149 and 150 together.Bus Éireann, which operates the School Transport Schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that the information you request regarding the average cost of school bus transport per pupil is not readily available on a per county basis. However, research carried out in the context of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Schemes shows that the annual unit cost per pupil for the provision of school transport was some €1,000, €950 and €7,000 for primary, post primary and children with special educational needs (excluding escorts) respectively.The school transport charges in respect of the 2011/12 school year are as follows: Eligible and Concessionary Post-Primary Pupils, €350 subject to a family maximum of €650;  Eligible post-primary pupils holding a valid medical card and pupils with special educational needs are exempt from paying the charge.   With regard to exam costs, entry fees for the 2012 state examinations have not yet been determined. However, the fees for the 2011 examinations for second level students were: Leaving Certificate (Established, LCVP and LCA) €109; Junior Certificate €103; and Repeat Leaving Certificate €284. An alleviation scheme is in place whereby medical card holders and their dependents are exempt from the payment of examination fees. This exemption applies to approximately 30% of examination candidates each year. Mock examinations are not part of the State examinations system and any decision to organise and/or charge for mock examinations is made at school level. Accordingly, my Department does not have a role in the matter nor information on the cost per pupil.My Department also does not have data regarding the cost per pupil to families in Co Donegal for the other items referred to by the Deputy.In general, however, voluntary contributions by parents or charges for optional extras over and above what is provided for in the general school programme are permissible, provided it is made clear to parents that there is no question of compulsion to pay, and, that in making a contribution, they are doing so of their own volition.  The manner in which such voluntary contributions are sought and collected is a matter for school management. However, their collection should not create a situation where parents or pupils could reasonably infer that the contributions take on a compulsory character. In addition, it should be noted that no pupil can be excluded from any activities that take place during school time, due to the fact that parents, for whatever reason, choose not to contribute to costs associated with that activity. When submitting returns of pupil enrolments, all schools in the Free Education Scheme are obliged to certify that these principles are being adhered to.Regarding fundraising, it is a matter for school authorities to decide whether to engage in or support organised fundraising activities provided the methods employed do not affect parents or students in a way which would conflict with the principles in respect of voluntary contributions which I have already identified. It is important for schools to be sensitive to the financial pressures on families, and to use the State funds provided to optimum effect. In this regard, the Deputy should note that my Department is not in a position to make additional funds available to schools in the current economic climate.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	665	There are a number of measures currently being undertaken to prepare second level students for future employment and careers.At Junior Cycle, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) was asked to review the junior certificate and advise on the scope for reform which would provide for a more active learning experience for students, the promotion of real understanding, creativity and innovation.  I expect to receive the NCCA's advice on the revised Junior Cycle shortly. At Senior Cycle, five key skills, information processing, communications, critical and creative thinking, personal effectiveness, and working with others, are being embedded in all senior cycle subjects as syllabuses are revised, and a second assessment component is also being embedded.   These changes should help to prepare students for the world of work.In addition, all post-primary schools also provide a guidance and counselling service for their students. The service includes the provision of individual guidance and counselling for students at critical stages in their education.  Guidance staff in schools are teachers with a post graduate qualification in guidance.   As well as their guidance qualification, guidance staff are members of the Institute of Guidance Counsellors which is funded by the Department to provide professional development supports.  Guidance staff also have the support of the National Centre for Guidance in Education (NCGE) which was established to act as a national centre of excellence for guidance. The NCGE provides on-line training on planning the guidance programme in schools, as well as resources and advice and a guidance handbook.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	666	Due to changes in the structure of the Vote for my Department over the period 2007-2011, total Education Expenditure for each of the years in question is not readily comparable. These changes include:The transfer out of the Education and Science Vote from 1 January 2009 of funding responsibility for various functions in relation to Youth Organisations and Youth Activities to the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs;The transfer into the Education and Skills Vote from 1 May 2010 of responsibility for FÁS skills and training programmes (formerly funded through the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment).The transfer into the Vote from 1 January 2011 of funding in respect of the provision of nursing education (formerly funded through the Department of Health).The transfer out of the Vote from 1 January 2011 of funding in respect of functions of the National Education Welfare Board to the Vote of the Minister for Health and Children.Adjusted expenditure figures to reflect the above changes are included in the attached document which shows that, on a comparable basis, overall education expenditure increased during the period 2007-2009, while expenditure was reduced during 2010 and 2011 (2011 figure is estimate).  The following summary of budget measures introduced over the period 2009 to 2011 indicates the areas where expenditure adjustments were made and which gave rise to the reduced expenditure in 2010 and 2011.2007 Outturn2008 Outturn2009 Outturn2010 Outturn2011 Estimate€million€million€million€million€millionCurrent€7,796.8€8,380.4€8,554.3€8,083.2€8,172.8Capital€813.3€829.6€767.2€696.9€495.5Total Expenditure€8,610.1€9,210.0€9,321.5€8,780.1€8,668.3Note — the above comparable figures differ from published figures of education expenditure due to changes in the structure of the Vote as outlined in the reply to the question from the Deputy.
Extract from summary of expenditure-related measures announced in 2009 Budget
Main Features (note — some of these measures were moderated in subsequent budgets)CapitalCapital allocation of €889m is an increase of €80m on the allocation for 2008.Teachers salary and pension costsThe net pay bill for teachers' salaries and pensions will increase by almost €300m as a result of a combination of pay increases and the full-year costs of the salaries of teachers appointed this September.The budget allocation takes account of increased enrolments in primary schools and the continued growth in provision for special needs in primary and post-primary schools.Overall, the number of primary and post-primary teachers in schools in September 2009 is projected to be about 200 fewer in each sector compared to September 2008. This is because of a number of measures that are being taken to meet the overall budgetary requirements:The mechanism used to allocate classroom teachers to primary schools is the staffing schedule and, with effect from September 2009, the enrolment bands will be based on an average of 28 pupils per class rather than the current 27 pupils per class.In the case of post-primary schools, the allocation basis will be altered by one point with effect from September 2009 from the current 18 to 1 basis to a revised basis of 19 to 1.In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment.The ceiling of two on the number of language support teachers per school is being re-imposed, with some alleviation for the position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall pupil enrolment.Arrangements will also be made for the withdrawal of teacher posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantage schemes to non-DEIS schools.Teacher substitution arrangements: substitution cover will be suspended from January 2009 for absences arising from uncertified sick leave in all schools, as well as for school business absences in post-primary schools.Early Retirement Scheme for Teachers: this pilot scheme is being suspended with immediate effect.School fundingImprovements are being made to the rates of capitation funding available to schools. The combined value is €20m.In the case of primary schools:The increased financial provision will provide for an increase of €21.42 in the standard capitation, bringing the rate to €200 per pupil. This equates to an increase of almost 12pc on the existing €178.58 grant rate.The ancillary grant will be increased from €151.50 per pupil to €155 per pupil.In the case of post-primary schools:
An increase of €14 per pupil in the capitation grant is a 4.3pc increase on 2008.The capitation grant will now stand at €345 per pupil.There will be an increase of €8 per capita in the equalisation measure payable to voluntary secondary schools, giving a total increase, when capitation and school support services grants are combined, of €22 per pupil.Abolition in 2009 of certain grants paid to schoolsIn the case of primary schools:
The separate cookery grant, resource grant for language support teachers and equipment grant for resource teachers are being abolished. The total value of these grants was €2m.A further €4.3m is being saved by the reduction in capitation funding for Travellers and withdrawal of certain capitation funding from schools that are not in the DEIS programme but had continued to receive top-up funding originally provided under previous disadvantage initiatives.In the case of post-primary schools:
A number of separate grant payments to second-level schools are being abolished. These are grants for Choirs and Orchestras, Home Economics, Physics and Chemistry, Junior Certificate Schools Programme, Leaving Certificate Applied, LCVP and Transition Year. The total saving will be €5.35m.A further €2m is being saved by a reduction in capitation funding for Travellers and withdrawal of certain capitation funding from schools that are not in the DEIS programme but had continued to receive top-up funding originally provided under previous disadvantage initiatives.In the case of  fee-charging second-level schools:
An anomalous situation has existed whereby fee-charging schools under Catholic patronage were not in receipt of certain grants, including the support services grant, that were paid to other fee-charging schools. This position is being regularised. All fee-charging schools will be treated on a similar basis resulting in a saving of €2.8m. The Protestant block grant remains in place.Other funding reductionsAid for school books: A saving of €7.5m will result by restricting aid for school books to DEIS schools. A fund of €7m will be available for distribution to schools in the DEIS programme.Library grants: A saving of €2.19m will result from the cessation of funding that the Department made available to local authorities to support school library services.Support for summer courses in Irish colleges: The per capita subvention by the Department to summer courses conducted in Irish colleges (in Gaeltacht areas) is being withdrawn. The saving will be €1.25m.Centre for Talented Youth: The Department has in the past provided an annual grant of €97,000 to the Centre for Talented Youth. This is being withdrawn.Grant for foreign qualified teachers attending Irish courses in the Gaeltacht: This grant is being withdrawn. The saving will be €200,000.Special needsResource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) will continue to be deployed to meet the needs of children with special educational needs (SEN) at primary and post-primary levels. There are just over 19,000 staff working with special needs children.While in the light of the financial situation it is necessary to defer the implementation of the EPSEN Act, children with SEN will continue to have their SEN met on a non-statutory basis.Further, provision is being made to improve these services through the allocation of an additional €10m which will fund enhanced measures for children with SEN pending the full implementation of the EPSEN Act.School psychologists: Some of this €10 million will contribute to a 33% increase in expenditure on the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS), resulting in all schools having a service by the end of 2009.SNAs: An increase of €40 million to cover the full-year costs of additional SNAs in the system this September, provision for additional posts next September, and full-year cost of pay increases awarded.Higher educationThe current estimates provision for higher education is €1,844m, compared with a 2008 estimate of €1,887m. The estimate allows for an increase in the student registration charge from €900 to up to €1,500 in individual institutions for the academic year 2009/2010. Third-level students entitled to a student support grant will remain exempt from paying the student registration charge.The estimates provision will require restrictions in the implementation of approved projects under the Strategic Innovation Fund and will involve the deferral of planned 2009 increases in medical education places. It will also involve restrictions in the volume of awards made by the two Research Councils (Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology and Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences).Adult and further educationThe non-pay grant provision for adult and further education shows a reduction of €8.5m or just under 5pc on the 2008 estimate.  This will require a reduction in the provision of 500 places on the Back to Education Initiative — reducing the total number of places to 9,000.     The number of places provided in Senior Traveller Training Centres will be reduced by approximately 100 — there are currently 1,084 places provided.Allowances to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres will be increased in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or FAS trainee allowances.YouthGrants for youth services are being reduced by just over 8pc — from €52.6m to €48.2m.Teacher educationThe provision for teacher in-service education support is €28.8m, compared with a 2008 estimate of €33.8m. It is intended to reduce teacher secondments to in-service and, while it will be possible to continue to provide a wide range of services to teachers, the reduced allocation will mean that programmes that are not in an expansionary or prioritised phase will have to be curtailed to a degree.School transportThe provision for school transport is €196m, compared with a 2008 figure of €175m.The post-primary school transport charge is increasing from an annual fee of €168 for junior cycle children and €234 for senior cycle children (payable on a term-by-term basis) to a single annual fee of €300 for eligible post-primary children first payable in summer 2009.The maximum amount payable per single family, regardless of the number of children using the school transport system, will be €650 annually. Eligible children in families who hold a medical card or children with special needs are exempt from the charges.Reduction in Department's regional office serviceThe 26pc reduction reflects the intention to rationalise and prioritise some services and to seek efficiencies in the operation of the Department's regional office network.Other currentFee increases will be required across the State Examinations Commission (SEC), Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC). SEC will increase fees by 8pc.Note: The Government decided in July 2008 that the payroll costs across Government organisations should be reduced by 3pc in 2009 and other restrictions should apply in order to effect cost savings in consultancy, advertising and other administrative areas. This is the background to some of the reductions applying in the Education Estimates for 2009. The estimates provisions under a range of headings will require careful management over the course of the year with expenditure control measures across all areas and possible further tightening measures may be necessary as the year progresses.
Extract from summary of expenditure-related measures announced in 2010 Budget
Main FeaturesCapitalCapital allocation of €715 million is being made available in 2010.    In addition €79 million capital savings from 2009 will be carried forward into 2010, bringing total capital funding available for Education in 2010 to €794 million.The total funding available is a decrease of less than 7% compared to the allocation for 2009.CurrentThe current allocation for 2010 is €8.173 billion which is a reduction of 5.4% over the allocation for 2009.    The reduction includes a general pay-related adjustment of €350 million in line with the Government decision to reduce public service pay rates. This accounts for 4% of the reduction. The distribution of this pay adjustment across subheads will be included in the context of the 2010 Revised Estimates Volume.Additional expenditure measures€12 million is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide 500 additional teachers over the next 3 years.   This allocation will allow for the employment of an additional 200 teachers starting in early 2010 and a further 150 teachers commencing in September 2010.€14 million is being provided in 2010 for the implementation of the Renewed Programme for Government commitment to provide additional teachers from September 2010 for the 2010/11 school year to meet demographic pressures and to ensure no further increase in the PTR. This allocation will fund 600 posts in primary schools and 330 in second level schools.€19 million is being provided to maintain school capitation grants at current levels and to take account of increased pupil numbers. This allocation will also enable additional funding to be allocated to schools for school books and to support curricular activities as provided in the Renewed Programme for Government.The allocation for VTOS is being increased by €7.5 million to meet additional expenditure on allowances due to the change in profile of applicants for the scheme.An additional allocation of €3 million is provided for the promotion of Gaeilge in schools, as part of the new 20-year Strategy for the Irish Language.The provision for the National Educational Psychological Service is being increased to provide for the increase in psychologists to 210.  This will allow NEPS psychologists to provide direct service to every first and second level school and an enhancement of service to special schools and units.Higher EducationThe provision for 2010 for Universities and Institutes of Technology is €1,266 million which is a 4% reduction on the 2009 provision of €1,318 million.The reduction in funding takes account of targeted reductions in numbers employed under an employment control framework for the sector and will also involve further non-pay cost efficiencies.Just under €130 million is being provided to higher education institutions next year for research activities, including capital research funding. This underlines the Government's commitment to focussed delivery of its Science, Technology and Innovation strategy.   As part of this it is intended that investments under cycle 5 of PRTLI will proceed.  The assessment process for PRTLI 5 awards will conclude in early 2010 and, in line with normal lead in times, major elements of expenditure commitments are anticipated to materialise from 2011 onwards.The funding available next year for projects under the Strategic Innovation Fund is €18 million a reduction of €8 million on 2009. This reduced allocation will require a further curtailment of project activity.   Priority will continue to be given to projects aimed at up-skilling and re-skilling for employment.Student grants and scholarshipsA reduction of 5% is being applied to the rates of student grants and scholarships.   This will provide €10 million in savings in 2010. However, the overall allocation for student support will be increased in 2010 to take account of increased numbers of students.The reduction will be implemented to all existing and new grant holders from January 2010. This is in line with reductions in other income maintenance payments including those for the unemployed.A further saving of €4 million will be made by the removal of eligibility for student support grants from people in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing a PLC course. However, the cost of the student service charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met by the Exchequer on their behalf.  This will apply to all new grant holders in 2010 onwards.Support under the Millennium Partnership Fund is being withdrawn saving €2 million.Adult and further educationThe number of places provided in Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs) will be reduced by 300 places from 984 places to 684 places. This in line with the Traveller Education Strategy.  Travellers can continue to access the full range of Adult and Further Education programmes across the country.Allowances to participants in VTOS, Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres will be reduced in line with the appropriate social welfare rates or FAS trainee allowances.Teacher educationThe provision for teacher in-service education support is €29.79m, compared with a 2009 estimate of €40m.  Restructuring of existing services will continue in 2010.   Services will be focused on priority areas including special education needs, child protection guidelines training, implementation of new procedures for underperforming teachers and Project Maths.The allocation for pre-service teacher education is being reduced by €3m and will be achieved by reducing the number of post-graduate conversion places.Teacher Sick Leave and SubstitutionThe supply teacher scheme at primary level will cease from the start of the 2010/11 school year.  Normal substitution arrangements, which apply to primary schools generally to cover teacher absences at present, will be used to cover substitution in those schools that participated in the scheme.From the start of the 2010/11 school year, the maximum number of uncertified sick leave days allowed in the school year for teachers in primary, secondary and community & comprehensive schools is being reduced to 7 days.  This is the same amount as is available for teachers in vocational schools and community colleges.School transportThe provision for school transport is €188m, compared with a 2009 estimated out-turn of €178m.   While efficiencies made during 2009 will continue to yield savings in 2010, an increase of €10m is being provided which includes provision for new services as necessary.Reduction in allocations to Education bodies:National Council for Curriculum and Assessment reduced by €0.93mNational Council for Special Education reduced by €2.3mHigher Education Authority reduced by €0.562mDublin Dental Hospital reduced by €0.410m.Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies reduced by €0.546m.Royal Irish Academy of Music reduced by €0.303mNational Qualifications Framework (NQAI, FETAC, HETAC) current allocation reduced by €2.1 million.Other currentFurther savings will be made from expenditure efficiencies in the Department's Administrative Budget (excluding NEPS) (€2.4 million).The allocation of €5m funding from the Dormant Accounts fund will allow for the continuation of existing schemes to counteract educational disadvantage funded from this source.Funding will be reduced by €1.2 million in 2010 for projects in Local Drugs Task Force areas in the Dublin city and county area.   Funding provided by the Department for these projects will be phased out in 2011.
Extract from summary of expenditure-related measures announced in 2011 Budget
MAIN FEATURESOverall AllocationThe gross overall Voted allocation for the Department for 2011 will be €8.855 billion. This compares to an allocation for 2010 of €9.002 billion, representing a reduction of 2%. In addition the Estimate includes provision for expenditure of some €362 million under the National Training Fund in 2011, which is a reduction of 14% over the allocation for 2010, due mainly to a projected significant reduction in fund income in 2011.Capital ExpenditureThe capital allocation for 2011 will be €491 million. The figure reflects the overall medium-term reduction in capital investment announced in the National Recovery Plan.The capital expenditure envelope for education of almost €1.9 billion over the period of the plan will provide for meeting demographic needs in primary and post-primary schools and for some improvement in the stock of school buildings. The allocation will also provide for some prioritised investment in third-level infrastructure.Current ExpenditureA provision for current expenditure of €8.364 billion has been made for 2011. This is an increase of just under 1% on the equivalent 2010 allocation of €8.295 billion. A further €362 million of current expenditure is provided for under the National Training Fund.  The 2011 allocation takes account of upward expenditure pressures mainly in relation to student support payments, the cost of pensions and demographic increases. It also takes account of savings of some €175 million to be secured across the education sector. More details regarding current expenditure are provided below.School TransportThe 2011 estimate for school transport services is €180 million compared to an allocation for 2010 of €186 million. €4.5 million in savings will be secured in 2011 (rising to €17 million in 2014), through a combination of increases in charges and the implementation of measures identified in a value for money review of the school transport scheme. With effect from the 2011/2012 school year a transport fee of €50 per annum will be introduced for primary school pupils, with a maximum family charge of €110 applying. This charge is being introduced to ensure that school transport provided for eligible primary pupils is fully utilised. The annual charge for post-primary pupils will be increased by €50 from €300 to €350. The combined maximum overall family charge will remain at €650.Changes in the 2011/2012 school year arising from the value for money review will include:The distance criteria will be applied to all pupils attending primary schools and the exemption under the closed school rule will cease. This means that children who reside less than 3.2 kilometres (2 miles) from the school of attendance and who are availing of free transport to that school under the closed school rule will lose their transport eligibility;Services under the minimum numbers, either single services or which are part of double tripping arrangements, will be discontinued. A pick up density of pupils in a distinct locality on a particular route — increasing from the current minimum of 7 to 10 eligible children — will be required to establish or retain services.Further changes from the review, which will take effect from a later date, will include the following:From the 2012/13 school year, eligibility based on the closed school rule (CSR) and the central school rule will cease for all new children entering primary schools. Existing primary pupils availing of transport under the CSR will retain transport eligibility for the duration of their schooling, provided the requisite distance is met;From the 2012/13 school year, the use of the catchment boundary system will cease for all new post-primary children. Eligibility for all new children entering post-primary transport will be on the basis of the nearest post-primary centre or school. Existing arrangements will remain in place for existing post primary pupils for the duration of their schooling;New arrangements will be put in place with Bus Éireann on a phased basis for the operation of the scheme. These will include arrangements for an increasing proportion of routes to be provided by private operators. From the 2012/13 school year, Bus Éireann will have full responsibility for the operation of the school transport system including responsibility for processing all applications for school transport or grants.  Synergies between school transport, rural transport and Health Service Executive services will be further developed.Schools€22 million in savings will be secured in 2011 though an average 5% reduction in funding grants to schools and Vocational Educational Committees (including mainstream and ancillary grants for schools), and including grants for Adult Literacy, Community Education, School Completion Programme, Youthreach. This will reduce capitation rates to those that applied to schools between 2007 and 2008. (There will also be a similar reduction in capitation rates payable in respect of Senior Traveller Training Centres, VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) and PLC (Post-Leaving Certificate) students). Details of the revised rates for each grant category will be issued to schools and VECs shortly. Reduced rates will also apply to ancillary and support services grants to reflect the reduction in pay that will apply to personnel who are paid from these grants, and who have not yet had the reduction applied to them, with effect from January 2011, e.g. school cleaners and caretakers.The 2011 allocation for teacher salaries of almost €3.85 billion takes account of €24 million in savings (rising to €98 million in 2014) to be achieved by reducing teacher numbers through a combination of measures. These measures will lead to a deferral of 150 extra posts and to a reduction of up to approximately 1,200 posts from September 2011 (approximately 700 primary and 500 post-primary posts) which, however, will be partly offset by the addition of an estimated 875 new posts due to demographics. The measures to reduce teacher posts include:Deferral of the provision of 150 extra teachers originally planned to be allocated at primary and post-primary level in September 2011;Changing the existing favourable pupil-teacher ratio (PTR) to the standard PTR for the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme (LCVP). Currently, the allocation of teachers to the LCVP is on the basis of 1 teacher for every 17 pupils. This will be changed from September 2011 to the standard allocation basis of 1 teacher for every 19 pupils (or 1 teacher for every 20 pupils in the case of fee-charging schools). This measure will secure savings of approximately 200 posts;Standardising the staffing schedule for Gaelscoileanna to the same that operates for other ordinary national schools, the estimated yield from which will be some 50 posts;Withdrawal of Resource Teachers for Travellers posts at primary level so that educational teaching supports to Traveller students will now be provided on the same basis as other students in schools. Alleviation measures will be put in place for schools with a high concentration of Traveller children. At post-primary level teaching hours for Travellers will be withdrawn, again with alleviation measures for schools with high concentrations of Traveller children. This measure will secure savings of approximately 600 posts net.A phased reduction of 500 over four years in the number of Language Support Teachers, through a demand driven reduction and, if necessary, a change in allocation rules over the period of the plan. A first year reduction of some 125 posts is targeted with effect from September 2011;The redeployment of some 170 existing supernumerary posts in post-primary schools from September 2011;The removal of 47 primary rural co-ordinator teaching posts currently allocated to DEIS rural primary schools. All of these schools, however, will continue to receive other DEIS supports including financial support, professional development supports, school meals and school books supports;The withdrawal from September 2011 of 42 Visiting Teachers for Travellers posts, currently assigned to the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB). The School Support services, including the School Completion Programme and the Home School Liaison Service under the NEWB, will be adapted to undertake work with Travellers in the future.In line with the Traveller Education Strategy and the 2008 value for money review of Youthreach and Senior Traveller Training Centres (STTCs), integrated further education provision for Travellers will be implemented through the phasing out of STTCs by June 2012 and replacement places, prioritised for Travellers, being provided under the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI).  This means there will be no new enrolments in STTCs from 1 January 2011.€10 million in savings will be secured from rule changes and efficiencies in relation to supervision and substitution arrangements in schools. This will include implementation of the flexibility measures provided for under the Croke Park Agreement whereby post-primary teachers will be available for an extra class period each week to cover for absent colleagues. There will also be a general tightening of the rules covering substitution.Special Needs AssistantsThe 2011 allocation for pay for Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) will be approximately €350 million, compared to an allocation of €335 for 2010. The allocation provides for the full-year costs of SNAs appointed in 2010. While there will be no reduction in the SNA numbers in 2011 it is intended to place a cap on these numbers. The Department will in this regard work with the National Council for Special Education to develop a new system to manage SNA provision within the total numbers allocation. All schools will be advised of the new system.Further and Higher EducationThe 2011 provision for Universities, Institutes of Technology and other higher education institutions is €1.113 billion, which represents a gross reduction of 7% on the allocation for 2010. Net of adjustments for increased income in respect of the Student Contribution Charge of €2,000, the overall 2011 reduction is 2.2% (5%, or €14 million, in the non-pay grants payable to these bodies and a 1.5% pay cost reduction).Further savings of €27 million will be achieved by replacing the existing €1,500 per year Student Services Charge with a flat higher education Student Contribution of €2,000 with effect from the 2011/2012 academic year.  The Student Contribution will apply to all students who currently benefit under the ‘free fees' scheme.  Higher education institutions will be asked to consider how they could put in place arrangements under which a student may opt to pay the charge in two equal instalments of 50% in September and 50% in January in a given academic year.  The contribution will be paid by the Exchequer in respect of students who qualify under the third level grant schemes.  These students, who account for some 43% of all undergraduates, will not be impacted by any increase in charges.  The Government is also aware of the particular financial pressures that this charge may place on families where family income is marginally in excess of current eligibility levels for maintenance grant support and on families with more than one sibling in higher education at the same time.  With this in mind, the current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for ‘50% Student Contribution' (see detail in Appendix). In addition, arrangements will be made to provide that second and subsequent siblings from a single family will not have to bear the full increased cost of the new €2,000 charge.The introduction of a new €200 annual contribution for Post Leaving Certificate students will secure savings of €4 million in 2011. The cost of the charge will be met by the Exchequer on behalf of those students who are eligible under the maintenance grant scheme for students attending PLC courses. Eligible students may include those in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance provided that they meet all of the terms and conditions of the relevant student grant scheme.Provision of further education opportunities in 2011 will be largely the same as that in 2010, with over 173,000 participants benefiting from VEC interventions.Student SupportThe 2011 allocation for student support payments is just over €385 million. This represents an increase of some 5%, or €18 million, over the 2010 provision and reflects both increased numbers of students qualifying for grants and a greater proportion of students qualifying for higher rates of grants, which are means tested.The current higher education grants schemes threshold will be increased to provide for an additional eligibility category of support qualifying for ‘50% Student Contribution' .The 2011 allocation also takes account of savings of some €22 million (rising to some €51 million in 2014), to be achieved through implementing a range of savings measures in the student support scheme. These measures include:A 4% reduction in the rate of student support grants, reflecting the reductions in rates of social protection payments announced in the Budget. This will yield savings of €8 million;Changing the qualifying distance criterion for entitlement to the higher non-adjacent rate of grant (distance from home to the higher education institution) from 15 miles (24 kilometres) to 28 miles (45 kilometres).  The original distance criterion was set in 1968, before the significant improvement in transport facilities and road networks which has taken place. This measure will yield €10 million of savings in 2011 (€30 million in 2014);Savings of €4 million (€13 million in 2014) will be secured by reducing the automatic eligibility of mature students to the higher non-adjacent rate of payment, thereby bringing the arrangements for mature students into line with all other students.Skills and TrainingSavings of approximately €10 million  will be achieved in the area of training allowances and supports.  This includes a reduction, consistent with reductions in social protection rates announced in the Budget, of €8 per week in all weekly training allowances and similar support payments. The long-term unemployment bonus paid to VTOS (Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme) students and to FAS trainees will be reduced from €31.80 per week to €20 per week.In Budget 2011 the allocation to FÁS for training the unemployed has been decreased by €43 million or approximately 15%. This will result in an equivalent reduction of 15,410 training places that FÁS can deliver for the unemployed next year. This will imply that FAS will deliver approximately 100,000 training places next year as opposed to the 115,000 they are delivering this year.Other current expenditure itemsThe reduced 2011 allocation of just over €18 million for the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) takes account of €3 million in savings to be secured through capping at 178 the number of psychologists in the service;A saving of €1 million in 2011, rising to €12 million in 2014, will be achieved through the impact of a 10% reduction in salary scales  for new entrants to the public service, with all new entrants starting on the minimum point of the new scale.€16 million in savings (€39 million in 2014) will be achieved through further reductions in public service numbers on the Education and Skills Vote, including in the Non-Commercial State Agencies under the aegis of the Department. These reductions are on foot of the updated Employment Control Framework in the National Recovery Plan, to control public sector numbers.A further €18 million in savings will be achieved through a range of non-pay administrative savings, the management of emerging expenditure pressures and other estimating savings.The 2011 allocation of €78 million for the Administrative Budget subheads A1 to A8 includes an additional €1.6 million in staff costs as a result of the transfer of functions in May 2010. When account is taken of this the 2011 allocation for these subheads represents a reduction of 2% on the comparable allocation for 2010.The 2011 allocations to a number of bodies under the aegis of the Department reflect reductions in payroll and other administrative savings.

The decision to organise and/or charge for mock examinations is made at school level, and my Department does not have a role in the matter. Schools are provided with capitation and school services grants to meet their running costs. Post-primary schools receive school services grant of €201 per pupil plus a capitation grant of €328 per pupil. DEIS schools also receive additional funds for targeted interventions to improve educational outcomes for students at risk.It is important for schools to be sensitive to the financial pressures on families, and to use the State funds provided to optimum effect. However, my Department is not in a position to make additional funds available to schools in the current climate.Ideally, mock examinations should be marked by teachers as part of their ongoing work in schools. While schools in the Free Education Scheme may seek voluntary contributions from parents, they may not charge fees for teaching and learning activities scheduled as part of the school day, or exclude students from such services for non payment of a fee.

I understand from FÁS that the additional 1,000 places for the longer Specific Skills Training Courses have been identified and scheduled, with some courses already commenced and participants for the remainder currently being recruited.FÁS are planning to commence over the next 3 months the remaining short, evening and blended learning, specific skills training courses with the additional 5,000 places.  FÁS is confident that it will achieve its target in this area in 2011.Back to Education and Post Leaving Certificate Courses. The additional 1,000 Further Education Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) and 3,000 Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) places are being prioritised for the unemployed. These additional places have been allocated to Vocational Education Committees (VECs) and other providers and are being made available to participants for the current academic year.It is expected that the additional 1,000 learners on PLC programmes will be fully utilised by the end of September. Data on enrolments will be notified to my Department as part of the standard 30 September enrolment returns which will be available at the end of the year.The additional BTEI places are designed to provide flexible short term programmes, with priority given to people who are unemployed and who left school prior to completing their Leaving Certificate. VECs are currently in the process of recruiting participants and initiating programmes for the Jobs Initiative. Data on the number of participants availing of these places will be submitted by VECs as part of end of year reports.Springboard Applications for the 5,900 Springboard places opened on 25 May 2011 through the online applications facility on the Bluebrick.ie. web portal. It is open to applicants to submit multiple applications and to date 16,040 applications have been received from 6,736 people. 3,792 applicants have been accepted and are enrolled on courses and 2,378 applications are currently being processed.As applications are still being submitted and processed, the overall position in relation to uptake will not be known for another few weeks. I understand that the majority of Springboard programmes will have commenced by mid October.

I understand that FÁS is introducing a Competency Determination Scheme for the trades of Brick & Stonelaying, Carpentry & Joinery, Electrical, Plastering and Plumbing.  Under this Scheme, redundant apprentices who have successfully completed Phases 1 to 7 of their apprenticeships, but who do not meet the requirement of having completed the statutory 4 years (208 weeks) in employment as apprentices, will be invited by FÁS to attend a FÁS Training Centre to have their competency assessed.Redundant apprentices who pass the competency assessment will receive an exemption from this requirement thereby enabling them to complete their apprenticeships and qualify for the award of the FETAC Advanced Certificate — Craft.  I understand that apprentices are being scheduled for competency assessments at present.  ? Certificate in Craft Transferable Skills. FÁS and the HEA with the Institutes of Technology have developed a post Phase 6 programme for redundant apprentices who wish to access a programme at 3rd level in the Institutes of Technology.  Redundant Apprentices who successfully complete this programme will receive a HETAC Special Award Level 3, 30 ECTS Credits.  This award should entitle apprentices to enter year 2 of a relevant Higher Certificate (level 6) and in some particular cases may gain entry to Ordinary Degree Programmes Level 7.  The Certificate in Craft Transferable Skills (optional) will be offered by the Institutes of Technology in Term 1 — 2011/2012.I would strongly advise that Redundant Apprentices should contact their FÁS Training Advisor to obtain advice and guidance in relation to the progression of their apprenticeship.

The teachers were paid by the managerial authorities.With effect from the 1st January this year, part-time specialist subject teachers are being paid on a payroll operated by my Department. Under the terms of the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act, 2001, qualified eligible part-time teachers are entitled to be paid salary appropriate to their qualifications and to receive incremental credit in respect of relevant teaching service.The arrears due to each qualified teacher are determined individually with regard to their qualifications and service.  It is hoped to pay the outstanding arrears to approximately 60 qualified teachers within the current financial year. The current priority of my Department's Payroll Division is to ensure that replacement teachers and special need assistants being appointed for the 2011/2012 school year are placed on payroll for payment.

Where a person changes grade during their final three years of service, the salary is averaged over the last 3 years for the purposes of calculating pensionable remuneration.Pension Calculation(a) in the case of staff appointed before 6th April 1995 the pension is calculated as 1/80th of pensionable remuneration for each years service.(b) For staff recruited after 6th April 1995 the pension is calculated as follows:1/200th of pensionable remuneration below 3 1/3 times Old Age Contributory Pension (OACP)Multiplied by reckonable service plus (where applicable)1/80th of pensionable remuneration in excess of 3 1/3 times OACPMultiplied by reckonable service. A maximum of 40 years service applies in both cases.  Retirement Gratuity.In the case of both categories of staff retirement gratuities are calculated as 3/80th of pensionable remuneration for each year of service subject to a maximum of 120/80th (i.e. 1 1/2 times the final annual salary).In the case of a person having reached 40 years service their pension will be calculated as follows:Pension = Annual Salary X Service 80Gratuity Sum = Annual Salary X 1.5It is possible for a staff member over the age of fifty to retire and receive an actuarially reduced pension.I have included details of the 2008 pay scales for the grades in question that are applicable to officials that retire before the 29th. February 2012. Officials that retire after this date will have their pensions calculated at the reduced salary rates that came into effect from the 1st, January 2010.In respect of the Secretary General her current gross salary is €215,590 per annum and she has effected a voluntary waiver to bring her remuneration to €200,000. Her gross salary prior to pay reductions was €253,635 per annum.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	683	The Deputy will be aware that policy can be expressed and manifested through a variety of forms. Explicitly, it is communicated via legislation, regulations, rulings, orders, plans, strategies, policy statements, and other forms — or through a combination of these. Therefore the Deputy will appreciate that specific policies and objectives are not always articulated in just one document.My Department strives to ensure that a continuum of special education provision is available as required for children with special educational needs. In line with this approach the policy is to promote a child-centred approach to education of all children with special educational needs including those with autism. As each child with autism is unique they should have access to a range of different approaches to meet their individual needs.Children with autism present with a wide range of needs. Some children are capable of being fully integrated into mainstream schools without additional teaching or care supports. Others are able to attend mainstream schools but need additional teaching and/or care assistance. Many are best enrolled in autism-specific classes where more intensive and supportive interventions are required. Some may move from one setting to another as they get older and differing needs/strengths/abilities emerge.The preferred policy of my Department is that children with autism are educated in school settings where children may have access to individualised education programmes (IEPs), fully-qualified professional teachers, special needs assistants, the appropriate school curriculum with the option, where possible and appropriate, of full or partial integration and interaction with other pupils.Autism classes are established with a staffing ratio of 1 teacher and a minimum of 2 Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) for every 6 children. Other SNAs may be allocated if required to meet the care needs of the children. Start-up grants are provided to the schools to enable special equipment to be purchased. Enhanced capitation is paid in respect of each child and assistive technology is funded where this is recommended.This approach promotes the maximum level of inclusion which accords with the intent of the EPSEN Act. While some children may be able to attend a mainstream class, for others the most appropriate provision may be in a special class or unit in the school or in a special school.My Department supports provision in mainstream schools, some 430 special classes for autism attached to mainstream and special schools and 18 special schools for children with autism throughout the State which cater for the educational needs of some 5,000 children with autism, all of which operate within the policy parameters.This policy is based on advice received from international experts on autism, NEPS, the Inspectorate and the report of the Irish Task Force on Autism. My Department has satisfied itself that research does not support the exclusive usage of any one approach as a basis for national educational provision for children with autism. It is for this reason that my Department's preferred policy is for a child centred approach where the approach to be taken is based on the individual child's needs.In arriving at the preferred policy which is currently in place, my Department has considered published research, including the Report of the Task Force on Autism (2001) and the Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders (2006), both of which are available on my Department's website and which have informed the policy. My Department was also mindful of contributions of many other experts at international conferences/visits which have also informed the development views.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	684	As the Deputy is aware the centre to which he has referred submitted a proposal for an academy for children with autism to my Department for consideration. My Department took a decision not to provide funding to support the centre as the proposal submitted was not in line with my Department's policy on educational provision for children with autism. My Department had no direct funding arrangements with the group in question.The purpose of the Home Tuition Scheme is to provide a compensatory educational service for children who, for a number of reasons such as chronic illness, are unable to attend school. The scheme was extended in recent years to facilitate tuition for children awaiting a suitable educational placement and also to provide early educational intervention for pre-school children with autism.The National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible for the provision of a range of educational services at local and national level for students with special educational needs. In particular, its network of Special Education Needs Organisers (SENOs) co-ordinates special needs education provision at local level and arranges for the delivery of special educational services.  The SENOs act as single points of contact for parents of students with special educational needs. Another specific function of the SENO is to identify appropriate educational placements for children with special educational needs. SENOs are a valuable source of support to parents who are actively sourcing a placement for their children.The NCSE have been fully engaged in securing placements for the children in question. The NCSE has advised my Department that there are placements available for all of these children. I am aware that the parents of the children have all been advised of their placement options by the NCSE.I also wish to advise the Deputy that my Department has approved home tuition, from the commencement of the current school year, for 1 month for all of the children concerned. The purpose of this provision is to facilitate transitional arrangements for children taking up placements. My Department will consider, as an exceptional measure, extending this period further to facilitate transitional arrangements for the children once they have enrolled in the school based placements.

The next stage involves the appointment of a Design Team and this process is expected to commence shortly.  All large scale building projects, including this project, will be considered within the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme. In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the completion of the project at this time.The current status of all projects on the school building programme, including this project, may be viewed on my Department's website at www.education.ie and this will be updated regularly throughout the year.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	686	The Deputy will be aware that the student grant measures announced in Budget 2011 by the previous Fianna Fáil — Green Party Government began to come into effect from January this year when a reduction of 4% in the rates of grant was applied to all student grant recipients.  In addition, from September 2011 the assessment of the qualifying distance criterion for the non-adjacent rate of grant was changed from 24 kilometres to 45 kilometres and mature students no longer have an automatic entitlement to the non-adjacent rate of grant.Given the current economic circumstances I regret that I am not in a position to reverse the changes made to the entitlement for mature students.  Students in exceptional financial circumstances can apply for assistance under the Student Assistance Fund. Information on the Fund is available through the access offices of third-level institutions. The access offices themselves will also continue to provide support and advice to students to enable them to continue with their studies.The BTEA is a Department of Social Protection second-chance education opportunities scheme designed to encourage and facilitate people on certain social welfare payments to improve their skills and qualifications and therefore, their prospects of returning to the workforce. The Deputy will appreciate that eligibility for, or any extension of the BTEA scheme to accommodate postgraduate studies is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.  There has already been a substantial level of liaison between officials of my Department and those of the Department of Social Protection in relation to common issues concerning eligibility for the BTEA and student grants.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	687	Changes in the School Transport Scheme were announced by the previous Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government and derive from recommendations in the Value for Money Review of the scheme.One of the changes announced included an increase to ten in the minimum number of eligible pupils, residing in a distinct locality, required to establish or retain an individual school transport service.Bus Éireann, which operates the school transport schemes on behalf of my Department, has advised that in this case, the number of applications from eligible pupils did not match the above requirement and consequently the service was withdrawn from the beginning of the current school year.This minimum number requirement has been applied to all individual school transport services nationally from the commencement of the 2011/12 school year.As is currently the position, families of eligible pupils, for whom there is no school transport service available, may apply for a remote area grant towards the cost of making private transport arrangements.It is essential to stress that the wider context within which this change is taking place, is a situation of the most serious financial difficulties. Under the four year recovery plan, there is a requirement to deliver savings of €17 million on the school transport budget and this measure is an integral part of this.

My Department has requested the VEC to ensure that the club referred to by the Deputy is given use of the facility following execution of the lease.  I understand that the VEC has already presented a draft user agreement to the club for their consideration in anticipation of concluding legal formalities with my Department.  Providing a letter of comfort to the club in relation to its future use of the sports facility is, therefore, no longer considered necessary.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I understand that the Deputy is interested in the ‘grace period' and its effects.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 provided for a period within which pensions are unaffected by the pay cuts introduced in that Act. This ‘grace period was due to expire by the end of 2010 however it was extended to 29 February 2012 to avoid too large a number of public service retirements in 2011 and to spread the extra pension lump sum costs over a more manageable period in both 2011 and 2012.Also, in July this year a 3 month minimum notice period for retirement was introduced for the public service.  The purpose of this minimum notice period is to protect services by giving management information about the number of staff retiring in a particular area and to assist in planning how best to maintain services.  I have no plans to introduce any special arrangements for public servants who do not have forty years pensionable service: in accordance with the standard pension arrangements, those who opt for retirement will receive a pension based on the service accumulated to the date of their retirement. I would point out that, generally, public servants who are aged over 50 may avail of cost neutral early retirement.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	694	As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland was allocated a total of €901m in Structural Funding for the 2007-13 programming period, with €750m assigned to the Regional Competitiveness and Employment (RCE) Objective. Ireland's National Strategic Reference Framework (NSRF) sets out the policy context through which the RCE allocation may be applied.  This is implemented through three Operational Programmes: the Border, Midlands and Western (BMW) OP, the Southern and Eastern (S&E) OP — both co-funded by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) — and the Human Capital Investment OP, which is co-funded by the European Social Fund (ESF). The balance of €151m is for smaller Territorial Cooperation programmes including PEACE III, INTERREG IVA and the Ireland Wales programme.The EU Commission developed four joint initiatives in co-operation with the European Investment Bank (EIB) group and other financial institutions in the framework of the 2007-2013 programming period. Two of them refer to the promotion of financial engineering instruments (JEREMIE and JESSICA). The other two (JASPERS and JASMINE) operate as technical assistance facilities.These initiatives were examined when Ireland's ERDF Structural Programmes 2007-13 were being developed back in 2006/7.  However, primarily because of the scale of operations required to secure EIB participation, the availability of credit at that time and the level of structural funds allocated to Ireland, it was not considered suited to our Structural Funds programmes.In any case, it should be noted that as Ireland has sufficient expenditure in the ERDF funded OPs to draw down our full structural fund allocation, no additional funding would have been made available.The regulations governing the 2014-20 round of structural funds are expected to be published shortly and I will be examining the detail to see if the use of such financial engineering instruments will be appropriate for our structural funds programmes for this period.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	696	The only added years awarded in the Civil and Public Service to persons before reaching the standard pension age are to Secretaries General, County Managers, CEOs of non-commercial State Bodies and to staff in any grade who retire or are retired on health grounds before normal retirement age.  There are no added years' arrangements which enable a person to retire on maximum superannuation benefits automatically before the standard pension age as suggested, as added years do not necessarily confer full pension benefits.  In the cases mentioned above, the amount of pension payable is based on service already accrued plus the added years.  It is not possible to state how many staff will be eligible to benefit from added years in the future, as that will depend on each individual's circumstances at retirement.  If, for example, a Secretary General or CEO is re-appointed to another public service post, has reached maximum retirement age or voluntarily leaves the post before the end of his or her contract, added years are not normally awarded.  It is also not possible to predict how many staff will retire on health grounds in the future.

Information on savings made in each Department was not collated centrally during the lifetime of the scheme.Innovation and business process improvement is now an established discipline within Government Departments. The management of change is also a well established process within business units. In addition, there have been significant developments in the application of information technology to operational environments under the eGovernment initiative, including the move to online customer services. Other contributors to process improvement include the Quality Customer Service initiative and the Taoiseach's Public Service Excellence Awards. These initiatives ensure that continuous improvement in the effectiveness of operational activities is an integral part of the normal business planning process within Departments.

As one measure to achieve this, the guidance advises that the sub-dividing of procurement requirements into "lots" should be considered by contracting authorities where it would be appropriate and practical and can be done without compromising efficiency and value for money.As regards promoting employment of local labour, the award of public contracts is governed by EU Treaty principles and Directives on public procurement. The provisions of the EU Directives allow contracting authorities to attach social conditions to the performance of contracts, provided these are compatible with EU law.  In this regard, EU law requires that such conditions must be made known to all interested parties and must not restrict participation by contractors from other Member States. Specifying such conditions is a matter for the contracting authority concerned, having regard to the foregoing considerations.

Nevertheless, some essential remedial and stabilisation works have been carried out by the Office of Public Works on behalf of the Courts Service in recent years.  The Courts Service has requested the OPW to consider taking ownership of the building as it is surplus to its requirements.The proximity of the old Courthouse to Kilmainham Gaol, which is in the care of the OPW, suggests certain development possibilities, which could well involve use as a public space.  These are at a very early assessment stage by OPW and no decision has been made in this regard as yet.  A critical factor in the decision-making process will be the availability of funding.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	702	Under the terms of the Civil Service Superannuation Schemes, retiring staff are entitled to a lump sum payment and a retirement pension which is based on their length of service and final pensionable remuneration. Further details regarding retirement benefits for civil servants are available at www.cspensions.gov.ie
Retiring staff receive a retirement lump sum of 3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1½ times pensionable remuneration.  In general, staff who were recruited prior to April 1995 and pay the modified rate of PRSI receive a pension of 1/80th of pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.  Staff who were recruited after April 1995, receive a pension which is integrated with the State Pension (Contributory). The formula for the calculation of the pension is 1/200th of pensionable remuneration up to 3 1/3rd times the State Pension, and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit, per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.TLAC retirement terms may be applied to retiring Secretaries General, subject to certain conditions.  Those terms are currently under review for future appointees.As regards the current pay of each senior civil servant, the information is not readily available and would take an inordinate amount of time and associated cost to provide.

The moratorium applies, with limited exceptions, to the civil service, local authorities, non-commercial state bodies, the Garda Síochána, the Permanent Defence Forces and to certain bodies established by enactment and wholly or partly funded out of the Central Fund.  The arrangements have been modulated in relation to the education and health sectors to reflect the particular needs in those sectors. In relation to the civil service, the area of the public service for which I have specific responsibility, a number of Departments and Offices are participants in the Willing Able and Mentoring Programme which is a graduate work experience programme aimed at persons with disabilities.  This programme is not subject to the moratorium.The Deputy may also wish to note that the 3 per cent target for the employment of people with disabilities in the Public Service remains in place, notwithstanding the moratorium.  Reporting on compliance with this target under Part 5 of the Disability Act 2005, the National Disability Authority in their latest published report in 2009 noted that 4.2 per cent of staff employed in the civil service had disabilities.  In relation to other areas of the Public Service, each Minister is responsible for compliance with and reporting on the target set in the Disability Act 2005 for the employment of persons with disabilities in public bodies under his or her aegis.Finally, the Civil and Public Service is an equal opportunities employer and all recruitment campaigns are conducted in strict compliance with the Codes of Practice set out by the Commission for Public Service Appointments. Codes include the Code of Practice governing the External and Internal Appointments of Persons with Disabilities to Positions in the Irish Civil Service and Certain Public Bodies.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	709	General policy in the area of prices is to allow retailers the freedom to determine the prices they charge their customers, whilst ensuring that in doing so they act in accordance with the provisions of competition law.  In this regard competition law does not prohibit below cost selling as there is no reason to believe that below cost selling of itself acts against the interests of consumers or is in any sense anti-competitive.  The use of aggressive pricing strategies is a perfectly legitimate marketing tool and is the normal outcome of the competitive process. Accordingly I have no plans to introduce a ban on below cost selling.Competition law does, however, prohibit traders who hold a dominant position in the market from abusing that position. One such abuse of a dominant position is predatory pricing. Predatory pricing normally involves a dominant undertaking pricing goods or services in such a manner with the principle objective of eliminating or seriously weakening a competitor.  Predatory pricing should not be confused with competitive pricing which is the result of a properly functioning market. The purpose of competitive pricing is to retain market share whereas predatory pricing is aimed at driving efficient competitors out of the market by abusing a dominant position.  Persons who have concerns that undertakings may be abusing their dominance in the marketplace by engaging in predatory pricing should bring their concerns to the attention of the Competition Authority who have responsibility for investigating such matters.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21380	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	712	This Government is committed to supporting entrepreneurs to ensure that emerging technologies and innovative business ideas with export potential become a commercial reality.  A range of structures are already in place, nationally including in Cork to provide appropriate support to start-up businesses.The establishment of business incubation centres on higher education campuses across Ireland is supported by capital investment from my Department's Vote, provided through Enterprise Ireland.  Such facilities are internationally recognised as an important element of public assistance for technology-intensive start-ups. Enterprise Ireland has invested over €50m in these facilities that operate in nearly every Institute of Technology and University in the country. They typically comprise a number of incubation units, some hot-desking space for prospective entrepreneurs as well as ancillary space, such as meeting rooms and networking areas. There are currently 276 companies in the 21 facilities and the 5 bio-incubation units operational across Ireland, employing over 1,100 people and operating in a range of areas, including software, environmental technologies and digital media.Additionally, support is provided through Enterprise Ireland for the part funding of Business Innovation Centres (BICs), which are regionally based support organisations for pre-start-up and start-up enterprises and innovative existing companies. There are four BICs located in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Waterford, all providing incubation space to assist fledgling businesses start, establish and then to move on, so that vacated space can be used for other new start-up businesses. A key feature of space managed by BICs is that the start-up company not only gets space, but often also gets free business advice and access to facilities such as meeting rooms with audio visual equipment and to shared services such as a receptionist/telephonist, shared photocopiers and printers.Enterprise Ireland has also rolled out four schemes to support communities to develop locally owned Community Enterprise Centres (CECs) which have enabled entrepreneurs to establish, provide employment and to grow their businesses in their own locality, by providing a physical and human support network for emerging entrepreneurs and micro industry.The CEC scheme was designed as a community led initiative in the form of a partnership between the local community and the State. The primary objective was to enhance the development of an enterprise climate through the provision of infrastructural facilities to support the establishment and expansion of micro enterprises through local community participation in both urban and rural locations.  In Cork, a total of six towns — Cobh, Mitchelstown, Youghal, Midleton, Dunmanway and Macroom were all successful in securing approval for the establishment of CEC's, together with funding, in some cases, for the appointment of centre managers.  The last call for proposals closed in 2008 and the final date for completion of these centres is April 2013.Since the launch of this initiative €61.4m has been approved for the development of CECs across the country and has facilitated the development of 134 centres.  While Enterprise Ireland will not be in a position to offer any financial assistance for a further centre in Kinsale, they will continue to work with the West Cork Enterprise Board; Cork Institute of Technology, and other relevant parties in the area to deliver supports for start-ups in Kinsale and its environs in the area of Enterprise Start Programmes; Out-reach from the Rubicon Centre in CIT; or 1 to 1 supports for groups interested in establishing businesses in the area.

However, specific expressions of interest are not tracked in relation to any specific amendment to that Scheme.  While IDA RD&I grants works to stimulate research, development and Innovation in the economy, a further significant advantage in this area is the productive collaboration between industry, academia and government agencies.

The main features of the Scheme are outlined below.Pre 1995   — Class B PRSI ("modified PRSI") Non-Contributory MembersMaximum retirement age is 65.  Minimum retirement age is 60.  Pensions are calculated at 1/80th of final pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service subject to a maximum of 40/80ths. Lump sums are calculated at 3/80ths of final pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 120/80ths.Post 1995 Class A PRSI Contributory MembersMaximum retirement age is 65.  Minimum retirement age is 60.  Pension Benefits for people who are fully insured for Social Welfare purposes accrue at the rate of 1/200 of final pensionable remuneration per year of service if salary is below or equal to 3 and 1/3rd (three and a third) times the current rate of Contributory State Pension (currently  €40,056.83). If salary is in excess of €40,056.83, pension is calculated at the rate of 1/200 of final pensionable remuneration per year of service on €40,056.83, plus 1/80th of the balance of salary per year of reckonable service. Lump sums are not integrated and accrue at 3/80ths of final pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 120/80ths.Post 2004Minimum retirement age is 65. There is no maximum retirement age. Pensions benefits are calculated using the integration method as with Post 1995 Contributory Members above. Lump sums are not integrated and accrue at  at 3/80ths of final pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 120/80thsEarly RetirementStaff may opt, at the discretion of the Department, to retire at an actuarially reduced cost to themselves between the ages of 50 and 60. The lump sum and pension are reduced to make them the equivalent, in actuarial terms, of preserved benefits. The actuarially reduced rate applies throughout the lifetime of the payment of a pension subject to adjustments in line with Civil Service pension increases/cuts, as appropriate.Special TermsIn addition to pension and lump sum calculated as per formula above, a Secretary General appointed for a term of Office of not more than 7 years who is required to retire at age 60 or after age 60 but before 65, should qualify for:(a) a special severance gratuity of one half of annual salary and(b) added years of service for superannuation purposes not exceeding the number of extra years he/she would have served if he she had been allowed to serve to age 65 subject to maximum service of 40 years.Professional Added Years for Professional and Technical GradesEntitlement to professional added years are assessed under the terms of Circular 12/97Revised Scheme for the award of professional technical and specialist added years to certain civil servants, and is dependent on entitlements under the Social Welfare system, prior employments and/or criteria specified in the original competition for the post.

Aviva has stated it is committed fully to Ireland and is currently in discussions with unions representing staff about the review. Until this review has been completed, it would be premature to speculate about the outcome. I think it is pertinent that the Government allows the unions to engage with Aviva to see where that process might go.As for the role of the IDA, it supports multinational companies predominantly trading outside Ireland or internationally. As part of its business in working to attract international activities into Ireland from multinational companies, the IDA has been in contact with Aviva at both corporate and local levels. I have asked the IDA, given its knowledge of the company, to continue to work with it to mitigate any possible negative outcomes. Consequently, the IDA has been active in this regard.

I am currently reviewing the draft and will, at the earliest possible opportunity, arrange for my Department to publish the Strategy Statement.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	723	Public sector pension rules, including in relation to retirement age, are a matter for my colleague the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  My Department is responsible for State pensions and I will outline the position in this regard.  State pension (transition) (SPT) is currently paid to people aged 65 who have a minimum yearly average of 24 social insurance contributions and who have retired from work.  Currently it ceases at age 66 when the claimant transfers to State pension (contributory) (SPC).
As a result of legislation introduced this year, State pension age will be increased gradually to 68 years.  This will begin in 2014 with the abolition of SPT and the standardisation of State pension age at 66.   State pension age will be increased to 67 years in 2021 and to 68 in 2028. It is worth noting that, until the early 1970s, the qualifying age for State pension (contributory) was 70 years of age.  By gradually increasing the qualifying age for State pension, people will be further encouraged to remain in employment beyond 65 years of age.The Quarterly National Household Survey Q4 2010 showed that the numbers currently at work drop dramatically at 65 years of age.  While 77.2 per cent of people aged 45-54 years are in employment, this drops to 64.3 per cent for 55-64 year-olds and to just 8.7 per cent  for people aged 65 years or older.   It is clear, therefore, that the challenges facing the Irish pension system are significant.   Increases in life expectancy mean that more people are living to pension age and living longer in retirement.  While this is to be welcomed, this has obvious and significant implications in relation to the future costs of State pension provision.   The fundamental principle that people need to participate in the workforce for longer needs to be emphasised and they need to contribute more towards their pensions if they are to achieve the income they expect or would like to have in retirement.People who have retired before State pension age may be entitled to apply for another social welfare payment, as is the current position.

The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008 provided for the transfer of responsibility for MABS to the Citizens Information Board (CIB), under the aegis of my Department, in July 2009 in order to provide strong management support to the local voluntary MABS companies.The future role of MABS is currently under consideration in line with commitments in the Programme for Government and recommendations contained in the reports of the Law Reform Commission on Personal Debt Management and Debt Enforcement, and the Expert Group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt.  In addition, my Department is contributing to the Economic Management Council mortgage arrears working group, chaired by the Department of Finance, which is due to report shortly.  Further to the outcomes of these deliberations, the introduction or amendment of legislation in respect of MABS will be examined, as necessary, to support any enhanced role which may emerge.I am satisfied that MABS will continue to provide a high quality personal service to assist people in overcoming their indebtedness and managing their finances.

Participants are released from their CE work for nine hours per week over the thirty week duration of the initiative.  The initiative aims to provide help for participants to achieve significant improvement in their reading and writing skills, to further enhance their opportunities in seeking employment and/or pursuing further education and training opportunities.  I am advised by FÁS that the same level of funding is available to participants as in previous years.  Nearly €11 million has been allocated by FÁS to support training for CE participants in 2011.As a result changes to the method of procurement and contracting, FÁS no longer arranges training on behalf of CE projects.  CE sponsors now contract for all training for participants in line with the requirements of the Qualification (Education & Training) Act 1999 and best practice in obtaining value for money.

This is based on implementation of the measure from the beginning of July 2011.  The 2012 reduction in income to the Fund is estimated to be €190m.  It is not possible to estimate the number of jobs directly attributable to this measure as the cost of employment is only one of the factors affecting job creation, albeit an important one.

These matters are for the Board of the company to manage.The Department of Social Protection was informed that MFG has decided to cease trading with effect of 7 September 2011.  MFG holds contracts with Pobal, on behalf of this Department, to manage and fund three services under the Community Services Programme.  The decision of MFG to cease trading has implications for the staff employed and for the communities in Gaeltacht areas benefiting from these services.My understanding is that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Pobal are working with representatives of the MFG Board and management to resolve a range of financial, legal and employment issues.  As the contract holder for the Community Services Programme, it is open to the MFG Board to propose alternative arrangements for the delivery of services.  This Department will work constructively with the MFG Board to find workable resolution in support of the staff members and communities affected.

Application for carer's allowance includes a declaration by the applicant that the information they are providing is true and accurate and that they will inform the department should there be any change in circumstances.  Additionally, the care recipient must sign a statutory declaration to state that the person who is applying is providing them with the full time care and attention that they require.Furthermore, if there is another person who claims to have been providing full time care and attention to a care recipient in respect of whom another person was receiving carer's allowance, it is open to that person to submit their own application for carer's allowance, providing full details of the circumstances.

Self-employed customers do not have to de-register as self-employed persons in order to claim Jobseeker's Allowance.Legislation provides for the assessment of ‘all income in cash and any non-cash benefits which the person or his or her spouse may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year'.  The means assessment guidelines state that where the income in the coming 12 months is not ascertainable otherwise, the income for the last 12 months should be taken as a guide, allowing for any factors which it is known will vary.If the means of the family are equal to or in excess of the family rate payable on jobseeker's allowance then the claim is disallowed.If a self-employed person's situation changes after they have made an initial claim for Jobseeker's Allowance, they can apply to have their means reviewed in the light of their changed circumstances.  In addition it is open to the individual if he or she is dissatisfied with the means assessed to appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.My Department has a wide ranging programme to combat social welfare fraud and abuse.  A new strategic fraud initiative was launched by me earlier this month.  This initiative takes a revised and renewed approach to the challenges posed by social welfare fraud.  The ambition is to ensure that the public have confidence and trust in this Government's response to combating fraud and abuse in the social welfare system.  It is designed to ensure a targeted response to high risk sectors and to ensure an integrated approach to the prevention, deterrence and detection of social welfare abuse across the Department's services.The emphasis of the Department's control activities is on direct intervention and engagement.  High visibility operations by the Departments' Special Investigation Unit (SIU) are regularly and systematically undertaken.  The effectiveness and cost-benefit of these operations and projects are continuously analysed and operational experience critically informs whether to continue, escalate, or terminate the specific projects.  New control projects will be developed and introduced, where appropriate.  In the context of self employed trades people who may be engaged in social welfare fraud specific activities being undertaken in the context of this plan include:The active policing of the hidden economy sector where there is a prevalence of social welfare and abuse.  Investigations are undertaken through Joint Investigation Units with the Office of the Revenue Commissioners.Where intelligence or reliable reports are received about persons engaged in concurrent working and claiming or under declaration of income, reviews of eligibility are immediately undertaken.A series of high visibility site visits and employer inspections are systematically conducted to detect incidences of social welfare fraud.  These visits and inspections are undertaken in those sectors where the risk of fraud is most prevalent.Multi agency checkpoints are undertaken with the Garda Traffic Unit and Revenue.  Persons driving commercially taxed vehicles are interviewed as part of these projects.A number of high visibility operations are being jointly conducted by SIU and local authority environmental officers to identify environmental offences and simultaneously detect incidences of social welfare fraud.Reviews of persons employed on a casual basis and claiming jobseeker's payment are being undertaken.  These are aimed at ensuring persons are not engaged in any incorrect certification or claiming of social welfare payments.The Department has not at this juncture undertaken specific analysis of persons driving commercial vehicles.

I understand that given the similar aims of JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, IBEC decided to close the Gradlink programme.However, in advance of the launch of JobBridge, IBEC participated in a Stakeholders Group which advised my Department on the design of the JobBridge scheme.  On foot of their experience with Gradlink, IBEC was able to provide an important and valuable input into this process.In addition, individuals participating in Gradlink were facilitated to transfer their work placement into an internship under the JobBridge scheme provided that both they and their host organisation met the eligibility criteria of JobBridge.JobBridge is available to all individuals, on the Live Register who have been signing on for at least 3 out of the last 6 months, including graduates.  It should also be noted that the JobBridge eligibility criteria is the same as that used for participants on Gradlink who wished to retain their social welfare entitlements.Very recent graduates who may not currently meet the eligibility criteria of JobBridge should, if they wish to qualify for the scheme, sign on to the Live Register.

However, EU regulations on the coordination of social security systems, and Directive 2003/41/EC on the activities and supervision of institutions for occupational retirement provision (IORP Directive) are applied by both countries.In relation to social welfare pensions, these are governed by EU Regulations 883/04 and 987/09.  The Regulations co-ordinate social security systems and are designed to ensure that people are not disadvantaged by moving within the EU to take up work.  These arrangements also extend to EEA countries and Switzerland.The Regulations set out the rules as to which State's social security system a person will pay contributions to when they move from one Member State to another to take up work, or where they live in one State and work in another.  In addition, the legislation also sets out the rules as to which State will pay benefit in the event of the usual contingencies arising, e.g. unemployment, sickness, old-age etc.  In relation to pensions, contributions made in both countries are aggregated for the purposes of determining eligibility and payments made by each country are determined by amount of contributions made in each.Article 20 of the IORPs Directive allows pension schemes to operate ‘cross-border'.  This means that a pension scheme can be established in one EU Member State which provides benefits to employees working in one or more other Member States.  Part XII of the Pensions Act provides for the transposition of Article 20 of this Directive.  The key provisions of this legislation are that the pension scheme must be registered with a competent authority (Pensions Board) and must fulfil a number of minimum conditions, such as being run by people of good repute who have appropriate qualifications and having properly constituted rules.  The Pension Act also provides that member protection provisions of the Pensions Act are to be applied to Irish-based members of overseas schemes and these include requirements in relation to the preservation of benefits and the jurisdiction of the Pensions Ombudsman.

From 1 June 2009, he was paid the standard CE participant rate with no child dependent allowance as confirmed by the Department.  On 12 July 2011, FÁS received confirmation that the participant was entitled to a child dependent payment of half rate at €14.90 per week.  This rate was paid by FÁS from 14 July 2011.Where there is an entitlement to a back-payment, my Department will provide the necessary confirmation to enable reimbursement.

The notification includes the application form for jobseeker's allowance and issues 10 weeks prior to their expected last day of entitlement to jobseeker's benefit.  A reminder issues 6 weeks later if no correspondence has been received back from the customer.There are certain categories which are excluded from the automated process for operational reasons, such as casual workers, as it is not possible to predict the exact date on which their benefit will run out.  These claimants are contacted through a manual process before their jobseeker's benefit expires.

The scheme is limited to individuals who are currently on the Live Register and have been in receipt of Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit or are signing on for credits for at least 3 of the last 6 months.The overall objective of labour market policy is to ensure a pathway to appropriate employment, training and education opportunities for those on the Live Register so that as employment opportunities become available they are taken up by those on the Live Register.Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, it is imperative to keep those on the Live Register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that those availing of activation measures such as the National Internship Scheme will gain work experience and so be in a better position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, the eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the Live Register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 3 months.  In so designing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the Live Register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in Exchequer costs over time.In the particular case highlighted by the Deputy such an individual may avail of the FÁS Work Placement Programme, which provides individuals with the opportunity to gain work experience.  An individual may qualify for the Work Placement Programme immediately if they do not wish to receive a social welfare payment from the State.  Further information on the Work Placement Programme is available on the FÁS website.

Current indications are that, while there now appears to be a slight drop in the number of appeals being received in 2011, the annual intake is still likely to be close to 30,000 for the year.In an effort to reduce the backlog of appeals, the Department made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.  These assignments augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.Some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced Appeals Officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.  This project commenced on July 1st.In addition to these measures, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.  As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 42% for the first 6 months of 2010 to just over 30% for the same period in 2011.As a result of the various initiatives taken, 22,226 decisions were made by Appeals Officers in the first eight months of 2011, in comparison to 17,184 for the same period in 2010.Overall, it is expected that the increase in the number of decisions being made by Appeals Officers will continue and this, combined with the slight reduction in the numbers received should lead to on-going reductions in the backlog of appeals.

Those who qualify are normally in receipt of a social welfare or HSE payment.The principal consideration in making a single payment of SWA to address a particular need is that the need to be met must be ‘exceptional'.  Payments should arise only under abnormal conditions and should not become a regular or standard practice.  Thus, an exceptional needs payment should be a single payment to meet an unforeseen and/or special need which cannot be met from a client's basic income.  The use of ENPs and every such decision must be based on the careful consideration of all the circumstances of an individual case.However, it is not considered appropriate that ENPs should be paid towards the costs of furnishing private rented accommodation.  In this regard, my Department has advised the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government that local authorities should not seek to have long term leased properties furnished by way of ENPs.

This is achieved by breaking the cycle of unemployment, opening up training and educational opportunities, providing work experience and work routines and utilising the skills sets.Operationally, community employment has two options with different eligibility rules and conditions.  The part-time integration option is designed to help participants find a job or enter full time training or education normally after one year on community employment.  In certain circumstances, an extension of one year can be granted under this option.  A person who is aged 35 or over and is claiming a jobseeker's payment for three years or more can qualify for the part-time job option.  With this option, a person can work up for up to three years in recognition of the need to provide access to a part-time job for extended periods for persons in this eligibility category.  Persons in receipt of any disability-linked Social Protection payments may be eligible for one additional year's participation.  Lifetime participation on CE is capped at three years for those aged under 55 years and six years for those aged 55 years and over.  The criteria for the consideration of extensions has not changed and my Department is not considering any proposals at this time.As with all programmes and schemes, community employment will be considered in the context of the Comprehensive Expenditure Review which is currently being finalised and may be affected by decisions made by the Government in its determination of the conclusion of that review.

As Minister, I do not have a role in respect of any administrative matter relating to community employment.I have been informed that FÁS does not collect or hold information on the number of community employment participants applying for extensions of their work placement on community employment.  Neither is information collected or held on the number of participants approved or refused extensions.  FÁS holds records on how long a person participates on community employment and other information in respect of a person's progression to training, further education or work.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	777	The Department of Social Protection supports operates a range of employment support measures designed to encourage and support social welfare recipients of working age to reduce their dependency on welfare payments.  Supports available include the back to education programmes and back to work schemes.In addition, a fully integrated nationwide range of services and supports is available to employers and jobseekers through FÁS Employment Services, responsibility for which has been transferred to this Department.The National Employment Action Plan (NEAP) process is a key element in addressing the progression needs of those on the live register.  It provides an opportunity to explore and access, under professional guidance, a full range of employment and training services.  Development of the NEAP is central to ongoing development in the labour market policy area and will be progressed within the framework of a new National Employment and Entitlements Service which, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is being established by the Department.  The new service will integrate employment and benefit payment services, currently delivered by FÁS and the Department, respectively,  within the Department and will be based on a case management approach with the objective of providing a more customised and personal service to customers.In line with good international practice, this new service will focus primarily on activation.  The objective is to encourage and enable customers to embark on developmental pathways appropriate to their needs; pathways to employment and/or training and/or personal development.  The objective of the new service is to offer users a high level, personalised employment support and prioritise the provision of more intensive support for those on the live register who are identified as being most at risk of long-term unemployment.  A key feature of the new service will be that customers will be expected to engage with these options in order to retain their entitlement to full benefit payments.A number of projects are ongoing in relation to the development of case management, the identification of those who are most at risk of falling into long-term unemployment, and the provision of appropriately tailored responses to their needs.  These projects will evaluated in the coming months after which approaches will be developed for their rollout nationwide as part of the national employment and entitlements service.These developments are complemented by measures announced recently by the Government under the Jobs Initiative and include initiatives such as JobBridge, the National Internship Scheme, which will provide 5,000 internship opportunities of 6 or 9 months in organisations in the private, public or community and voluntary sectors. In addition, from July 2, the rate of employers PRSI on jobs paying up to €356 per week has been halved to 4.25%, up to end 2013.All of the measures outlined above will support people who are unemployed in acquiring the education and skills and work experience that will assist them in returning to employment while measures such as the PRSI reduction will encourage employers to new employment.

In addition, to date 1,430 interns have commenced an internship under the JobBridge scheme.  Of these, 599 individuals have converted their Work Placement Programme placement into a JobBridge internship.In relation to the cost of the JobBridge scheme it changes on a daily basis as the number of people participating in the scheme increases.  However as of the 23rd September the additional cost of the €50 weekly top-up for the 1,430 participants on the JobBridge equates to a weekly cost of €71,500.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	779	I propose to take Questions Nos. 275 to 277, inclusive, together.The back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme is a second chance education opportunities scheme designed to remove the barriers to participation in second and third level education by enabling eligible people on social welfare to continue to receive a payment while pursuing an approved full-time education course that leads to a higher qualification than that already held.A person wishing to pursue back to education allowance (BTEA) scheme will have to satisfy a number of conditions such as being a certain age, in receipt of a prescribed social welfare payment for a specified time period, pursuing a full time course of study leading to a recognised qualification in a recognised college and progressing in the level of education held by the client with reference to the national framework of qualifications among others.The BTEA scheme covers a large range of full-time courses of education in approved colleges spanning basic foundation courses to third level courses across all disciplines.  The BTEA guidelines are in the main in line with the mechanisms in place for student support type schemes administered by the Department of Education and Skills (DES).The student grant scheme administered by DES includes provision for grants to eligible students pursuing certain full-time undergraduate courses of at least two years duration in other EU member states provided they satisfy the terms and conditions of the grant scheme including those relating to residency, means, nationality and previous academic attainment. Eligible full-time day undergraduate courses in other EU member states which are recognised by the DES for student grant purposes may be considered for the BTEA.The student grant scheme does not extend to postgraduate study outside of the island of Ireland; this is also the position with regard to the BTEA and is outlined in the scheme guidelines. However it should be noted that Section 473A, Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, as amended by Section 11 of the Finance Act 2011, provides for tax relief, at the standard rate of tax, for tuition fees paid in respect of approved courses at approved colleges of higher education including certain approved undergraduate and postgraduate courses in E.U. Member States.My Department is not aware of a scheme similar to BTEA available to Irish students studying in other EU states and paid for by the Government of that member state. Member states offer a multiplicity of supports and interventions that are administered and funded by various bodies which are often particular to the varying governmental structures and imperatives of  member states.The BTEA, in conjunction with other employment support schemes, will be monitored on an ongoing basis to ensure that it continues to meet its objectives.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	786	The purpose of rent supplement is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.Under the legislative provisions governing rent supplement, the Department's relationship is with the tenant; the tenant makes the application for rent supplement and payment is made to the tenant.  Rent supplement is specifically for the benefit of tenants to assist them with their accommodation needs.  There is no direct relationship between the landlord and the Department in the administration of the scheme.Current legislation already provides for the making of a rent supplement payment to another person (e.g. a relative, a landlord or landlord's agent) on behalf of the recipient, at the tenant's request and is subject to the consent of the HSE.  Approximately 20% of rent supplement payments are currently paid to a person other than the tenant.It is open to the landlord to bring to the attention of the HSE any instance where a tenant is receiving rent supplement but is not paying their rent.  Where a Community Welfare Officer becomes aware that a person receiving rent supplement is not using that supplement to meet housing costs, payment of the supplement is suspended and the matter is investigated.  Any overpayment of rent supplement incurred in circumstances of this kind may be recoverable from the tenant.Where a landlord has a grievance in relation to the non-payment of rent by a tenant, s/he may apply to the Private Residential Tenancies Board to have the dispute resolved through the Board's dispute resolution process.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	788	The Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance (BSCFA) scheme operates from the beginning of June until the end of September each year.The administrative arrangements for the 2011 BSCFA scheme differ from those that applied in previous years.  For this year, the majority of BSCFA entitlements were fully automated with no application form required from customers.  127,000 households in respect of over 250,000 children received their payment automatically in June.Those customers who did not receive an automated payment are required to complete and return an application form to the Department.  The timescale for determining applications for Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance claims is dependent on a number of factors including: the number of applications received, when the application is lodged, the availability of the required information such as details of the applicant's income, bank statements and other relevant information regarding an individual's application.In addition, some aspects of the applications are inevitably time consuming and delays can occur where further investigations or third party evidence is required.  Delays can also arise if the applicant is slow to respond to requests for additional information.  Staff are working as quickly as possible on clearing the large volume of manual application claims received.  Based on the current volume of applications it could take up to 7 weeks from date of receipt to process claims.  Departmental records show that an application form was received from the person concerned on 13th September 2011 and she will be notified of the outcome of her claim when an assessment of her entitlements are made.

Such persons will have their eligibility for benefits assessed under our domestic legislation.  A decision to award or reject any claim for benefits depends on the circumstances of the individual concerned and the qualifying conditions for the scheme under which the benefit is claimed.

On completion of the necessary investigations relating to all aspects of her claim a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome.The average time to award a claim for carer's allowance is currently 17 weeks.  Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on satisfying medical, means and residency conditions.  In determining entitlement to the allowance there are, in certain cases, unavoidable time lags involved in making the necessary investigations and inquiries to enable accurate decisions to be made.  Delays can also arise if people applying for the allowance are not in a position to supply all the necessary information in support of their claim.

A multiplier of 3.333333 (i.e. 6 decimal places) is used to calculate 3 and one third times CSP.  The maximum number of years of reckonable service is 40.  The CSP rate is the maximum CSP payable by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to a single person without dependants on the last day of the officer's pensionable service.Retirement Lump Sum Calculation:Retirement lump sum is 3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1.5 times pensionable remuneration.Emoluments payable to officers on their retirement are dealt with as follows:Pensionable Emoluments Emoluments are benefits in cash or in kind which are additional to basic salary. Pensionable emoluments are the average annual amount of an officer's emoluments.  The pensionable allowances are the best three consecutive years in the last ten.Generally speaking, pensionable emoluments are:(a) allowances for the performance of work done (e.g. higher duties allowance, Private Secretaries' allowance);(b) allowances for the conditions under which work is done (e.g. shift premia, unsocial hours allowances);(c) in certain exceptional cases, specifically approved by the Department of Finance, payments for compulsory, regular and rostered extra attendance which forms an inherent part of the conditions of service for certain posts and where such attendance is considered to be the most effective and economical means of carrying out the work involved;(d) the value (as determined by the Department of Finance) of certain perquisites provided free as part of an officer's conditions of employment (e.g. house, quarters, fuel and light, board and lodgings, uniforms).

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	794	In order to satisfy the medical conditions for receipt of disability allowance a person must be suffering from an injury, disease, congenital deformity or physical or mental illness or defect which has continued or may reasonably be expected to continue for a period of at least a year and as a result of the condition the person is substantially restricted in undertaking work which would otherwise be suitable having regard to the person's age, experience and qualifications.  When conducting an assessment, the medical assessor does not dispute the existence of the certified cause of incapacity but rather s/he assesses the duration of the illness and the degree to which the loss of function in work-related activities, resulting from the disease or injury, affects the person's ability to perform either their own job or alternative types of work.In this case the person concerned applied for disability allowance on 4 February 2011.  Her claim was referred to one of the department's medical assessors who was of the opinion, based on the information furnished by the person's doctor on the application form, that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and the claim was refused and the person was notified in writing of this decision on 9 May 2011.  Further medical evidence was received and referred to a medical assessor who again expressed the opinion that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  Accordingly, the original decision to refuse the claim was confirmed by the deciding officer and the person was notified in writing of this on 23 August 2011.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	795	I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the number of appeals waiting to be processed at present is 17,992 (a reduction of some 2,809 (since September 2010), of which 3,128 refer to disability allowance.  These figures must be seen against a background where there has been a very significant increase in the number of appeals received in the Social Welfare Appeals Office since 2007 when the intake was 14,070 to 32,432 in 2010.  Current indications are that, while there now appears to be a slight drop in the number of appeals being received in 2011, the annual intake is still likely to be close to 30,000 for the year.In an effort to reduce the backlog of appeals, the Department made 9 additional appointments to the office earlier this year.  These assignments augment the 3 appointments made to the Office in 2010, bringing the total number of Appeals Officers serving in the office to 29.  Some 3,000 cases, registered prior to 31/12/10, have been ring fenced and a team of 10 of the Office's most experienced Appeals Officers have been freed from all other work in the Office and will concentrate on clearing this backlog.   This project commenced on July 1st.In addition to these measures, more emphasis is now placed on dealing with appeals on a summary basis so as to increase productivity.  As a result, the number of appeals dealt with by way of oral hearing was reduced from 42% for the first 6 months of 2010 to just over 30% for the same period in 2011.   As a result of the various initiatives taken, 22,226 decisions were made by Appeals Officers in the first eight months of 2011, in comparison to 17,184 for the same period in 2010.  Overall, it is expected that the increase in the number of decisions being made by Appeals Officers will continue and this, combined with the slight reduction in the numbers received should lead to on-going reductions in the backlog of appeals.The Deputy asks about two cases as an addendum to his question; one case received on 18 January 2011 is listed for an oral hearing since 6 August 2011 and there is no appeal registered for the other.  In relation to the first person mentioned in your Parliamentary Question, following a review of his continued entitlement to disability allowance, his payment was stopped as he was deemed to be no longer medically suitable for disability allowance. He subsequently appealed this decision to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.In relation to the second person mentioned in your Parliamentary Question, this lady applied for disability allowance on 4 February 2011.  Her claim was referred to one of the department's medical assessors who was of the opinion that the person was not medically suitable for disability allowance.  The deciding officer accepted this opinion and her claim was refused and the person was notified in writing of this decision on 15 July 2011.  Further medical evidence has now been received in this case and has been referred to one of the department's medical assessors for their opinion. The person concerned will be notified shortly of the outcome of the review.

Flood relief works were also undertaken in some of the affected areas and other works are at an advanced state of preparation. Discussions also took place with representatives of the insurance industry regarding giving households access to appropriate house insurance at a reasonable cost.Subject to certain conditions the Government also decided to provide support to a small number of families who are continuing to experience significant housing problems as a result of the November 2009 flooding and are considering the possibility of relocating rather than resuming living at their original home.  The household of the person concerned and all of the other households have been visited by officials from the Department and reports of their individual circumstances have been completed.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	801	A general review of the provisions of the Civil Registration Act, 2004 is on-going and is expected to be completed later this year.  Usually, when an Irish citizen dies abroad, the death is registered by the civil authorities of the place where the death occurred, and a certified copy of the death registration is obtainable. This certificate, translated if necessary, is normally sufficient for all legal and administrative purposes here and for these reasons alone there is no necessity for the death to be registered in the State.Any broadening of the current provisions will require careful consideration. It will be appreciated that the number of people who live and die in other countries and who have or are entitled to have Irish citizenship is very large. This would have implications both for the registration process itself and for the vital statistics relating to deaths which are derived from registered events.A death certificate is readily available in the overwhelming majority of these cases. However, I do appreciate that many families of the deceased feel strongly that by registration of the death, the person's death is given recognition in his/her own country and also that this fact would assist during a period of considerable grief.  My Department will therefore have this matter reviewed in the context of future amendments to the Civil Registration Act, 2004.

As part of this Act, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is a statutory consultee on any proposed development that may have an impact on the built or natural heritage.  However, final decisions on development applications are a matter for the relevant planning authority or An Bord Pleanála on appeal.In November 2006, under the 2000 Act, Castleblayney Town Council referred a planning application for works at the courthouse building to my Department.  In January 2007 the Town Council granted permission for the proposed works with a number of conditions.  It appears that Monaghan County Council has yet to commence works on foot of the permission granted.Castleblayney Courthouse is included on the Record of Protected Structures provided for under the Act and is owned by Monaghan County Council but is located in the area under the planning remit of Castleblayney Town Council.  Accordingly both Councils as owner and planning authority have responsibilities for the protection of the building.  I understand that an application for funding for Castleblayney Courthouse was submitted to the Heritage Council by Monaghan County Council under the Heritage Managements Grants Scheme in 2011, but was not successful.  The Heritage Council will shortly be accepting applications under the Heritage Management Grants Scheme for 2012.

While I understand that a number of other staff have made preliminary enquiries about retirement, my Department does not maintain records of such cases. As the Deputy will appreciate, enquiries of that nature may not necessarily result in retirements taking place during the period in question.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I can assure the Deputy that there are no proposals to remove the protection of the National Monuments Acts from any category of monument.  My Department's National Monuments Service is reviewing the policy for including monuments in the Record of Monuments and Places (RMP) because the current RMP, drawn up more than 10 years ago, is not consistent across all counties, where post-1700 AD monuments are concerned.The objective of this current review is to bring about greater consistency across the board. This is only one element of a wider strategy to improve the management, protection, presentation and appreciation of Ireland's unique archaeological heritage. We are working to provide high quality, accurate and accessible information through our dedicated website www.archaeology.ie. A comprehensive new Monuments Bill is also being drafted to consolidate, modernise and improve the legislative code for the protection and regulation of our archaeological heritage.  In addition, we are developing detailed guidance on archaeological best practice and procedure based on comprehensive recommendations from an expert review group that has been engaged in an intensive examination of practice over a number of years.There are obviously issues that will arise as to how, and under which legislation, certain structures should be best protected. There is no question, however, of the current Record of Monuments and Places being revised until we have completed the review. When draft policy and criteria for updating the RMP have been developed, the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will consult with interested parties before any decisions are made.

The breakdown of staff in my Department at the grades described by the Deputy is set out below:GradeHEO, AO and equivalent Professional & Technical Grades:153APO and equivalent Professional & Technical Grades:89PO and equivalent Professional & Technical Grades:17Director:2Assistant Secretary:3Secretary General:1Individual salaries are in accordance with the appropriate point of the relevant pay scale for each staff member, depending on whether they joined the Civil Service before or after 5 April 1995.  Under the terms of the Civil Service Superannuation Schemes, retiring staff are entitled to a lump sum payment and a retirement pension which is based on their length of service and final pensionable remuneration. Further details regarding retirement benefits for civil servants are available at www.cspensions.gov.ie.
Retiring staff receive a retirement lump sum of  3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1½ times pensionable remuneration.  In general, staff who were recruited prior to April 1995 and pay the modified rate of PRSI receive a pension of 1/80th of pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.   Staff who were recruited after April 1995, receive a pension which is integrated with the State Pension (Contributory). The formula for the calculation of the pension is 1/200th of pensionable remuneration up to 31/3rd times the State Pension, and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit, per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.TLAC retirement terms may be applied to retiring Secretaries General, subject to certain conditions.  I understand that those terms are currently under review for future appointees.

As required under the Act, it sets out my Department's proposed strategies, outputs and objectives in its key policy areas for the next three years.  The draft Strategy Statement was prepared following a publicly advertised consultation process, as well as consultation with other Government Departments, key stakeholders and customers.  The Statement of Strategy will be published on my Department's website in due course, following its approval.

I held a full day seminar on 7th  September with representatives from a wide range of organisations with an interest in genealogy matters. A representative from the Family History Centres in each county was invited, the majority of which attended on the day. Each organisation which attended was given an opportunity to make a presentation that outlined their views on the issue of digitising genealogical records and maximising the potential of roots tourism. This involved some 30 presentations being made over the course of the day.  I am still considering the views of the various organisations on this important issue.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	808	The Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme was introduced in 2010 in order to deliver on the mandatory EU target of 10% renewable energy in transport by 2020.  This scheme requires suppliers of road transport fuels to include a certain percentage of biofuel across their general fuel mix.  This percentage is currently set at 4 per cent.  Since the biofuels obligation came in to force on 1 July 2010, industry figures show that the obligation level has been met and slightly exceeded by industry, across all retail petrol outlets.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I propose to take Questions Nos. 311, 312 and 329 together.I can inform the Deputy that my Department has not received applications for, nor licensed the use of exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing in the Irish onshore and accordingly the monitoring of this activity does not arise at this time.  Earlier this year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous Basin and the Clare Basin.  The Licensing Options are designed to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data from previous exploration activity.  This work is largely office/desktop based and does not involve exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing.By the end of the Option period in February 2013, the companies will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licence or relinquish the acreage.  I have made it clear that in the event any of the companies involved decide to apply for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing, the application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.  The application would then be the subject of an environmental impact assessment which would include a public consultation phase.The environmental impact assessment would be broad and consider a range of potential impacts including an assessment of the potential visual impact of the proposed works on the landscape.  My Department would also consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the Environmental Protection Authority, the National Parks and Wildlife Service and local authorities before reaching any decision.  In the event of a commercial discovery, the principal authorisations required from my Department for a gas production project would be a Petroleum Lease and approval of a Plan of Development.  The Plan of Development would set out the basis for the project and the rationale for the selection of the appropriate development option.The Plan of Development would also be subject to an Environmental Impact Assessment, including a public consultation phase.  A future petroleum production project would also likely involve consents from other statutory authorities including the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Environmental Protection Agency and the planning authorities. This consent framework provides for a comprehensive assessment of such a project.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	810	The Application Phase of the Rural Broadband Scheme closed on 29 July 2011.  Almost 5,000 applications have been received.  My Department is currently processing approximately 1,200 of these applications where address details need to be clarified — this is a time consuming exercise but the aim is to clear these applications over the coming weeks.The next step in the scheme is the Verification Phase, in which the Department will give internet service providers the opportunity to serve the applicants under normal commercial terms.  Subject to agreement with the companies concerned, the Verification Phase should be carried out over the period October-January 2012.  We would expect that some of the applicants under the Scheme will be offered a service by these companies during this phase.The procurement process is expected to commence in parallel to select a service provider to offer a service to remaining applicants once the Verification Phase has been completed.  My Department expects to identify the preferred supplier by the end of January 2012 and pending contract negotiations a service provider will be appointed by mid-February 2012.  Roll out of the service under the Scheme is expected to be completed by the end of 2012.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	811	I can inform the Deputy that no company currently holds an exploration authorisation that permits exploration drilling onshore, including exploration drilling that would involve hydraulic fracturing.In February of this year, my Department granted onshore Licensing Options to three companies over parts of the North West Carboniferous (Lough Allen) and Clare Basins.  The Licensing Options are for a two year period from March 2011 to the end of February 2013.The Licensing Options are preliminary authorisations and are different to exploration licences.  The purpose of these authorisations is to allow the companies assess the natural gas potential of the acreage largely based on studies of existing data from previous petroleum exploration activity.  This work is mainly office/desktop based and does not involve exploration drilling or hydraulic fracturing.By the end of the Option period in February 2013, the companies will have to decide whether to apply for a follow-on exploration licences or relinquish their acreage.  In the event that any of the companies involved decide to apply for an exploration licence that proposed the use of hydraulic fracturing, the application would have to be set out in detail and be supported by an environmental impact statement.My Department would then undertake a full assessment of the application, including an environmental impact assessment with a public consultation phase.  My Department would also consult with other relevant statutory authorities such as the EPA, NPWS, Local Authorities in reaching any decision.Work under these Licensing Options is at an early stage and it is too soon to conclude whether or not these authorisations will proceed to the exploration licence stage let alone to anticipate a petroleum project that would require planning permission.  I am aware of environmental concerns relating to hydraulic fracturing and have made clear that any future application proposing the use of this technology will be subject to an environmental impact assessment before any decision is made.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	812	The renewable energy feed in tariff scheme known as REFIT is a scheme to support new renewable generation.State Aid applications have been submitted to the European Commission to continue to offer REFIT for existing renewable energy categories and to extend the scheme to cover additional biomass categories.  It is intended that REFIT will be available for up to 310MW of new generation in the biomass categories including biomass CHP and Anaerobic Digestion, which is intended to stimulate renewable generation in that sector.State Aid approval for up to 4000MW in the onshore wind, hydro and landfill gas categories is being sought.  This amount is sufficient to cover new Gate 3 renewable generation projects which are necessary for the achievement of Ireland's legally binding renewable energy target.My Department will advise the renewable energy sectors of the terms and conditions approved by the Commission for the REFIT schemes as soon as the State Aid application is approved.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	813	The only function I have in regard to biofuels relates to the Statutory Biofuel Obligation Scheme.  The biofuel obligation applies to fuel for road transport only and does not apply to diesel used for "off-road" motor vehicles such as those used in the agricultural sector.  Issues relating to fuel quality in the context of minimising our pollution emissions are a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.The National biofuel obligation level is currently set at 4 per cent on average for road transport fuel.  This level is set to ensure that the fuel is fully compliant with the European EN590 standard for diesel and the European standard EN228 for petrol.  These fuel standards are accepted by all makes and models of on-road vehicles.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	814	I propose to take Questions Nos. 317 and 318 together.As the Deputy will be aware, the Broadcasting Act 2009 places specific news and current affairs requirements on sound broadcasters.  The Act requires all broadcasters to devote at least 20% of the broadcast day to news and current affairs programming.  There are also additional requirements relating to the provision of such programming in peak time.  The statutory News and Current Affairs requirements make an important contribution to the achievement of diversity and plurality for Irish audiences.No amendment to the Broadcasting Act 2009 of the type suggested by the Deputy is required as the Act permits the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to agree to a derogation from these requirements, whereby the broadcaster can provide less news and current affairs content than that required by the Act.  In doing so, the BAI must have regard to the interests of the audience. In light of the flexibility that this approach provides for the commercial broadcasters, I do not believe that the legislation puts them at any disadvantage in comparison to RTÉ in this regard.  Finally the Deputy should be aware that the BAI recently published their draft Broadcasting Services Strategy (Consultation Document), which is available on the Authority's website www.bai.ie.  This consultation document suggests a more nuanced approach to considering derogations should be adopted by the Authority.  All interested parties were invited to submit views on the Broadcasting Services Strategy by the closing date of 23 September 2011.  These views will be taken into consideration by the Authority.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	815	One employee in my Department will be required to retire before 1 March 2012 upon reaching their compulsory retirement age of 65 while others may retire upon reaching their minimum retirement age of 60 years of age or on actuarially reduced pension terms if they are within ten years of minimum retirement age.  Since 11 July 2011, all staff in the civil service who intend to retire on or before 29 February 2012 are required to give 3 months notice of their date of retirement.  Accordingly, in advance of the cut-off date of 30 November 2011 and taking account of the many factors that might determine an employee's decision to retire or not, it is not possible to accurately reflect, at this juncture, the number of employees in the Department who will submit a formal notification of retirement.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	816	The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) launched the Greener Homes Scheme in March 2006 to support homeowners who wished to install renewable heating technology in their homes.  The technologies supported included Biomass, Heat Pumps and Solar Thermal systems.The scheme closed for applications in May 2011 when solar thermal technology transitioned across to Better Energy: Homes.  At that time, just over 29,500 applications for solar technology had been approved.  The total number of appeals received from home owners, since the inception of the Scheme in 2006 is 641, which represents less than 2% of applications processed.  Of these, 521 appeals were successful.Under Better Energy: Homes applications can be made online and, for eligible homes, approval is immediate with the homeowner having six months to complete the required work and submit payment documentation.  Grants are not paid in cases where the homeowner does not meet the terms and conditions of the scheme.A further 2,100 solar grant applications have been approved since the launch of Better Energy in May.  SEAI advises that it is not yet possible to identify how many applicants have been subsequently awarded a solar heating grant on appeal as the six month deadline for completion of works under the new arrangements has not yet expired.  If the Deputy has details of a specific case she wishes to raise, I would suggest that the details are forwarded to the SEAI.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	817	The provision of electronic communications services is, in the first instance, a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market, regulated by the independent regulator, the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).  Broadband services are provided by a number of private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis. In the case of one such intervention, namely the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), broadband services are available from "3", in all of the 1,028 Electoral Divisions (ED) designated to be covered under the Scheme.  This includes the area of Ballydesmond which is located in Williamstown ED.My Department and its external consultants actively monitor coverage within the NBS areas.  The NBS contract guarantees service levels and imposes a service credit regime on "3" with financial consequences in the event that minimum specification service levels are not met. Any NBS customer experiencing problems with the NBS service can contact 3's customer care centre 24 hours a day 7 days a week by phone at 1913 (free of charge).  Additionally, a team of field engineers has been established to address NBS specific maintenance issues at customer's premises. My Department has a role when customers have fully utilised the established complaints process.  It operates a dedicated NBS mailbox, which NBS customers can contact by email (nationalbroadbandscheme@nbs.ie) with any comments or complaints they may have about their NBS service.As regards future broadband initiatives, under the NewERA proposals in the Programme for Government, there is a commitment to co-invest with the private sector and commercial Semi State sector to provide Next Generation Broadband customer access to every home and business in the State.  In June of this year I convened the Next Generation Broadband Taskforce which I chair and which also comprises the Minister of State with responsibility for NewERA, Mr. Fergus O'Dowd, T.D., the CEOs of all of the major telecommunications companies currently operating in the Irish market and CEOs of some Internet Service Provider companies.  I expect that the Taskforce will help to identify the optimal policy to deliver wider customer access to high-speed broadband generally, including in areas in county Cork, and thereby assist in delivering on the commitment in the Programme for Government.

ComReg has advised me that the authorisation process does not distinguish between wireless equipment located on buildings and equipment located on telecommunications masts.  In addition, in the case of telecommunications masts, these may be shared by two or more authorised service providers.  ComReg is not in a position, therefore, to calculate the number of telecommunications masts in any region.  Additionally, where the construction of telecommunications masts requires planning permission, such matters are appropriate to the planning authorities.  I have no function in either of these processes.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	820	The provision of broadband services in schools is in general a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education & Skills.  I do, however, recognise the key role that high speed broadband services can play in achieving the objective of a knowledge society.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Education & Skills, has successfully implemented a pilot project of 100mbps high speed broadband to 78 second level schools.  I am currently engaged with the Minister for Education & Skills on how a phased roll-out of high speed broadband to all second level schools can be implemented.As the Deputy will appreciate, availability of resources is a key element in the delivery of this goal.  It is my objective that in the context of the forthcoming Budget, an agreed programme for a phased roll-out can be put in place.  The timescale for individual schools is of course dependent on such a programme being put in place.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	822	I propose to take Questions Nos. 326 and 327 together.The licensing of radio microphones is a matter for the Commission for Communications Regulation (Comreg).  I understand that there are currently 49 channels (channels 21 to 69) available for radio microphone use in Ireland in the 470-862 MHz band with the majority of assignments made in channel 69.  These channels are made available on a non-exclusive basis and are subject to sharing with existing broadcasting services in this band.At the International Telecommunication Union World Radiocommunication Conference in 2007 it was agreed that channels 61 to 69 would be made available for mobile services. Subsequently the European Commission in its Recommendation 2009/848/EC recommended that analogue terrestrial TV services switch off in 2012, and that the above channels should be used for electronic communications services. This switchover will facilitate the roll out of high speed mobile broadband to communities across Europe.  In complying with this Recommendation channel 69 will no longer therefore be available for radio microphone use.  As the Deputy may be aware Ireland's national digital switchover strategy provides for a move to all digital TV services by the end of 2012, with the existing services in the 800 MHz band (including channel 61-69) being switched off at that stage.I understand that radio microphone manufacturers and suppliers have been aware of the fact that channel 69 would no longer be available for wireless microphone use from the end of 2012.  In addition ComReg conducted a public consultation on this matter in April 2010.The consultation highlighted a number of issues including that in June 2009, the UK Communications Regulator (Ofcom) confirmed Channel 38 (606-614 MHz) as a replacement for Channel 69 (854-862 MHz). In light of the Ofcom decision, and noting that Ireland is a small and open economy and the potential for economies of scale of equipment manufacture and roaming of services, ComReg considered that spectrum for radio microphones should be aligned with spectrum available for radio microphones in larger European markets.Following consideration of responses received to its consultation, ComReg's view is that it would be appropriate to use a replacement channel aligned with the UK's channel for wireless microphones and it therefore announced in September 2010 that it would make Channel 38 available on an exclusive basis for radio microphone use in Ireland.I am advised that there will be no increase in the associated licence fees.   The current cost of a licence for the possession and use of programme making and special events equipment, including radio microphones, for an event is a €12 administration fee and €12 per piece of equipment.  This licence fee was established in 1986 and has remained unchanged since that time.  As the Deputy will be aware ComReg is obliged to recover its administrative costs for the management of such licensing schemes.  Comreg has no remit in relation to compensation and my Department has no funds for a compensation programme as suggested in the Deputy's question.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	824	The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is divided into 4 Axes. Axis 1 deals with competitiveness of the agricultural sector, Axis 2 aims to improve the countryside and environment and the objectives of Axis 3 are to support the diversification of the rural economy and improve the quality of life in rural areas. Axis 4 or the LEADER Axis provides support for the use of a "bottom up" approach to development which ensures that local people are involved in the decision making thereby facilitating sustainable development in a more inclusive way. In Ireland the LEADER approach is used to implement Axis 3 measures.Funding of €427m is available under Axis 3&4 of the RDP for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013. The programme provides support to start up enterprises in rural areas and in this context support for shared kitchen facilities could be provided under the Axis 3 measure for Business Creation and Development.However, the output of such facilities must be compliant with the EU regulations on support for the processing of agricultural products. Basic Agricultural products are listed in Annex 1 to the EC Treaty and are commonly called Annex 1 products. Under the main rural development regulation 1698/2005 support/grant aid for adding value to Annex 1 products is facilitated under Axis 1 of the programme.

The most important exemption under the Act is for principal private residences.  If a person owns a property other than one that they reside in as their principal private residence, then it may be liable for the charge.The Act defines "owner" at section 1 as "a person  . . . who . . . is entitled to receive the rent of the property, or where the property is not let, would be so entitled if it were so let".Where a property is willed or gifted to an individual and a right of residence is retained by the original owner or occupier, I have been advised that liability to pay the charge depends on whether the right of residence is exclusive.  If the right of residence is exclusive and the owner does not have an entitlement to seek or receive rent, he or she is not an "owner" within the meaning of the Act until that right ceases to affect the property.  In such a case, there would be no liability for the charge.

My Department has no role in relation to the provision of political oversight or in directing the business of Local Development Companies, which are private limited companies. My Department has a role in relation to the provision of guidance on corporate governance arrangements for those companies as well as in ensuring adherence to contractual funding agreements.   With regard to corporate governance, Guidelines on the Governance of Integrated Local Development Companies and Urban Based Partnerships were issued by the then Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, to all companies on 1 October 2007 (with an addendum to the guidelines issued in June 2009).  The guidelines were designed to assist the companies with the establishment of the company board structure (including the relevant sectors and pillars), and with the prescribed requirements of the Department to enable each Company to ensure eligibility for Departmental and European funding.  In addition, the guidelines provided a model Memorandum and Articles of Association, along with a model of Corporate Governance Policy which were adaptable to meet individual requirements. In accordance with commitments in the Programme for Government, the Department has commenced work on aligning local government and local development functions with a view to reducing the duplication of services, providing more efficient and cost effective services for the citizen, and ensuring greater democratic accountability in decision making at a local level.  All Local Development Companies, including those serving the Dublin City and greater Dublin areas, will form part of that process.

Current funding of €71 million is being provided this year to meet local authority loan repayments to the HFA and the payment of the annual management and maintenance subsidy to approved housing bodies in respect of projects completed under the CLSS.As the CLSS has been terminated, local authorities no longer accept applications for new projects. However, certain approved housing bodies may now borrow directly from the HFA for the purposes of providing additional housing units to meet the accommodation needs of persons on local authority housing waiting lists.Capital funding of up to 100% of the approved cost of projects will continue to be provided to approved housing bodies under my Department's Capital Assistance Scheme for the provision of accommodation for groups with specific categories of housing need such as older people, people with a physical, intellectual or a mental health disability, and homeless persons.

Article 22(2)(c) requests evidence of site suitability where it is proposed to dispose of wastewater other than into a public sewer.Where an application for permission is made to a planning authority consequent on the grant of outline permission, the planning authority cannot refuse to grant permission on the basis of any matter which had been decided in the grant of outline permission, provided that the authority is satisfied that the proposed development is within the terms of the outline permission.  However, an outline permission does not operate to authorise the carrying out of any development to which the outline permission relates until a subsequent permission has been granted.My Department will shortly be writing to all Planning Authorities to clarify that, where at outline stage an applicant has carried out a site suitability test which is in compliance with the EPA code of practice, there should be no requirement to carry out a further test at the consequent permission stage.

Implementation of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) new Code of Practice on Wastewater Treatment and Disposal Systems Serving Single Houses   which was published in October 2009 is a key measure in this regard.The Code of Practice sets out comprehensive requirements in relation to the design, installation and maintenance of on-site wastewater systems.  My Department issued a circular letter to planning authorities in January 2010 regarding implementation of the EPA's new Code of Practice.Elements of the Code of Practice relevant to building control have also been provided for in the recently published Technical Guidance Document to Part H (Drainage and Waste Water Disposal) of the Building Regulations as amended by the Building Regulations (Part H Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 561of 2010).In this regard, the EPA Code of Practice lays down the technical standards to comply with Ireland's duty of care under Article 4 of the Waste Directive, but in particular to ensure that the disposal of waste via wastewater systems for single dwellings does not give rise to public nuisance, health risk or damage to the  environment.While the Code of Practice may pose engineering and planning challenges in certain parts of the country where soil and geological conditions create very difficult drainage conditions, it also sets out a number of potential technical solutions.  These include innovative designs of proprietary wastewater treatment systems, and the consideration of discharges other than to sodden or otherwise unsuitable ground conditions, that can be used to ensure that development on suitable sites can proceed while protecting the environment.My Department will therefore continue to work proactively with local authorities in ensuring that the planning system takes proper account of river basin management plans, water quality legislation and new technology in assessing the on-site wastewater treatment and disposal system aspect of proposals for housing to meet the needs of rural communities.

There are no plans for any exemptions from the requirement for all owners of septic tanks and other on-site wastewater treatment systems to register their systems with the relevant local authority, and to operate and maintain them correctly. There will be a proportionate and risk-based approach to inspections and it is intended that inspections will be targeted to areas where drinking water sources or habitats are likely to be, or have been, impacted upon by septic tank discharges.

The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority.Under the legislation the person liable for payment of rates is the person in occupation of a rateable property on the date of the making of the rate by the relevant local authority. The owner rather than the occupier may be liable for commercial rates if the property in question is unoccupied on the date of the making of the rate. Should a person's occupancy commence after the date of the making of the rate then that person is not primarily liable for rates for that year.  However, as a subsequent occupier, that person can be held liable for up to two years arrears of rates if they cannot be recovered from the person with whom the primary liability lies.I recognise that these are difficult economic times for many businesses and my Department continues to keep all matters relating to commercial rates under regular review.

Having regard to the wider applicability of Article 3 of the EIA Directive to other consent systems provided for in Irish law, my Department, in consultation with other Departments, is currently in the process of identifying other EIA Directive-relevant legislative consent processes outside the planning system to ensure full and correct transposition of Article 3 in these codes.In respect of (2) above, building on the legislative amendments contained in the Planning and Development Regulations 2008, the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 2011 provide that the category of ‘works of demolition' now requires EIA.In respect of (3) above, my Department is currently examining options for secondary legislation which would prohibit an applicant from submitting a stand-alone environmental licence application to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in certain cases unless it is clearly established that mandatory or sub-threshold EIA is not required in respect of the proposed activity.  Alternatively, if EIA is necessary, the applicant would be required to submit a planning application and an Environmental Impact Statement simultaneously with, or in advance of, the environmental licence application.In the interim, for certain environmental licence applications on hand, an administratively based analysis of such cases is being carried out jointly by the EPA and An Bord Pleanála to identify any situations that would require assessment under the EIA Directive.Accordingly, I am satisfied that the implications for Ireland of the ECJ Judgement in Case C-50/09 are being properly and expeditiously dealt with so as to ensure full compliance with the EIA Directive.

These were revised in January 2010 in accordance with Government policy on pay.Section 147 of the Local Government Act, 2001 deals with the tenure of office of county and city managers. At present, a manager's tenure, at appointment, is for seven years with the possibility of a three year extension if he/she seeks such extension by way of notification to the council in the fifth year of tenure. The retirement age for managers is 65 years.The pension entitlements of city and county managers are provided for in article 78 of the Local Government (Superannuation) (Consolidation) Scheme 1998.A manager is entitled to a pension calculated at a rate of 1/80 of pensionable salary per year of service, capped at half of pensionable remuneration and a retirement lump sum calculated at a rate of 3/80 of pensionable salary per year of service, capped at 1½ times pensionable salary.Where a manager ceases to hold office before the age of 65, and is not re-employed in a local authority, he/she may, depending on his/her length of service, be entitled to added years of between 5 and 10 years. However, most managers tend to have long service records. The added years cannot bring a managers service beyond 40 years in total and cannot add years beyond the service he or she would have gained had they stayed in office to age 65.In cases where a manager's tenure expires before he/she reaches retirement age a severance payment of the lesser of half of his/her annual salary on the date of cesser of office or potential earnings had he/she remained in Office to 65 is payable.Where a manager extends his/her contract by the 3 years but does not serve the full extended period, the special added years and severance gratuity provided for under Article 78 are not applicable.The provisions of Article 78 only apply to managers; however, certain other local authority grades may have an entitlement to added years under Article 66 of the Local Government (Superannuation) (Consolidation) Scheme 1998.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	854	I propose to take Questions Nos. 362 and 363 together.Our current reliance on landfill as the primary waste treatment method is unsustainable. Ireland must comply with challenging targets under the EU Landfill Directive with regard to the diversion of biodegradable municipal waste from landfill.The landfill levy is chargeable on waste presented for disposal at landfill facilities.  The increase in the levy to €50 per tonne which I recently introduced is intended to send a strong price signal to the producers, collectors and managers of waste, to deter against unsustainable behaviour and to encourage a shift away from landfill to waste management practices which are more closely aligned with the waste hierarchy.  Further increases in the levy are also planned, to €65 per tonne in 2012 and €75 per tonne in 2013. I hope to see significantly improved levels of prevention, recovery, recycling and reuse of waste as a consequence of these increases.  Assistance to both householders and businesses in reducing their generation of waste is available through the National Waste Prevention Programme, administered by the Environmental Protection Agency. The latest available data from the Environmental Protection Agency's National Waste Report 2009   state that in that year 0.24 tonnes of household waste per person was sent to landfill.  This equates to 0.672 tonnes per household (based on the average Irish household size of 2.8 persons), which would indicate an average increased cost per household of approximately €13.44 per annum due to the change in the landfill levy rate.  However, this does not take account of the dissuasive effect of the levy increase referred to above, the intention of which is to encourage prevention and recycling and therefore decrease the amount of waste generated per household which falls subject to the levy, and reduce the impact of the levy increase on waste charges.As the waste collection market is currently structured, the pricing schemes used by private waste collectors are a matter for determination as between the service providers and consumers of the service, subject, of course, to a service provider's collection permit and other legal responsibilities being complied with. Any consumer who is dissatisfied with the service currently provided to them may consider switching to an alternative service provider, although this may not always be a realistic option in certain areas. The Programme for Government   includes a commitment to introduce competitive tendering for household waste collection, under which service providers will bid to provide waste collection services in a given area, for a given period of time and to a guaranteed level of service. Such a system has been associated with reduced costs to householders. A public consultation on the issues involved, designed to inform the policy development process, has recently concluded. The responses received are being examined and I intend to bring policy proposals to Government before the end of the year.An objective of any such policy will be to help ensure that households and service providers are incentivised to behave in a sustainable fashion — pricing structures more closely aligned with the polluter pays principle are one such method of driving improved environmental performance. The question of how best to meet the needs of low income households will be amongst the principal issues to be considered in finalising household waste collection policy.

My Department has not received any specific reports regarding the matter referred to.It is a matter for the PRTB to enforce tenancies' registration requirements in accordance with the provisions of the Act, specifically sections 144 and 145 which provide for the issuing of notices to landlords and/or occupiers of the dwellings in question and the prosecution of offenders for non-compliance with the registration requirement. Under section 9 of the Act, a person guilty of an offence is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding €3,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 6 months or both, and daily fines of €250.The Act makes provision for the exchange of information between the PRTB and the Department of Social Protection, the Revenue Commissioners and local authorities. In the latter instance, the PRTB provides information on a regular basis to local authorities which is used to assist them in the implementation of the charge in respect of Non-Principal Private Residences.The registration enforcement activities of the PRTB are informed by a variety of information sources including reports from local authorities and members of the public, as well by cross-referencing of PRTB records with those held by the Department of Social Protection regarding landlords in respect of whom rent supplement payments are made.

If an application for asylum has been made by the person concerned the Deputy will of course be aware that it is not the practice to comment on asylum applications that are pending.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	860	I am informed by the Garda authorities that, in accordance with the provisions of the service agreement for the provision and operation of safety cameras, the service provider is responsible for the recruitment and selection of personnel, ensuring they are qualified to undertake the role assigned to them and providing remedial or renewal training as necessary.  An Garda Síochána does not have a direct role in the recruitment and selection process.  However, the service agreement provides that the service provider and all sub-contractors must comply with relevant employment legislation and  employment regulations.The service provider undertakes, within the terms of the agreement, to use appropriately experienced, qualified, skilled and trained personnel in the performance and provision of services in accordance with industry standards and applicable laws.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána apply to the Courts Service for the issue of summonses, which are served in accordance with the Courts Acts and the District Court Rules.  The service provider does not apply for the issue of summonses.However, An Garda Síochána is also responsible for the issue and service of fixed charge notices for road traffic offences.  Currently ordinary post is utilised to serve fixed charge notices, as provided for in section 25 of the Interpretation Act 2005.  Where a fixed charge notice is not paid, proceedings are instituted for the fixed charge offence by the issue of a summons, which may be by hand, personal service or registered post.Section 103(10) of the Road Traffic Act 1961 (as substituted) provides that in a prosecution for a fixed charge offence it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown that the relevant fixed charge notice has been served or caused to be served and that a payment pursuant to the relevant notice has not been made.A number of legislative changes are contained in the Road Traffic Act 2010, which is under the aegis of my colleague the Minster for Transport, Tourism and Sport, relating to the service of a fixed charge notice.  These include section 44, which  provides that a person who is served with a summons in respect of a fixed charge notice may pay a fixed charge, of an amount 100% greater than the original fixed charge, not later than seven days before the date of the court on which the charge is to be heard.  If the person pays the fixed charge, proceedings in respect of the alleged offence will be discontinued and the person need not attend court on the day.  The section also provides that where a summons is served in respect of a fixed charge offence evidence the fixed charge notice was not served shall not be a defence to the alleged offence.

The Bill will provide a statutory basis for the existing system of vetting provided by the Central Vetting Unit of the Garda Síochána.  In addition, and in line with the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children, the Bill will also provide for the disclosure of so-called "soft information" for the purpose of the protection of children and other vulnerable persons.The drafting of the Bill is ongoing with publication expected during the current Dáil session.

The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

Consequently it is not open to me to intervene in this matter.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	866	I am informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána adopts a strategic approach to the procurement of goods and services consistent with its Procurement Strategy 2011 — 2012 policy document.  The key goals of the strategy are;The development of a procurement planning frameworkMaximising the opportunities for entering formalised contracting arrangementsParticipating in wider public sector procurement initiativesDeveloping procurement staff capacity and skillsMaximising the opportunity to develop and advance e-procurement initiatives.The Procurement Section in Garda Headquarters is responsible for procurement of high value/high risk goods and services while local Divisional Procurement Committees are responsible for the procurement of other services such as cleaning, towing and waste management.  Furthermore, The Garda Síochána purchases goods and services (e.g. furniture, stationary office equipment, fuel, vehicles and other goods and services) from contracts put in place by the National Procurement Service.  The Garda Síochána also participates in joint procurement initiatives with other public bodies e.g. for gas and electricity and maximises the use of the Government e-tenders website to advertise for goods and services.Garda procurement guidelines and tender documentation ensure a consistent approach to procurement and maximise opportunities for small and medium enterprises to bid for goods and services.  The Garda authorities also work closely with officials of my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to ensure their approach is consistent with public procurement guidelines and achieves value for money.

Government operates as a collective entity. When significant issues of coordination arise, it is generally agreed at Cabinet which Minister or Department should undertake an oversight or leadership role".The information required by the Deputy in relation to Tribunals of Enquiry that have recently come under the remit of my Department is set out in the table:Terms of ReferenceDate of CommencementDate of Completion/Projected.Morris TribunalTribunal of Enquiry into complaints concerning some Gardaí of the Donegal Division.€59.14 million to end of August 2011.(of which €41.82 million relates to legal costs.24 April 2002December, 2008Smithwick Tribunal of InquiryTo inquire into suggestions that members of the Garda Síochána or other employees of the State colluded in the fatal shooting of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Robert Buchanan on 20 March, 1989.€8.84 million including legal costs.May, 2005The Tribunal is currently sitting, however, the Terms of Reference were amended in June, 2011 requiring inter alia that the Tribunal  conclude it’s work and present a final report to the Clerk of the Dáil no later than 30 November, 2011.Barr Tribunal of InquiryTo inquire into the facts and circumstances surrounding the fatal shooting of John Carthy at Abbeylara, Co.

The Deputy should also note that Tribunals of Enquiry are established by resolution of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the commencement date and the terms of reference are a matter for the Oireachtas and not my Department. The date of conclusion of a Tribunal of Enquiry is a matter for the Tribunal of Enquiry.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	869	At the outset I would like to advise the Deputy that documents submitted by an applicant as evidence of identity or nationality, or in support of a case to remain in the State, can only be returned to that applicant once the case has had a definitive outcome.Insofar as the case referred to by the Deputy is concerned, a copy of a passport submitted by the person concerned during the course of her asylum application was sent to her legal representative on 27th April, 2011. As a matter of policy my Department does not certify such documentation.The Deputy should note that as the person concerned has not established a right of legal residency in the State, the issue of an application for naturalisation does not arise at this time.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

However I have no knowledge of any recent judicial enquiry recommendations on conditions in Mountjoy Prison.I can assure the Deputy however that the Government is committed to the elimination of slopping out in all prisons and places of detention. The Programme for Government, includes the objective to provide in-cell sanitation to all prisons, and in so far as resources permit, to upgrade prison facilities where possible.As things stand, I am informed by the Irish Prison Service that 72% of prisoner accommodation has in-cell sanitation at present.  This will rise to in excess of 80% when the extension currently under construction in the Midlands Prison is opened in 2012.A refurbishment project is also nearing completion in the basement of the C-wing at Mountjoy Prison which will result in an additional 36 cells with in-cell sanitation coming on stream by October, 2011.  In addition, work has commenced on a project to provide in-cell sanitation in the remaining 74 cells on the same wing which is expected to be completed by the end of the October, 2011.  Depending on the findings of a post project appraisal, the Irish Prison Service will consider installing in-cell sanitation facilities in the remaining cells of Mountjoy and indeed to other facilities that do not have in-cell sanitation.The Irish Prison Service also has toilet patrols in operation until late evening in Mountjoy, Cork and Limerick Prisons with staff rostered to provide this function after final lock in the evenings.  Prisoners requesting to use toilet   facilities after these times are accommodated where possible.  The possibility of extending toilet patrols is being further examined by the Irish Prison Service.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	871	I can assure the Deputy and the House that it is a priority for this Government to maintain frontline services at the highest level possible.I have been advised that the Commissioner is currently carrying out a review of the entire Garda organisation in the context of ensuring that the Force will be in a position to match the deployment of resources to its policing commitments as effectively as possible.Clearly, an examination of the opening hours and in some cases the viability of Garda stations will form part of this.  The issue of the closure of some Garda stations will be a question the Garda Commissioner will have to consider as part of this process.  He may have to consider in appropriate cases whether a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Gardaí out on patrol instead of in a station.I look forward to receiving the Commissioner's proposals, which will be aimed at maximising the efficiency of the Garda Síochána, and prioritising the resources available to operational front-line policing services.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	872	As at the current date my Department has received sixteen confirmed notifications of retirement on or before the 29 February 2012 deadline for payment of retirement benefits based on pre-1 January 2010 salary scales.  This figure includes three staff who will reach the compulsory retirement age of 65 on or before that date.Staff in my Department have access to a personal Pension Service Statement (PSS) which facilitates estimation of pension entitlements, without reference to Human Resources Division, by way of the Civil Service Pensions Modeller.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	873	As of Friday, 23 September 2011, 399 members of An Garda Síochána had either left the force or declared their intention to leave the force in 2011. Of this number, 167 are intending to leave in the months of October, November or December. The Garda Code requires that Members intending to retire must give three months notice of doing so and therefore we will have a clearer idea of the final figure for this year's retirements by the end of this month. Similarly, by the end of November of this year, we will have a clearer idea of the number of retirements to be taken before the end of February 2012.  In addition to the foregoing, 60 civilian staff have already retired this year and five staff have indicated their intention to leave by 29 February 2012.  The three month notice period also applies to civil servants and the situation regarding final numbers will become clearer in the coming months.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	877	A foreign national who is present in the State without permission or in contravention of the terms of a permission is in breach of Irish immigration law.  In general, such persons may have entered the State either through covert means or through the use of false documentation at a port of entry or they may have entered lawfully but remained beyond the duration of a permission or have breached the conditions of their permission.By its nature illegal immigration is clandestine and covert and since illegal immigrants may go to extreme lengths to avoid contact with the immigration authorities, it is extremely difficult to accurately estimate the number of such persons in the State at any given time.  Ireland is no different in this regard to any other jurisdiction.The Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service in conjunction with the Garda National Immigration Bureau, which is responsible for enforcing immigration law, controlling the States borders and carrying out investigations into illegal immigration and human trafficking, investigates all known instances of illegal migration and as necessary targeted measures to deal with such activity are implemented at both a policy and operational level.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	878	As the name and reference number supplied by the Deputy do not match, it is not possible to definitively identify the person to whom the Deputy is referring to in his Question. However, if the Deputy wishes to contact my Department with the correct details a substantive response will be provided.In that context, I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	879	The Legal Aid Board is a statutory, independent body in accordance with the Civil Legal Aid Act, 1995.  The matters raised  by the Deputy are a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.The past three or four years has seen a considerable increase in demand to the Board for legal services and this coincides with the downturn in the economy. In 2007, just over 10,164 persons sought legal services from the Board in relation to general civil (non asylum) matters. This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010 and I am informed that the number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost the same as the total number of applicants in 2007. Inevitably, this has created huge pressures for the Board's law centres and its capacity to deliver legal services within a reasonable period of time. As of 1 September 2011 the waiting time in 17 of the Board's 29 law centres was greater than four months. In six of those centres the waiting time was greater than six months.  As of 1 September 2011 there were just under 4,500 persons waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor. This compares to 3,153 on 1 January 2011, 2,335 on 1 January 2010 and 1,681 on 1 January 2009.The Board is committed to ensuring that applicants for legal services receive a substantive appointment with a solicitor within a maximum period of four months. This is consistent with the view expressed by the High Court in the O'Donoghue case. This has been difficult to achieve in a number of the Board's law centres recently. Certain types of case are deemed by their nature to merit the provision of an immediate or near immediate service. Priority cases include those where there are allegations of violence, child custody matters and where statutory deadlines are fast approaching when clients make their first contact with law centres. These comprise some 15% of all applications to law centres. A considerable number of other applications are referred speedily to private practitioners. Thus, up to 40% of all cases receive a very speedy service. In addition, because the Refugee Legal Service operates to strict statutory deadlines every asylum case processed by the Board is a "priority" case by reference to the speed of response from the organisation.I wish to inform the Deputy that waiting times in each law centre as of 31 December can be found in the Board's annual reports. The most recent published report is for 2009. Waiting times fluctuate depending on demand and the capacity of the law centre or board to offer appointments to new clients at a particular point in time. Waiting times in each law centre as of 31 December can be found in the Board's annual reports. The most recent published report is for 2009.The following table shows details of the number of persons who are waiting for a first appointment with a solicitor at each of its law centres as of 1 September 2011. The table also, shows the waiting times for each law centre as of 31 December 2010 and 31 August 2011.Law CentreNumbers Waiting 01/09/2011Waiting Times 31/12/2010Waiting Times 31/08/2011Blanchardstown7664Brunswick St.20645Clondalkin20057Finglas12555Gardiner Street15956Tallaght199911Popes Quay28534South Mall27676Cavan12858Clare14022Donegal10932Galway11133Kerry7843Kildare23379Kilkenny28035Laois21757Limerick8632Longford9455Louth000Mayo11955Meath13944Monaghan10544Offaly9764Sligo10555Tipperary20179Waterford13434Westmeath13665Wexford25635Wicklow17255Total4,482The 2009 annual report indicates that, of the new clients seen in that year 49% sought services in relation to general family law matters including maintenance, custody, access, domestic violence etc, 19% sought legal services in relation to separation / divorce matters, 4% sought legal services where there was a risk of children being taken into State care, 17% sought legal services in relation to asylum and the remaining 11% sought legal services in relation to general civil matters.The Board has taken a range of measures with a view to addressing the increasing demand for services in a resource constrained environment. These include:Increasing the number of cases referred to private solicitors for the purpose of providing a service.An advice-only service which facilitates an earlier, brief, meeting with a solicitor where applicants are likely to have to wait in excess of four months for a substantive appointment.An integration of the delivery of all services with a view to ensuring the most effective deployment of resources.The recent introduction of a pilot integrated mediation initiative in Dublin involving the Board co-locating and co-operating with the Family Mediation Service and the Courts Service. The purpose of the initiative is to offer applicants for legal services alternatives to litigation in the Courts as a better (and from the State's point of view) a more cost-effective means of resolving family law disputes.The creation of specialist units for medical negligence and child care services.The current development of a new legal case management system that is likely to improve the efficiency of service delivery, the management of risk in the organisation and provide for on-line applications.The Board has also made use of a very limited exemption from the moratorium in relation to a small number of temporary front-line service delivery positions.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	880	I wish to inform the Deputy that the Legal Aid Board provides legal aid and advice in civil matters and is a body that is  independent from the Minister for Justice and Equality by statute.  I am informed that the amount spent on civil legal aid in each year is published in the Legal Aid Board's annual reports, which are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas and are available to the Deputy in the Dáil library. The 2010 annual report, which is due to be published shortly, shows that the Board received a grant in aid of €24.225 million towards the provision of civil legal aid in 2010, along with funding of €7.967 million for the provision of legal aid in asylum matters. The remainder of the Board's  operating expenditure comes from client contributions and costs recovered, which amounted to €1.766 million in total in 2010.The following table indicates the number of new clients seen in each of the years requested in non-asylum civil legal aid cases, whether by the Board's own solicitors or those engaged on its Private Practitioner panels.Number of new clients seen20062007200820092010In law centres5,9355,7436,4797,2407,069By private solicitors1,7192,3062,9834,0125,279Total7,6548,0499,46211,25212,348I further wish to inform the Deputy that for criminal legal aid, expenditure in each of the years 2006 to 2011 is as set out in the following table.  I am informed that information regarding the number of persons to whom criminal legal aid was granted is not readily available and would necessitate a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and resources to provide.

The matters raised  by the Deputy are a matter for the Board.  However, in order to be helpful to the Deputy I have had enquiries made with the Board.I am informed that the Legal Aid Board does not prepare on an ongoing basis, detailed breakdowns on a county by county basis of the types of civil cases being handled by the law centres. I am further advised by the Board that, as this information is not readily available, it would necessitate a disproportionate expenditure of staff time and resources to provide. However, to be helpful to the Deputy I would draw her attention to the fact that the Board's annual reports give information in relation to the different types of cases that the Board deals with. The most recently published annual report is the 2009 report however the 2010 report will be published shortly. It is clear from these Reports that in the Board's experience the types of problems presenting at different law centres are very similar, save that certain work presents in Dublin, because the Superior Courts are, by and large, based there.Under the Government's value for money and policy review initiative, the Board has recently been the subject of a review conducted by my Department in co-operation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. The review undertook a level of analysis of the different types of cases in the different law centres. The review is completed and is currently under consideration in my Department. It will be published in due course.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	882	I can assure the Deputy and the House that it is a priority for this Government to maintain front-line services at the highest level possible.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner is currently carrying out a review of the entire Garda organisation in the context of ensuring that the Force will be in a position to match the deployment of resources to its policing commitments as effectively as possible.  I look forward to the outcome of the Commissioner's review and I understand that it should be available in the next couple of months.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	883	The deputy refers in his question to the recently announced Visa Waiver Programme for the holders of certain types of UK short stay visas from sixteen selected countries.  This pilot programme allows persons who are in possession of the relevant type of UK visa and who have been granted permission to enter the UK on foot of that visa to also travel to Ireland without the need to apply for an Irish visa.  The programme, which was announced as part of the Government's Jobs Initiative, is mainly targeted at those travelling to the UK on short stays who might wish to include a short visit to Ireland as part of their overall journey.  Recent indications are that the number of tourists entering Ireland has increased this year.  This is very much to be welcomed and, while it is difficult to know exactly what proportion of this increase may be attributable to the Visa Waiver Programme, the response from the industry as a whole to the programme has been overwhelmingly very positive.It should be borne in mind by the Deputy that the Visa Waiver Programme is not a reciprocal arrangement and there is not a common visa regime between Ireland and the UK.  The Visa Waiver Programme is solely an Irish government initiative, but it benefits from and requires the very valuable support and cooperation of the UK immigration authorities.  This initiative is not indicative of a change in the position of the Government with regard to the Schengen Acquis.  In fact, any such change in attitude would be likely to place in jeopardy the necessary support of the UK authorities for the Visa Waiver Programme.  The cooperation of the UK authorities with the programme is extended to Ireland in the context of the continuing operation of the Common Travel Area (CTA) between the two jurisdictions which remains an important priority for the Irish Government.  The CTA could not, for all intents and purposes, continue to operate if Ireland were to remove border checks with the Schengen states while the United Kingdom did not.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	884	The moratorium on Public Service Recruitment continues to apply to An Garda Síochána and no date has been fixed for future intakes into the Garda College or for the commencement of a recruitment competition of full time members.  A decision on when recruitment will re-commence will take into account the rate of retirement in the Garda Síochána and Government targets for reductions in public service numbers.  The moratorium on Public Service Recruitment does not apply to the Garda Reserve, and recruitment to the Reserve is ongoing.  To date, some 40 members of the Garda Reserve have joined An Garda Síochána as full time members.  The Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 already allow the Public Appointments Service to give due recognition to any satisfactory service by a person as a reserve member of the Garda Síochána.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	885	Under the law as it stands the costs that must be paid to the winning party to an action are calculated on the basis of what is necessarily and properly incurred for the conduct of the case.  I have noted the Deputy's suggestion and will bear it in mind in the context of my development of proposals for reform of the law on legal costs.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	886	I recently announced my intention to enact legislation to place the interim Parole Board on a statutory footing.  I believe this will help to strengthen and improve its functions and, while it may not be possible to introduce the relevant legislation this year, it is my hope to do so next year.  In that context I will be considering exactly what role it will play and what powers it should have.As regards the Irish Human Rights Commission report, I can advise the Deputy that it was previously considered by my Department.  The recommendation referred to is however based on the premise that our existing law on the temporary release of prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.  There has been no finding of a court to this effect.  I have no reason to believe that our existing law is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights or the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  Indeed, the Irish Courts have found that the management of prison sentences is a matter for the Executive and under current legislation I, as Minister for Justice and Equality, am entrusted with the power to grant temporary release to a sentenced prisoner.   The Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act, 2003 provides a clear legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which apply to the exercise of this power and provides a clear and transparent basis, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release.  The power of release is retained by me under the Act.The interim Parole Board, which replaced the Sentence Review Group, was established on an administrative basis in April, 2001.  The Board's principal function is to advise me on the administration of long term prison sentences.   The Board, by way of recommendation to me, advises of the prisoner's progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence.  I consider in full all recommendations when making the final decision on sentence management.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	887	I can advise the Deputy there were 274 persons in custody serving life sentences for murder on 31 August, 2011.  In addition, there were 61 persons serving life sentences for murder under the supervision of the Probation Service on extended temporary release subject to strict conditions as are specified.  Some of these persons were first released into the community over 30 years ago.Of the 61 persons referred to, 15 of these were granted temporary release during the time period 2005 to 31 August 2011.  The average time spent in custody by these persons over this 6 year period is slightly in excess of 17 years. This compares to an average of just over 7.5 years for releases dating from 1975 to 1984, just under 12 years for the period dating from 1985 to 1994, and just under 14 years for the period dating from 1995 to 2004.  The Deputy will understand that a life sentence is mandatory in the case of a conviction for murder and such persons remain subject to that sentence for their life even where granted temporary release. Specific legislation enacted by the Oireachtas; the Criminal Justice Act, 1960 and the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act, 2003, provides a mechanism whereby the Minister for Justice and Equality may release prisoners on temporary release for such period  of time and subject to strict conditions as may be specified. Temporary release may be granted on a range of grounds including humanitarian or where the Minister is of the view that the person has worked with all available services to aid his/her rehabilitation and reintegration back to the community.  However, before any such decision is reached matters such as the gravity of the offence, the period of imprisonment served, the overall conduct of the prisoner during imprisonment and the potential threat to the safety and security of the public are considered.  Prisoners who are deemed to continue to pose a threat to the community if released continue to remain in prison and indeed there are some prisoners who have remained in custody for over 30 years.All prisoners serving a life sentence are eligible to have their case reviewed by the interim Parole Board when they have served seven years into the life sentence.  The Board's principal function is to advise me on the administration of long term prison sentences.  The Board, by way of recommendation to me, advises of the prisoner's progress to date, the degree to which the prisoner has engaged with the various therapeutic services and how best to proceed with the future administration of the sentence.  I consider in full all recommendations when making the final decision on sentence management.The Irish Prison Service provides a Victim Liaison Service to keep victims of crime informed of significant developments in the sentence management of certain offenders.  Any victims or their relatives, once they have opted to avail of this scheme, will be informed as a matter of course in advance of the Board's review of the prisoner.  The victims are given the opportunity to make a submission to the Board, either via the Prison Service Victim Liaison Officer, or directly to the Board.  The Board, as it has acknowledged on a number of occasions, will take into consideration the views of victims and the impact on their lives prior to making any recommendations to myself.  Several victims and families have made submissions to the Parole Board in recent years and the Victim Liaison Officer also advises the family of any decisions arising out of each review.I have already announced my intention to place the interim Board on a statutory footing.  While it may not be possible to introduce the relevant legislation this year, it is my hope to do so next year and, in that context, I will bear the Deputy's suggestion of victim representation in mind.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	888	I am informed by the Garda authorities that two vetting applications were received by the Garda Central Vetting Unit in respect of the person to whom the Deputy refers.  A response to the first application was returned to the registered organisation involved on 9 August 2011.  The second application is currently being processed and it is anticipated that a response will issue shortly.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	889	The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, sets out the position as to which persons born in this State can claim an automatic entitlement to Irish citizenship by virtue of their place of birth.  Essentially, any child born in the State seeking to claim an entitlement to Irish citizenship must have a parent who is an Irish citizen or, if not, one of the two parents must have been legally resident in the State for three of the four years preceding the child's birth.In the event that the Deputy is referring to the position in the State of third country national parents of Irish born minor citizen children in light of the European Court of Justice Judgment in the Zambrano case, the position is as follows.  The ECJ Judgment provides that EU Member States, Ireland included, are precluded from refusing a third country national upon whom his minor children, who are European Union citizens, are dependent, a right of residence in the Member State of residence and nationality of those children, and from refusing to grant a work permit to that third country national, in so far as such decisions would deprive those children of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights attaching to the status of European Union citizen.  In Ireland, this Judgment applies to the non-EEA national parents of Irish born minor citizen children.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	890	It is a well recognised crime trend across many jurisdictions that the practice of tobacco smuggling is widely used by organised crime groups as a means of generating large amounts of criminal gains.  This situation applies equally in this jurisdiction. I understand that the contribution of the Garda Commissioner to the report in question on tobacco smuggling relates exclusively to tobacco smuggling from a law enforcement perspective and is one of a number of contributions from persons involved in law enforcement.  It is, of course, a matter for the Garda Commissioner to take whatever measures he believes will assist in the efforts to counteract organised crime and I do not accept that the contribution in question gives rise to the type of issues outlined by the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	891	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in May, 2011.  The application is currently being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level and it is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  The service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek this information through the more administratively expensive Parliamentary Questions process.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	895	The detailed allocation of Garda resources, including mountain bikes, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner in the context of his identified operational requirements and priorities.  I am advised by the Garda authorities that the current mountain bike stock is sufficient to meet policing requirements in the Districts referred to by the Deputy and that there are currently no plans to increase the number of bikes in either District.  This situation will be kept under on-going review.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	896	I can assure the Deputy and the House that it is a priority for this Government to maintain frontline services at the highest level possible.  I have been advised by the Garda authorities that the Commissioner is currently carrying out a review of the entire Garda organisation in the context of ensuring that the Force will be in a position to match the deployment of resources to its policing commitments as effectively as possible.  I look forward to the outcome of the Commissioner's review and I understand that it should be available in the next couple of months.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	897	Responsibility for the allocation of resources, including personnel, within the Force and for determining the powers and duties of members of the Garda Reserve rests with the Garda Commissioner, in consultation with his senior management team.  I have been advised that the Commissioner is currently carrying out a review of the entire Garda organisation in the context of ensuring that the Force will be in a position to match the deployment of resources to its policing commitments as effectively as possible.  Clearly, an examination of the opening hours and in some cases the viability of Garda stations will form part of this. The issue of the closure of some Garda stations will be a question the Garda Commissioner will have to consider as part of this process.  He may have to consider in appropriate cases whether a better policing service could be delivered to a local community by having Gardaí out on patrol instead of in a station.  I look forward to receiving the Commissioner's proposals, which will be aimed at maximising the efficiency of the Garda Síochána, and prioritising the resources available to operational front-line policing services.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	898	I am advised by my officials that to provide the Deputy with the information requested in the form she has sought would require a detailed examination of almost 900 files of staff in general service and equivalent grades in my Department. In addition, to provide a breakdown of the pension entitlements of each staff member would require personalised pension entitlement statements to be prepared which would have to make certain assumptions as to the date of retirement, length of service and grade or salary point at which staff will retire.  The compilation of this information would require a disproportionate use of available resources.  Full details of the pay scales currently applicable in the Civil Service are set out in Circular 28/2009 with which the Deputy is familiar.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	899	The Deputy will appreciate that it is not a matter for me to interpret the application of the law in particular circumstances.  However, the following general information relating to anti-social behaviour by tenants may be helpful.  I am informed that in the case of private rented dwellings landlords are responsible for enforcing the obligations that apply to their tenants under the Residential Tenancies Act 2004, which is under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government.  The Act inter alia prohibits a tenant in a private residential tenancy from engaging in anti-social behaviour in, or in the vicinity of, a dwelling to which the Act applies.  It allows a landlord to terminate any tenancy where the tenant is engaging in or allowing others to engage in such behaviour, subject to a notice period of only seven days in the case of serious anti-social behaviour or 28 days in the case of less serious but persistent behaviour.The Act also provides that a third party directly and adversely affected by anti-social behaviour may, subject to certain conditions, refer a complaint to the Private Residential Tenancies Board against a landlord who has failed to enforce tenant obligations.  A specific condition is that the third party complainant must have taken reasonable steps to resolve the matter by communicating or attempting to communicate with the parties to the tenancy concerned. Section 23 of the Multi-Unit Developments Act 2011 provides that an owners' management company may make house rules for the effective operation and maintenance of the multi-unit development.  The rules must be consistent with any covenants or conditions contained in the documents of title and have the objective of advancing the quiet enjoyment of the unit owners and achieving a fair balancing of the rights of such owners.  The section also provides that where a unit is let it shall be a term of the letting that it is subject to the observance of the house rules by the tenants.  A summary of the relevant conditions and covenants together with a copy of any house rules must be incorporated into the letting agreement relating to the unit concerned.  Where a person, who is obliged to comply with house rules, commits a material breach of the rules, the Act provides that the owners' management company of the development concerned may recover the reasonable costs of remedying the breach from the person and those costs may be recovered as a simple contract debt in a court of competent jurisdiction.Local authorities are required by law to adopt anti-social behaviour strategies for the prevention and reduction of anti-social behaviour in housing provided by them.  The Housing Acts 1966 to 2009, which are also under the aegis of my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, include a range of measures to assist housing authorities to give effect to their strategies, including the power to refuse to allocate, or to defer the allocation of, a dwelling to a person engaged in anti-social behaviour or where an allocation to that person would not be in the interest of good estate management.  Other powers available to housing authorities include application for civil excluding orders prohibiting a person engaged in anti-social behaviour from entering a specific local authority house and/or neighbourhood and, in extreme cases, eviction of a household engaged in anti-social behaviour.

Following consideration by a Visa Officer both applications were refused on the 23 September 2011 for the following reason: It was the opinion on the Visa Officer that the applicants did not have sufficient obligations to return to their country of origin and that they may not observe the conditions of a visa where one was granted.  It is open to the persons concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal, in this instance, before the 23 November 2011.  Guidelines on the visa appeals process is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).  I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual Immigration cases may also be made direct to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The person concerned was informed of that decision in a letter issued, via her solicitor, on 31 March 2009.  The person concerned has taken judicial review proceedings and, as the matter is sub judice, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the specific case.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	905	Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, the management and administration of the courts including responsibility for maintaining and publishing court statistics is a function of the Courts Service.However, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had enquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that the parties to a judicial review involving District or Circuit Court cases are to be found in the High Court record; the only persons who are not identified are those whose identities are required to be protected by law, for example, the victim or perpetrator in alleged sexual assault cases.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	906	The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Force Review Implementation Plan both identified the requirement to address the age profile in the Defence Forces.  The key element in military life is the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness. This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level in the Defence Forces.The upper age limit for enlistment in the Army is under 25 years of age on the date of enlistment and for the Naval Service it is under 27 years of age on the date of enlistment.  These limits are determined on the basis that the essential functions of the Permanent Defence Force require that its members be composed of able-bodied personnel of an age which is commensurate with the functional requirements of the organisation.While increasing the upper age may increase the quantity of suitable candidates, the Defence Forces are endeavouring to reduce the average age of serving personnel.  Moreover, recruitment to the Defence Forces is heavily oversubscribed with excellent candidates so the current age requirements are not an impediment to recruitment. Other factors such as return on training investment must also be considered.I am satisfied that the existing age requirements for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force are appropriate and I do not propose to make any changes in this area at this time.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	907	As of now no decision has been made in relation to the future of any particular military installation.  However various commissions, reports and studies back to the 1990s identified barrack closure as a fundamental requirement towards improving military effectiveness and efficiency.  Since then there has been a number of consolidation programmes which has seen the number of barracks occupied by the Permanent Defence Force reduced from 34 to 23 today.  The dispersal of Defence Forces personnel over an extended number of locations continues to be a major impediment to essential collective training and to releasing personnel for operational duties.I have made it clear that I cannot give a commitment that there will not be further programmes of barrack consolidation.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	908	The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has introduced a temporary three month minimum notice period for retirement from the Civil Service, following the extension of the "Grace Period" to 29 February 2012, i.e. the period during which the calculation of public service pensions is unaffected by the pay reductions applied under the “Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009.”   The last date for staff to notify of their intention to retire during the extended Grace Period is 30 November 2011. It is therefore not yet possible to indicate the number of staff who intend to retire ahead of the changes to public sector pensions.While a number of staff of this Department have made enquiries regarding their pension entitlements should they avail of the opportunity to retire during the Grace Period, it would be premature to consider these as expressions of interest in advance of formal notification of their intention to retire.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	909	The first White Paper on Defence was published in February 2000 and was intended to encompass the period to end 2010. Whilst preliminary work on the preparation of a new White Paper had been ongoing, I decided to expand the planned consultative process by initiating the preparation of a Green Paper on Defence. This discussion paper will act as a catalyst to ensure an appropriate level of debate on Defence and inform the development of the new White Paper. I hope to have the Green Paper finalised and published by early 2012.

An officer's pension entitlement is determined by total reckonable service and reckonable remuneration on the last day of service.It is not possible to provide exact figures to the Deputy for the pension entitlements and other emoluments upon reaching retirement as this would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.

The Act identifies the promotion and development of Sea Fishing as the core function of each of the Fishery Harbour Centres.I am however mindful of the importance of the tourist industry and can confirm that tourism in common with other non fishing activities will continue to be facilitated and supported at Howth Fishery Harbour Centre subject of course to the necessary prioritisation of the needs of the fishing industry.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	914	As outlined in my reply to a question from the Deputy on 20th July 2011, a copy of the death certificate of the person in whose name the herdnumber was registered was received by my Department on 9th  December 2009. In accordance with standard procedures in such circumstances, the herdnumber was then registered under the personal representatives of the deceased person.An application was received on 4 January 2010 from the personal representatives of the deceased person to register details of the herdnumber in the name of the son of the deceased person. The application was accompanied by a copy of Probate of the Will of the deceased person.An on-farm inspection was carried out by the DVO on 27 January 2010 and all of the cattle present on the holding were inspected and found to be in order. However, the DVO was aware that there was a dispute over the ownership of the land and it was decided that no change in registration of the herdnumber should take place pending clarification of this issue. In the meantime, the herd keeper role, which assigns responsibility for the care and maintenance of the cattle to a nominated person, was assigned to the son of the deceased person in whose name the request for transfer of the herdnumber had been received. Further action on the registration of herdowner cannot take place until evidence has been provided to the DVO that the land ownership issue has been resolved.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	915	Under the provisions of the governing EU Regulations, payments under the Single Farm Payment may be made only in respect of eligible land. Applicants under the Scheme are obliged annually to declare the land parcels available to them; said details of the eligible areas of the land parcels are then recorded onto LPIS (Land Parcel Identification System), my Department's computerised database of all land parcels declared, which currently contains details of in excess of one million individual land parcels. Applicants are obliged to identify and exclude all ineligible features, such as scrub, roadways, etc. Therefore, the LPIS database has to be amended on an ongoing basis to reflect any permanent changes, such as parcel boundary changes, addition of new parcels, etc. In the vast majority of cases, while the various ineligible areas had not been mapped out of LPIS, applicants were making sufficient deductions for the ineligible features and, therefore, there were no over-payments in these cases.The case of the person named was subject to LPIS review and I can confirm that, while the person named was initially identified as having over-claimed on a specific land parcel, following consideration of his written appeal, I can confirm that it has been found that no such over-claim arose. Given this successful appeal, the necessary arrangements are now being made to make the necessary refund due to the person named.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	916	REPS 4 is a measure under the Rural Development Programme, 2007-13 and is subject to EU Regulations which require that detailed administrative checks on all applications to be completed before payments can issue.These administrative checks in respect of 2010 claims have been completed and of the 30,300 farmers who are due payments, approximately 660 applications are currently awaiting their initial 75% for the year.  This is due to queries which have arisen during the administrative checks.  Outstanding queries are being rectified on an ongoing basis, including through correspondence with the applicants, and payments issue as soon as the queries are resolved.My Department is also currently making arrangements to process the outstanding 25% payments in respect of 2010 to farmers in instances where penalties have been imposed.  I now expect that these outstanding payments will commence in October to approximately 2,300 farmers with penalties.Arrangements are also well advanced to issue payments in respect of 2011 and I expect that these payments will commence in November.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	917	The person named commenced REPS 4 in January 2010 and 75% of the first year payment issued for the amount of €10,416.57 on 31st  March 2011.An area based discrepancy was subsequently discovered following a cross check between the Single Payment Scheme application for 2010 from the person named and the REPS agri-environmental plan.  This discrepancy has resulted in the imposition of a penalty and a delay in processing the final 25% payment under REPS 4 for 2010.My Department is currently making arrangements to process outstanding payments to farmers of the 25% due in respect of 2010 in the cases where penalties were incurred and I expect payments to commence in these cases in October.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	918	Regulation (EC) 999/2001 as amended by regulation (EC) 727/2007 requires the annual testing of both sheep presented for human consumption and fallen sheep over 18 months of age.In 2007 the Commission adopted a level of testing for future years at a minimum annual sample of 10,000 sheep slaughtered for human consumption and 10,000 fallen sheep aged over 18 months.This testing regime was directed at Countries where the population of ewes and ewe lambs put to the ram exceeds 750,000. This change substantially reduced the testing requirement from previous years when 41,677 and 26,970 healthy sheep were tested respectively in 2006 and 2007.The testing requirements as set down by the EU are kept under review.The scrapie surveillance programme is financed by my Department. In turn this expenditure is recouped almost in its entirety from the EU.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	922	I would inform the Deputy that there has already been a substantial increase in the value of agricultural exports to BRICs countries over the past two years.  Total exports of agricultural products to BRICs in 2009 were valued at €87.8 million.  This rose by almost 35% in value terms in 2010 to €118.3 million and the value of these exports for the first six months of 2011 stands at €101.4 million — well above the total for the full year of 2009.Against that background I am very conscious of the valuable opportunities these markets present for increased trade in Irish agricultural products, notably those identified by the Deputy.  It is an essential element of the Food Harvest 2020 strategy to increase Irish production of these products in order to grow agricultural exports and contribute to our national economic recovery.   The Chinese market, in particular, represents a huge opportunity. I hosted a visit by the Chinese Vice Minister for Agriculture earlier this year and it is my intention to follow up on this contact by an official visit China later this year.  We have established a series of High Level Working Groups to progress mutual co-operation on a number of fronts including a group on "cooperation between China and Ireland in the Agri and Seafood areas”.As to India, Russia and Brazil, I and my Department are working closely with industry, other Government Departments, the agencies such as Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland and the Irish Embassies in these countries to identify opportunities to grow and develop the trade.

Furthermore, my Department is obliged to conduct field inspections in respect of a proportion of those applications made under the Scheme. In this particular case, the person named declared 145 breeding ewes on their Sheep Census and, having been selected for field inspection, the inspector confirmed this figure. Accordingly, the payment made to the person named was calculated on the basis of 145 breeding ewes. However, given the position regarding the restriction on the flock of the person named, as outlined, I have had arrangements made to have the case of the person named fully reviewed, following which the person named will be advised, in writing, of the outcome.

Ireland was notified that very significant penalties would apply for continued failure to implement the Directive and two sets of Regulations have been introduced to address the findings of the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland.The drainage and reclamation of wetlands is the responsibility of my Ministerial colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and remain within the planning system.  The Minister introduced the Planning and Development (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2011 on 8 September 2011 to address this element of the Court judgment.Three specific areas covered by the EIA Directive are now regulated by my Department under legislation I signed into law on 8 September 2011, i.e. the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Agriculture) Regulations 2011 (S.I. No. 456 of 2011) and these are—restructuring of rural land holdings,the use of uncultivated land or semi-natural areas for intensive agriculture, andland drainage works on lands used for agricultureMy Department's Regulations provide for a screening and consent system that will not only satisfy the requirements of the Directive but will also provide a practical and workable solution that will minimise the administrative burden on farmers.  There will be no application fee involved in the screening process and each application will be adjudicated upon on a case by case basis in a timely manner, taking into account the relevant criteria outlined in the Directive.Mandatory Environmental Impact Assessments will only be required for larger projects which are above specific thresholds set out in the Regulations.The Regulations will be underpinned by a comprehensive guidance document and a draft of this document is now available on my Department's website and all relevant stakeholders are invited to comment on this guidance during the consultation period which will close on Friday the 21 October 2011.

Further details regarding retirement benefits for civil servants are available at www.cspensions.gov.ie
Retiring staff receive a retirement lump sum of  3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1½ times pensionable remuneration.  In general, staff who were recruited prior to April 1995 and pay the modified rate of PRSI receive a pension of 1/80th of pensionable remuneration per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.  Staff who were recruited after April 1995, receive a pension which is integrated with the State Pension (Contributory).  The formula for the calculation of the pension is 1/200th of pensionable remuneration up to 3 1/3rd times the State Pension, and 1/80th for pensionable remuneration in excess of this limit, per year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 40 years.

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	949	The information sought by the Deputy is not readily available and it would place excessive demands on scarce staff resources in the Department to compile this data.I should explain, however, that the cost of the Bovine TB and Brucellosis programmes has declined considerably over the past 10 years or so arising from the effective eradication of Brucellosis from the country and the substantial reduction in the incidence of TB. For example, the cost of the two eradication schemes (excluding staff costs) has fallen from almost €82m in 1999 to just over €40m in 2010. A significant element of the costs relates to the payment of compensation to farmers and payments to private veterinarians for herd tests.With regard to Brucellosis, the eradication scheme has been extremely effective and has enabled this country to be declared officially free of Brucellosis by the European Community in 2009. Following the achievement of this status, my Department has gradually scaled down the testing regime, with the result that the number of blood tests carried out annually has declined from 4.7m in 2008 to 2.9m last year. The cost of the programme in 2010 is estimated at €4.2m compared with €6.5m in 2008 and €35m in 1999. The changes made to the testing regime will result in significant savings for Irish farmers in terms of reduced testing costs. I will take a decision before the end of the year on the testing arrangements for 2012 following consultation with the farming organisations. My decision will be risk based and will take account of the continuing existence of disease in Northern Ireland, on the one hand, and the desirability of removing costs both for farmers and the Department, on the other.With regard to TB, my Department's eradication programme includes a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing of all cattle in the national herd, the restriction of holdings where reactors are disclosed, risk-based testing of herds contiguous to infected herds, the early removal of reactors, a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak, the use of the gamma interferon test in problem herds, the depopulation of infected herds, where appropriate, and the payment of compensation to farmers whose herds are affected by disease.Bovine TB is a much more intractable disease than Brucellosis, partly because of the presence of TB infection in wildlife. Nevertheless, there has been a significant improvement in the incidence of this disease over the last few years. For example, herd incidence has fallen from 7.7% in 1999 to 4.6% last year and reactor numbers in 2010 were, at 20,200, the lowest recorded since the commencement of the programme in the 1950's.  The cost of the programme has declined from €47m in 1999 to €36.2m last year, largely as a result of the reduction in the incidence of the disease.Reactor numbers and herd incidence have continued to fall in 2011 and it is likely that reactor numbers will fall below 20,000 this year, which will represent a new record low.  If reactor numbers remain below 20,000 this year, we will have seen 3 years of very low disease levels and I am hopeful that the incidence of this disease will continue into the future. Notwithstanding the difficulty in attributing trends to a single factor and the cyclical nature of the disease, my Department believes that much of the improvement in the disease situation is due to the badger removal programme.The TB eradication programme in Ireland, which implements many of the provisions of  EU trade Directive 64/432/EEC, is necessary for the continued export of live cattle and beef to other Member States and, in effect, has underpinned the growth of the Irish cattle and beef industry, which is worth over €2 billion per year,  by creating and enhancing export opportunities. There are also public health benefits from implementing the programme. The cost of the eradication programme has to be seen in this context.My Department will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the TB eradication programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of this disease in all areas.

Under this programme, in return for providing the free  pre-school year to eligible children, a pre-school service will be paid an annual capitation for each eligible child enrolled.  The standard capitation rate is €2,450 per annum and a  higher capitation rate of €2,850 per annum is payable to services with more highly qualified staff.The Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme which was introduced in September 2010 provides free childcare places to qualifying trainees attending certain FÁS and VEC courses.  Under this programme qualifying students and trainees can avail of childcare places free of charge, with my Department paying providers a weekly capitation rate of €170 for each full-time childcare place contracted in their service, €95 for each half day care place and €50 for an after school place.Funding is also provided by my Department to support the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme which enables community childcare services to provide childcare at reduced rates to disadvantaged and low income families.  These not-for-profit facilities provide childcare at cost price with reductions to qualifying parents based on the level of subvention they are entitled to under the programme.The above childcare programmes represent an overall investment in the region of €220 million in childcare supports in 2011.

All services participating in the programme are required to return information to my Department at the start of each academic year in relation to the number of qualifying children attending, as services are funded on this basis.Services had to make their 2011 returns by last week, and these are currently being processed, but I regret it is not possible at this stage to say what the participation rate will be in 2011/12.The number of pre-school services  participating in the programme has been estimated as 95%.

Through this work a clear policy framework will emerge that will aim to enhance the development, participation and support of young people.I intend that the policy framework will also facilitate and promote co-ordination and coherence across departments and services and will set out the priorities, rationale and criteria for future funding programmes.  It will also accommodate issues relevant to young people within the 10-24 age range in informal or out-of-school settings that fall within the remit of my Department.   The overall aim will be to clarify and enhance coherence, connectivity, coordination and delivery in youth services and related out-of-schools services for young people and to ensure such provision is both quality and outcomes based.As part of this approach my Department is in the process of commissioning a review of international best practice in the area of youth development and youth support. The findings from this work will inform my Department's policy objectives and future funding provision with the aim of ensuring that young people engaging in youth services derive maximum benefit.One of my key aims for youth policy development will be to ensure optimum use of all the financial and human resources available. Accordingly, the development of my Department's policy in relation to young people will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, coordination and impact in youth policy and provision so as to ensure quality outcomes for all.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	967	A Vision for Change identified mental health services for children and young people as a priority area for development.  The HSE has therefore placed a particular emphasis on developing child and adolescent mental health teams, improving inpatient access and addressing waiting times for assessment and progress has been made in recent years.   The Government is committed to reforming our model of healthcare delivery so that more care is delivered in the community; access to modern mental health services in the community will therefore be significantly improved.  It is proposed to ringfence €35m annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services for both adults and children.  There are now 61 multidisciplinary Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams nationally and further teams will be developed in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change  .In terms of child and adolescent mental health infrastructure, two new purpose built units opened earlier this year at Bessboro, Cork and Merlin Park, Galway, increasing the total bed capacity to 36 beds, with a further increase to 52 beds expected before the end of 2011.  It is also proposed to provide further beds in the Dublin region and, in this regard, work is due to commence later this year on the second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview which will increase capacity from 6 to 12 beds, and on the development of an 8 bedded facility at St Loman's, Palmerstown.  In addition, work on the Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Day Facility in Cherry Orchard, Dublin is close to completion.Where an emergency situation arises for a young person, an assessment is arranged within 24 hours.  Recent cases have arisen where there have been difficulties for some individuals under 18 years in accessing a psychiatric assessment.  The Executive Clinical Directors have considered the issue and have committed to ensuring that in all such cases, an immediate assessment will be provided by the general adult mental health service in the catchment area.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	968	Where there is suspicion of self harm or injury the most appropriate course is to advise the individual to seek help from their GP, who can then make a referral to other services such as the mental health or addiction service, if the self harm is drug or alcohol related.  In an emergency the individuals should be referred or taken to the nearest hospital emergency department for a medical assessment, treatment and if necessary referral to other services.  The HSE Clinical Care national lead on mental health is working with key stakeholders to develop a uniform approach to self harm assessments in emergency departments so that all those who present will receive the most appropriate care and treatment.  In addition a pilot project is now under way in the Cork Hospital Group to train all appropriate clinical staff in self harm/suicide management and it is planned that in due course this will be rolled-out to other hospitals.The HSE National Office for Suicide Prevention has funded a number of community SCAN (Suicide Community Assessment Nurses) who work directly with primary care to avoid admission to hospital.  These projects are currently being evaluated.  A number of voluntary organisations also provide  services to those who self harm.Dealing with the current high levels of suicide and deliberate self harm is a priority for this Government.  The total funding available nationally through the HSE for suicide prevention is  about €9 million of which €4.2 million is available to the National Office for Suicide Prevention (NOSP) and approximately €5 million is available regionally to fund Resource Officers for Suicide Prevention, Self-Harm Liaison Nurses in Hospital Emergency Departments and local suicide prevention initiatives including crisis awareness groups.  The funding provided in this area this year includes a special allocation of €1 million specifically to target initiatives to address the increasing incidence of suicide and deliberate self harm.

Since December 2009, there has been a net increase of 61 wholetime equivalents in the number of physiotherapists to August 2011 in the public health services.In July 2011, the HSE made the decision to pause recruitment in order to assist in addressing its difficult financial situation.

This programme is supported by a multidisciplinary team with representation from a number of Nursing and Allied Health Professionals, Podiatrists, GPs and the Diabetes Federation of Ireland.The National Diabetes Working group is working through a number of key objectives; one of these is the development of a national diabetic retinopathy screening programme by the National Screening Programme (NCSS) — which was formally requested earlier this year by the HSE National Directorate of Clinical Strategy and Programmes to start the development of the retinopathy screening programme.  This work has started; however, the development of the programme will inevitably prove protracted given the scale of the work involved in establishing such a new programme — especially given the fundamental principle that quality assured outcomes for diabetic patients is not compromised; and on this basis, it is not anticipated that it will be ready to start in the first quarter of 2012.  A budget of €1.6m  has been assigned to the project for 2011.

The Group is not considering the introduction of tax on high fat, salt and sugar foods at this juncture. They have explored the issue of calorie posting in fast food restaurants and officials from my Department met with representatives from the food industry during the summer in this regard.  I now intend writing to fast food operators in Ireland asking that they introduce this calorie posting in their Irish restaurants.  This initiative was first introduced in the US, and it has recently been replicated in the UK in a deal between the British government and industry.

The Dental Advisor formerly on secondment to my Department has completed her secondment and returned to the HSE.  Following the review of my Department under the Organisational Review Programme (ORP) we will be reviewing the skills needed for the future and this will include positions such as that of Chief Dental Officer.This Review of Skills is in the next phase of our implementation of the Action Plan prepared in response to the ORP review and work on this phase will commence shortly.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1016	The Joint Committee on Health and Children produced a Review of Public Orthodontic Services in June 2005, which contained seven specific recommendations.  The position in relation to each recommendation is set out in the tabular statement.RecommendationsStatus of RecommendationsThe existing guide-lines for Orthodontic Treatment (Categories A, B and C) should be replaced by the Index of Orthodontic Treatment Need Code (IOTN) on a national basis immediately.  Persons classified as Grade 4 or 5 under the IOTN in terms of the severity of their need for treatment should then be removed from waiting lists and given the requisite orthodontic treatment.HSE Guidelines based on IOTN have been introduced.The Minister for Health & Children should implement measures, as a top national priority, to ensure international accrediting bodies are given proper recognition.  This recognition would then facilitate an increase in the number of qualified Orthodontists.The Irish Committee for Specialist Training in Dentistry is the recognised accredited body in Ireland and orthodontic courses run by the Dublin and Cork Dental Schools have been recognised.The Training Programme provided by a number of Orthodontists in the former Mid-Western Health Board area that was stopped should be reinstated immediately, with the requisite academic supports, as a means of further increasing the supply of trained Orthodontists.This recommendation has not yet been implemented.The outstanding issues at the Dental School in University College Cork (UCC) should be resolved as a matter of top priority so that Orthodontic training can commence there in the very near future.Cork Dental School is accredited for training postgraduate orthodontic students.Funding for Specialist Training Places (funded by the Department of Health & Children and attached to Health Authorities for a 3 year period) that was stopped should be reinstated immediately.  In the event of the State having to provide funding for orthodontic trainees, these trainees should be required to have a public service commitment upon graduation.The HSE has two postgraduate students attending the Dublin Dental School and Hospital course. They are due to qualify this autumn. Post qualification they are contracted to work for the HSE for a four year period.A Chief Dental Officer should be appointed to the Department of Health and Children as a matter of urgency to replace the vacancy that has been there since 2004.  The salary and conditions should be commensurate with recruiting a professional of the highest calibre with the requisite skills to deliver on a national dental strategy.This is being considered by the Department of Health.At least 5 additional Oral Surgeons and 5 Maxillo-Facial Surgeons should be appointed without delay to complement Orthodontic treatment services.This recommendation has not yet been implemented.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1026	I am determined to ensure that consultants adhere to the private practice limits set out in the 2008 Contract and to see that public patients receive equitable access to appropriate care.The 2008 Consultants' Contract includes measures to strengthen the management, monitoring and control of activity in hospitals with a view to ensuring that the level of consultant private practice within public hospitals does not exceed the permitted ratio, which is 20% for new consultants and a maximum of 30% for consultants who previously held the 1997 Contract.  A small number of consultants have significantly exceeded the private practice limit.  The Health Service Executive has taken action against these consultants focusing on those with private practice in excess of 40-50% and seeking compliance with the terms of the contract. Under the contract, consultants who remain in breach of the permitted ratio are required to remit excess private practice income to the employer for placement in a research and study fund.Where consultants exceed the private practice ratios permitted in the contract, the principal cost to the State is that a smaller proportion of public patients than should be the case receive treatment.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1027	The weighted average cost for long-term residential care in private nursing homes is arrived at by multiplying the cost of care in each nursing home by the number of residents, adding all of these totals together and dividing by the total number of beds nationally.The cost of care in each private nursing home is notified to the HSE and published on its website. The latest information available indicates that the lowest cost of care in a private nursing home is €565 per week and the highest is €1,344 per week. The weighted average is €900.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1030	Letterkenny General Hospital is categorised as a Category 2 Hospital for the purpose of public hospital charges.  Private, semi private and day case charges for hospitals in this category were increased this year by between 29% and 42%.The issue of reimbursement of hospitals for private patient treatment was examined in the ‘Value for Money and Policy Review of the Economic Cost and Charges Associated with Private and Semi-Private Treatment Services in Public Hospitals', published in December 2010.  This Report recommended a review of the system of hospital categorisation, on which private patient charges are based.  The existing categories reflect differences in teaching status and complexity as measured by the casemix system.As measured by the casemix system, Letterkenny General Hospital has a relatively low level of case complexity, and therefore resource usage, compared to other hospitals.  This would suggest that its current classification for charging purposes is appropriate.However, I will keep the matter under review in the context of categorising all hospitals for charging purposes.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	Since taking office I have had meetings with very many representative organisations in the area of mental health, including the one referred to in the details supplied by the Deputy.  At those meetings I reiterated the Government's commitment to the reform of our mental health services in line with A Vision for Change.
It is the Government's intention that over time access to modern mental health services in the community will be significantly improved.  It is proposed in our current Programme for Government to increase the spend on mental health services by ring-fencing €35 million annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services.  In addition, as 90% of mental health needs are dealt with at primary care level, the Government is committed to developing closer links between mental health services and primary care.  GPs and Primary Care Teams will be supported in their physical working environment through the provision of shared premises which will encourage and facilitate interaction across all health professionals.  It is envisaged that the provision of improved community-based services will ensure that people with mental health problems receive the treatment and after-care support needed to facilitate recovery.I have asked the HSE to prepare an implementation plan, which will identify specific recommendations of A Vision for Change that can be progressed over the next three years, with timelines, detailed costs, person(s) responsible for implementation etc.  I am also in discussions with officials in my Department with a view to establishing a Directorate within the HSE to take overall responsibility for driving and implementing the recommendations of A Vision for Change  and, in particular, to deliver on the commitments in the Programme for Government.

#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1037	Under the General Medical Card Scheme, medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of general practitioners services.  Eligibility for the medical card is based primarily on the means of the adult and his/her spouse or civil partner.  Two years is now the average period nationally for which an individual or family holds a medical card before formal review under the General Medical Scheme (GMS).  The review process is an important quality assurance aspect of the management of the GMS.The medical card review process for the over 70's is based on separate legislation and the process has been simplified to facilitate older persons where there has been no change in their circumstances.  Where changes in circumstances have occurred, the case is reviewed in the normal way.  The HSE has no plans to change these arrangements.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1038	Dating back to the 1991 contract and earlier, consultants had an entitlement to rest days in lieu of extra days/hours worked.  Consultant Contract 1997 provided for ‘historic rest days' as a means of settling claims that consultants had not benefited from their full rest day entitlement.  This allows them to take up to a year of such rest days — on full pay — prior to retirement and requires that they be replaced on a locum basis until their actual retirement date.  In a number of instances, consultants offer to perform their own locum, effectively on double pay.  Consultants who had established an entitlement to historic rest days maintained this under Consultant Contract 2008.  The 2008 contract has a new mechanism for rest days whereby, on a quarterly basis, consultants must now take such leave days or forfeit them.Approximately 450 Consultants remain eligible for historic rest days. The large majority of these are eligible for the full year of historic rest days, meaning that for a year prior to their retirement and the introduction of a permanent replacement, their employer must pay both for the consultant and — if services are to be maintained — for a locum.  It is estimated that such contracts would cost the health service approximately €100 million in the period up to 2027, when the last of the cohort of eligible consultants is set to retire.Historic rest days represent an anachronistic and costly means of compensating Consultants who did not receive their full complement of rest days in the period 1991 to 1997.  The requirement that the full complement be taken immediately prior to retirement places a significant burden on the employer in terms of maintaining services and funding both the Consultant and their locum for up to a year.Taking this into account, the HSE has recently tabled proposals under the Public Service Agreement 2010-2014 to the Irish Hospital Consultants' Association and Irish Medical Organisation, aimed at addressing this future liability for the health service.  The matter is the subject of ongoing engagement between the parties.

My officials will now seek to establish the parameters of what can be offered in this regard and will be in touch with the representatives of both thalidomide organisations when my Department and the HSE are in a position to outline the details involved.  I will ensure that survivors and their representatives are consulted during this process, which I have asked to be advanced as quickly as possible.

#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	A child should only be admitted as an in-patient to a psychiatric facility as a last resort, and should as far as possible receive the necessary treatment in the community; there are now 61 multidisciplinary Child and Adolescent Mental Health teams nationally and further teams will be developed in line with the recommendations of A Vision for Change.  The Government is committed to reforming our model of healthcare delivery so that more care is delivered in the community; access to modern mental health services in the community will therefore be significantly improved.  It is proposed to ringfence €35m annually from within the health budget to develop community mental health teams and services to ensure early access to more appropriate services for both adults and children.In terms of child and adolescent mental health service infrastructure, currently bed capacity is 36, 12 in Dublin, 12 in Cork and 12 in Galway, with a further 16 beds to be commissioned by the end of the year — 8 in Cork and 8 in Galway.  It is also proposed to provide further beds in the Dublin region and, in this regard, work is due to commence later this year on the second phase of the Child and Adolescent Unit at St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview which will increase capacity from 6 to 12 beds, and on the development of an 8 bedded facility at St. Loman's, Palmerstown.  In addition, work on the Linn Dara Child and Adolescent Mental Health Day Facility in Cherry Orchard, Dublin is close to completion.  It is anticipated that this facility will provide day care and treatment for children and adolescents with mental health needs and will obviate the need for some admissions.  It is envisaged that the provision of improved community based services, coupled with an increase in bed capacity, will put an end to the practice of placing children and adolescents in adult psychiatric facilities.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1049	During the period specified by the Deputy, having due regard to the tendering process, a total of 105 external reports were commissioned by the Department. Details of these reports are set out in the following tables.Health is an extremely complex environment involving a broad spectrum of primary and acute care services for the entire population, ranging from services for children and families, services for older people, mental health services and disability services. The nature, cost and burgeoning demand for services require that a strong emphasis be placed on the evidence base for policy and resource usage.Many of the reports can be traced back to the development of services for cancer, cardiovascular health, health promotion and the subsequent evaluation of these strategies. A number of the reports deal with complex and ethical issues, for example, the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction.A strong feature of a number of the reports related to engagement in widespread public consultation. National and international expert advice are critical and vital components in the development of health strategy.  The commissioning of external reports is very much part of a modern and effective administrative system and helps to inform the development of policy, regulation and legislation for the health sector as well as serving the public interest. There is, and will continue to be, a need for objective, independent and expert review and evaluation of health services and health outcomes into the future.Name of ReportCarried out byCostFinal

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1053	As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme. The implementation of individual national road projects, including the M3, is a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007. In particular, the statutory power to levy tolls on national roads, to make toll bye-laws and to enter into toll agreements with private investors in respect of national roads is vested in the NRA under Part V of the Roads Act 1993 (as amended by the Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Roads Act 2007). The contracts for the privately operated toll schemes are commercial agreements between the NRA and the PPP concessionaires concerned.  Noting the above position, I have referred the Deputy's question to the NRA for direct reply. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within 10 working days.

I have referred the Deputy's Question to Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland for direct reply on the matter. Please advise my private office if you do not receive a reply within ten working days.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-09-27 00:00:00	Prelude	1055	In line with the commitments in the Programme for Government, I developed a comprehensive three-pronged strategy to encourage in-bound tourism and announced this as part of the Jobs Initiative  in May. The first element was the proposed conditional suspension of the air travel tax, the second was a new growth incentive scheme which has been introduced by the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) applying to all of the three airports under its remit and the third was more targeted and co-operative marketing of new routes from key source tourism markets by Tourism Ireland, the DAA and airlines to encourage more tourists to fly into Ireland.I made it clear from the outset that the proposed suspension of the travel tax would be contingent on a positive response to the initiative from the airlines in terms of restoring routes and capacity. My officials and I held discussions with Ryanair and Aer Lingus about what additional capacity the airlines would be prepared to deliver in return for the suspension of the tax and I also wrote to all of the scheduled airlines operating services to/from Ireland advising them of the Government's proposals and inviting them to engage with the Dublin Airport Authority to establish what new services they might introduce or reinstate taking advantage of the incentives on offer from the Government and DAA.However, the response of the airlines was disappointing. I engaged independent consultants to examine the most significant proposals that were put forward, particularly from the point of view of their potential to increase inbound tourism. These proposals and the overall response of the airlines was not sufficient to persuade me to abolish the tax. I announced my decision in August and I said that I would look at the issue again early next year when I see the airlines proposed schedules for the summer 2012 season. With the agreement of the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, half of the revenue that will be generated by not suspending the tax will be made available for a targeted co-operative marketing effort in conjunction with the airlines, airports, ferry companies, tour operators and others.

Fisher Associates have been appointed by my Department to review the current delivery of services by the Coast Guard and the Marine Survey Office.Currently there is a moratorium on recruitment, however essential staff at the Rescue Centres are being replaced on retirement. Three Watch officers have been recruited recently and are under training and a further ten watch officers are being called from the current recruitment panel to maintain staffing levels at the three Centres including Valentia.In relation to the installation of equipment at the Rescue Co-ordination Centres, there are four main phases.  Phase one, installation of National Maritime Operations Centre (NMOC) Dublin and east coast radio sites is complete. Phase two, installation of ICS equipment, is well under way with an expected completion date of the end of October 2011. Phase three will see the completion of Malin by end June 2012 and phase four, Valentia, by end 2012.In relation to the move of the Coast Guard Functions to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, officials of my Department are engaged in discussions with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on the matter. Discussions have also taken place with the Office of the Attorney General in relation to a number of complex legal issues arising in the transfer. These discussions are not yet complete.

The initial selection and prioritisation of works to be funded is also a matter for the Council. A total of €439,676,000 is being provided for the maintenance and improvement of regional and local roads in 2011.

In relation to Government policy on public transport investment, the comprehensive review of capital expenditure is currently under way. The level of funding available for public transport investment from 2012 to 2016 will be dependent on the outcome of this review which takes place against a background of new funding realities. A major consideration for transport investment over the next five years will be the need to prioritise funding to protect investment made to date and to maintain high safety standards.  The outcome of the review should be available in the next few weeks.  Until the review is completed it would be premature for me to comment further in relation to individual projects.
