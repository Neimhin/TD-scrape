#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I do not often suffer from delusions but I thought that last year I saw the Taoiseach climbing onto a tram in Merrion Square and subsequently advertisements stating that the next tram would be along in 2003. Given the fact that Goodbody Consulting indicated that the cost of traffic jams this year to the economy will be in the order of €600 million, which is 60% of the entire budget of the National Roads Authority for this year, would the Taoiseach confirm, in view of the contradictions from the Minister for Transport, if the Luas project is shelved or not, and if the proposed traffic corps is shelved or not? How is it that traffic backs up from St. Stephen's Green to Chapelizod and that Harcourt St. resembles the Burma Road? Is it not a fact that more people from the greater Dublin area and beyond now spend more of their waking hours travelling to and from this city in sheer and utter frustration and that business is losing hand over fist as a consequence of the inability to manage the city's traffic? What moneys and facilities will be put into Operation Freeflow, when will it commence and why has it not done so already? In view of the fact that the Department's own website says it is responsible for providing a well functioning integrated public transport sytem, will we see the trams in 2003? Will we have Operation Freeflow next week? Will the traffic corps begin acting immediately? Will the Taoiseach order or instruct his Ministers to sort out the unholy mess that is the worst traffic situation of any city in Europe today?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	1	Deputy Kenny asked many questions. He asked about the Luas which is proceeding a few months behind schedule but the work is going ahead. I congratulate all those working on it as they have done an enormous amount of work in a relatively short period and say that it will be March or April 2004 when the work is complete.His second question was about the proposed traffic corps which is also proceeding—

A large part of the roads' infrastructure is in the Dublin area where more than €0.5 billion is being spent on the port tunnel which will take almost 20,000 vehicles off the streets per day. The extension of the Balbriggan by-pass to link with the Ardee by-pass is only a year and a half from completion, and the southern cross and the Glen of the Downs projects are almost complete as is the widening of the M50. The private sector is involved in the building of the M50 bridge. The Minister is ready to proceed with several other major projects; this means that about €1 billion will have been spent on roads between this year and last. Fifty major schemes have been opened to traffic covering over 100 kilometres of road, including the Ardee-Dunleer, Macroom and Blackpool by-passes, and the southern cross route. This year about 20 major projects are under way involving almost 200 kilometres of roadway, of which 130 kilometres are dual carriageway or motorway standard.

Our economy has grown by 8% in five or six years and the downside is that we now have 600,000 vehicles and 1.4 million cars which take up much space on the road. That is why we must continue with our progressive policies on rail, the Luas and our roads.

I  am glad to hear the Taoiseach talking about progressive rail policies. He should explain them to the workers in Athenry who lifted the line from Limerick to the West.The Taoiseach did not respond to some of my questions. When can we expect to see the Luas in operation as it is not joined in the middle? There is no money in the Estimates for the widening of the M50, which appears to be shelved, nor for the traffic corps. When will we see this corps? As I said, Harcourt St. being like the Burma Road is one thing, but the cost of €600 million to the economy is over ten times the estimated saving for the so-called abolition of the first time buyer's grant. Will the Taoiseach answer these questions and tell us when we will see Operation Freeflow on the streets for this Christmas? Business people are astonished that it is not operational yet as they are losing trade hand over fist.

On the issue of the Galway-Claremorris road, the Minister said that a final decision will not be made on that matter until publication of the strategic railway plan. He has also made it clear that the line is being maintained on a care and maintenance basis. There has been no rail on that line but it can be restored very quickly. Operation Freeflow normally starts on or around 8 December, usually the Monday of that week, and this year will be no exception.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	31	—if it is considered that the €3,800 is irrelevant in policy terms and is being trousered by the builders? Why did the Taoiseach's party promise in 1997 to increase the amount to £5,000? Why did he not abolish it during the boom when the builders were already taking excessive profits in the building industry? Is it not the case that in reality the €3,800 is a leg-up for first-time buyers and that for some young people it is the difference between acquiring and not acquiring a home? Is the Taoiseach aware of the credit squeeze now being put on by the Central Bank which will make it more difficult for young people to acquire a home? Following this morning's parliamentary party meeting, does the Taoiseach anticipate that the backbenchers will try to save their faces by ringing the wagons on this issue only and that they are prepared to ignore the €24 million cut from the primary schools refurbishment programme, the €59 million from the capital programme for third level education, the €80 million from the capital roads programme, the €14 million from the non-national roads programme and the €44 million from the FÁS employment schemes?Does the Taoiseach anticipate that all these matters are not of interest to his backbenchers? Are the backbenchers prepared to ignore the fact that not one new garda will be put on the streets, after all the promises from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and the Taoiseach about the provision  of 2,000 extra gardaí, in favour of taking a stand on the first-time buyer's grant? If they take a stand on the first-time buyer's grant, is the Taoiseach prepared to at least concede that to them?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	32	As I have said many times in the past few days, the framing of this year's Estimates took place in a different context from that of recent years. Our economy has been growing at an average rate of between 8% and 12% over recent years. That has allowed the Government, with much criticism, to continue to increase expenditure by 20%. That has put huge increases into the base of all subheads and as a result people have seen better services, more resources, more staffing, enormous increases in pay across the public sector and more money put into the capital programme. Even now our capital programme spending is approximately double that of most other European countries.The reality is that the economic position has changed totally. Growth this year will be about 2% or 2.5% of GDP. Instead of projected revenue of 8% or 8.5%, it will be 3% so this year we have to sustain what we have and try to reduce the substantive increases we put into all the areas in recent years as mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte, including the 40% in the past two years.We have almost doubled the allocation to social and affordable housing in the past two years over the 2000 base but we are not able to continue to maintain the bases plus 20% this year. As one of my colleagues said, this year's base is a plateau; it is not a decline. It is a bridge into the future and if we sustain our policies and continue to put the money into areas such as health, which received over €650 million this year, education and infrastructure, for which we still have €5.3 billion, we can then maintain our economy and try to hold on to the extra 600,000 jobs – there are 1.8 million people working – and get through this difficult period.The alternative is to bring in policies that will reverse all our tax reforms. Increased taxes will immediately result in fewer people in employment and affect our export base, and we are not prepared to allow that to happen. We have to manage carefully through a difficult time and as soon as circumstances permit, we will again implement higher value social policies, but we are sustaining very high increases into the base of 2003 and I am glad the Government has been able to do that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I wish to focus on the first-time buyer's grant because the Taoiseach should not mislead the House. There is a 5% cut in the Book of Estimates for social housing for next year. That is the reality. There is not an increase, as the Taoiseach suggested. Is it the Government's view that there is a moral obligation on builders? Is the reality not that the moral obligation is on the Government? If the Taoiseach is serious about savings of €38 million on the first-time buyer's grant, why does he not claw back some of the tax  breaks for investors, elaborated on at considerable length yesterday in The Irish Times by Frank McDonald? If the Taoiseach is interested in making savings of €38 million, why does he not claw back some of the capital gains tax breaks for speculators? Why does he not claw back some of the stamp duty lost after the imposition of the third Bacon report? Why does he not tackle any of these areas for revenue raising rather than intruding in the aspirations of young people to buy their own home?Is it not the case that investors now pay the same in stamp duty as first-time buyers? First-time buyers are expected to compete in the market with investors—
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	34	That is not true, and the Deputy knows it.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	36	It is correct. The Minister brought it back last year. Is it not the case that the rental income for investors is now higher than mortgage repayments? Is the moral obligation on the Government or on the builders, who are doing what builders do?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	37	I will quickly address the points made by the Deputy. On the question of the social affordable housing, the Exchequer provision for housing next year is down 5% on the 2000 levels.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	38	That is what I said.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	39	Will Deputy Rabbitte please let me give him the details? The provision of €932 million from Exchequer capital expenditure in 2003 is more than double the spending in 2000, which is what I said, when Exchequer capital spending was €452 million. When the non-Exchequer capital is taken into account, which is the local authority borrowing from the National Finance Agency, the total capital funding for housing next year is €1.7 billion, an increase of 7% on the amount provided in 2002.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	41	The Minister is endeavouring to keep up the supply of affordable houses into the market for next year as he has done for this year. A few years ago there were 8,500 houses and I hope this year there will be 12,000 houses available. Unfortunately, some things have to give, in some policy decisions. Two years ago we substantially cut the stamp duty to the extent of almost €5,000 in order to help first-time buyers.

There are sick people who are denied proper medical treatment because of this. Today is United Nations Day of the Child and there are many parents who make huge sacrifices even to bring their child to the family doctor. Is the Taoiseach aware that the Department of Health and Children says there will be no new beds opened in 2003 and that in his own health strategy there was a commitment to provide 3,000 new beds over a ten-year period? Has the Taoiseach also noticed that the cost of medicines has increased? Will he tell the House if the health strategy has now been abandoned to all intents and purposes and is no longer relevant to this Government?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I am aware that today is the United Nations Day of the Child. The Deputy asks if we are concerned about these matters and I say we are. That is why this Government has trebled the amount payable for child benefit. The incidence of child poverty has been halved because of our policies. A sum of €40 million capital is being provided to increase the high support special care children's services and to be used in a range of other services such as foster care and family support services. We will continue to do that.The Minister for Health and Children has made it very clear that he will continue to implement the health strategy. This year he has delivered on bed numbers. He will deliver on 109 more next year. He has provided capital funds of more than €500 million for next year for further improvements in infrastructure. I supplied a list yesterday. I do not need to give it again to Deputy Ó Caoláin.We would have liked to be able to extend the provision of medical cards and it is still our wish. We extended the medical card scheme to the over 70s because it is necessary to look after the vast majority of the elderly who are in need. Surveys have shown that those who are not in need tend not to use the medical card anyway. It is a costly scheme—

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	49	—and we need €230 million extra this year just to maintain the 31% of the population who have medical cards without improving the service. The Deputy will accept  that the general medical services scheme is a good but costly scheme. There is no point in extending the scheme before protecting the most vulnerable and that is what we are endeavouring to do. When resources permit, we will honour our commitment to improve the scheme but for the present we must ensure that we can pay for the service that is already in place.

The reality is that for the 200,000 people and for many others, the cost is something that the Taoiseach has not calculated. This is part of the reality of the daily life condition for those ordinary people.On a second health matter, the first major claim against the former consultant Dr. Neary from Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda was won in court last week. Will the Taoiseach and his Minister now establish a tribunal of inquiry into the barbaric practice of carrying out unnecessary Caesarean hysterectomies which happened for years at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and which maimed dozens of women for life? Will the Government also establish a compensation tribunal as sought by the group representing the women?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	65	I reiterate that we would like to extend the medical card scheme and that is the Minister's stated position. The pre-budget Estimates for 2003 for health is €8.9 billion. It includes capital expenditure and in addition €694 million in current spending is provided. That is a 9% increase year on year. The spending figure for next year will be €554 billion higher, 154% more than it was five years ago. That extra investment has resulted in record levels of activity in the acute hospital system. The Deputy raised the issue of beds. An extra €53 million next year will mean an overall investment package for the bed capacity of €118 million. The Deputy should accept that this shows we are honouring the proposals in the health strategy. The treatment purchase fund, the additional money for cancer services and the money for the primary care for GP services will, I hope, help his constituents in Monaghan as well as people everywhere in the country.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	66	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 28, inclusive, together.The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference met on 22 October under the joint chairmanship of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen and the then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid. The conference reviewed recent political developments.Both Governments reiterated their commitment to the implementation of the Agreement as the only way forward and the only viable future for the people of Northern Ireland. It is our determined wish to see devolved Government restored as soon as possible and before the scheduled elections.Under paragraph seven of the review section of the Good Friday Agreement, the process of review falls to the two Governments in consultation with the parties in the Assembly. We have, individually, already had a wide range of contacts with the parties and we believe it is now useful to hold a meeting of all the Assembly parties. The meeting, at which all the pro-Agreement parties will be present, will take place tomorrow and will be chaired jointly by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Paul Murphy. We see the principal purpose of the meeting as being to enable each party to indicate what it sees as the key issues requiring resolution and advancement if the current difficulties are to be overcome. Following the meeting, and taking into account any areas of agreement identified, in consultation with the parties we will consider how matters should be taken forward.When I met the Prime Minister Mr. Blair in the margins of the European Council meeting in Brussels, we again emphasised our full commitment to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We are continuing to keep in touch, but we have no immediate plans to meet.In the course of our ongoing contacts with the parties, including Sinn Féin, we will work to ensure that all issues are addressed in a way which will promote confidence and trust and will allow for the restoration of the devolved institutions as soon as possible. I welcomed and was encouraged by many aspects of Gerry Adams' speech of 26 October and David Trimble's positive reaction to it. Gerry Adams' strong statement of determination to keep the peace process intact and of recognition of the need to bring closure to all of the key issues is a positive contribution at this difficult time in the process. I share his view that the process on which we are all embarked must involve irreversible change on all sides.I also welcome David Trimble's statement that his party wanted loyalist groups to stand down their paramilitary armies and that loyalist leaders would have to face up to questions about the existence of their paramilitary groups. The latest horrific attacks by loyalist paramilitaries underline once again the need for strong action by the police service and strong support by the community for the police.I take this opportunity to express my appreciation and the appreciation of the Government for the significant contribution of John Reid to the peace process and in advancing the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and to wish him well in his new role. The Government looks forward to working closely with his successor,  Paul Murphy, who I met on Wednesday 6 November, as we seek to manage the current difficulties and challenges together.Concerning the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, there are a number of matters which will require consideration in advance of a meeting, which it is proposed to hold on Wednesday 27 November, and I have written to the parties in this regard. I know there already has been a meeting of party representatives to discuss arrangements for next week's meeting. I thank Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness for her contribution in steering the work of the forum at a very important time in advance of the talks which led to the signing of the Good Friday Agreement.Ms Justice McGuinness is unable to continue as chairperson of the forum because of her position on the Supreme Court. As Senator Maurice Hayes, the chairman of the Forum on Europe, was already a member of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, it seemed appropriate to invite him to assume chairmanship of that forum and I thank the leaders of the participating parties and groups for agreeing to this.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	67	In a recent interview with the editorial board of the Chicago Sun Times, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, David Trimble, suggested that the existence of this State resulted from anti-Britishness and Catholicism. In a previous interview he referred to the Republic as being monocultural, monoethnic and pathetic, though he seems to have rolled back upon the latter word. Has the Taoiseach spoken to Mr. Trimble about these comments as reported? What are his views on the comments as reported?I thank the Taoiseach for recalling the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation, which I called for here some time ago. Does the Taoiseach believe the IRA will be disbanded? In his conversations with the Sinn Féin leadership, has he pressed the point? As we now approach the concluding difficulties in implementing the Good Friday Agreement – policing, demilitarisation and the abandonment of all paramilitarism – does the Taoiseach personally believe the IRA will be disbanded, that Sinn Féin will take its place on the policing board and that we can move towards real progress in the implementation of the Agreement?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	68	Regarding Mr. Trimble, I have not spoken to him yet on this occasion, no doubt I will get that privilege in due course. It is a fairly single transferable speech that he tends to make at least twice a year, particularly when he is away from this island. This version has not changed much from the last version that I and others strongly expressed to him our views in that regard. I do not think he believes a word of it. Unfortunately my power over him to prevent him saying these things from time to time is zero.When he is questioned on this he says it is not his view, or if it is, he does not defend any of these points. Like other Members, I wish he did  not say these things. I said this to him before and I assure Deputy Kenny that I will say it again, as I am sure other Members will also when they meet him. Whatever about the validity of some of his arguments in the dim and distant past, none of his points stands up to any scrutiny nowadays, and they are not helpful. I feel that when some of the people of a Nationalist outlook in the United States express their views to him it acts as a wind-up. I do not get too upset about these matters.On the issue of dealing with the IRA, the important thing is that on this island we move away totally and absolutely from paramilitary violence from all sources. The offending issues that continue to cause difficulty are intelligence gathering, military training, direct and indirect procurement or manufacture of arms, punishment beatings and other forms of criminal behaviour, whether North or South. What is important is to try to achieve a discipline that is consistent with ending all of that kind of violent conflict. It is in that I and others are now engaged.Deputy Kenny asked directly whether I think we will be successful. I would like to be able to give the answer to that, I hope we can. The IRA have been on a ceasefire most of the time for a number of years. There have been some activities – dangerous activities – but they have been sporadic, and all of us have managed to stretch our minds to a position where we can tolerate that, if not like it, providing we can get to a closure on it.There still are other paramilitary groups which exist to one extent or another and which still create concern. The position on the Real IRA has to be monitored closely following the recent statements by its leadership within Portlaoise prison. I still have a worried but open mind on all of that, perhaps more worried than open. We have to be very careful about that. There is of course no engagement with this group, and that will continue to be an issue.I am still strongly of the view, as I have been for a long time, that policing is a key issue that will resolve or not resolve so many of the difficulties in Northern Ireland. Like many others here, I could speak all day about the difficulties and the problems but a resolution, however difficult to achieve, is vital if we are to address many of the other difficulties in Northern Ireland and to build trust and confidence, to achieve full participation by Nationalists in the PSNI, to stop the problems at interfaces, to stop the difficulties during the marching season and to stop a lot of other issues of concern.These are all complex issues but they are important, and I welcome the publication, or at least the listing in Her Majesty's speech to the first session of the British parliament two weeks ago, of new legislation on these matters. I am well aware that this legislation does not deal with everybody's concerns, but I am happy that we have at least brought matters to this stage, and it is a move in the right direction.

These institutions have been suspended by the British Government. Does the Taoiseach agree that decision is a matter of major concern for people in this State, as it is for people in the Six Counties, and that it has constitutional and political implications here?With regard to the talks scheduled to commence tomorrow in Belfast, does the Taoiseach agree that these talks are not and must not be a renegotiation of the Good Friday Agreement? Does he agree the focus must be on the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and not on the dismantling of the Agreement, as was the focus of a motion adopted by the Ulster Unionist Council on 21 September last?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	70	We are now into a period of intense talks. The roundtable talks start tomorrow. I hope that people positively set out what they believe are the issues and conditions that are necessary to allow us to move on. We will have the British-Irish Council on Friday with representatives of all the peoples of these Islands but without the Unionist community, which is a little ironic. Before someone asks why I attend that council, I wish to point out that I call constantly for everyone concerned to implement all aspects of the Good Friday Agreement. Even if the Unionists do not turn up to the British-Irish Council, I feel duty bound to turn up. It would be hypocritical for me to call for full implementation of the Agreement and then not to implement that aspect. It is strange that we will all be there but that the Unionists will not be. That is the reason I feel I should be there.Talks at official level are talking place today and will continue next week, and then we will have the forum. We will then see where we can move in respect of the roundtable talks. All of that is on the basis of the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. It is not a renegotiation of it. I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin on that point, but he must also agree with me that we must try to create a position where there is faith, confidence and hope, that we must all work together and that inclusiveness of the institutions means we are working to make sure there is a better time for the people in Northern Ireland and people elsewhere on this island. That is the important aspect. I try not to be prescriptive about any of these issues because it does not get me anywhere. Everybody must share in trying to find a resolution of these issues. It is a pity the institutions fell, but there were reasons for that. In putting them back, we must try to resolve  those issues for good and we all have a part to play in that.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. I also wish to thank Ms Justice McGuinness for her work. We in the Green Party look forward very much to the forum meeting next Wednesday at which there will be representatives from both jurisdictions, North and South of the Border.In relation to the inclusivity of the Assembly, in regard to the four year review of the Agreement – paragraph 8 in respect of validation and implementation refers – is the Taoiseach open to examining the current requirement for a process of designation? Given the difficulties that caused, and perhaps the further difficulties it generated in terms of mistrust and division, is he amenable to considering a more multi-option approach in the workings of the Assembly, which would still enjoy the requisite degree of cross-community support, and in relation to that review to being open to the ideas that might come forward in that regard?I wish to ask the Taoiseach about the degree of accountability and transparency in the institutions. I note from a report that the de Chastelain commission has cost £6.3 million sterling to date. Does the Taoiseach know the reasons for that cost, given that we do not have full decommissioning? It is important that we keep an eye on the kinds of costs that are being run up and that we let the people know exactly what is being done and spent in their name.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	72	The review of the Agreement is an issue down the road. At this stage our aim is to put the institutions back in place. While nobody would disagree with this goal, when we look at aspects that are required in the review next year, I hope there will be no difficulty about those issues – I think it will be possible to get understandings on them. One particular party, which is partially involved, may already be on record as to how they want that monitored. I would be happy to negotiate any of those aspects.In the meantime, the big issue, as we try to put the institutions back in place, is confidence. I readily admit there are problems of confidence on both sides. We have finished a fairly extensive round of discussions with everybody, the British Government and all the parties. We met some of the parties a number of times. I had long meetings with the Secretary of State. There were meetings between the Irish officials, British officials and the leaderships of the groups. There were large delegations. The two Governments have made it clear that paramilitaries must become a thing of the past. We need a clear break from the past if confidence and trust are to be restored for the future. The intensity of activity of loyalist paramilitaries is a complicating factor. There are the outstanding issues of demilitarisation, the human rights agenda and policing. They are all fairly clear items, but the real ingredient missing is trust and confidence. That is  not something that one can put down on a sheet of paper and instil. We can put many words and formulations around it.I have no difficulty about inclusivity – the more of it the better. I wish the process was more inclusive. I wish the DUP would attend and that when the institutions were up and running that it would have worked and interacted with the SDLP, the UUP and Sinn Féin. All that would have been very helpful. I think it is feasible. I do not think it is a pipe dream any more, although maybe it was a few years ago. We just have to work hard on that.What worries me most is that, as in the case of any project in which one is involved, one must be able to carry with one the people who will make it work. In this case, they are the people on the ground who live in Northern Ireland. They have to see that they can work these institutions, respect them and take direction from them. At present, that does not exist, but between now and Christmas we have a chance of at least getting a better understanding of the issues. Tomorrow will be a useful mechanism for people to reflect their concerns.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I do not have the breakdown of that cost. It seems large.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Will the Taoiseach ask about that?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	78	I will try to find out about it because it seems rather large. These debates in the Dáil are closely scrutinised outside this House. I appreciate the work that General John de Chastelain and his comrades have put in.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has no say in that matter.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	81	Will the Taoiseach speak about the role he envisages for the forum? Does he foresee it meeting on a regular basis? Does he agree that while the forum can do some useful work that it is no substitute for the inter-party talks that are necessary in Northern Ireland in order to make progress? What is his assessment of the likely timeframe for the talks that are due to get under way in Northern Ireland? Is he satisfied with the proposed structure of the talks at this stage?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I agree with Deputy Rabbitte. I was reluctant for a long time to call a meeting of the forum on previous occasions when we had difficulties or on this occasion. The parties in Northern Ireland and here have said it could be useful to have a session. We should not return to weekly sessions since we would not have the business nor would it be a useful exercise. A meeting at this stage could be productive, and maybe we could consider it again after Christmas. It would be beneficial for people to be able to express how they wish things to move forward. The British Prime Minister and I have set out the position as we see it while regretting that the institutions have again collapsed. Neither of us wanted to see that happen. We have indicated that some years on, we want to see movement towards an end to paramilitarism and all that entails. We want to see a specific programme of confidence building with the two Governments playing a role in that, but particularly the parties involved.I refer to the timeframe for the talks. Needless to say, we are trying to ensure as much engagement and as much action as possible and to crystallise the issues and not have endless debate. The British Government has separately had bilaterals with all the parties as we have had – in some cases several. I hope the issues will be crystallised tomorrow. I do not see agreement tomorrow; that is not the purpose. At least if we can get them around the table, we can see how we can move on. What comes out of tomorrow and the reflections of the Oireachtas next week will be useful and will be keenly noted by all the parties in the North. Because they have been away from their institutions, they look forward to that opportunity next week. The idea of a one off meeting next week is important to them. I would like to think we could make substantial progress before next Christmas, but we will see. It will be difficult but we should keep trying as we have one month.Maybe events will prove me wrong but it is my view that if there had not been a breakdown of the institutions before the UUP September conference which kind of indicated that it would make some move in January, a move which I did not welcome, the institutions would have ceased around St. Patrick's Day – 20 March was the date pencilled in in order to have the elections at the beginning of May. That coincides with the start of the marching season – late March into the Easter period which is late next year. At that point almost every year, we cease to make progress. There must be elections next year and the British Government is of the same view. I know not all the parties are of the same view as the two Governments. If we are to deal with this, the end of February is the latest date. If that does not happen, we will face grave difficulty. People say I am wrong and that one can make progress during the summer but I never find that anything productive happens. I wish it was otherwise but issues are dragged backwards from March to September. I urge those following the debate not to  make that mistake. It would be a grave mistake for us not to try to break the back of this issue prior to Christmas and to resolve it, if possible. Anyone who believes we can go beyond the end of February is making a grave mistake.

It was a valuable forum to reflect different views.

#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Will the Taoiseach ensure there is movement on the peace process and that we get out of this mess? Will he show strong leadership on this issue and do all in his power to represent the Irish view as I believe that recently, there has been some slippage? I urge the Taoiseach to do something for the residents of the Short Strand – the 2,000 of them who face a nightmare scenario each night with vicious sectarian attacks. I met a group of the residents in recent days. I urge the Taoiseach to speak out, to highlight this issue and to point out that it is a complete breach of the Good Friday Agreement.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	90	The Government continues to meet residents of the Short Strand. During the worst of their difficulties throughout the summer, our officials communicated with them and they continue to assist in every way they can. I am sympathetic to the difficulties. Ultimately, proper policing and trust and confidence in it will be the final resolution to that. In the meantime, we will continue to highlight their difficulties and to assist them in whatever way we can.I welcome what Deputy McGrath said about the forum. I assure him we will do all we can to try to ensure there is stability and confidence and we will continue to deal with that over the coming weeks.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	91	Does the Taoiseach agree we need to take a more radical look at the real processes in Northern Ireland? Does he agree the institutionalisation of sectarian division, which is provided for explicitly in the structures of the Good Friday Agreement, has utterly failed to  take society in Northern Ireland forward? Does he agree the peace process has seen increased polarisation and division between communities – a war over territory, in many cases?Does the Taoiseach agree that his Government, the British Government and the parties in Northern Ireland, which base themselves on one side or other of the sectarian divide, have no solution and that under them, politics is stagnating and festering? Does he agree that his Government, which is involved in a vicious programme of cuts here, will have no moral authority with working class people in the North? Not being able to resolve problems here, they will question where this Government can resolve problems there. Does he agree that a new political force, which could bridge the divisions in working class communities by addressing the real and critical issues they face, is what is required to provide radical and real solutions? Will the Taoiseach clarify what he said in answer to a supplementary question when he referred to paramilitary activities, called them "bad" and said "we can stretch our minds to tolerate that" before moving on to something else? Would he like to rephrase that? Does he agree paramilitary activities are reactionary in every sense, that their activities contribute to sectarian division and polarisation and that the biggest favour they can do working class communities is to disband and disappear?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	92	I do not agree that a new radical political solution over the heads of all the parties on all sides in Northern Ireland will bring a great Messiah and Utopia for all.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	94	If we could keep away from that type of thing and keep people focused on the political parties which are there, then they would not drift into paramilitary activities because that is what tends to happen. People follow some warlord or other and there is more sectarian activity. Keeping people focused on the main political movements would be far better in these areas. I do not agree with the Deputy in this regard.We all have to work hard. Within the parties in Northern Ireland, and in spite of all the difficulties and tensions, enormous efforts are being made to work across the divides. It is a pity those divides are there. There is polarisation and sectarian activity which forces people from one community to another. We all reject that kind of activity. We have to keep on working to break down the barriers to trust and confidence. That is precisely what I said to Deputies Kenny and Rabbitte about trying to deal with these issues. Even this summer we have seen people being driven out of their homes because they are Catholic or Protestant. People on both sides have been petrol-bombed. These are things we have to continue to work against and I do not think any new force will change that.What I said with regard to paramilitary activity is that it is five and a half years since the ceasefires of the IRA and other groups were called. There has been paramilitary activity between then and now, which is regrettable. I said we had stretched our minds in order to tolerate that, so as not to throw away the whole process, but to keep on working to try and resolve it. If we were to jump every time there was an issue we would never have got to where we are now. We do not like what is happening but, as has been said by me, Tony Blair and many of the party leaders both here and in Northern Ireland, we have had enough of that and what we now need to do is see the end of that particular period of paramilitary activity forever. That is what we are trying to do.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I am glad the Taoiseach has rebuked Mr. Trimble for his remarks about the Republic and for his comments as reported. It is important that we should not be afraid to set out our stall in respect of our own part of this island.I previously raised the matter of the Barron inquiry with the Taoiseach, arising from the instruction given by the British Ministry of Defence that members who were working in 1974 should not give information to the inquiry on the bombings in Dublin and Monaghan. The Taoiseach undertook to raise the matter with Prime Minister Blair in Brussels. Did he do so, has there been a response and is he now happy that the British authorities are co-operating satisfactorily with the Barron inquiry?Will the Taoiseach give an update on the investigations into alleged espionage by elements of the republican movement? Is he concerned that prison officers in the North intend to take mass leave on an organised basis because they fear that their personal details may have fallen into the wrong hands?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	96	I raised the issue of the Barron inquiry with Paul Murphy and he assured me that they have done an enormous trawl of their records and additional papers have come to light. I do not know what they contain but I think they are some of the ones sought by Mr. Justice Barron. They continue to do their utmost to comply with the wishes of Mr. Justice Barron. Paul Murphy assured me personally that he will do all he can in regard to the inquiry, just as his predecessor as Secretary of State, John Reid, had been doing. There are issues which are still being addressed.There is not much news to report on the inquiry. The Deputy is aware that there is ongoing litigation in some of the cases and that one of the individuals being held was released as no case was found against him. Concerns have been expressed as to why he was questioned in the first place which is another serious matter. Those investigations are continuing and I am aware that there are concerns about the details and in regard to correspondence. More will come  to light on that issue but it is better to say no more about it pending the outcome of the cases.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	97	What is the Taoiseach's assessment of Mr. Adams's speech at Monaghan where he said that he can foresee the day when the IRA will disband? Does the Taoiseach attach any hopeful connotations to that? How does he assess it, in terms of the IRA statement of a few days later about a withdrawal of co-operation with the de Chastelain commission?Mr. Adams says that the IRA will not disband at the behest of the Unionists or of the British. Does the Taoiseach agree that it is, in fact, the overwhelming majority of Irish people that has expressed that request?Has the Taoiseach had an opportunity to consider the draft motion that I circularised to him and other party leaders? Does he believe that a motion something along these lines calling for the disbandment of all paramilitary organisations, including all sections of the IRA, could be helpful at this juncture? Does the Taoiseach not agree that it would be a powerful political and moral authority to press on the republican movement the necessity of disbandment or decommissioning?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	98	As I said in my reply, I took encouragement from the statement by the President of Sinn Féin, Gerry Adams. I do not know to what extent the IRA can come to an end of its activities. What I see as the most important features are those aspects of paramilitary activities such as the procurement of arms, training, targeting and criminal activity north or south of the Border. They are the key issues and what happens at the end of the day will be a matter for the organisations themselves. The offending aspects that continue to create the problems and difficulties are the ones on which we should try to keep our focus. We will certainly do that as we move forward.I hope to be in a position to reply to the Deputy in a few days in regard to the motion. I agree with the sentiments expressed in it, with some additions, because if we are to pass a motion of the House with which everybody will agree then we must include all elements of the progress achieved to date. I expect to pass an amended version to Deputy Rabbitte in the next few days for his consideration and, hopefully, his support.

Following on the earlier question in regard to the ongoing reality of the lives of the people on the Short Strand, has the Taoiseach any plans during a future trip to the North of Ireland to visit the interface communities, specifically the community in the Short Strand, which would undoubtedly draw significant succour from the interest that his presence would demonstrate? It is an important matter for the Taoiseach to con sider and I strongly urge him to do so. I look forward to a positive reply.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	100	That is a matter I would consider. As the Deputy knows, I have done it before. It is always necessary to balance these occasions across the communities but I do not have a difficulty in that.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	101	Is the Taoiseach aware of any specific proposals which he or the British Government intend to table at the discussions on Thursday which might bring about an early restoration of the Assembly?I agree with previous comments that the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation is a valuable entity to prevent a political vacuum opening up but it is necessary that we now concentrate on new proposals to bring about a restoration of the Assembly as soon as possible.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	102	I do not expect any proposals. The British Government's position centres on the speech made several weeks ago by Prime Minister Blair where he put down what he is prepared to do, providing other things happen. We must wait and see how close we come to that. We have made our contribution as well.Tomorrow's meeting will be co-chaired by both Governments in the persons of Secretary of State, Murphy, and Deputy Cowen. Hopefully, we will at least produce a working document to continue the search for progress, if not a conclusion.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	103	Before coming to the Order of Business, I propose to deal with a number of topics under Standing Order 31, dealing with three different issues. I propose to deal with these separately and I will call on Members in the order in which they submitted notices to my office.
#JamesBreen	unknown-#JamesBreen-party	unknown-#JamesBreen-dob	unknown-#JamesBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I propose the Adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to discuss an item of national importance. The reduction in the number employed on community employment schemes is an attack by the Government on the most vulnerable in our society. People who have done marvellous work in our communities are being told there is no more work and they should return to the dole queues. This is surely false economy. I ask the Minister to reconsider his position, maintain the numbers involved and continue this valuable community service, particularly in areas where there is no public transport.

The House should have an opportunity to debate and set out a timeframe for the implementation of measures whereby we, as a State, could cope with such a disaster, as pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Sargent, yesterday during Leaders' Questions.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	112	I pressed an amendment to No. 14 to a vote yesterday and I do not wish to do so today. Following the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting later, would it not be important to provide more time tomorrow for discussion of the Estimates to allow those vocal Government backbenchers who have been opposed to certain measures in the Estimates to come into the House to express their opinions?
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	113	The Deputy is too kind.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	118	It will arise tonight when those Deputies will have to vote.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	123	Many people await the outcome of the meeting. The Taoiseach gave an assurance to the IFI workers in the lounge of Cork Airport that the €5,000 down payment would not compromise negotiations. Is he aware an offer has been made to them and they must sign irrevocable documents if they accept the €5,000?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	124	Has the Deputy a question on legislation?

Aer Rianta wants to build a runway and Fianna Fáil backbenchers do not support that. The air navigation and transport Bill is promised and I want to know when it will be—
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	130	The Deputy is well aware of Standing Order 26.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I am and that is why I am asking about promised legislation. The air navigation and transport – Montreal Convention – Bill is to come into force by the end of 2002. Is that true?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The Taoiseach will answer the Deputy's question on the legislation.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	133	The air navigation and transport – Cape Town Convention – Bill will  enable Ireland to ratify the convention dealing with international financing of aircraft. Preliminary work on the draft heads is expected over the next six months or so. The legislation will not be introduced until the second half of next year.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	134	One of the key features of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, is social and affordable housing. Will the Taoiseach confirm that the Government will undermine its policy by accepting a levy in lieu of serviced sites from builders?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	135	A question on legislation.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	136	This relates to the building control Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	137	In reply to Deputy Sargent, I should have mentioned that there is a second air navigation and transport Bill relating to the Montreal Convention. It will give the Montreal Convention, 1999, the force of law in Ireland before the end of 2002 in common with all other EU states. The heads of the Bill are expected within the next fortnight and the legislation will then be finished.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	140	I was trying to be helpful to Deputy Sargent.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	142	The heads of the building control Bill have been approved and the legislation is due—
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I asked about the social and affordable housing proposal. Has the Government decided to impose a levy which will be absorbed into the Government coffers?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	144	That does not arise. I call Deputy Gilmore. If Deputy Allen does not resume his seat, we will move on to ordinary business.

I refer to a related regulation, which will cap rent allowances paid by health boards and is being prepared by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I suspect Fianna Fáil backbenchers have not heard about it yet but it will create further grief for them before the dust settles on the first-time buyer's grant.

Is the Taoiseach aware the regulation is being prepared? What answer will he give to tenants, to whom he has denied legislation to protect them for the past three years?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I am amazed Deputy Gilmore has raised this issue because in this instance the Minister is trying to control and regulate landlords.

#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	162	The final part of the question is out of order.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	163	The heads of the oil pollution of the sea – civil liability and compensation – amendment Bill are expected in December and it will be taken next year. The Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) (Civil Liability and Compensation) Bill, 2000, has been referred to select committee. The heads of the suppression of unlawful acts against the safety of maritime navigation Bill are to be cleared by Christmas and the Bill will be introduced next year. The Sea Pollution (Amendment) Bill is to give effect to the protocol of 2000 of the International Convention on Oil Pollution Preparedness, Response and Co-Operation, 1990 and to develop maritime emergency capabilities. The heads of that Bill are almost complete and it will, hopefully, be introduced next year. Most of this legislation will be dealt with next year.

#PaddyMcHughIND	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-party	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-dob	unknown-#PaddyMcHughIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	231	Young people are a nuisance. We must not provide them with any facilities to receive a proper education and we have to ensure that if they have notions about buying a house, they will be put in their respective boxes. We must remove any assistance on which they have relied to put in place the last few euro to clinch the deal. The same can be said for rural Ireland and its inhabitants. They are a drain on the economy. We have never given them any recognition and that will continue.Let me hasten to add that the foregoing is not my view but, from my perusal of the Book of Estimates, it certainly appears to be the view of its author, the Minister for Finance, and the Government collectively. The totally unacceptable conditions in which young people are educated are set to continue. The deplorable standards of our national schools, some of which were sub-standard 30 years ago, are being allowed to continue without improvement. The cutbacks in the provision for the national school building programme amounts to a real reduction  of 8%. The Government parties should bow their heads in shame for allowing terrible conditions to prevail in our national schools, which would cause a revolution in Third World countries.The abolition of the first-time new house buyer's grant is the most evident attack on young people that has emanated from the Estimates. It means that such people will not now be able to purchase new houses and will end up on local authority housing lists. Unfortunately for them, the prospect of obtaining local authority houses has also been hit because there is a reduction of 9% in real terms in the finances available for local authority and social housing. The Government backbenchers who are now in revolt can stop going through the pretence of making representations to the Taoiseach and his Ministers because I can tell them what the outcome will be. It will be a fudge, a pretence of replacing the grant by increased mortgage relief or some similar concession. Those backbenchers should start claiming the credit immediately.The contempt in which rural Ireland and its inhabitants are held by the Government is obvious from the anti-rural bias in the Book of Estimates. Under the provisions included in the Estimates, the condition of rural roads in particular is set to decline. A 25% decrease in funding under the CLÁR programme will strike an enormous blow to areas of the country that have witnessed the greatest decline in population in recent years. The CLÁR programme was hailed two years ago as the saviour of rural decline but the shambles that is the Government's rural development policy is exemplified by a cut of 29% in that programme.A cutback of 11% in the finances available for water and sewerage services will impact on small villages and towns that have been on the waiting list for such facilities for years. Any hope such towns had of enjoying prosperity is totally dependent on adequate services being provided. The savage cutback in a budget which was already inadequate is an indicator of the Government's lack of concern for rural areas.

#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	233	According to the programme for Government, the current Administration has a vision of rural Ireland in which young people will have a choice between attractive options. It is committed to developing radically the social and physical infrastructure of rural areas. If the cuts signalled in the Estimates are anything to go by, however, the only options on offer will be the old ones of emigration and poverty. That is because the only radical change to be made on foot of these cuts will be detrimental and will undo whatever benefits have occurred over the past few years.The proposed cuts in the area of forestry plantation are a disgrace because they target the most vulnerable section of our community and go  against the grain of rural regeneration. The rural affairs budget is being slashed by 26% and this will have serious implications for programmes such as Leader and CLÁR, which should be expanded to attract increased participation instead of being subjected to these restrictions. Other areas to suffer include installation aid for young farmers, which is down by 75%. It is bad enough that rural communities should have to suffer the effects of the overall cutbacks in public spending, without also being subject to the isolation and deprivation that will inevitably follow the cuts in funding for rural development.I contest the Government's current claim that it must introduce these cuts because revenue sources are not as lucrative as had been envisaged. In recent weeks we have seen joyous announcements from the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources on new gas finds and new exploration licences. Yet, the State is not guaranteed a single cent in revenue or royalties from hydrocarbon reserves because any downstream benefits have effectively been given to the multinationals. This amounts to a scandalous give-away of our natural oil and gas resources.Future generations will shake their heads in wonderment at how a Government that pleaded poverty as it attacked the most vulnerable in society could at the same time be delighted that our oil and gas potential, worth billions of euro, was left in the hands of unscrupulous and dishonest multinationals who in other countries would have to stage a military coup to secure the operating terms they receive here. The revenue from our oil and gas reserves could have funded an economic golden age, as it did in Norway. All the multinational companies have to do, however, is pay for a tent where their Fianna Fáil friends can donate money to the party at the Galway races. That is all we are aware of at the moment, although the role of Ray Burke in charging for licences might make one think otherwise.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	234	I was very moved yesterday to see one Minister after another coming into the House to boast proudly about how they had increased departmental spending over the past two years. They failed to realise, however, that the central criticism of the Government is that it allowed current spending to get out of control. They blew the boom for the purpose of getting re-elected and, while no one wants to cut spending coming up to an election, they have had to apply the brakes since. The Government has crashed the economy with Lord knows what long-term consequences.I was amazed by the Taoiseach's response yesterday when we sought time to debate the Estimates. He said he thought it was strange because there had not been such a debate over the past few years. The lack of any critical analysis of the previous Government's spending is possibly the greatest problem. The Progressive Democrats, the so-called watchdogs, sat at the Cabinet table,  yet they did not analyse Government spending. Do they know so little about economics that they were able to watch Ministers throwing money at their respective Departments, at a growth rate of 20%, and not realise that it was madness to do so?One of the reasons there was no such debate – it is one of the broad issues we need to address – is the lack of analysis of how we should spend public money in a developing society. It is increasingly clear that the partnership process, which was originally designed to bring about peaceful industrial relations, has taken over the role of this House in analysing budgets and the legislative way forward.Another reason there was no critical analysis over the past two or three years of Government Estimates is that most political parties bought into the partnership process. My colleagues in the Labour Party were probably getting a line from ICTU that said, "All is well, we've got the wage increases we want, keep things quiet, we are happy enough with the way things are". Meanwhile, my colleagues in Fine Gael might well have been getting a line from IBEC that said, similarly, "All is well, in our case we are doing particularly well, thank you very much, we have halved our capital gains tax liability and have massively increased our profits so we would prefer if you didn't rock the boat too much".

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	236	It is about time this House started debating exactly what the Government is spending and it is about time the Government itself came up with some vision as to what it stands for and how it wants to develop the country. I get no sense of that, however, from the Book of Estimates. In every area, it is not just the amount of money we must question but also how we are spending it.Much attention has been paid in this debate to forestry and I regret the cuts in that budget sector, but it depends where the cuts are made. I do not want to see isolated communities covered with Sitka spruce at the lowest possible cost, just to produce low quality timber. I want to see investment in the highest quality of wood-producing plantations. I am, therefore, not just querying the amount of money that is being spent, but also the development strategy involved.In yesterday's debate, the Taoiseach was asked why we had not invested in broadband technology, and he replied that it would be a great idea if we invested in broadband but, unfortunately, the private sector does not seem particularly interested. He said it is a terrible pity, but that is the decision of multinationals. We have to take a lead because the State has a role in developing the country's infrastructure. The Estimates provide the blueprint for that but the Government does not seem to have any interest  in or vision of how to develop the country – it believes the market should decide everything.As the Minister is aware, the Green Party takes a strong position on the issue of transport. The one area in which the Government seems to have vision is in the provision of motorways. A massive budget of €1 billion per year is being spent on building motorways that the National Roads Authority says we do not need. We are therefore pouring money into the provision of motorways at a level of capacity which is not required.Money has also been poured into health without really questioning how we are mixing our public and private health services. We need a much longer debate on the Estimates. The House needs to start analysing exactly how the Government is spending our money and on what. Such analysis has been lacking so far but I hope that, given the renewed criticism both here and in the country at large, we will be able to hold the Government to account for its complete failure to manage the economy.

If he says the country does not need more motorways and I say it does, then there is a certain clarity in that which I appreciate. Perhaps we need more of this in politics. That is where we stand and if Deputy Ryan's party is prepared to say on the 9 o'clock news that the country does not need more motorways, that is fine.

I do not take from Deputy Ryan's sincerity but if all of us spent a lot of money then all of us in the House did it. Every single Member, in speech after speech, called for that spending and I can show the Deputy the speeches in the Library. Maybe that can be explained by saying we had money. It was there and we were trying to catch up as a country. The health service needed a huge boost  from €3 billion to €9 billion. The public service needed to take on 30,000 extra people and it did. We were trying to catch up and that additional spending was necessary. In any case we had it and the Opposition side was right to call for all of that. It is important to be clear on this.

The Estimates for 2003 provide for expenditure of over €1.8 billion in this area in the coming year and is confirmation of our continuing commitment to delivering infrastructure projects which will be the foundation of future expansion and economic growth.The Estimate for this year shows an increase of 3% over the comparable 2004 Abridged Estimate figure. This will enable me to progress the development of key projects in the roads, public transport and aviation sectors, all of which require investment. Approximately €1 billion of this funding will be used to continue the national road development programme. To put this funding in context, since 1997 some 60 major projects, covering approximately 400 kilometres of  national roads, have been completed or are under way. In that time the level of investment in new road construction has risen from €330 million to €1 billion for 2003. That is a threefold increase in a couple of years.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Did the condensing of the roads programme into a short period of time lead to construction price inflation that almost halved the value for money we are getting from that roads budget?
#SeamusBrennan	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-party	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-dob	unknown-#SeamusBrennan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	257	The Deputy has a point. The huge investment in roads and the speed at which they were being constructed did add to construction cost inflation. I acknowledge that. There was a big push to get more roads and enormous funds were being put into this, which obviously pushed up prices. That is not going to happen in the coming year because construction cost inflation is down considerably.During 2001 alone some 50 major projects, with a combined length of 106 kilometres, were opened to traffic. Those included the Dunleer to Dundalk stretch of motorway in Louth and the bypasses at Croom and Adare in Limerick, as well as Mountcharles in Donegal. At the beginning of 2002 work was under way on some 20 major projects covering 200 kilometres of national roads, including nearly 130 kilometres of motorway or dual carriageway standard. New stretches open to the public included the Enfield relief road in Kildare on the N4, the N7 parkway in Limerick and the N18 Newmarket-on-Fergus bypass. The provision of €1 billion for the national roads in 2003 will allow for funding of major construction works, including work on the Dublin port tunnel and the south eastern section of the M50 motorway. Work will also continue on the M1, including the Drogheda bypass in Louth, the N7 in Limerick and Kildare, the N11 at the Glen of the Downs in Wicklow and the Ashford-Rathnew bypass. Funding will also be provided for the Youghal and Ballincollig bypasses in Cork as well as for work on the Knock-Claremorris stretch of the N17 in Mayo. Progress on these projects will be carefully monitored in the course of the year and I will consider whether additional projects can be commenced within this financial allocation. I will also be looking for public private partnerships and other funding mechanisms to increase the level of development in the roads sector.The other significant allocations include the provision of €53 million for national road maintenance and almost €41 million for the Dublin Transportation Office. The latter allocation funds measures such as quality bus corridors – more of which are needed – the strategic cycle network and the implementation of traffic calming and street improvement projects. These include pedestrian routes, facilities for the mobility impaired and the development of local integrated land use and transport framework plans.Despite the welcome reduction in road deaths, which are down 13%, and serious injuries, which on the basis of Garda figures are down 40% on the last few years, I am progressing initiatives aimed at lowering what is still an unacceptable level of deaths and injuries on the roads. Financial support for these initiatives is included in the Estimates in the provision of €5 million under roads and related services, while €2.7 million is provided for the National Safety Council. These allocations include funding for the Medical Bureau of Road Safety, which undertakes analysis of alcohol content of samples and approval and supply of equipment to the Garda. Support for the penalty points system is also included. The Road Traffic Act, 2002, provides for penalty points to be applied in respect of a wide range of offences, the commission of which have a potentially negative effect on road safety. These include excessive speed, running red lights, poor lane discipline, non-compliance with stop and yield signs and a number of other offences related to vehicle safety, driving licences, seat belts and so on. Excessive speed is still recognised as the most significant contributor towards road accidents and I have therefore asked that the highest possible priority be given to the introduction of penalty points for speeding offences on a stand-alone basis initially. This has been operational since the end of October and I thank the Garda and everyone involved in getting it off to a good start. We must keep the pressure on. Extension of penalty points to all the offences in the Act will be pursued in the course of 2003.The National Safety Council is a key player in the promotion of road safety and delivery of the goals in the Government's road safety strategy. The council undertakes various awareness and educational activities including radio and television advertising, promotional and educational literature and support for local authority activities.There is a total public transport allocation of €668 million for 2003. This allocation provides €400 million for investment in capital funding for public transport. The Exchequer investment will also be augmented by EU funding amounting to approximately €90 million next year, which brings total capital investment for next year to approximately €491 million, which compares favourably with the level of funding provided in 2002. This will allow for major expansion in capacity on mainline, suburban and DART services. It also facilitates completion of the upgrading and expansion of Heuston Station and continued investment in a comprehensive railway safety programme.This continues the unprecedented level of investment in public transport which started in 1999 and it will ensure that the development and expansion of the public transport network in Dublin and the regions is maintained. I am committed to achieving a greater use of public transport, to providing extra bus corridors and  additional cycle and pedestrian ways and to bringing the public transport service to a high level. I will leave the discussion of investment in airports and aviation to another time.These Estimates for the Department of Transport, which show a 3% increase over the 2002 Estimates, will allow for a strong level of investment activity in roads, railways, public transport and aviation for the coming year.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I wish to share my time with Deputy McManus. Public debate has, understandably, focused on the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant because that is the first cutback in the Book of Estimates to be implemented by the Government. Opposition to the abolition of the grant has been led by this side of the House and I am glad to say it has been enjoined by several Deputies from Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. Deputies on the Government side have, justifiably, expressed their concerns at the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and its impact on young people attempting to buy a home for themselves.However, I draw the attention of Government Deputies to the Labour Party amendment to this Estimates motion. There is no point in voicing opposition to the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant in their constituencies unless they are prepared to vote with the Labour Party on the proposal. If Government Deputies vote for the Estimates they are, in effect, voting for the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant and no amount of talking around the question will change that fact. They would be wrong to think the dust will settle on this controversy.I draw Government Deputies' attention to another cutback being implemented by the Government in the area of housing. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has announced that she is putting a cap on the amount of money a health board can pay in rent allowance and rent supplement to low income tenants. Health boards pay rent supplements largely to tenants in the private rented sector who are in receipt of social welfare payments. The Minister herself estimates that approximately one third of all tenants in the private rented sector – between 50,000 and 60,000 tenants – are in receipt of rent supplement. Arising from these Estimates the Minister has decided that this rent supplement is to be capped and the tenants concerned exposed to the full impact of rent increases, of which many landlords have already notified them, to take effect on 1 January next.To add insult to injury the Minister has issued a statement saying this is being done to curb increases in rents and control inflation. If the Minister and the Government want to do something about curbing private rents they should cap rent and not cap the rent allowance which is paid to the poorest tenants.There are three major cutbacks in housing arising from these Estimates: the first-time buyer's grant; the capping of rent allowances by health  boards; and the financial cut in local authority and social housing programmes in the Book of Estimates itself. These programmes are to be cut, in money terms, by 5% but when one takes construction inflation into account this amounts to a 20% cut in the social housing programme for next year.That cut itself comes on top of other cuts in important infrastructure. There is to be a cut of 3% in water and sewerage services, at a time when the country is being taken to the European Court because of our failure to protect the Irish environment. The grant to the Heritage Council is to be cut by 17% and the grant-in-aid to the Heritage Council by 10%.Most importantly for many Members of this House and for people who value local services, the local government fund is to be frozen. No increase is provided in these Estimates for local authorities. We saw what happened following the flooding last week. Local authorities are unable to maintain drains and surface water systems as it stands but no additional resources are being provided for local authorities which must now set about addressing their own estimates in the next couple of weeks. This will, in turn, result in direct cuts to local services.
#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	259	In the early hours of this morning I accompanied an elderly woman to my local hospital. As we speak this 90 year old is still lying on a trolley in the accident and emergency department. She has received excellent care from people who are working extremely hard in the most appalling conditions, which are more appropriate to a Third World country. The conditions are dilapidated and, in ways, unsanitary. If St. Colmcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown were getting its entitlement a new hospital would have been built in its grounds. Maybe if it were in the Minister for Health and Children's constituency a new hospital would have appeared by now. Situations such as this, when a 90 year old woman lies on a trolley in an A and E department because there is no space for her in a ward, are a constant daily reminder of the Government's failure to address the problems in our health system.The Book of Estimates tells a sorry tale. The deepest and biggest failure for which the Government is responsible is its failure to live up to its own promise to deliver medical cards to the 200,000 people who are struggling to live just above the GMS income limit and who need them most. This promise was made clearly by Fianna Fáil and I have no doubt people voted for that party on the basis of that commitment being honoured.I listened with horror today to the Taoiseach deflecting blame away from himself and placing it, as usual, anywhere but on his own desk. In his usual fashion he said the money was not available and that the general medical scheme was very costly. That is not true and the Taoiseach should know better. The GMS is one of the few areas of  the health service which the value for money audit found to be good value. The audit did not find the Department of Health and Children or the health boards good value but it did find the GMS was such.Since then, because of Government decisions and its gross incompetence, the costs of the GMS have gone up and a new inequity has been introduced into the system. When the over 70s scheme was being negotiated, the Minister for Health and Children was guilty of a cowardly capitulation to the doctors and paid over the odds for the extension of the GMS card to people over 70. He did not even know how many people over 70 there were in the country. His Department miscalculated the figure at half the true number. The responsibility for the failure of the Government to deliver a health service to people on low incomes lies with the Taoiseach and his Cabinet. We now see people suffering as a consequence because they are unable to pay their family doctors.Drug bills, as the Minister constantly tells us, have gone up. There are issues to be addressed in relation to international pharmaceutical companies but Government intervention has also contributed to the rise. Government intervention determined that many treatments to prevent heart failure are now excluded from the drug budgeting scheme which applies to GPs. It is a very good thing that Government decision was made. GPs are now in a position to provide costly treatments for patients to keep them out of hospital and to keep them healthy. However, that decision has a cost attached. It has a cost that should have been assessed and estimated by the Government and should not now become a mysterious increase meaning that the Book of Estimates has to be drawn up in a way that denies proper funding, for example, for hospitals. In this regard there is a 5% increase.The major Dublin hospitals are currently operating with a shortfall of €100 million for this year, which they will have to carry off and will be the first to be paid off next year. We will see major cutbacks and a reduction in resources and services to patients. The Taoiseach will come into this House and try again to deflect any responsibility from himself and his Cabinet.It is deeply regrettable that an opportunity that existed to ensure people could have decent health care has been squandered by a Government that had five years to deal with the issues that need to be addressed and is not only failing to deal with them at present, but is deepening the crisis in the health service because of a right-wing bias in respect of its political outlook.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I am very pleased to be making a contribution to this most important debate. In May of this year, the people rewarded competence, ability and a strong track record of delivery by returning the same Government to power for the first time since 1969. They cast clear verdicts on the main opposition parties – Fine Gael was brushed aside, while the Labour Party was frozen in its tracks. Fianna Fáil and our partners in Government, the Progressive Democrats, were returned to the helm of Government because the people responded to what we had achieved since 1997. Our mandate was greatly increased because the people had faith in an Administration that would guide them through the harder times ahead.It is worth restating just some of what this Government has achieved over the past five years. Over 300,000 additional jobs were created, with unemployment reduced from 10% to 4.5%; long-term unemployment was reduced to 8%; annual growth levels reached highs of 8% to 10% and the national debt was reduced from 74% to 36%; there was €5 billion in personal tax reductions, with tax rates coming down 12 points over the period; old age pensions increased by almost 50%; and over €8 billion has been invested in the national pensions reserve fund to support our social welfare and pension needs for the future. This legacy, when set against any measurement, signifies genuine social progress and achievement. It is uncomfortable reading for the Opposition, which never came close to implementing policies that have had so positive an impact on so many of our people.Even those with only a scant interest in economics knew the downturn in the economy was coming long before the general election. In fact, our Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, was heavily criticised for not holding the general election a year earlier. For some strange reason, certain media and political interests have forgotten the foot and mouth crisis, 11 September in America, the downturn in the IT sector and the thousands of jobs lost towards the end of last year. To suggest that the people knew nothing about this is absolutely preposterous.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18147	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	261	They certainly have not forgotten the manifesto or the promises on the health strategy.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	262	We now face more challenging times, especially in the context of a global recession. Time and again during the general election, the Taoiseach and other Ministers made the point that we had come through a sustained period of economic prosperity and that, through no fault of our own, we now have to chart more difficult waters.We must not fall into the trap of talking ourselves into a recession. Despite what is thrown around by a floundering Opposition, the Irish economy remains one of the most robust in the EU. Most of our fellow countries still look with envy on our progress and strength. Our projected growth rates will still be a multiple of the EU average. The challenge now is to bolster these gains and make the choices that will allow our country to fully avail of the benefits that will accrue when a global upturn begins.The Government is only five months into a five year programme of Government, which will build on what has been achieved since 1997. We face tougher times and tough decisions have now to be made to secure our prosperity going forward. We stated clearly in our election manifesto that our strategy for the future was "predicated and dependent on continued economic growth". Put simply, this means that to ensure our commitments are delivered, we need to ensure continued economic growth. This in itself is a strong and necessary argument for reining in public spending. This means prioritising and being prudent.We now know that these prevailing conditions are less optimistic than we would like them to be. We are not in recession and must not talk ourselves into one. There will be no return to the bad old days of the 1980s and the purpose and resolve of the Government will remain strong.The Estimates we are debating are a road map that will guide our country carefully and competently through more difficult times. Good government is not about pretending that everything is possible at once: it is clearly about making hard decisions when required.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	18147	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	263	That was good electioneering.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	264	We were re-elected on a strong record of achievement and have pledged ourselves to deliver on An Agreed Programme for Government, just as we delivered fully on its predecessor. Our programme is a blueprint for progress over five years, not five months. These Estimates will allow us to order our priorities and ensure that the plans we have set before the people can be delivered upon fully over the coming years. Were we to plough forward without some restraint on public spending as set out in the Estimates, we would be guilty of gross irresponsibility.We could take the soft option and borrow at unsustainable levels as before, but this is not the way of this Government and this Taoiseach. To do so would be to betray the people and place us at a disadvantage when the inevitable upsurge comes in the international economy. As a Government, we will be spending €36.7 billion next year, which will allow us to largely sustain the services we have built up over the past five years.We have made our priorities clear and will continue to concentrate our focus on the main areas of social inclusion. Next year, over 64% of our resources will be concentrated on health, social and family affairs and education, representing increases of 6%, 3% and 3%, respectively. We are spending over €1 billion on housing and will also not be neglecting our roads and transport system, which is so vital to future economic development and in respect of which over €1.5 billion has been allocated for next year.In my own area of defence, the Estimates agreed for 2003 will allow us to build significantly on what has already been delivered from the  White Paper on Defence. We have prioritised our requirements for the coming year and will be proceeding with major equipment purchases, which will include a further 25 armoured personnel carriers, a replacement anti-armour weaponry system and eight new turbo-prop trainer aircraft for the Air Corps. We will also continue to deliver on our refurbishment and modernisation at barracks, on which we have spent over €150 million since 1997.Our country is at a critical crossroads and the wrong choice of direction would have serious consequences. The Government has chosen the direction of maintaining spending at a sustainable rate without resorting to borrowing. We cannot spend what does not exist, and to fall into the trap of reliance on borrowing to shore up short-term benefit would undoubtedly see us on the slippery slope of lengthy dole queues and emigration, which so blighted our country in the 1980s.These Estimates are an expression of responsibility and strategic thinking by this Government. In the face of the downturn in the worldwide economy, we have taken the hard choices now to secure our prosperity for the future. This Government, and the Fianna Fáil Party that leads it, have a strong track record of delivery and competence. We will not fail the people now at a time of critical importance for their future.

I have real problems with the fact that Opposition spokespersons in different areas are now being given five minutes to make their case in respect of the Estimates. It is a total nonsense that the whole country is talking about Estimates and cutbacks, or adjustments as Fianna Fáil Ministers like to call them, and Opposition spokespersons who are supposed to be the critics are given only five minutes to make their case.In the four or five minutes I am allowed, I want to make a few brief points. I am surprised to hear the Minister saying we all knew long before the election that there was an economic downturn on the way. One would not think it reading the Fianna Fáil election manifesto. These cutbacks just confirm for people that the election manifesto we saw and which has resulted in giving this new Government a mandate was a lie. It was a lie to 200,000 people who thought they would get medical cards and now will not get them. It was dishonest to companies which were given assurances that the Government would ensure a quick and efficient roll-out of broadband technology, but it now appears that will not happen.There will be also cutbacks in the primary schools building programme and increases in third level fees. Some 10,000 first-time buyers  each year will be affected by the removal of the first-time buyer's grant. There will also be cutbacks in the national development plan affecting capital programmes across the country. The Government secured a new mandate by deceiving the people.I am responsible for overseeing the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It has been hit hardest by the cutbacks and adjustments. For economic reasons the Government is making the biggest mistakes in this Department.According to surveys Ireland has become the most uncompetitive country in Europe in terms of telecommunications infrastructure with the result that the country is rapidly becoming uncompetitive in terms of attracting foreign investment. Foreign companies, which are the cornerstone of our economic prosperity, will not invest here unless they are provided with the telecommunications infrastructure they expect. However, the Government proposes to cut the regional broadband and technology programme by 27%. Multimedia developments will be cut by 87% and telecommunications infrastructure investment will be cut by 57%. What message does this send to European and American companies who look to Ireland as a place to invest because of its quality workforce? We cannot provide them with the infrastructure they require and which they can get elsewhere. It is short-sighted, blinkered economics that makes no sense in the interest of securing relatively small savings. We should not be afraid to borrow modestly for capital investment and infrastructure because it is an investment in the future.The marine faces potentially difficult times as negotiations commence on the Common Fisheries Policy, which will be crucial to the country, especially to coastal communities. The Minister has cut funding to BIM by 12%, supports to the fish processing industry by 31% and developments in fisheries harbours, some of which are perhaps in the constituency of the Minister for Agriculture and Food, by 3%. It is not a vote of confidence in the fishing industry.The decisions on forestry are perhaps the most extraordinary. The Minister has decided to cut investment in forestry by 22%, or €23 million. For every euro that is cut from the planting programme the rural economy loses at least €2 in direct investment because cuts in the rural planting programme mean the loss of matching funding from the European Union. The savings envisaged in this area will not only put approximately 1,000 people out of jobs, some of whom will have to join the dole queues, but the Government will lose from the tax they pay and matching funding from the European Union. It makes no sense economically. I strongly protest at these cuts.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I will confine my comments to the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, which I oversee. The cuts in investment in the film industry will have severe consequences. The  cut of 12% in the capital income of the Irish Film Board will affect what the board will be able to do in 2003. Internationally, film financing faces great difficulties, as demonstrated by the closure in the United Kingdom of Granada Films, Film Four and Sky Pictures, all of whom financed Irish films. This cut will make it even more difficult to finance Irish medium and higher budget films.A number of €1 million feature films have been made by the Irish film industry this year in addition to one big United States film, "Rain of Fire". However, if the Irish Film Board is not properly financed it will mean that major films will no longer be made here and the industry will be confined to making low budget films. That will have a major impact on the industry and will also impact on Ireland's recognised reputation for film production. In addition, a recent survey by Bord Fáilte indicated that 14% of Americans cited Irish films as the reason they visited Ireland. The Minister is also responsible for tourism and he should note that the cuts envisaged for the film industry will have a knock-on effect on tourism.The arts plan, 2002-2006, forms part of An Agreed Programme for Government. The plan calls for funding for the arts in 2003 of €53.7 million, a €6 million increase on this year. However, the Estimates propose a reduction of €4 million. It will mean that much of the plan will be long fingered. Will the Minister indicate if the Government has now abandoned the plan? It was launched before the general election and promised much to the arts world. It is now a non-event and has no credibility. I call on the Minister to clarify the Government's position on the plan.With regard to forestry, a recent economic analysis has indicated that the Government will lose €1.1 million in revenue if it implements the cuts outlined in the Book of Estimates. They will also result in the loss of €44 million to the rural economy and the loss of 1,000 rural jobs. In addition, if the cuts are implemented over 20 million forestry transplants will be destroyed, resulting in a loss of revenue of over €4 million. The rural economy will be devastated by these cuts and I appeal to the Minister for Agriculture and Food to use his influence to stop this madness as soon as possible.The Book of Estimates proposes a cut of 41% in the funding for the provision and renovation of swimming pools. The previous Government gave a commitment that every child would have access to a swimming pool and would be given the opportunity to learn how to swim. Despite the fact that approximately 41 applications involving major swimming pools have been made, each averaging €5 million, the Estimates only provide for funding of €9 million. This is another major U-turn by the Government. It means that many swimming pool projects will not proceed, including some in the Minister's constituency.The funding for SFADCo, the only regional authority in the country, is to be cut by 13%. This will affect the type of service SFADCo will pro vide for the tourism industry and small indigenous industries in County Kerry.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	269	These Estimates are framed against a background of changing economic and budgetary circumstances and after a period of unparalleled growth in the economy and in public expenditure. In relation to my brief, it is worth recalling that agriculture remains more important to Ireland than to most other EU member states. Evidence of the ongoing commitment to the sector can be seen from a series of special actions undertaken over recent months for the benefit of this sector in recognition of the particularly difficult market and weather conditions. These actions included obtaining EU agreement on a number of occasions to strengthen significantly market supports for dairy products, securing EU agreement to allow the use of set-aside land for grazing and fodder, negotiating the removal of the Russian county ban on beef exports and obtaining EU agreement to allow an increase by up to 30% in beef export refunds to assist the beef industry in agreeing contracts for exports to Egypt. There are some reductions in this year's Estimates but we must recognise the gross Vote figure for 2003 will allow us to continue the Department's various schemes.I welcome the enhanced control and accountability measures proposed by the Minister for Finance. In the case of my Department, we have a well developed control system and I very much appreciate the advice on control and risk that I receive from my Department's audit committee, which comprises five members who are external representatives. My Department strives to be at the forefront in developing best practice in corporate governance. It also has a well resourced internal audit unit of 19 staff and is subject to a high level of external audit from a number of different sources, both nationally and from the European Union. It has also implemented a new financial accounting system which will both drive the development of the management information framework and further enhance financial reporting and control.Next year's overall provision for animal health, disease eradication and related measures is €228.5 million, which is lower than the projected 2002 outturn of €268 million. Nevertheless, it reflects a positive outlook for improvements in this sector which is to be welcomed. For 2003, €67 million is being provided for the operational costs of the TB and brucellosis eradication schemes. While the present position regarding both diseases is encouraging, it is imperative that the stringent regimes in place are continued for some time yet, notably the carrying out of regular TB and brucellosis testing on all cattle in the national herd. As regards TB, the number of reactors this year is expected to be down compared to 2000. The ongoing improvement in the brucellosis situation in recent years is, I am glad to say, con tinuing with new restrictions so far this year down by 55% on the comparable date in 1998.In 1996, when new arrangements for the TB and brucellosis programmes were put in place it was envisaged that annual receipts from the bovine disease levies would contribute at least 50% of the cost of compensation to farmers. In reality, the annual return from these levies has fallen far short of projections. The Estimates provision envisages a doubling of the current rates of levy and I will be bringing this proposal before the Oireachtas in due course. It is further intended that some of the costs currently borne by the Department in relation to BSE testing and the disposal of meat and bonemeal will be transferred to the industry.BSE has been the focus of major attention over the past decade or more. In this country we have put an enormous amount of time, effort and money into protecting consumers of Irish beef at home and abroad against the threat posed by BSE and into eliminating the disease from the national herd, and we are increasingly seeing evidence that our efforts are now paying dividends. The most noteworthy illustration of this has been the significant shift in the age profile of animals showing up as positive for BSE. As I have said, the measures which we have put in place throughout the 1990s, particularly since 1996, worked well. However, our battle against BSE is not yet over and we must be vigilant at all times. It may never be the case that we will know everything about all aspects of the disease, and we can realistically expect to get the odd surprising case, as evidenced by a very small number of animals born in 1997 which have to date turned up positive. However, we are on course to meet our objective of eliminating BSE from our cattle population.The food industry has made significant strides in recent years. State funding has enabled it to keep up with ever-changing consumer trends and demands through investment in research and development, training, marketing and promotion, as well as in plant and equipment. In 2001, our food and drinks industry was valued at €16 billion of which almost €7 billion was exported to over 130 countries worldwide. Having been instrumental in forming a dedicated food promotion agency, I take great personal satisfaction in the achievements of Bord Bia since 1994. Bord Glas has been promoting and developing horticulture since its establishment in 1990. Over the years it has made a considerable contribution to the development of horticulture in this country and has established a record of which it can be justifiably proud. The allocation this year for Bord Glas is €2.330 million. Both Bord Glas and Bord Bia have performed extremely well, fulfilling their statutory roles in an exemplary manner. However, there is always the need to look ahead to new challenges and the food sector might be better served by pooling expertise and amalgamating these bodies. In the interim, the boards of  both bodies will have to consider changes to some of their respective schemes and activities.Given the tight budgetary situation this year, an allocation of €82.819 million for Teagasc general expenses, which includes a grant for capital purposes, is a measure of the Government's continuing commitment to supporting it as the provider of a wide range of research, training and advisory services for the agri-food sector and rural communities. While the allocation is a reduction on the 2002 allocation, it should be remembered that it is an increase of almost 30% on the 1997 allocation of €52.97 million.Many of the Department schemes are demand led and in the past few years participation in some schemes has fallen below initial expectations. However, despite this, provision has been made within the overall 2003 Estimates allocation for additional funds, over and above the 2002 projected outturn levels for the rural environment protection scheme and on-farm investment programme expenditures. In the case of the national development plan's agricultural measures, €31 million is being provided in 2003, which represents a 19% increase on the 2002 expected outturn. The measures involved include on-farm investment and the development of equine and cattle breeding infrastructures. A total of €503 million is being provided for the three agricultural measures contained in the CAP rural development plan. In the case of the agri-environment programme, REPS, the 2003 allocation of €190 million represents an increase of 10% on the 2002 expected outturn. I fully recognise the importance of this measure in assisting compliance with Ireland's environmental commitments. I have commenced a consultative process on the scheme with a view to determining possible improvements and changes. The outcome of that review will be considered in tandem with the independent evaluation of the CAP plan to be undertaken in 2003.The overall allocation for the agriculture sector is substantial. This allocation follows events such as foot and mouth disease and BSE, when the Exchequer, and by definition the taxpayer, provided substantial support to the sector at short notice. The Government has stood by the industry in times of difficulty and provided support when it was needed most. As I said, the Estimate for my Department must also be looked at alongside the €1.6 billion in EU spending on agriculture, which is not included in these figures. In 2003 we will spend a total of about €2.8 billion on the sector, and that is a huge commitment in anyone's terms. We are entering into a period when we will have to exercise restraint. It seems our critics want to have both sides of the argument: criticise if action is not taken and criticise the impact when action is taken. Being in government entails taking hard decisions and we are prepared to do that, not in a way which undermines the fabric of our internationally sound economy, but in a way which protects our com petitiveness and secures our future growth and prosperity.

#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I am glad to be able to contribute to this debate for a few minutes although any Deputy could go on for hours. As a rural Deputy, I detect a clear anti-rural bias in the Estimates. One has only to look at the savage decrease in the allocation for non-national roads and the negative consequences of that for the highways and byways where people live in rural Ireland. The implication of that for county councils will be savage and it will be interesting to see how it is managed. There is apparently no real increase in the equalisation fund for local authorities. In addition there is a failure to honour the commitment to increase the income limit eligibility threshold for medical cards for the 200,000 people to whom it was promised and a reduction of 5,000 in the community employment schemes which are vital to many tidy towns associations and local clubs throughout rural areas, particularly in my constituency of Westmeath. I want to focus today, however, on the proposed abolition of the first time buyer's grant.Of all the cutbacks proposed by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, the removal of the grant to first time buyers is the most savage. At a time when people earning even reasonably good incomes are struggling to buy any kind of house or apartment, and when the local authority housing waiting lists are at their longest since the 1960s, the Minister has put yet another barrier in the way of people on low to average incomes wishing to acquire even the most modest homes.The Minister must be aware that many people rely on this grant as part of the funds they have to provide to obtain a mortgage. People on low incomes who qualify for affordable housing will be very badly hit because the first time buyer's grant is factored into the amount they must pay from their own resources.An example of that is Westmeath County Council which has been to the forefront in the provision of affordable housing. Affordable housing comprising of 31 houses has been developed in Grange Park, Mullingar, where the benefits of the new house grant can be seen because all the applicants have availed of the grant. Westmeath County Council affords the applicants loans on the basis that they will receive the first time buyer's grant. If the grant is no longer available, that will have a significant impact on the scheme.A further scheme of 55 houses for Ashe Road in Mullingar is proposed for 2003, and 60 houses at Lissywoollen in Athlone. All those people who otherwise would be dependent on Westmeath  County Council for rehousing were in a position to surrender their houses and get a loan with the help of the €3,800 grant, thereby giving somebody else an opportunity to get a local authority house. Those people will now be deprived of that opportunity which means that even the other schemes the Minister lauds and asks the local authorities to implement will be impacted in a negative fashion by this savage imposition affecting many people in the lower income category. Those people will now be pushed out of the owner occupier sector and on to local authority housing waiting lists. Is the Minister aware that there are now more homeless people here than in the cities of Manchester, Birmingham and Bradford combined?The Government has been boasting about the increase in house completions over the past five years. While the number of new houses completed has increased, the Minister is well aware that many of those houses are either holiday homes or luxury homes aimed at wealthy purchasers. What the auctioneering profession rather dismissively call starter homes are rarely featured in the property supplements and those seeking them must be prepared to spend up to three hours per day commuting to and from them. Every week in the property supplements there are advertisements for holiday homes, all of which are constructed under tax relief schemes. Such is the shortage in the greater Dublin area that some people are driven to buying houses up to 60 and 70 miles away, some even as far away as Deputy Harkin's constituency of Sligo-Leitrim. I recently met a taxi driver who works in Dublin but who lives in Ballymahon, County Longford, and the only way this man can survive is by working at night. He has to drive 70 plus miles to and from his home at off-peak times. That is the current position.What about the quality of these starter homes? I listened to a discussion on "Five Seven Live" in the past week which outlined the appalling experience of many people buying new homes who find they are poorly constructed, with many of the regulations being flouted with impunity.Does the House recall the rapid abandonment of the threat from the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, to deal with the hoarding of building land? Could this reversal of policy have anything to do with the fact that the largest owners of building land in Dublin are also among the largest contributors to Fianna Fáil?It is very revealing that the area of housing the Minister first targets for spending cuts is the first time buyer's grant. Why did he not target the tax breaks available to the wealthy to buy investment properties? As many as one third of the houses and apartments in new developments are being purchased by investors since the Minister restored interest relief on borrowings for such properties. The rationale for this reversal of policy was that the supply of rental accommodation had been reduced by the restrictions imposed in 1998. As returns on rental properties are now falling, there is no shortage of rental properties and  therefore little reason for continuing this subsidy to the very well off. The only justification is that the Minister is determined to protect the interests of the wealthy at all cost and so ensure that all cutbacks hit only those who have benefited least from the economic boom.We are all aware that the wealthy have the easiest access to the Minister, whether they are entertaining him in their villas in the south of France or in their tents at the Galway races. What many people seem to realise is that the Progressive Democrats, in addition to having the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in Government, also have, if not in fact at least in spirit, the Minister for Finance. The Progressive Democrats have an explicit and unapologetic programme to redistribute resources to those who are already well off by reducing public expenditure and ensuring that the tax burden on the well off is minimised. The Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has been their faithful acolyte in doing so. I have much more to say on this matter and I intend to return to it.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	273	I thank Deputy Penrose for sharing his time. If it were not so serious it would be funny that the Opposition Members have a variety of items to choose from in the Book of Estimates to raise in this debate.I live in south Kildare where a number of builders have decided that their market is for people on low incomes. They have set out to obtain and develop lands in that regard and, as such, the shared ownership scheme is of major significance to the people concerned. The maximum loan available under the shared ownership scheme is €139,000. The Minister for Finance appears to be able to abolish the first time buyer's grant at will but I am sure that the many people in Athy and south Kildare who are involved in the shared ownership scheme would be glad of that €3,800. If the Minister was trying to buy a house in Athy or in south Kildare, where the builders have put together magnificent developments to facilitate these people, he would realise that €3,800 is a lot of money and is necessary to obtain the cherished aim of so many people, that is, a home for themselves and their families.The changes in the community employment scheme are disastrous for rural Ireland. The telephone has not stopped ringing since they were announced, with local groups concerned about their future. Everyone wants to know if the changes will affect their area because these people know the value of community employment. Community employment has put them back into the workplace where they received the necessary training and gained confidence in themselves. Reducing the number of places by 5,000 will have a negative impact on the confidence these people gained, the training they received, the work they were able to do and the benefit to the local community. These places were reduced with the stroke of the Minister for Finance's pen,  as anyone involved in voluntary organisations across the spectrum knows to their detriment.In regard to medical cards, the Minister tried to defend that cut on a television programme last night, but he could not do so. Anyone who saw the programme would have to admit that he had no defence to the argument being made. The people affected believe they have been hoodwinked by the Government because they are being deprived of their medical card, which is a basic necessity. The Minister had no answer to that last night. He said he cannot do all things at once but before the election the Government was able to do everything. It was amazing what could be done before the election but the pot now has a hole that cannot be plugged. The Minister for Health and Children, who is present in the Chamber, bears responsibility in terms of the changes to the medical card scheme and many people are disappointed with that aspect of the Estimates.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline for the House the broad details of the Estimate of health spending for 2003.The increase of €694 million for the health services announced by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in last week's Estimates represents a 9% increase year on year in current spending. It also represents a significant proportion of the net increase in the overall Estimates, taking up the majority of the additional spending. This demonstrates more than anything else the Government's commitment to the health services and our determination to protect them and resource them adequately, even in an economically tougher year than we have become used to. I acknowledge to the House that 2003 will be a difficult and a much tighter year than previous years because the rate of growth is not similar to the extraordinary rates of growth in spending in recent years.The additional €694 million allows us in 2003 to continue the roll-out of services in some key areas identified in the National Health Strategy. Bed capacity is one of these. The Estimates provide €53 million to complete the programme of 709 additional beds already undertaken this year. This was a target that exceeds what was provided for in the strategy. Together with the 2002 investment, this means a total of €118 million is being invested in bed capacity in just two years. I am confident this additional funding will bring substantial benefits to the acute hospital system.The improvement of primary care services is also a key strategic issue for the health services. Six weeks ago I announced the 12 pilot projects to which we are committed in the strategy and which are to develop the new multi-disciplinary team approach to primary care. I am pleased the funding in the Estimate allows me to allocate an additional €10 million for the development of primary care, including general practitioner co-operatives. There has been tremendous progress in  GP co-operatives in recent years. They provide a 24-hour GP service thus reducing pressures on accident and emergency departments. Patients now have an alternative service and can be more appropriately treated by a GP. There has been a virtual transformation even in a short space of time and this has not always been acknowledged. General practitioner co-operatives are a concept which were not regarded with enthusiasm by doctors a few years ago but that has changed. Doctors across the country are now queuing up to establish co-operatives. Two years ago the base funding was less than €5 million or €6 million and last year it was €17 million. We are now adding up to €27 million to €30 million and that is significant progress in a key area of preventative medicine.The additional funding in 2003 also allows me to provide for a range of increases across other key areas. I am allocating a further €29 million in additional funding for cancer services. This will enable us to continue to address demands in this area and in particular to respond to the increasing cost of oncology drug treatments which has been a media topic in recent weeks. There has been tremendous developments in cancer treatment in recent years, compared to earlier in the decade. We have appointed up to 76 additional consultants. Additional oncologists mean significant drugs bills and other developments. These are to be welcomed because it represents more internationally accepted application of protocols in terms of the treatments. The National Health Strategy identifies the need for a national health information equality authority. It is envisaged that the authority will become the lead agency to advise Government and practitioners and hospitals about the best evidenced-based protocols for the application of new drug therapies and new health technologies. That is the best and most effective way forward and is the policy framework within which we intend to provide both oncology and all other drugs.The Estimate also makes provision for €31 million for the treatment purchase fund in 2003. We were not in a position to spend €31 million last year but we will do so this year. The contacts have been established with the hospitals here and overseas. The focus of the fund is on those waiting for low-acuity treatments such as cataract operations or orthopaedic treatment. Some cardiac operations have already been carried out. The funding being provided in 2003 means that more than 7,000 people currently on waiting lists can be treated, in particular those who have been waiting longer than a year. This will result in a significant improvement of quality of life for many people.It is an important statistic to note that over the past three years it is estimated that an additional 139,000 people are being treated as in-patient or day cases in acute hospitals. These are phenomenal activity levels and demonstrate this Government's commitment to the public hospitals sys tem. In 2000, 870,000 people were treated and in 2001 it was 920,000. I hope 960,000 will be treated by the end of this year. Those levels of increases in hospital activity were not experienced in previous years. This has obviously created pressures on the acute hospitals but it is important to acknowledge that fact.The staff in the acute hospitals have increased productivity significantly. There are increased numbers of people being treated and discharged. In 2003, the €31 million provided for the treatment purchase fund is in addition to €43.8 million being provided for the waiting list initiative to enable hospitals to pursue continual reductions in waiting lists and waiting times. Waiting lists have been reduced by 22% since 1997. In specific specialities such as cardiac surgery, there has been a reduction of 41% over the past two years and that is a dramatic improvement. Children's cardiac surgery has seen an effective reduction because of the use of overseas hospitals for operations while the capacity at Crumlin is being developed.Another key achievement is in relation to the reduction of group C meningitis. In 2001, 35 cases of group C meningitis were reported compared with 139 cases over the same period in 2000. This represents a 75% reduction overall. The most dramatic reduction in the age groups targeted by the vaccine was in the five to nine age group, which recorded a 93% reduction in the number of cases. That vaccination programme costs an enormous amount of money. In the initial year it cost €50 million. Some of that cost was a once-off cost because of the huge catch-up element involved. It is the kind of expenditure that is often forgotten about in debates about health but it makes a significant difference to mortality figures and to quality of life for children. An additional 340 consultants have been appointed since 1997, an increase of 26%. In the four years to 2001, the number of individual nurses and midwives employed in the public health system rose by 5,788 which is a 19% increase. The number of nurse training places is up to 1,640 and the number of people applying for places on nurse training courses is up by 35% this year.While much has been made of the increase in the level of administrative staff, it is well recognised within the health service that about two thirds of that number are involved in front-line services for patients. The appointment of a consultant also involves the appointment of a team of workers and general administrators are involved in that team. They are the people who arrange appointments and organise schedules. We require a more informed debate on that issue because a certain class of worker is being scapegoated to a certain extent in terms of health spending. Many of these administrators are not on high salaries and that should be noted. I acknowledge the need for organisational and structural change. The year 2003 will be a significant year in terms of structural change. That process is under way in the context of the con sultancy study on the health structures. We are expecting a report in early February.Between 2000 and 2001, additional revenue and capital funding for intellectual disability and autism services has provided around 840 new residential places, 296 new respite places and more than 1,500 new day places, in addition to the enhancement of other services. Funding for 2002 for services for people with intellectual disabilities and autism was €38 million, and an additional €13.3 million is now being provided for 2003. From 1997 to 2002, more than €175 million in total was provided for physical and sensory disability services. In that period, we provided an additional 51 long-term residential places, 95 residential respite places and 400 new day care places. An additional €13 million in revenue funding has now been announced for 2003.Services for older people received total additional funding of €256 million between 1997 and 2002. We have also established a PPP pilot project to create 850 additional beds in units in the Eastern Health Board region and in the Southern Health Board region. I regret the current fiscal position does not allow me to extend medical cards. Nevertheless, the Estimate provides additional funding of €230 million to meet the increased costs of the GMS scheme in 2003.Management consultants have been appointed to examine the rising costs within the scheme. Given the escalation of the costs also in the drug payments scheme, my Department is examining a restructuring of the scheme which will involve an increase of the existing threshold. The overarching framework for the development of our health services will be the health strategy. We have already commenced 70% of the actions identified in that strategy and we are committed to its implementation.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	275	When the Minister was announcing these Estimates last Thursday, the roof fell in on a school in my constituency, St. Killian's in Kingswood. I have with me a number of letters I received from schoolchildren and other TDs will have received similar letters. They are basically looking for repairs to be done to their schools or schools to be replaced.Many TDs would say this is no major issue, that they have the same problems in their own areas. What I suggest we do, however, is send these letters to Charlie McCreevy because it is he who is going to stop these young children from getting repairs done to their schools. He can tell nine-year-old Amy Lawrence why her class has to put up with an asbestos roof that leaks every time it rains. Christopher Byrne wants to know why there is no provision for indoor PE facilities so he can learn to play rugby because he cannot go out to play when it rains. Laura O'Loughlin in fifth class wants gates erected to prevent stray dogs entering and fouling the schoolyard. David Dillon, aged 10, admits he may not be an expert on these matters but believes his classroom's leaking metal roof, damaged windows, graffittied  walls and profusion of vermin suggest that his school is in desperate need of repair. Sean Fitzpatrick wonders why politicians can bring relative peace to the North but cannot make a school a safer and nicer place.Other schools in the State have their problems, and I could go through a whole list of them. The reality is that the Minister is cutting back on repairs to schools and on the building programme. In an address to the INTO, the Minister for Education and Science suggested that 3,200 primary schools were unsafe and posed a health and safety risk. At least he was honest about it. The Minister for Finance is saying the cutbacks he is proposing will not damage anybody or have a major impact on people's lives. Any child in a schoolyard will tell one a bully picks only on those who are smaller. It is clear the people being picked on will be the most vulnerable sections of our society.Other speakers have talked about cuts in community employment schemes. At a community employment scheme meeting I attended last night in St. Agnes's Community Centre I was told there were 15 people on the scheme 18 months ago and that in January 2003 there will be only two people. The reality is that this centre will close. It is a centre that has everything from FÁS schemes to child minding services. A children's nurse attends the centre and various other services are provided.TDs and those in the gallery know people will be devastated by these cutbacks. What we are seeing – James Connolly's statue is just behind me – is an example of ruling by fooling. The Government fooled the electorate, claiming there would not be cuts. We were then told they were not cuts, simply adjustments. Now we are told this will not have any major impact. The reality, however, is that those who will be most affected will be from the most vulnerable sectors. The rich will not be asked to tighten their belts. It is clear from the Estimates and previous budgets that the rich will get richer and the poor will have to fend for themselves. This budget is skewed towards the well off, and they will not be affected by these cuts. The marginalised, the poor, the disabled and the elderly will unfortunately suffer from the cuts outlined in these Estimates.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	277	That is a new revelation.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The last Government, of which the Minister opposite, Deputy Martin, was also a member, spent in a manner reminiscent of the Roman Empire when the patricians in their togas would sit around gorging themselves and getting as full as they possibly could before going outside and vomiting. There is an element of a stink about these Estimates that is reminiscent of those  times. The last Government did not know what to do with the money so it threw it around with fairly wild abandon, in a way that did not change the overall inequalities in society to any great extent. It certainly did not make us any more sustainable in terms of long-term thinking and energy use, for example.Unfortunately the disadvantaged are going to be worst affected by these Estimates. I could go into detail about schools in Swords, Malahide, Balbriggan, Skerries, St. Margaret's, Kinsealy, Portmarnock or small areas such as Hedgestown. The Minister for Education and Science would have received letters relating to all these areas, yet spending on first level education is down by 13% and by 4% on second level. There is a general pain being felt in many of these places now that they realise their hopes are evaporating.We are all aware of the situation in regard to first time house buyers. Some of these people have contacted me saying they have signed contracts and are now unable to proceed with the purchase of their houses. They are submitting the forms anyway, hoping against hope that the Government might have some degree of mercy on their plight.The Minister for Health and Children talks about a high activity level. The high activity levels I see in Beaumont Hospital are the trolleys shifting inwards and outwards like a parking lot to accommodate staff and to find privacy for people who need examination. The Minister would know this if he went to see it for himself. The Green Party was not unrealistic, we could see the pain ahead. I hope nobody will say this is to do with prudent management because the Minister for Finance is not being prudent here. He talks about prudent economics and yet he is not able to live within the means of this country.We are expending more energy and are definitely out of line in terms of our international commitments under the Kyoto protocol, even though they are modest in themselves. When I hear the Minister talk about living within our means, I ask him to please realise that as a country we are not living within our means in terms of energy use or use of resources, and that is where the Minister needs to focus his attention.

In 1996 it was announced that a western investment fund worth £100 million was being set up to progress western development. When this Government came to power in 1997, that fund was cut to £25 million. Two years later, under threat of resignation from the chief executive of the Western Development Commission, some measures were put in place to set up the fund. After constant delays and foot dragging, the fund became fully operational this summer, with its full complement of staff and  confident it could spend its allocation of €6.3 million in 2003.Last Friday that fund was decimated. It was cut by 68%. What defies belief is that Minister Ó Cuív came into this House last night and said these cuts reflected "the likely demand for funding for next year" when he and his officials know that last Monday, the western investment fund gave approval for projects worth $1.6 million and next month will likely give approval for projects worth more than €500,000. In these two months at the end of 2002, the western investment fund is committing the entire amount of money the Minister has allocated for all of 2003.The Minister and his Department knew this, yet the Minister could stand up in the House last night and say that even with the cut in the western investment fund it would meet likely demand. This fund is only up and running. The Minister is cutting off its oxygen supply. It is the greatest slap in the face for western development, and that it should come from Minister Ó Cuív is almost beyond belief.CLAR funding has been cut by 25%. Minister Ó Cuív came to my constituency just a few weeks ago to celebrate the first birthday of CLAR. Did he tell the people there that there would be a cut of 25% last Friday. When Minister Ó Cuív launched the CLAR programme in Leitrim just over a year ago, he described it as the start of the big fight back. As far as I am concerned, last Friday was the start of the big cutback, with a 25% reduction in the allocation to CLAR and 68% from the western investment fund. The Government has given up on balanced regional development.

These submissions will be of assistance to my Department in its evaluation of the requirements for a viable public private partnership to procure a national stadium. Examination of these expressions of interest by an assessment panel, which is chaired by the Secretary  General of my Department and whose membership comprises senior officials from the Department of Finance, the Office of Public Works, the National Treasury Management Agency, the Attorney General's office and Campus Stadium Ireland Limited is ongoing.I attach a great deal of importance to ensuring that this process is managed in an open and transparent manner. Accordingly, there have been no contacts or discussions between myself or my officials and parties interested in providing the stadium, other than to seek clarification on points of detail in some of the expressions of interest received. I have, however, taken steps to ensure that the major sporting bodies involved in the stadium project are kept abreast of developments.

As he will be aware, UEFA will make its decision regardless of whether the Irish soccer bid will be successful on 12 December. If a decision has been made by that time on whether the stadium will proceed by way of private investment, surely that would boost considerably the chances of success of our bid. Will the Minister be more definite about a date on which he will make a decision? If the decision is made after that date, it will certainly reduce our chances of being successful in securing the hosting of this important tournament.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	282	I assure the Deputy that the Government is fully supportive of the joint bid for the European Championships in 2008 which, as he correctly pointed out, will be decided by UEFA in December. I have no doubt that it would certainly help if we were in a position by then to state categorically where precisely we hope to host the games in so far as they apply to this country. In that respect, the Taoiseach has written to the GAA authorities requesting them to make Croke Park available for the European Championships in 2008 in the event of the bid being successful. In addition to that, I have explained that we are examining the expressions of interest from all 23 parties and it is hoped that we would conclude the assessment of these expressions within a short period following which I would be obliged to go to Government with a recommendation.It must also be remembered, although it is sometimes forgotten, that the option of Lansdowne Road remains a live one. In other words, it has never been the case that we were putting forward only two venues. It has always been the case that there were three possible venues, two of which might be made available. That remains the position.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I am glad the Minister is coming around to my way of thinking at the start of this process, that Lansdowne Road is a possibility. If there was a joint proposal from the IRFU and the FAI, is he still considering that a revamped Lansdowne Road may be the solution to our stad ium problem? Is he aware of the importance of being successful in our bid to host the European Championships? The games would attract approximately 90,000 overseas visitors to this country, bring in approximately €50 million and expose us to a television audience of seven billion people in 200 countries. Therefore, it is of major importance. I am sure the Minister would agree that if we go with something definite to UEFA on 12 December, we will be successful in our bid, but if we procrastinate we will not be. I would like to hear something more definite on the proposed stadium.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	284	There will be no question of deliberate procrastination. I am anxious, as is the Deputy, that this bid should succeed. He correctly pointed out that securing it would be of major benefit to our economy in terms of the revenue that would be generated, the visitors who would come here and the exposure to a cumulative television audience of seven billion worldwide. As I said on previous occasions, that would be advertising one could not buy.In addition to that, every effort is being made to finalise the consideration of the expressions of interest to ascertain how we will proceed from here. Lansdowne Road has never been excluded and is not excluded at this point. Our bid has every chance of success. I think it remains the best available option for UEFA. I say that because it appears the other favourites are the Austrians and the Swiss who have made a bid. My understanding of the position is that at least four stadia would have to be built before the games could proceed. In addition to that, I understand that in relation to at least one stadium, a stadium in Geneva, there is considerable difficulty regarding its cost. It also appears that the construction of one stadium would require a referendum to be held in Switzerland regarding the use of a piece of land. People should not be pessimistic about the Scottish-Irish bid. It is very advanced and it deserves to be successful. It has the wholehearted support of Members of this House, in particular the Opposition spokespersons on sport.

Over the past five years grants to the value of €213 million have been allocated to some 2,900 projects under the sport capital programme and it is now timely to consider the impact of these allocations and to formulate a new strategic plan for the provision of such facilities in the future. As the Deputy's question intimates, there are many complex issues to be addressed in structuring the audit such as the standard, size and type of facilities to be recorded and establishing a reliable base on usage patterns.It is intended to set up an inter-agency steering group to plan and oversee the project. This group will be chaired by my Department and will comprise representatives of the Departments of Education and Science, the Environment and Local Government and Health and Children and the Irish Sports Council. There will also be local authority involvement in the project.

Is he aware the first paragraph or two of his reply is basically a rewritten version of an earlier reply? I had asked for some elaboration. What is the timeframe for this inter-agency process which would include an audit of sports facilities? Is the Minister aware that until now we have been operating in the dark in terms of planning and development of sports facilities and efficiently managing their use because we do not know exactly what sports facilities we have? Is he aware that in the UK pilot studies have been done by regional and local authorities in which they have been able to pinpoint the location of sports facilities, the requirements for certain sports facilities and, therefore, plan more effectively?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Carrying out an effective and comprehensive national audit of local facilities is a major undertaking in terms of complexity and time. For instance, the Sports Council in Northern Ireland is just embarking on a similar exercise and is allowing a period of five years to complete the task. It is a smaller geographical area with a smaller population and an administration where local authorities have been directly involved in the provision of sport and leisure for almost 100 years.The first step would be to appoint a steering group to oversee the development of a long-term strategy for sports facility provision which, in turn, will commence the planning of the audit. I understand a number of local authorities have already become involved in carrying out an inventory of sports facilities in their areas and the Department will closely examine the methodology, standards and parameters used by them. It  is not clear yet how successful, comprehensive or accurate these local services are proving to be. I agree with the Deputy that we do not really know precisely what facilities are available at this point. However, over the past five years 2,900 projects have been approved and the total spend has been of the order of €219 million. The sports capital programme for next year has a provision in the region of €60 million.There is no point pretending an audit of this nature will be easy or will be done in a brief period. We must look at the question of the type of facilities we have, their usage and location. We must then seek out deficiencies or lacunae which exist and seek to fill them where possible. If it is to take up to five years to complete a study of this magnitude in Northern Ireland, the probability is that it will take even longer here.

Does he intend, through the Irish Sports Council, to ensure all information is provided, including participation levels in schools by age and gender, and participation among the elderly? Will he ensure that we take into account the correlation between a school which has a hockey pitch and the number of hockey clubs in an area so that we can carry out an assessment of need on a geographical basis and provide the most cost-effective facilities while acknowledging that participation is what is most important because sport has a benefit which has a knock-on effect on our health care service?

The data contained in applications by various clubs and organisations will clearly be of assistance also. Of particular assistance will be the local sports partnerships. There are now 12 local sports partners up and running. It is my intention in the foreseeable future to ensure the concept of local sports partners is spread throughout the country. I hope this will involve a sports co-ordinator in each city and country. Such partners would be at the coal face of activity and would be in a strong position to return to the Department the kind of data the Deputy correctly said should be available. I sincerely hope we are in a position to progress the plan in the near future and that we will gather the necessary data so that we can fill voids where they exist.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	290	A process of major change in the institutional arrangements for the delivery of tourism policy is being undertaken at present. The new all-island tourism marketing body, Tourism Ireland Ltd., commenced operations in 2002. The Government this week in accordance with An Agreed Programme for Government approved the text of a Bill to establish the National Tourism Development Authority bringing together the functions currently carried out by Bord Fáilte and CERT. These new agencies require an up-dated policy orientation for their work.Up to 2001, there had been ten years of uninterrupted tourism growth and the expectation, both nationally and internationally, was of continued growth. However, recent major shocks, such as the impact of foot and mouth disease and the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001 have had a serious impact on tourism which when combined with adverse trends emerging in the global economy, has stimulated a stock-taking of the existing policy approach.We have reached a significant point in the evolution of tourism at which it is timely for the Government to oversee a major policy review and I recently informed my colleagues in Government of my intention to initiate such a review. This initiative is supported by the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation.I envisage the review will include an assessment of the performance and potential of the sector and the identification of key determinants of both an industry and Government strategy for the future development of the industry.It will be obvious to the House that the terms of reference for this project need to be carefully scoped given the broad range of external influences on the development of tourism. There would be a number of elements to this exercise; first, a review of the performance and economic impact of tourism in Ireland in recent years; second, a stocktaking of the total public funding and support for tourism development, its sources and modes of delivery and value for money; and third, to the extent feasible, an examination of trends in the international competitiveness of Irish tourism in terms of value for money, pricing, quality and service levels.The next major element of the exercise would be to assess future tourism market potential for Ireland in terms of priority source markets, categories of visitors, changes in holiday taking trends and level of international competition. All of that work should then enable us to start mapping out a revised strategy for the future development of the sector.Additional informationI envisage that the review will be led by my Department with significant participation by the tourism State agencies, the industry and, possibly, some other Departments whose polices and programmes have a significant impact on tourism development.As to working arrangements, a good deal of research and information already exists and this will be reviewed. The tourism agencies should be in a position to take on responsibility for large sections of the work. The work of any external consultants will be focused on areas where they can add value and where independent objective advice is needed.It is my intention that those involved in steering the exercise would meet as soon as possible and I hope the external consultancy exercise will be scoped and launched before year end. My objective is that the review phase of the work would be completed by March 2003 and that the strategy formation phase would be finalised later in the spring.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	291	I welcome the Minister's reply in relation to a review. Anyone with an interest in tourism will know it is long overdue. The Minister set out a rota of all aspects of this review which will have to take place. What timescale does he envisage? How long will it take for the review to be completed? I welcome the Minister's recent statement in which he said that in his tenure as Minister, he hopes there will be 5% growth each year. How does he view that in the context of Bord Fáilte's budget and the cutbacks in the recent Estimates? What is the Minister's vision for the future of the tourism industry as set out in the terms of the current review?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I wish Deputy Wall well in his new role as spokesperson for the Labour Party on Arts, Sport and Tourism. I have no doubt he will make a very constructive contribution to this area, as he did in his previous portfolio.It is hoped that phase one of the review will be completed in the near future. We anticipate it being completed by the early spring. Phase two of the review should be completed by late spring. The next stage will involve seeking to implement a selection of the main recommendations which are deemed to be most worthwhile.With regard to tourism in general, I anticipate that this year will be better than had been predicted. While the American market will be down by up to 10%, that is an improvement on the earlier forecast of a downturn of as much as 20%. The British market is indicating a potential growth of some 6% this year, bringing the total number of visitors from there up from 4.35 million to 4.6 million. I anticipate that the growth of visitors from the Continent should be in the order of 3%. The growth for the entire year should be of the order of 3%. That represents an outstanding performance because the backdrop, to say the least, was unenviable in respect of the difficulties in regard to foot and mouth disease, September 11 and the downturn in the global economy, which all contributed adversely to the performance of the tourism industry. In those circumstances the industry has indicated that it is extremely resilient and this should be remem bered in terms of growing the industry in the future.I am disappointed with the return from the Continent from where we continue to have far too few visitors. We have a market of some 400 million people on the mainland of Europe most of whom are, on average, a two hour plane journey away and yet our share of the market remains minuscule. I hope to reverse that in terms of future marketing strategies.

I hope to be in a position to take the matter to Government for further direction shortly.My Department's assessment is being carried out in light of the Government's stated commitment, as set out in the agreed programme, to ensure the construction of a state-of-the-art national conference centre. The context for this commitment is that conference business is such an important and valuable element of the Irish tourism product. It was worth an estimated €169 million to the economy in 2000. The number of overseas conference visitors in 2000 at 113,000, which is the latest figure available, represents almost a 200% increase on 1993 figures and underpins the substantial development of Ireland's stock of conference facilities over the same period.

Is another report needed to convince the Minister and the Government that the conference centre is essential?It is estimated that there are 4,000 conferences in Europe every year and Dublin gets about 40 of the smaller ones. The ideal conference centre would have a capacity of 2,000 to 3,000 as in the international conference centre in Birmingham which brings €100 million to that city every year.Will the Minister indicate if there is a commitment on this and if it will be honoured? If it is due to start, what is a possible starting date for the centre to be built?An agreement was reached between the Government and Treasury Holdings in regard to the proposal at Spencer Dock where planning  permission was granted for development of residential accommodation and a conference centre. Progress has been made on the residential aspect but what is the position in regard to the proposed conference centre?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	295	With respect to the original Spencer Dock proposal, the contract in regard to the grant offer of €33 million under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-99 terminated last year. That sum of European Regional Development Fund moneys is no longer relevant. It was not lost to the country, as I understand it was transferred to other programmes.Deputy Deenihan raised the question of where we go from here and whether or not a further report is necessary. I agree that one can have a surfeit of reports and many of them gather cobwebs and dust. It is necessary to get on with projects such as this rather than commissioning endless reports, departmental committees and so on, but at this point it is vital that any decisions we make are guided by the most up-to-date information possible. Circumstances have changed over the past number of years in regard to this business, as they probably have in regard to most others. It is also important that we look at where Ireland stands now, in terms of benefiting from the international conference market. In deciding on the way forward, it is important that we establish if there is a robust business case for the centre. My gut feeling is that there is such a case. I do not intend to have this going on forever and hope to have the assessment on the current position completed in the near future. It will then be necessary for me to go to Government with a recommendation.I agree with Deputy Deenihan that there appears to be enormous potential for growth in this area. If we were able to succeed in bringing in 113,000 people without a national conference centre it seems clear that we should be able to develop that business considerably, provided that we put the centre in place. I assure him that we are not raking over old coals in respect of the previous reports but we are trying to assess precisely what the current position is, with the intention of coming to an early decision.

I understand he has been approached by the National Event Centre in Killarney to consider it as a possible venue for the future.

While I would naturally like to see the regions, particularly Killarney, benefit, I  am afraid that the examination is confined to Dublin at this point.

Bord Fáilte will administer the funding under the terms of the Tourism Product Development Scheme 2002-2006. Decision-making in relation to grant allocations under the scheme rests with the two independent product management boards, one for each region.Grant approvals will be announced following final decisions on projects being taken by the management boards.

Will the Minister explain the delay in the assessment of the various proposals? When will decisions be made, particularly on cluster applications? A cluster proposal was submitted for north Kerry, which Shannon Development recommended as one of the most innovative in Ireland. When will a decision be made on that?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Once the applications were received it was a function of the regional tourism authorities and Shannon Development in its area to screen them. They were then forwarded to Bord Fáilte and examined. Product management boards were set up in the two regions to examine the applications. They are independent in the exercise of their function and the Department has no involvement in the assessments. Applications were invited under three different categories – the development of attractions, special interest pursuits and tourism and environment management.Detailed proposals and plans have been requested for 72 special interest projects or 53% of those presented. We have not yet progressed to the stage where detailed plans and specifications are sought in respect of the other two categories but the product management boards are progressing in terms of these categories. The reason for the delay is screening had to take place, initially followed by the assessments, and then details had to be sought from 72 applicants under the special interest category. The same  procedures will be followed with the other two categories.

It would not be in the best interest of the process to publish the names of the parties which responded to the request for expressions of interest while the assessment process is ongoing, but subject to the agreement of the individual consortia, I am agreeable to doing so on completion of the process.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Will the Minister provide a breakdown of the 23 expressions of interest in terms of whether they involve national or international companies? Where stands the €63 million gift from J. P. McManus? Is it dead in the water or can it still be activated if a public private partnership develops a stadium? Are the two main sporting bodies, the FAI and the IRFU, still fully committed to the project? There was a rumour in a newspaper that one of the associations was not as keen or committed in proceeding with the project as it had been.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	306	There has not been a major international expression of interest in the construction of a national stadium, although there has been some. In addition, the FAI and the IRFU are still extremely anxious that a stadium would be provided. Some of those who expressed an interest have been in contact with both bodies while the majority have not.With regard to the funding that was generously offered by Mr. J. P. McManus, he has not indicated officially as yet that the funding has been withdrawn. My understanding of his offer,  however, is that it was predicated on a national stadium being built with Exchequer funds.

I have received no indication from Mr. McManus that he has withdrawn it. Deputy Deenihan wonders whether hurling will be played in the national stadium.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	309	That is a condition laid down by Mr. McManus.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	311	With regard to the expressions of interest, was there a preference for Abbotstown or a city centre location? The Government, particularly the Minister, and the Department should exhaust all possibilities of undertaking a major revamp of the Lansdowne Road stadium before they embark on another long process examining different sites and proposals. I ask the Minister to examine all possibilities to upgrade Lansdowne Road with the IRFU and the FAI, including the proposal to turn the stadium 90º. Dublin Corporation, Dublin Tourism and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce are all very supportive of that proposal. Could such proposals be examined while the expressions of interest are also examined before the Minister makes a decision?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	312	Lansdowne Road has not been excluded from the equation. However, the refurbishment of the stadium would not come cheap. Providing the necessary facilities, for example, to enable the European Championships to be played there in 2008 would require expenditure in excess of €100 million. We have received expressions of interest from 23 different parties with a view to building a stadium and they are being assessed. It is hoped to decide whether we will proceed to tender in the near future.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	313	I propose to take Questions Nos. 55 and 75 together.Although my Department has no direct responsibility in this regard, it is nonetheless my policy to encourage the implementation of environmentally responsible measures by hotels and other establishments providing holiday accommodation.Under the Operational Programme for Tourism 1994-1999, funding was provided for a pilot tourism and the environment initiative to generate practical projects that would address issues where tourism and the environment interface. One of the projects supported concerned research on best environmental practice by tourism accommodation providers. This research resulted in the production of an excellent manual entitled A Natural Shade of Green – An Environmental Guide for Hotels. A similar guide was prepared for guesthouses. These practical guides, which address the environmental issues raised by the Deputies, including energy efficiency, conserving resources and waste reduction, provide a blueprint for best environmental practice for accommodation providers throughout the tourism industry.The maintenance of a clean, unspoilt environment is central to the Irish holiday experience and I encourage accommodation and all tourism product providers to enhance their reputation and help secure the future of the industry by adopting best environmental practices as set out in the guides.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	314	I am aware that A Natural Shade of Green – An Environmental Guide for Hotels was launched two years ago. Are there any initiatives in the Department to encourage other Ministers to enact legislation which would make it mandatory for hotels or guesthouses to have a minimum standard of environmental good practice? The Minister will be aware that this is an increasingly important aspect of marketing Ireland as a tourism destination. If we lose our green image, we will lose large amounts of revenue to other countries in northern Europe, such as Sweden and Finland. One can discuss the reasons there are not enough Europeans visiting this country but given the high level of environmental awareness among the Germans and the French, for example, will the Minister agree that any effort to progress this matter and to highlight our hotels and guesthouses as being environmentally friendly will only benefit tourism and encourage tourists from continental Europe to visit Ireland?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I strongly agree with the sentiments expressed by the Deputy. In the final analysis, it is a matter for individual hotels and guesthouses to decide what their position is in this  matter. However, I am encouraged by the fact that the Irish Hotels Federation has, over the last number of years, been preparing a waste management strategy and intends to launch it in the near future. Under the tourism development programme, 2000-2006, approximately €130 million has been provided to develop the Irish tourism product under three categories, one of which is tourism and the environment. It is my sincere wish that there will be innovative applications from people involved in the sector with a view to ensuring that the environment is enhanced and, where applicable, preserved.I intend to introduce a national tourism development authority Bill and we should address the environmental issue in that context. There is no point pretending that it could be a problem if people ignore the benefits of protecting the environment. In particular, it is something which might be usefully discussed during the debate on how best the new body might progress in terms of policy implementation. I hope to have the opportunity to address the issue again when that legislation is being discussed to see if it is possible, on a practical level, to insert a provision or provisions which would be helpful to the case made by the Deputy.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	316	The Minister will be familiar with the white flag award for leisure centres. Most of these leisure centres are located in hotels. Does the Minister think the white flag award could be extended to encourage hotels to become environmentally friendly in all their operations?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	317	Again, this is something which could be discussed in the context of the new legislation. Perhaps we should consider it when deciding whether certain hotels should be graded with one, two, three, four or five stars. It is extraordinary that this country starts grading hotels at three stars. I doubt that it is conducive to good marketing or is of assistance to the industry. One of the factors which could be taken into account in the future grading of hotels, for example, is the hotel's contribution to a cleaner environment. I look forward to hearing contributions from Members on all sides of the House to the debate on the new national tourism development authority Bill. I will be happy to discuss proposals which would be conducive to assisting the industry.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 65 and 80 together.The visit to Ireland by the UEFA inspection team on 16 September last was part of the bidding process for the 2008 European Football Championships. The team visited all 14 of the applicant countries to assess their general suitability for hosting this important event.The Taoiseach and I met with the team in the course of its visit to convey the support of Government for the joint bid submitted by Ireland and Scotland. That visit was a great success in terms of organisation and in satisfying UEFA's requirements and all the indications are that the Ireland/Scotland joint bid is very much in contention with a good chance of success in December. Subsequent to that visit, the Taoiseach and the Scottish First Minister wrote to UEFA reaffirming the support of the Irish and Scottish Governments for the bid and confirming their commitment to providing all the stadia necessary for the tournament.I have not had any meetings with UEFA since then and the bid process does not involve my meeting with UEFA before the final decision is made. However, I am aware that the FAI and members of the bid team continue to press its merits in ongoing contacts with the UEFA members involved in the decision-making process. The next milestone in the bid process will be a further presentation on the joint Ireland-Scotland bid by the bid project team to UEFA in Switzerland on 11 December. All the other bidding countries will make similar presentations, after which UEFA's executive committee will meet to consider all the bids and vote on who should host the 2008 finals. The successful bidder will be announced on 12 December.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	319	Does the Minister think it would be an advantage if the Government had a commitment from the GAA that it would provide the Croke Park stadium for this tournament? What type of commitment would be sufficient to satisfy UEFA? Would it also be helpful if the Minister had carried out the process of examining expressions of interest in providing a national stadium and had a more definite line that there were genuinely interested parties in that regard?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	320	The bid is not predicated for success upon us being able to identify the stadia, but obviously it would be of immense benefit if greater clarity could be brought to the situation.  Were the GAA to give a favourable indication about the use of Croke Park for the European Championships in 2008, it would certainly benefit the bid. There is no point pretending otherwise. The Deputy will be aware, however, that the GAA congress must meet to make a decision of this magnitude. Nonetheless, I hope there might be some indication forthcoming from the GAA as to the possibility of Croke Park being utilised during the championships. We cannot force that; it is a matter for the GAA.All Members of the House have outlined, on numerous occasions, the immense benefits which the championships would be to the Irish economy, the future of Irish tourism and the country's sense of place in the sports world. There can be no doubt about that. A greater degree of clarity would be beneficial to the bid. However, the Scottish/Irish bid is in a strong position at this point. I believe it is the best bid on the table.The main competition comes from the Swiss-Austrian bid which is predicated on the construction of four new stadia. In addition, in Switzerland a referendum must be held in relation to the availability of such land. There are difficulties also with the cost of the proposed stadium in Geneva. It is clear that six facilities will be available in Scotland and so the joint Scottish-Irish bid is in a strong position. We should be able to provide the relevant facilities and in that regard I hope the GAA will be positive.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	321	The Minister stated that the Taoiseach has written to the GAA concerning the request to use Croke Park, but has the Taoiseach emphasised the urgency of receiving a positive reply? We all know that a GAA congress must be held concerning this matter but, given the circumstances, time is of the essence. We should know where we stand before the assessment takes place rather than being in a grey area concerning the new national stadium and Croke Park. I welcome the Minister's statement that we are in a strong position concerning the bid to host the European football championships in 2008, but we would be in a far stronger position if at least one stadium had been decided upon before UEFA's assessment of the applications takes place. Have the Taoiseach or the Minister specified a date by which the GAA should reply to the request?All the residents associations in the area surrounding Croke Park have a major role to play in the application. I hope they will be kept on side as the relevant information becomes available. Has the Taoiseach set specific dates and has the Minister met with the GAA and the residents associations to discern whether they agree with these developments?

The association is also aware that a decision on the final destination of the European  championships for 2008 will be made on 12 December. I have attended at least one meeting between the GAA and the Taoiseach. Deputy Wall referred to the benefits which have been clearly outlined. I thank him for his support for the bid.

Will the Minister be going to Switzerland himself?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	324	No, I will not be going to Switzerland myself.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	325	He is away too much. I am making all his presentations.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	326	I have to mind my constituents as well. The management of football in Ireland is a matter for the FAI and any Minister would be extremely foolish to become involved in it. To be fair to the FAI, it has worked hard on this bid. It put forward a cogent case and has been supported at all times by myself and my predecessor, and in particular by the Taoiseach over a longer period. The Government is fully committed to the bid. Both the Taoiseach and I met with UEFA and we outlined to that association our total support for the joint Scottish-Irish bid. The Taoiseach and the Scottish First Minister wrote to UEFA outlining their commitment, indicating our wish to provide the necessary facilities for holding the 2008 championships. I am not sure we can advance the matter beyond that.The question of providing stadia sometimes overrides the passion for sport which is evident in large measure both here and in Scotland. Irish and Scottish football fans have been acclaimed worldwide for their good behaviour and sportsmanship. Ireland and Scotland can guarantee an audience in the stadia in excess of 1.7 million for the 2008 games, and few other countries could achieve that. We can go further and almost underwrite the fact that this will be achieved without violence.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	327	In view of the goodwill that has been expressed on all sides of the House, it is unfortunate that an all-party approach to our bid was not adopted at the beginning. It would have helped. There may be some benefit in sending an all-party group of Irish and Scottish parliamentary representatives to Switzerland to support the presentation.The Minister may or may not be aware of the soccer match that will take place here on Sunday between a team from the Oireachtas and the Scottish Parliament. It would be a good gesture if the Minister was to tog out on that occasion. The Minister's attendance at the match would be the  greatest expression the House could make in support of our application to host the 2008 tournament. The Scottish Parliament is enthusiastic about the match and is sending representatives to play here in Dublin. Such unity of purpose could ensure that we will host the 2008 competition.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	329	We are all togging out.

I wish Deputy Deenihan well with the game and I have no doubt that he will be one of the fittest men on the team.It would be churlish of me not to acknowledge that there has been all-party support for the bid, particularly among Opposition spokespersons who have expressed their support throughout the process. I do not believe that a late intervention by a political deputation would be of any benefit to the bid. UEFA acknowledges that there is all-party support for the bid and that the country generally is behind the bid, as are the people of Scotland.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Do the criteria for the bid envisage providing four stadia in Scotland and two in Ireland or is there some leeway whereby Scotland could provide an extra stadium?
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	332	As I understand it, Ireland would host one group, as well as some of the quarter-finals and a semi-final.
#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	333	Eight games.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	334	We would have eight games in all and it is anticipated that they would be divided four and four. In reality, therefore, the request to the GAA is not to open up Croke Park for rugby, soccer or cricket, but to make the stadium available for four international football matches in the year 2008. Most people would agree that it is a fairly reasonable request. We are not asking anybody to concede any principle or to accept that one sport might encroach upon another. All we are asking is for the stadium to be made available for four games in 2008. Objectively, I can perfectly understand it when I view sports in Ireland and elsewhere competing with one another for young people. It is perhaps not acknowledged often enough that sports have common enemies in drugs and alcohol.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	335	Given the nature of its ownership, investment in the tourism sector is primarily from private sources. The challenges facing tourism cannot therefore be solved solely or mainly by the State. That said, it must be acknowledged that strategic Exchequer investment in tourism has contributed significantly to the emergence of Ireland as a world-class tourism destination.A recent economic report prepared for the Irish Tourist Industry Confederation by Tansey Webster Stewart & Co. estimated that the combined public and private sector investment in tourism during the 1989-1999 period was of the order of €4.3 billion. Of this, 35% came from Exchequer, EU and IFI sources and 65% from the private sector. Much of that investment was stimulated by various fiscal incentives and two EU Operational Programmes for Tourism. It is estimated that the two tourism operational programmes generated €1 billion in investment between 1989 and 1999.This investment has clearly contributed to the phenomenal growth in tourism in Ireland. Over the past ten years or so, total foreign earnings from tourism have more than doubled and stand at almost €4 billion a year. It is estimated that domestic tourism earnings are of the order of €1.2 billion. The industry now supports up to 150,000 jobs in the economy and is a major contributor to regional development and regeneration.In the National Development Plan, 2000 to 2006, there is a commitment of more than €460 million for tourism programmes under my aegis. This represents a substantial level of commitment to the tourism sector in terms of Exchequer investment in tourism this year. Also, 2002 has seen the largest ever budget being deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland. Tourism Ireland Ltd., which was successfully launched towards the end of last year, has a total budget of €50 million this year, of which €27 million represents direct programme spend. This is supplemented by substantial budgets for regional and product marketing by Bord Fáilte, of the order of €25 million.Shortly after my appointment as Minister for Tourism and following consultations with the industry and tourism agencies, I decided to reallocate a further €3 million in funding for front line marketing activity. With the help of that funding, Tourism Ireland extended its marketing activities in those markets with the best prospects for generating visitors and revenue in the short-term, targeting in particular Great Britain, closely followed by Europe and North America. In addition, Bord Fáilte has put an unprecedented level of investment into campaigns in the domestic market.Additional informationOn the basis of feedback from the tourism agencies, this investment, combined with the marketing activities of the industry itself and their special value offers, will produce a positive over all performance this year. We are well placed to recover much of the ground lost in 2001 as a result of the foot and mouth disease crisis and 11 September setbacks. In particular, the British market, which is traditionally our biggest market, has held up well with estimates of up to 6% growth in visitor numbers. This confirms the wisdom of Tourism Ireland's strategy of targeting Britain as a market that could yield immediate and significant results this year.In relation to Exchequer resources available next year, I am particularly pleased that the Government has maintained the overall tourism budget and, within that, increased the allocation for the Tourism Marketing Fund by 20% to €30.4 million, its highest allocation to date. This is a clear recognition by Government of the importance of the tourism sector to the Irish economy and in particular, the benefits of marketing Ireland in an increasingly competitive international marketplace. This funding will enable a strong programme of international marketing activity to be rolled out in 2003.

Surely it is time for a reappraisal of investment in our product. Does the Minister agree that much of the product provided in the period referred to, 1989-2000, is now stale? In some cases tourists no longer find our product attractive. We also have a new type of tourist, given attitudes change as generations change. Has there been any analysis of the kind of product tourists want?There has also been a reduction in the budget for the film industry despite the fact that 14% of American tourists came to Ireland because of our film industry, according to a recent Bord Fáilte survey.

They want value for money and a high quality product and we must remain competitive. However, other factors must also be looked at, including whether our marketing strategy is appropriate, whether access should be improved, whether our environment and infrastructure can be improved and whether the product needs a greater level of sophistication. These and other issues will be addressed in a review I announced which will be completed by next spring.I agree there is a new type of visitor and that people are booking holidays at a far later date. It is now almost the norm in some markets for people to decide two weeks in advance to take a break. Regarding the improvement of our market share in continental Europe, despite budgetary constraints this year I have ensured that the tourism marketing spend will be increased to its highest level ever. The increase year on year will be 20%, which is indicative of the seriousness with  which I and the Government regard marketing. I hope it will yield the dividends we anticipate.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	338	The Minister referred to the advantages of tourism when it comes to regional development. The waterways are a major bone of contention with me. We are not doing enough to attract tourists to our waterways, although we have marvellous canals and the Shannon. We never seem to attract the numbers of tourists it is possible to attract to those areas. The Minister may not have the relevant information with him but he should look at this area as adventure tourism activities such as hill walking, mountain climbing and waterway use are areas we have not exploited.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	339	The 2003 Estimates provision for the relevant subhead is €8.4 million, which is the amount of money required to complete the National Aquatic Centre, which is on schedule for completion by the end of 2002 and to be in use early in 2003, to provide for ancillary professional fees and to provide funds to allow Campus Stadium Ireland Development Ltd. to administer the facility during that year. There is no excess provision of funds in this subhead available for any other developments. Under Subhead C3 – grants for the provision and renovation for swimming pools – a provision of €9 million exists to meet commitments under the local authority swimming pool programme. In addition Subhead C1 – grants for sporting bodies and the provision of sports and recreational facilities – includes a provision of €60 million to meet commitments under the sports capital programme.

Will he acknowledge that it is important to maintain that support for the aquatic centre? The North East Fingal Swimming Pool Project is ideally placed to avail of such a facility. Is there a strong provision in the terms of the management of the aquatic centre to allow off-peak use of the 50 metre pool for local groups as well as our elite athletes and those from the regions? Is local access paramount? Are there regulations or guidelines which will ensure that even within the existing funding constraints?

In addition the company will operate a pricing policy which will facilitate access for less privileged sections of the community.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	353	I welcome this opportunity to speak in this debate on the Abridged Estimates for 2003. I wish at the outset to place the Education Estimates in the general context of Government policy.In terms of an overall strategy for the Estimates for 2003, the Government is strongly of the view that we need to take prudent decisions now to protect the gains of recent years and to prepare the country for the anticipated upturn in the economy. Failure to follow a sound economic policy would inevitably result in returning us to the position we faced in the late 1980s when there were massive cuts in public spending. The Government is not prepared to put at risk the advances of the last five years.A recurrent theme of this debate has been that the background to framing the Estimates for 2003 has not been as favourable as in previous years. We have seen a significant slowing of the economy and this has impacted on tax revenue.The 2003 Estimates for education continue the progress made in relation to the Government's massive investment in education since 1997. For example, in 1997 the gross education budget was €2.92 billion and in 2003 it will be €5.65 billion, an increase of €2.73 billion or almost 94%. The increases in capital spending have been even more dramatic with the investment level rising from €123 million in 1997 to €508 million in 2003. As far as first and second level education are concerned, capital funding in 1997 was €93 million and in 2003 it will be €338 million. This represents an increase of more than 350% over five years.There have been achievements across all sectors of education, some of which were mentioned in the recent OECD publication "Education at a Glance 2002" and the House has a right to feel proud of this progress. The OECD report draws particular attention to the success some countries,  including Ireland, have had in combining high quality education with social equity. This finding shows that our schools are having much success in ensuring that all students, whatever their backgrounds, can develop to their potential and is a great tribute to the work of both teachers and the school authorities.For 2003, the Education Estimate on the current side will total €5.1 billion, an increase of €290 million, or 6%, on the 2002 Estimate. This increase, although significant and almost twice as high as the current increase across all Departments, is lower than in recent years. This brings the need for prioritisation to the forefront. I have already said publicly that my priority is to assist the most disadvantaged people in the education system. Consequently, I have decided that for 2003 priority will be afforded to specific targeted programmes for tackling education disadvantage and for primary and post-primary education.The level of investment provided for in the current Estimates will enable us to maintain existing services and make further progress in a number of key areas. The provision for resource teachers and special needs assistants in primary schools has been increased further in the 2003 Estimates. My policy is to ensure the maximum possible integration of children with special needs into mainstream schools.The 2003 Estimates provide for 2,400 whole-time equivalent resource teachers supporting children with disabilities. Over €100 million has been provided in 2003 for the employment of special needs assistants in primary schools. The level of special needs assistants has increased from fewer than 300 in 1998 to approximately 5,000 in 2003.We will be developing the national council for special education in 2003 and that is provided for in the Estimates. We have also increased the provision for school retention initiatives to €23 million in 2003. The school completion programme will be expanded in 2003. The objective of that programme is to provide for a range of interventions in areas of disadvantage that support the retention of young people in education.An area of continuing concern to me and the Government is that of access by adults to education after they leave school, especially those who leave school early. That priority is recognised in these Estimates where there is an increase of €5.9 million for the full-year costs of the Back to Education initiative. Also, an extra 6,000 part-time places have been approved in 2002. The area of further education has also received increases and the programme that has been rolled out over the past four or five years is being expanded even further.Regarding schools, I want to put capital investment in the primary and secondary sectors on a sound footing. Much as I would like to do so, I cannot solve all of the problems in a short space of time. For that reason, I have proposed with the Minister of Finance that we agree a five year envelope for investment in these two areas to be financed through a combination of Exchequer  funding and public private partnership. I look forward to that happening in the very near future.The Estimates show a consolidation of the progress of recent years in providing funding for the education sector despite the more difficult economic environment and the many demands on the Government's finances. The provision for education in the 2003 Estimate is a clear demonstration of the priority that this Government has accorded to education.

The Celtic tiger, if it is not dead, is certainly taking a breather, as we might say in sport. It is obvious to me as a former teacher that many different participants helped to build that Celtic tiger. The politicians, particularly the current Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, can claim much credit despite some media criticism and political criticism in recent days, but that is part and parcel of political life.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	355	The Deputy is only telling the truth.
#TonyDempseyFF	unknown-#TonyDempseyFF-party	unknown-#TonyDempseyFF-dob	unknown-#TonyDempseyFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I am not used to this kind of thing, but if one is increasing expenditure by 20% one year on the other, surely one should say "Well done." rather than "You should have done better."Education has played a very important role. In times of scarcity we have to balance what we can spend against tax, but taxation has been a crude method of redistributing wealth, which I am thankful is near and dear to my heart and the hearts of politicians of every hue in this country. Taxation is crude because if one over-taxes those who create wealth, they will emigrate with either their talents or capital. Then we would not have the wealth to give to the socio-economically disadvantaged.Perhaps we should look at the Estimates and the role they will play in education. We should appreciate education not only in terms of literacy and mathematical intelligence, but also in terms of the intelligence that exists in entrepreneurship and sports. Social intelligence must also be considered. It has always amazed me as a teacher that we have to send young Irish boys and girls abroad to train for nursing because of the over-emphasis on academia and because highly intelligent youngsters fail to get into nursing training courses here. They go abroad to England and then we pay them salaries to come back or we invite foreign nurses over here to fill the places that should have been filled.Let us look at social education and hope that the Estimates take account of it. Consider the  driving test, for example, about which we have heard so much, along with the points system of which Deputy Brennan has spoken. The rules of the road could become part of a civic, social and political education curriculum. Youngsters of 17 and 18 in our second level schools could do the theory section of the driving test as part of such a leaving certificate curriculum.The Minister and the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, should be congratulated on the €5.6 billion expenditure which is estimated, an increase of 77% on 1977 and an increase of 3% on last year. Recognising the contribution of education, I congratulate Deputy Noel Dempsey on the fact that he is looking at the disadvantaged. Education, through qualifications, can actually make wealth available not just to the few. I concede that the Celtic tiger has favoured too small a number. That is regrettable and it is regretted by politicians on every side.We should look at taking education into the poorer housing estates. One has to be very careful because I do not want to be patronising, but some of the education that is on offer is irrelevant to many people from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Perhaps we should consider enterprise centres, for example, as part of the education system. We should possibly consider them in parts of rural Ireland, which seem to be dying for different reasons.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I am sharing my time with my colleague, Deputy Hayes.The way in which the budget Estimates have been presented was a masterpiece. All 75 spin doctors the Government has employed must have been brought together to work on how they could best present bad news and dress it up in such a way that the Government would get away with what it has done. Certainly it pulled off a masterpiece. The Government used the trick, which is probably used in the grocery trade, of lost leader. It has come out with a lost leader and the lost leader is that we are cutting the first time buyer's grant. That is the lost leader on which everyone is homing in. The whole public has been taken in by it, as have the media, and it has been the focus of attention on the Estimates in recent days. Because the focus has been on that one item, many of the other things contained in the Estimates are hidden and have not been subjected to public debate or public disgust. In that way, the Government has pulled off a masterpiece.All the backbenchers who have been talking about the Estimates and criticising them are not prepared to vote down this motion in the Dáil. They will appear to have been listened to. On  budget day, the message will go out that the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, has not been too bad after all and that he has put things right. This also is how the Government has pulled off a masterpiece and has managed to switch the debate in the way it wanted. Many of the terrible things have been hidden.Some of those terrible things relate to regional county roads, the spending on which is to decrease by 27%. How will that affect ordinary local authorities throughout the country? Take my own county of Westmeath for example. The cut amounts to a reduction of €750,000 in the roads fund for this year. That will have devastating consequences for the county and its regional roads. Good work has been done on the roads in recent years. There has been much surface work and strengthening done, but much of this will be of no consequence because of this huge cutback.This cutback will leave the local authorities in difficulty when balancing their books this year. The local government fund is being frozen. As everybody knows, public service employees got a rise of 4% in October. How will that be paid for in the coming year if one freezes the local government fund? Where will the 4% come from to cover the wages? What about inflation that has occurred on many other fronts? Will the local authorities increase charges in that regard? Hence, taxation will increase.I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, has left the chamber because there was one point I wanted to make specifically to him. I hope he will hear it on the monitor. He is a straight talking guy and I am surprised and disappointed that some of the information emanating from his Department is what I could only call deceptive, inaccurate and unworthy in terms of any Minister standing over it. I refer particularly to what appears on the website under the heading "Major primary school projects approved to go to tender". The Department's website had a heading last April that read: "Major primary school projects approved to go to tender". Thirty primary schools were listed. The ordinary interpretation of the heading was that the schools were to go to tender. That was before the general election when Fianna Fáil candidates sent letters to constituents advising of the situation. Parents were pleased that new schools were to be built. However, six months later, of the 30 schools on the list, only 17 have gone to tender and seven have gone to construction.A new list has appeared on the website with the same heading detailing 24 schools that are to go to tender. An additional one has been added. However, only some have been approved, some have gone to tender but the remainder have not been approved. This deception was played on the public before the general election. The Fianna Fáil candidate in my constituency, Deputy Cassidy, told people that their school would be built. Worse, the then Minister, Deputy Woods, con spired with him, had a photograph taken and announced that the money was secured. That was deception.

It is unparliamentary in any civilised democratic Parliament. In recent times it has been used in this House. My predecessors always objected to its use and the Members of the House did not use it for the past 80 years. I ask Members to refrain from using the word "lie" in this House.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	362	The Government told untruths, if that term is acceptable to you, Sir, to return to power. The electorate is very annoyed with what happened because the truth will always emerge. When I went to school I once saw on a local billboard a big sign which was headed: "Help de Valera clean up the mess". That sentiment is appropriate today because the country is in a mess as a consequence of the wasteful spending by the Government over recent years in an attempt to buy its way back into power. Future generations will have to pay for it.The country is crying out for new infrastructure. The road network needs to be upgraded, yet despite repeated promises that new roads would be built there are to be cuts in infrastructure spending. In my constituency of Tipperary South, the Cashel bypass, promised since 1991, is again long-fingered by the current Administration.There are to be cuts in spending on agriculture, the country's main industry. The Government is presiding over the demise of agriculture while the Book of Estimates proposes more cutbacks. In 1997, 1,200 farmers took up farming while last year only 35 young people took it up. Rural Ireland is being closed down because the Government does not care.Over the next 12 months hospital corridors will be full of beds and wards will be closed because of the Estimates. The Minister for Education and Science outlined the implications for education. In every constituency primary and secondary schools are awaiting badly needed capital allocations. Last week I visited a school where water is flowing from the roof of the toilets on top of children. People are crying out for funds for school repairs.It took time for forestry to develop, but people saw it as a substitute for agriculture and began to invest in it. Many have benefited, yet the Government now proposes to slash funding in this area.
#JohnODonoghue	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-party	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-dob	unknown-#JohnODonoghue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	363	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in this debate and to refute what  some commentators have said about the decisions taken by the Government. In these difficult economic times the Abridged Estimates for 2003, published last week, reflect consolidation and re-prioritisation of Government spending after several years of strong growth. I am happy that the €390 million available to my Department will enable me to maintain the thrust of State support for the arts, sport and tourism sectors.The Government is still fully committed to the development and promotion of arts and culture and to the commitments set out in An Agreed Programme for Government. However, it is clear that at a time of national financial difficulty, support for the sector must be in line with available resources. I am satisfied that with prudent management by all concerned, the funding to be provided will be sufficient to achieve our objectives for arts and culture, building on the significantly increased funding provided by the Government in recent years.In the case of the Arts Council, while the allocation for 2003 is reduced from €47.6 million to €44 million, funding for the council in 1997 was just €26.4 million. The reduced allocation for the Irish Film Board must be seen against a background in which the board's funding more than doubled over the five year period 1997-2002. The Government remains committed to the strategic development of the film industry, with the board having a role in that process. The new structures recently put in place in line with the recommendations of the strategic report on the film industry are already having a significant impact.Although slightly down on the current year, funding for the major national cultural institutions next year will enable them to continue their important work of conserving and displaying our national heritage of arts and antiquities. A sum of €2.5 million will be added to the heritage fund next year which should facilitate the acquisition of significant heritage objects by the national collection institutions. Significantly increased funding has also been made available for international cultural exchanges. This will enable the Department to press ahead with planning for a major reciprocal exhibition of Chinese and Irish arts and cultural treasures in both countries.The period since 1997 has seen an unprecedented level of Government support for sport in Ireland. When the Government took office in 1997 the budget for sport was frozen at approximately €17 million. This level of funding was expected to meet the needs of national governing bodies, elite competitors and local organisations as well as providing much needed sports facilities around the country. This was inadequate to fund the many priorities to be addressed in sport. The new Government which took office in 1997 set about making a major investment in sport, including appointing the country's first full Minister with responsibility for sport. This Government appreciates the importance of sport in the social and economic life of Irish people. It has provided  realistic funding to reflect this central role of sport in our society and the increasing demand for improved sports services and facilities. In 2001, the sports budget of €93 million showed an almost fivefold increase over 1997. This year the budget was increased by a further 73% bringing it to a total of €161.4 million. This increased level of funding has enabled many major proposals to become a reality and since 1997 the sporting landscape has changed dramatically.The Government is proud of the following highlights in sports development. The statutory Irish Sports Council was established in July 1999 and for the first time ever, Ireland has an organisation focused fully on sport and its development. Funding for the Irish Sports Council has increased by over 100% since 2000, its first full year of operation. With increased Government funding, the council has been able to raise the level and quality of support to governing bodies and Ireland's top international competitors are now in receipt of the type of funding and support about which they only dreamed some few years ago. It has now embarked on the establishment of local sports partnerships around the country. A new high performance strategy is being implemented with the help of increased funding of €3 million introduced in 2002, leading to the Athens Olympics in 2004. Ireland has its first ever national anti-doping programme, one of a select group of 30 countries in the world with one. Almost 3000 sports facilities, at all levels, throughout the country have received grants totalling over €213 million. Major national sports facilities have been provided or upgraded, including the new 50 metre pool opened in Limerick this year, a refurbished national boxing stadium, and a new national centre for rowing in Inniscarra, County Cork. In addition, almost 3,000 clubs and community organisations throughout the country have been supported to the value of €213 million in providing much needed sporting and recreational facilities. Under the local authority swimming pool programme pools have been built and refurbished at Arklow, Courtown, Dundalk, Ennis, Enniscorthy, Monaghan, Navan, Roscommon and Wicklow.Despite the tight budgetary situation the Government has attempted to ensure that the excellent work carried out between 1997 and 2002 is not diminished by a reduction in funding for 2003. With the level of funding provided for 2003, the momentum and the commitment to sport by this Government is being sustained. The Irish Sports Council will be able to maintain its levels of support for the wide range of programmes and initiatives in place for the development and progress of Irish sport, from recreational sport to top national and international teams and competitors. The capital programmes administered by my Department will continue to assist organisations in every part of the country in their work in providing appropriate, high quality, sustainable facilities to meet the varied needs of Irish sport at national, regional and local level throughout  Ireland. Under the local authority swimming pool programme we will continue to support local authorities towards providing swimming facilities for the public.Funding is being provided to ensure the completion of the national aquatic centre at Abbotstown, which will be completed at the end of the year and will come into use early next year. As the House will be aware these facilities are being provided to enable the aquatic events of the Special Olympics world summer games to be held there in June 2003. This is the first time that the world games are being held outside America and, therefore, it behoves us all to ensure that the event is one of the best ever. To ensure its success the Government has provided dedicated funding towards the organising and holding of these games.

This reflects my policy of re-orientating my Department's tourism funding towards frontline marketing activity, a process that I began shortly after I assumed office when I freed up €3 million for additional marketing activities to generate extra business this year. With the help of that funding, Tourism Ireland Limited has been able to extend its marketing activities in those markets with the best prospects for generating visitors and revenue in the short-term, targeting in particular Great Britain, closely followed by Europe and North America. The additional marketing funding that is to be provided in next year's Estimates will enable an even stronger programme of international marketing to be rolled out in 2003 and I look forward to launching detailed marketing and operational plans on behalf of Tourism Ireland Limited and Bord Fáilte Éireann early next month.After ten successive years of uninterrupted growth up to 2000, the industry faced its first major setback with the double blow of the foot and mouth disease crisis in the spring of 2001 and the aftermath of the tragic events of 11 September in the US. However, although there were varying fortunes within and between different sectors and regions, the hard evidence is that we coped well due to a combination of resolute actions at industry and Government level. While  official CSO figures for 2001 show that the number of overseas visitors to Ireland fell by 5% in comparison with 2000, they were still at a very healthy level of six million. Even more remarkable is the fact that total foreign revenue earnings from all overseas visits actually increased by 8% to €3.96 billion. In addition, domestic holiday business remained buoyant last year, with expenditure rising by 16% according to Bord Fáilte figures. Our performance in terms of tourism receipts was ahead of the world and European averages.While evidence from CERT employment surveys shows there was a marginal reduction in permanent employment in Irish tourism in 2001, recruitment of skilled staff remained a challenge for the sector, with evidence of a continuing interest in recruiting labour from third countries. There was little hard evidence of major permanent job losses or closures in 2001, although margins were undoubtedly under pressure in many businesses. Overall, on the basis of the information currently available to the tourism State agencies, the outturn for this year will be better than originally expected with current forecasts suggesting a small percentage increase in visitor numbers which could bring us close to the 2000 performance.As to the prospects for 2003, the medium to long-term outlook for the tourism sector remains bright. As long as we can maintain our international competitiveness in terms of pricing, access and the quality of our product, the sector can, in time, overcome its present difficulties. I would have to temper that statement by saying that recovery is dependent on a stable international political and economic situation. A major political crisis, such as a gulf war, could damage tourism and travel prospects both nationally and globally. Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte are working in close consultation with the industry on their marketing programmes for 2003. This close interface with the industry will ensure that the programmes are soundly based and target the available resources where they can deliver the greatest dividends.I am convinced from my recent tourism promotional visits abroad that we need to sustain strong international marketing campaigns to ensure that Ireland remains on the radar screen for potential visitors and to meet the more intense international competition that has emerged recently. My priority during the discussions on the departmental Estimates for 2003 was to ensure that sufficient funding would be available within the tourism budget to mount robust marketing campaigns in our key target markets next year. I am happy that I have achieved this objective and I welcome the positive public expressions of support from the key industry groups following the publication of the Estimates. In conclusion, I want to reaffirm the commitment of this Government to the arts, sport and tourism sectors even at a time of budgetary  restraint, and I commend the Estimates to the House.

Right across the board, no matter what sector of education one chooses, substantial cuts have been made. The Estimates are a blatant attack on young people in every sector of our educational system. I welcome the increase in funding for special needs assistants that the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, announced and I recognise its importance, but after that there is little good news.Hundreds of school building projects are anxiously awaiting confirmation from the Minister on where they stand. It seems certain that many of them will be delayed or halted completely. In every county, there are schools in dire condition, rodent infested and freezing cold, which would not pass either a health and safety or fire safety inspection. Children use unhygienic toilets and eat in the same overcrowded classrooms in which they sit all day.The Minister for Education and Science Deputy Noel Dempsey mentioned an announcement on extra resource teachers, but already these teachers are juggling their timetables with remedial teachers, often sharing or using a back kitchen, office, staff room or cloakroom in which to try and teach already deprived children. These children cannot achieve their full potential by being given extra teaching in such terrible conditions, yet the Government, through the Estimates, is condemning them to these awful conditions indefinitely.No one is fooled by a figure of a cut of 4% in primary schools' and 10% in secondary schools' capital spending. The teachers, boards of management and parents live in the real world and know that this is in effect a far higher figure when construction inflation is taken into account. The Minister stated this afternoon that he could not solve all the problems in a short time and has proposed to the Minister of Finance that they agree a five year envelope for investment. I am not sure what a five year envelope is, but Deputy Noel Dempsey sat in the last Government, although not as the Minister responsible for education, but he was a member of the Cabinet that made the decisions and to decide now to provide a five year envelope for schools building projects is little comfort for all those who have been waiting for the past five years to be seen.One of the most baffling decisions in these Estimates is the cut of 60% in the information technology programmes. The short-sightedness of that decision is incredible. Very few schools have adequate IT facilities and those which have com puters are working with out-of-date equipment. Computer literacy and the development of information technology skills are as important, if not more so, in today's climate as the three Rs were years ago. Many young people who are not attracted by traditional teaching methods find they can be switched on by working in the computer technology area. Slashing the information and communications technology budgets for schools will deny our young people the qualifications needed to compete in today's high-tech world. We have begun to accept, and it has been quite a transition, that the type of industry we are in a position to attract is changing. We are told we have to move on from the labour intensive industries on which we have relied to the more technological and communications based industries, yet we will not provide our young people with the skills they need to obtain employment in these sectors. What sort of economic sense is that?When it comes to third level institutions, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, appears to be paving the way to allow the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to bring in his pet project of returning third level fees.In the programme for Government, which is a master work of fiction, the Government admitted that the infrastructure in colleges had not kept pace with the growth in student numbers, and that it would change that. It appears the only way this will happen is when student numbers fall as there is a massive drop in the budget for capital spending in our third level institutions.The 1% cut in current spending will have negative consequences also. The Conference of the Heads of Irish Universities, which the Minister for Education and Science and his Department are fond of quoting when it suits them, reckons this to be effectively a cut of 8%. It has said it is impossible to follow the Minister's advice and achieve the necessary savings in non-staff costs only. Ireland is already ranked 25 out of 30 OECD states in spending per student. How much farther in the ranks will the Government allow third level education to fall?Where does the Government stand on research in third level institutions and what type of "pause" does the Minister have in mind? I realise that in the response to that question I will have to listen to a litany of money spent in this area since 1997, which appears to be the Government's favourite year from which to quote figures. I accept that the money was spent, but research on third level is not sustainable on a stop-go-pause-go-stop basis.A decision was made in 2001 to provide an agreed amount of funding for research. This money was divided between capital and recurrent spending. The Higher Education Authority agreed to fund certain projects. An enormous amount of work went into putting together programmes for these projects and to making proposals. Colleges went ahead and employed  people to carry out the research. The former Minister for Education and Science, until his change of position, signalled that he would bring in a fourth cycle of funding for these projects. We now have researchers employed to carry out valuable research without laboratories, instruments and building space in which to work. Contracts have been entered into which universities will have to honour but they will have nothing to show for it. That is this Government's version of value for money.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	371	It is now widely accepted that the Government plundered the public finances to get itself elected last summer, and the public is now being asked to foot the election bill. We had a mini-budget shortly after the election where we saw the cost of visits to casualty departments increase by 40%, VHI charges increase by 18%, ESB charges increase by 10%, college registration fees increase by 69% and the threshold for the drugs refund scheme increase by 22%. These increases came at a time when we had the highest inflation level in Europe. We also had a summer of massive cutbacks but I do not have the time to detail those this evening.Over the weekend we heard some of the Government Deputies moaning and groaning about the latest series of cuts. They are seen as seething tigers in their constituencies but as we have seen already in the Dáil this week they are purring kittens under the eagle eye of the Government Whip. However, the litmus test will come tonight for the magnificent 11. Will they be tigers or pussy cats when asked to vote "Yes" or "No" on the cuts in public expenditure?The abolition of the first-time buyer's grant has torpedoed the hopes and aspirations of many young people and, in a heartless decision, has put owning a home at any time way beyond the reach of people already struggling to buy their first house. This is the same Government which, prior to the election, promised not only to keep the grant but to increase it to €6,350 for couples. After the election, however, the Minister opposite described the first-time buyer's grant as an inefficient use of funds.In the past seven days I have received dozens of telephone calls and personal calls from panicking people who cannot get straight answers to their anxious questions. The latest one, received just an hour ago in my office, was from a young man who is buying a house with a local authority under the shared ownership scheme. The local authority had purchased the house but because he had not signed on the dotted line with the local authority, he will now lose the grant. That is according to the local authority.As the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is in the House, will he indicate what will happen to a person in those circumstances? The local authority had bought the house but they had not completed the deal with this man as co-owner. Will he lose the grant? I  would like the Minister to address that issue in his contribution and to make clear to local authorities the true position because they are whistling in the dark at this stage.

#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	377	In the appendix on page 55 of the Estimates for the Public Service, the stark reality is shown. It states that the estimated spend this year is €1,039 million, factoring in inflation at 4.5%, which equals about €41 million. The local authorities' requirements for this year, therefore, total €1,080 million. The local authorities are getting €975 million, leaving a shortfall of €105 million. This shortfall can be met only by raising charges and-or cutting services. In addition to that we have a 47% cut in the road allocations. We will shortly be back to the era of potholes. The local authorities have always been treated by this Government as the second division of our democracy but they are now being called upon to act as front-line troops to wage a war of attrition on the public involving savage services cuts, a new array of taxes and a new poll tax.We have read already of proposals to cut back services and increase charges. One local authority, my own council, Cork City Council, is facing the possibility of a 46% increase in refuse collection charges, an 8% increase in commercial rates, a 6% increase in commercial water charges as well as a 20% increase in parking charges. The full waiver for service charges allowed to old age pensioners is being removed and they will be asked to pay 25% of the final charge, or approximately €82 per annum, of which €20 will revert to the Government under the waste charge levy. This is the introduction of a poll tax, a demand for charges irrespective of means. I am aware that another local authority in Mayo has overspent this year by €20 million and will have to accommodate that overspend as well as the effect of cutbacks it will experience this year.The impact of these measures on local authorities will be catastrophic and traumatic. Local councillors will not tolerate the treatment they are getting and they are being forced to act as  front-line troops in the Government's campaign of taxing and cutting. The next number of weeks will be very difficult for councillors.

The position is that the local authority is the contracting authority, not the individual, with the builder of the scheme. To the best of my knowledge most of them have already done the business with their individual clients, the people they are putting into the houses, and in that case they qualify for the grant. I hope there was not any tardiness on the part of the local authority to which the Deputy referred.

Economic management is one of the most important foundations on which good government is built. We have just come through a period of sustained economic growth which has transformed our country, especially in terms of employment availability and opportunity. I remind the Deputy that the environment budget has been raised by 170% in the last five years.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	388	It did not go up this year.

There will not be the same level of increases every year but that figure is some increase in the last five years. The Deputy should deal with fact rather than fantasy.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	390	There were no increases. It is an effective cut of 5%.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The economy clearly suffered a number of external shocks last year and growth declined from the record highs of 1999 and 2000. However, growth has resumed in the current year from a virtual standstill in 2001. In its recent Quarterly Economic Commentary, the Economic and Social Research Institute estimates that real  GDP growth will be 4% in 2002 and 2.5% in real GNP terms. The commentary says that “there is a need to consolidate the public finances by bringing expenditure growth under control” and this is what the Government has done in framing the Abridged Estimates for 2003.The Government could have taken the soft option; it would have been easier politically and every other way to avoid taking some difficult decisions and in the process to delay full economic recovery. It would have been easier to mortgage our future at the expense of the present, but this would not be good government, and we are not prepared to sacrifice the future well-being of our economy at the altar of expediency. With public expenditure increases running ahead of tax yields, it was essential for us to take a number of difficult decisions in order to match Government resources and expenditure.One of these decisions involved termination of the new house grant. This grant was introduced in 1977 with the main purpose of encouraging new house building. First-time buyers of existing housing received no grant assistance. At that time the grant was set at £1,000 and it represented about 7% of the average new house price when private house building was around 17,000 to 18,000 units each year. This is in stark contrast to output of over 47,000 units in 2001. By general consent, the grant has for some time now outlived its usefulness as an economic incentive because its impact has been absorbed into house prices. The Government appreciates that €3,800 is a substantial sum to persons purchasing their first house, but while termination of the grant was a difficult decision, it was the right decision. Over time, house prices will reflect the abolition of the grant, and first-time buyers will be at little, if any, loss. Some €40 million will be freed up to be used—
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	392	How can the Minister justify that statement? He is whistling in the dark.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	393	—for the social housing programme each year. In recent years, there have been substantial increases in housing provision, both in terms of the levels of funding made available and in the numbers of social and affordable housing units provided. While the Exchequer provision for 2003 is down 5%, the provision of €932 million for Exchequer capital expenditure in 2003 is more than double the spending in 2000, when Exchequer capital spending was almost €452 million.In overall terms the total capital funding for housing in 2003, Exchequer and non-Exchequer, is up almost 7% at €1.7 billion on the 2002 provision. In effect, we are consolidating the very significant progress made in recent years and maintaining a very high level of commitment to social and affordable housing.The focus of housing expenditure in the future must be on the range of better targeted schemes to assist low income purchasers such as the shared  ownership and affordable housing schemes and those with social housing needs. The funding being made available under the social and affordable housing measures in 2003 will provide accommodation for almost 12,000 households in 2003, an increase of about 40% when compared to 1998 when we provided accommodation for somewhat less than 8,500 households.The largest area of spending is the local authority programme. We had a substantial overhang of commitments coming into 2002 which will not be repeated in 2003 and the funding reflects this. The provisions available are likely to allow some increase in starts under the local authority programme in 2003 and we expect to meet our national development plan commitments in relation to provisions of both voluntary and co-operative sector housing and the affordable housing initiatives. In these Estimates we are focused on consolidating progress in meeting targeted housing needs and providing a range of accommodation options for the most vulnerable groups and low-income households.After housing, the capital programme for water and waste water services is the largest spending programme for which I am responsible, and the one which has the greatest environmental impact. The main objectives of the programme are to provide an adequate supply of suitable quality water for a range of uses, as well as providing systems for the safe and adequate disposal of sewage and other water-borne wastes.These objectives underpin the current water services investment programme which was launched earlier this year and covers the period 2002-04. Funding in 2003 will enable us to progress over 600 schemes in the programme to increase the quality and capacity of water and wastewater systems across the country. The availability of serviced residential land will continue to be a special focus of the investment in water and sewerage services so as to deliver some 170,000 sites under the serviced land initiative. A major water conservation programme as a sustainable alternative to the provision of infrastructure will also be funded in order to meet additional demands arising.One of the highlights of the new programme is that it now incorporates all the remaining waste water schemes needed for Ireland to comply with existing and future sewage treatment standards for urban areas under the EU waste water treatment directive. Many larger schemes required to comply with the terms of the directive, such as Cork, Limerick, and Galway main drainage schemes and particularly the Dublin Bay project, are at an advanced stage of construction. The latter includes at Ringsend the largest waste water treatment scheme currently under construction in the EU and is due to be completed shortly.The record levels of expenditure being invested in the rural water programme will be maintained in 2003 to address the urgent water quality problems in privately sourced schemes. The pro gramme is funding a number of targeted initiatives aimed at improving the quality, reliability and efficiency of rural water supply systems. Funding will ensure the implementation of the agreed strategy for the upgrading and renewal of these schemes.The accelerated investment in water services infrastructure in recent years is beginning to underpin a reversal in river pollution. The most recent Environmental Protection Agency report on river quality confirms that for the first time since national surveys commenced in the 1970s there has been an increase in the length of unpolluted river channel from 67% in the 1995-97 period to 70% in the 1998-2000 period. I expect this trend to continue with the level of investment now being provided.Demand for water and sewerage services has increased at an unprecedented rate over the last few years due to strong economic and demographic growth, increased tourism numbers and record levels of new residential development. The level of investment proposed next year will ensure that all demands arising from this growth will continue to be met.The Abridged Estimates also give details of expenditure from the environment fund in 2003 which will amount to around €48 million. The environment fund is financed by the levies on plastic bags and on the landfilling of waste. This level of expenditure will provide a substantial increase in environmental funding over and above the projected out-turn of around €17 million in 2002 on environmental initiatives under the relevant subhead of this year's Estimates. It will enable us to increase substantially investment in waste management infrastructure as well as taking new initiatives in waste prevention and minimisation and in developing markets for recyclable materials. I also intend to direct substantial resources to increased environmental enforcement, an area which has long been identified as requiring additional attention at local authority level.The Abridged Estimates 2003 reflect the Government's focus on sound and responsible economic management. The rate of increase in public spending in recent years was unsustainable and had to be reduced. We are still investing in our public services but we have had to take some difficult decisions about programmes of a lower priority. This should not obscure the fact that there have been very large increases in public spending since 1997. Capital spending, in particular, is up 170% on the 1997 level. These Estimates consolidate public investment, give effect to our priorities and lay the foundation for continued economic prosperity into the future. I commend the Estimates to the House.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I wish to share my time with my colleague, Deputy Shortall. It is a fact that we live in a country with one of the richest economies in the world. We also live in a country with one of the highest levels of poverty in the Western  world. If proof of that is needed, 30% of the population qualify for medical cards; the cut-off limit for a medical card is €135 a week for an adult which is a real poverty level of income. It is a further fact that the last five years of economic boom have seen the gap between rich and poor widen even further. This did not happen by accident; it is the direct and calculated result of the implementation of right-wing policies by a Minister for Finance who by his own admission is a right-wing ideologue. I wonder where all the Fianna Fáil republicans have gone. Are they out cherishing the children of the nation equally on their local radio stations and then rushing back to this House to vote through the anti-people proposals of their right-wing Government and Minister for Finance? If they believe what they say on local radio they are morally bound to vote against these Estimates tonight at 7 p.m. Otherwise they will be exposed as hypocrites.Deputy Ned O'Keeffe, a senior member of Fianna Fáil, has described the regime as the most right-wing in the history of the State. Deputy McCreevy's ideology dictates, like his mentor Margaret Thatcher, that there is no such thing as society or community. It dictates that there is no need for any sense of equality, that equality is only for the weak; that there is no reason for fair play; and that only the fittest should survive. It dictates that those in need have only themselves to blame. It dictates that the individual is superior to society or community. Those who have argued otherwise have been dismissed as "pinkos" by Deputy McCreevy and his supporters. In his mad rush to implement those right wing theories, Deputy McCreevy effectively destroyed the tax base and gave 85% of the proceeds to those who were already well off and certainly not in need. That was a deliberate and calculated decision.The effect of this is to weaken the State and its power to intervene in society to such a degree that it is ineffective. They now call that a lack of resources. That is a lie. Now they tell us that people must provide for themselves or do without. If a person cannot provide for himself, it is his own fault according to the Minister's creed. Let us look at some examples of how he is seeking to achieve his goals. He taxes stable lads and girls while the stud owners are tax-free. He cuts funding for social housing while giving 100% tax relief to the vultures who speculate in rented residential properties. It matters not a whit to Deputy McCreevy that there are 50,000 families on the housing waiting lists.He refuses medical cards to 200,000 people who are on a minimal income of €135 per week while cutting capital gains tax from 40% to 20%. He abolishes the first-time buyer's grant while refusing to tackle or tax the massive gains made in land zoning and speculation. He slashes funding for rebuilding national schools while funding the 25% per annum bonus to those who can afford to save. He has dumped the Government health plan while granting a 40% per  annum bonus to those who can afford to augment their pensions.It is fine with Deputy McCreevy for people to lie on trolleys for days or wait for years for vital medical procedures – and many die while they wait. So it is obvious that this Government and particularly the Minister for Finance have made clear decisions. It is not the case that there are no resources – there are plenty – but the Minister and his colleagues have established their priorities. Their priorities as set out in these Estimates favour the rich over the poor and favour the individual over society.The stud owners, the multiple house owners, the land speculators, the so-called non-resident tax dodgers and the recipients of massive capital gains have nothing to fear from these Estimates. They can buy services. The poor and those in need of medical treatment, the children in rat infested pre-fabricated national schools, the sick on waiting lists and on trolleys at the end of their wait, those waiting for social housing, those who were struggling to buy a modest home – the weakest of our society – all have much to fear from Deputy McCreevy and his right wing ideology. They will be punished because he has decided to protect the rich. It is time now for Fianna Fáil to put a stop to his mad gallop, and if it does not have the courage to do it in this House, it might do it in its party rooms.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I will focus upon the whole area of transport and traffic. Nowhere are the results of this Government's mismanagement of the economy more evident that in the area of transport. A failure to invest sufficiently in major transport and road projects in recent years and the indecisiveness of former Minister, Senator O'Rourke has resulted in a situation where much of our infrastructure is at Third World levels.Many of the major projects which had been earmarked over several years are now significantly behind time. In Dublin, traffic is almost at a standstill and public transport provision is hopelessly inadequate. In the rest of the country, people are struggling with an awfully inadequate road network, traffic congestion in most towns and reduced rather than improved rural public transport systems. Much of this arises as a result of the failure of the present and the previous Governments to produce a spatial plan. Development is taking place at a phenomenal rate along the eastern seaboard – at the expense of the rest of the country. We now have congestion throughout greater Dublin and the eastern region. The quality of life of most people living and working in that region has been seriously affected by the lack of a decent road structure and, more importantly, the lack of adequate public transport.In the rest of the country, many of our rural areas are being denuded and run down. The failure to put in place a proper development plan for the entire country has meant that development has been dictated by developers alone and there  is no overall strategy or plan on the part of the Government. The attempts of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, to massage the figures that came out last week in the Estimates do not stand up. We cannot avoid the fact that there is a mere 2% increase in the Estimate for his Department. Deputy Brennan has said that we are able to support about the same level activity as last year, but this simply cannot happen.As a result of the real reduction in the Estimates for the Department of Transport, we will see significant cutbacks and delays in all of our major traffic and transport projects. In the Dublin area alone there are significant projects being long-fingered and delayed by more than two or three years in some cases. The Minister has approved a fare increase of 9% on buses and trains. This does not make sense. It will add significantly to overall inflation rates. More importantly, it goes against all of the principles in traffic management and public transport in so far as it will act as a serious disincentive for people to use public transport. That goes against what we are in theory trying to achieve. It simply does not make sense that we are discouraging people from using public transport on cost grounds by sanctioning this 9% fare increase.We know only too well in Dublin in particular that there is mayhem on many of our streets. People increasingly are ignoring the rules of the road, ignoring red lights, ignoring bus lanes and parking restrictions and there is inadequate enforcement of traffic laws. It is clear that the Garda is not in a position to enforce the traffic laws adequately, nor should they be expected to. They have more to do in terms of enforcing laws in relation to criminal activity. We desperately need a traffic corps, especially in Dublin but in other parts of the country also to ensure that people adhere to speed limits and so on. It is a critical element in a proper transport and traffic management system, and now it would appear that that element has been completely dropped from the Government transport plans. There is no funding there, despite what the Minister has been saying about the traffic corps being delayed and not meeting the target of early 2003. It will not meet any target in 2003 because the money simply is not there, and the core area of dealing with traffic has obviously now been dropped by the Minister.We have two light rail lines at present. The funding provided for capital infrastructure in relation to light rail is the same as last year so there can be no expansion of the system. The Minister suggests that the rail procurement agency will be able to raise funds of €90 million, but this is not what the agency was set up to do, it is not why it was given the power to borrow money. It was given the power to borrow money to extend the network. It will not be able to do that within the current constraints. Similarly, a metro system has now been long-fingered indefinitely, so there is no single public transport  initiative for the northside of Dublin, in particular to service Dublin Airport.It seems that the people living and working on the northside of Dublin are to continue living and working with the kind of traffic gridlock we have at the moment, with no prospect of relief. I could go on for the next half an hour about major projects being shelved, which will have serious implications for the quality of life of people around the country, as well as for business. Traffic congestion is costing the business community more than €600 million per year. This is not sustainable. The Minister for Transport has failed the commuter and failed the public transport user in his inability to secure adequate funds to put in place the kind of infrastructure a modern economy needs.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	396	I propose to deal with two Votes of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Vote 38, which funds the main policy, administrative and consular service of the Department, and Vote 39, the Vote for International Co-operation which supports the Ireland Aid programme.I will comment first on Vote 38. The Estimates for Vote 38 for 2003 amount to €163.739 million, which is a reduction of 5% of the allocation for 2002. As in previous years, most of the Estimates for Vote 38 will be taken up by the administrative budget which amounts to €133.399 million, or more than 81% of our total Vote.Like other Departments, the proposed budget for the Department of Foreign Affairs for 2003 reflects the general economic reality and the more difficult budgetary situation with which the Government must now deal. One of the major commitments that will face the Department during 2003 is the Presidency of the European Union, which runs for the first six months of 2004. For the Department of Foreign Affairs, Presidency related work will commence in the middle of 2003, in particular through our involvement in the Troika, the so-called committee of the past, present and future Presidencies, which spearheads the Union's political activities during a Presidency. In addition, all the necessary planning and logical preparation will have to be completed during 2003.An allocation of €7 million has been provided in the Department's administrative budget to cover its Presidency responsibility in 2003. As with the previous five Irish Presidencies of the European Union, Ireland is determined that its stewardship of the Presidency on this occasion will be as effective and efficient as those in the past. It is possible that this may be the last EU Presidency in the present format and we are determined to make it a successful one.Our Presidency is likely to be marked by a number of major events such as the historic enlargement of the European Union to 25 states and the final negotiating phase of the Intergovernmental Conference dealing with the future of Europe. The expansion of EU activities  means that the next Irish Presidency will have to implement the largest and most complex programme of work ever undertaken by an Irish Administration. We will need to provide the necessary resources to ensure that the Presidency is successful.The terrorist attacks on the US on 11 September last and more recently in Bali and in Moscow have highlighted the need for the Department to maintain in place and develop further well prepared systems of support both at headquarters and within our missions abroad for the protection of Irish citizens. This together with the ongoing high level service of consular protection offered to Irish citizens abroad will be a particular priority for the coming year.On the programme side of Vote 38, the Department has been allocated €30.34 million, which is only slightly less than what was provided in 2002. This level of funding will enable the Department to maintain its commitments to various programmes in 2003. For instance, we will continue to support projects which enhance North-South co-operation and build on the Good Friday Agreement. We will provide continued assistance to the European Union accession countries in the form of support for training programmes to help them meet accession requirements and we will support peace and election monitoring programmes under the control of the European Union, especially in the Balkans region. We will also meet our ongoing financial commitments to international organisations, in particular the UN and its peacekeeping operations. Ireland's role in UN peacekeeping operations continues to be an important signal of our commitment to the ideals of the organisation.Before dealing with Vote 39, I wish to refer briefly to a service provided by the Department that does not always come to the notice of this House, but I know Deputies appreciate this service. There has been a significant increase in the number of Irish passports issued over recent years. On current trends, over 430,000 passports will be issued in Dublin and Cork this year, up from 394,000 last year. Over 50,000 passports are likely to be issued by the Irish Embassy in London and passports issued by other missions should be in excess of 35,000. This will bring worldwide passports issued for 2002 to nearly 520,000, which is approximately 10% up on last year and 80% up on 1996. Fees received in Dublin and Cork for the first ten months this year amount to €18.2 million. On current trends, the end of year revenue will amount to over €19.1 million. Worldwide passport revenue should be in the region of €23 million. In order to improve the level of service to the public, we are currently examining proposals for the development of a modern, automated passport production facility which will result in a more efficient passport delivery system.The 2003 allocation for Vote 39 is €373.449 million. This compares with an allocation in 2002 of €340 million and represents an increase of €33  million or 9.7% on that figure. The 2003 allocation of €373.449 million is the highest ever in the history of the Ireland Aid programme. It is a measure of the Government's commitment to the area of overseas development aid that despite the changed and difficult financial circumstances, our level of assistance to developing countries will be maintained at an unprecedented high level. The increase in the allocation for 2003 follows a period of unprecedented growth in our overseas aid. This growth is pursuant to the Government's commitment, which is restated in the programme for Government to achieve the UN target for ODA of 0.7% of GNP by 2007. Five years ago when the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Coalition assumed office Ireland's programme for development assistance amounted to €158 million. Since then the programme has more than doubled. Much of the expansion has come in the past two years and it is anticipated that our contribution, as a percentage of GNP, will have increased from 0.33% in 2001 to 0.41% in 2002. Increasing the allocation to Vote 39 in 2003 by a further €33 million bringing the total allocation to €373 million should enable us to maintain our contribution of 0.41% of GNP next year. As a proportion of GNP, Ireland is now placed among the top five donors in the European Union and among the top six donors in the OECD.The main focus in 2003 will be on consolidating the progress which has been made possible in recent years through the rapid expansion of the aid programme and to lay the groundwork for further expansion in the years to come. Rapid growth has enabled us to expand and deepen our support for programmes in a range of countries and fields. Our programme enjoys a worldwide reputation for high quality and effective aid and we will continue to seek to improve further the effectiveness of the programme through closer co-operation with partner Governments and with Irish NGOs and missionaries.While our relationship with NGOs has always been a fruitful one, the establishment of the Development Forum under the aegis of the Advisory Board for Ireland Aid will provide a formal mechanism for closer co-operation in 2003 and beyond. I recently met representatives of a number of NGOs and reiterated my desire to see our partnership deepen at the programme and policy level.I would like to refer to the detailed breakdown of Vote 39 as outlined in the Abridged Estimates Volume. The vast bulk of funding under Vote 39, €355 million, or 94% is allocated across the various programme subheads while administration accounts for €22.3 million, or 6% of the total allocation. This latter amount, which is marginally down on the allocation for 2002, includes the salary and allowances cost of permanent civil servants and specialist contract staff as well as locally employed advisers and support staff in programme country missions, travel and subsistence costs, consultancy services, premises, telecom munications and other running costs for the programme.The Abridged Estimates Volume provides a breakdown of the €355 million. As in previous years, priority will continue to be given to bilateral grant aid under subhead B. The key focus of the bilateral programme is on a small number of least developed countries. The programme countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, which are among the poorest in the world, will account for more than half of the total allocated to the bilateral programme.Subhead B will also include an increased dedicated provision for NGOs in recognition of the vital role they play in development and as a measure of our commitment to enhance co-operation with the NGO sector. The planned introduction of a multi-annual programme scheme for a number of NGOs from next year represents a further strengthening of our support for the important work undertaken in that sector. We will also continue the fight against HIV-AIDS as the Taoiseach announced. We will also support APSO, Agency for Personnel Services Overseas.I wish to clarify an issue. I am aware that some concerns have been expressed about the apparent reduction in support under subhead D in respect of our response to emergency and humanitarian crises worldwide and I wish to take this opportunity to clarify the position on this issue. This area is a key component of the Ireland Aid programme with particular attention given in 2002 to famine affected countries in southern Africa, to the emerging food crisis in Ethiopia and the humanitarian situation in Afghanistan. As Minister of State with responsibility for development, I will take steps to ensure that resources, at least of the order of those made available in 2002, will be provided again in 2003 to support emergency and humanitarian operations and to enable a rapid and effective response to emergencies worldwide. Some €51 million will be allocated to subheads E and F in respect of our multilateral programme of assistance. Subhead E concerns mandatory payments due under international treaties while subhead F comprises voluntary contributions to UN development and relief agencies.In line with the recommendations of the Ireland Aid review, a small allocation will continue to be set aside for development co-operation in Eastern Europe under subhead G. Notwithstanding our current financial difficulty, and I have listened to contributors to this debate, I am pleased that we will have the scope to strengthen the quality of our support for developing countries and the poorest of the poor in 2003.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I wish to share my time with Deputies Joe Higgins and Connolly.Reading the Estimates published last week, I was struck by the question as to who they are  aimed at. Much has been said about the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant which, in a calendar year, would cost the Exchequer €40 million, and rightly so. Last year the Minister for Finance reinstated mortgage relief for purchasers of second homes giving an estimated €50 million in tax breaks to house speculators. It is clear these Estimates are budgeting to protect the wealthy, while penalising average workers and their families.In the vital area of economic development, this double standard is also being applied. The cuts proposed in the Estimates will impact severely on the job creation activities of Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development, the county enterprise boards and the Western Development Commission. At a time when we need to invest in indigenous industry and employment, the funds for these agencies are being cut by 18%, 30% and 13%, respectively. Spending on some elements of FÁS is to be cut by 41%. What message is the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment sending to Irish business? Now is the time for innovative investment in developing Irish business, and not for cutbacks. IDA grants to industry are increasing yet the cost of a new job in an IDA backed company was €13,375 in 2001. The cost of an Enterprise Ireland job was less than €9,000, €4,000 cheaper but still more costly than the €4,500 it took a county enterprise board to create a job. We urgently need to review how funds are being allocated by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.An example of the lack of accountability of spending is the failure to evaluate the actual cost of the 19 task forces created since 1997 by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. The Government does not know how much these 19 task forces have cost and has not undertaken any cost benefit evaluation, but believes they "provide an effective, co-ordinated response to major company closures". How do we know that? This is just one small example of the lack of thought on how effectively public funds are being spent.Over €161 million was spent last year on job creation grants to industry. This is only one part of a substantial economic development budget. We need to know this money is being spent fairly and effectively. We need a review of the share of that grant allocation to the various industries to give the more cost-effective agencies, such as the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland, a better share of this more productive grant being handed out. The sooner indigenous industry is recognised as an integral part of the economy, the better.
#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I view the proposal to abolish the first-time buyer's grant as one of the most regressive steps taken as a panic measure by this bankrupt Government. Bereft of ideas and cash and having squandered the boom from the posi tion of a €4.8 billion surplus last year to a €2 billion deficit nearly 12 months later, this has to be the most reckless, feckless and gung-ho bunch of wastrels since Papa Doc Duvalier and his gang. I hope the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's sense of humour has not gone with all the billions.In this Government's headlong dash towards bankruptcy, haemorrhaging cash with gay abandon, it has succeeded in turning Ireland into a tribunal ridden society with the legal profession being the principal beneficiaries of the corruption fall-out which has enveloped our body politic. Using the Lindsay tribunal as a yardstick at a cost of €23 million, which laboured for over a year and produced nothing tangible, scant thought has been directed towards the value for money principal in the swathe of tribunals which continue to ponderously and meticulously pursue their work. Indeed, the Government would be well advised to borrow a leaf from the FAI's experience with the eminently worthwhile Genesis inquiry which recently completed its report at a cost of €30,000. The Government regularly spends millions of euro and gets no answers. At least with the Genesis report, the FAI had a result.The Government which presides over the economy's mismanagement and misdirection has grievously let down all those couples desperately seeking to gain a foothold on the residential property ladder. For them, their first home represented an enormous personal financial burden and commitment – indeed, the greatest single investment of their lives. Both the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach displayed an appalling lack of understanding about how young couples must cope. It is easy for them speaking from the comparative comfort of their respective pads in Dublin. Ministers with their triple housing breaks untouched by the Minister for Finance are cushioned from the impact of grant cutbacks and receive an allowance of nearly €11,000 to build another house in Dublin far removed from their constituencies. Ministers also have the comfort of 100% mortgage interest relief on a second home and standard tax relief on their primary home.Another scheme which is severely undermined as a result of the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant is the shared ownership scheme. This scheme has an honourable record of enabling less well off first time buyers to gain a toe hold in the housing market with the co-operation of the county council. The effect of the grant cutback will be to virtually eliminate this scheme since at this end of the market, every penny counts to help bridge the gap. The €3,800 represents a small fortune to buyers in this position.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	399	I welcome a delegation of striking fire-fighters from Northern Ireland to the Visitor's Gallery and express my solidarity and that of Irish workers and the Socialist Party with their just struggle.The publication of the Estimates for public expenditure reveals an utterly discredited crew of  politicians ruling this State and calling themselves a Government who have lied and cheated their way back into power and then with cynical callousness kicked in the teeth those who they duped into believing them. What a cast of characters we have had thrown up in the recent days since the publication of these Estimates. The Minister for Finance and his party leader have been widely labelled as cowboys, unfairly because there is no evidence that a majority of those who honestly herd cows for a living are chancers and cheats. Then we had the parade of the mighty mice roaring from the safety of the Fianna Fáil backbenches about the abolition of the first-time house buyer's grant. We heard their roars from Cork to Swords and beyond but come 7 p.m. this evening, which of the brave mice will come into this House and bell the McCreevy cat by voting in the lobbies against these draconian measures being introduced by the Government? Clearly, they will stick with their chunk of cheese and will be exposed – I welcome this – as fraudulent champions of young workers.What about the Progressive Democrats? We know the Tánaiste believes working class people are some form of primitive life but what about the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform? His greatest achievement in recent times has been to climb ladders for Ireland during the general election campaign. He has no time to listen to the trauma of those who will endure his cuts; he is too busy hiring aeroplanes to deport a handful of people to Nigeria. How we wish the Minister would leave the few unfortunate asylum seekers here and take the plane to Nigeria and stay there.These cuts coming at the first hint of economic slow down in national and international capitalism signal the beginning of an onslaught on the living standards of working people and the crucial public services on which they depend. For five years this Government has handed billions to speculators, big business, corporations and the wealthy in concessions and cuts in their taxes. It did not lift a finger as the obscene profiteering and speculation in housing doubled and trebled the price of a home putting it outside the reach of working people. What an outrage now that those who the Government kicks are the victims of the speculators rather than the speculators themselves. My call to working people, trade Unionists, working class communities, students, youths and to those needing homes is, let us not lie down in front of it anymore – take to the streets, mobilise in open, visible opposition in the unions and communities to a Government which is determined to solve whatever crisis lies down the road on the backs of ordinary people while protecting its rich backers. We will force back these draconian cuts and send the Government scurrying. We will expose its members for the frauds they are.

Let us remind ourselves of one thing – if the public knew the kind of society he really stands for, he would not even have his own seat.

He will not do it because he believes in it. That is what he  stands for. I defer to nobody and particularly not to Deputy Higgins on a charge of fraudulent politics.In the last election I stood clearly on a platform which had as its primary role the keeping of the finances of the country on a sound basis. Deputy Higgins was the first to say that I would stand for the kind of politics for which I stand. He was the first to go on platforms in his constituency and berate me and hold me up as an object of contempt because I wish to do what it takes to make this country successful.Let us be clear about this. The Deputy is a Trotskyite and a Communist. I am not. That is the truth of the matter. I do not wish to hear Deputy Higgins going on about fraudulent politics, fraudulent labels and getting elected by fraud. If the Deputy actually told his constituents what he stands for, the kind of society he wants to create, the kind of society that people like him have created in the past, he would not even save his notional deposit.

The Estimates will, in combination with the measures taken on budget day, approximate the growth in public spending to the growth in available revenue. Before the election, that is something which I said I would ensure happened. I, and my party, are clear that if revenue is available we will spend it. If it is not available we will not borrow in order to create the kind of economic mess that brought me into politics in the first place, the situation that existed in 1987 when the country's debt had doubled in five years. We were pictured on the front of The Economist magazine as the sick man of Europe and the IMF was going to come in to rescue us from the absolutely irresponsible politics that had brought us to our knees.Unemployment stood at 250,000 and 19% of workers were without jobs. There were areas, particularly in Deputy Higgins' constituency, with 80% to 90% unemployment. There were no jobs and third generation unemployment was a fact in some houses. It is the policies of the Progressive Democrats in combination with Fianna Fáil that turned this country around and brought unemployment down to 4%.

It suggested that it wanted to bring our tax rates up to the European average. Effectively, that meant that it wanted to double some rates of taxation and make our system of taxation the kind that has driven jobs out of central Europe. It wanted to undo all the work that had been done to make this country successful.

There is a number of reasons for that. The cutbacks signposted in the Estimates will affect the vulnerable and less well-off sections of our communities, from Deputy Higgins's constituency to my constituency in north-west Donegal. However, what has hurt the people most is that they have been misled by the Government and its predecessor because only a few months ago while the election campaign was being fought we were told no cutbacks were envisaged in the near future and everything was rosy in the garden.I am interested in the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform's assertion that he stood in the general election on the platform of implementing sound financial policies. I am glad he has been reformed. He was a member of the previous Administration and attended Cabinet meetings. It emerged in a recent Sunday newspaper that long before the election was held every Department and Minister knew the public finances were not healthy and were not in the condition outlined by the Minister for Finance right up to election day. They knew a crisis was around the corner and the general election was the reason the crisis was postponed.I refer to the document that was inadvertently released by the Department of Foreign Affairs, which contained a circular to all Departments that outlined cuts that needed to be implemented, amounting to €300 million. We did not hear about these cutbacks until the election was over. The amount of cutbacks was subsequently increased to €900 million. No sooner was the election over than the truth emerged, and that is what has hurt people most. They were misled and they re-elected a Government that withheld the truth until the election had been held. The Government will pay the price for this at a later date.Commentators are asking what would the Opposition do, but the question that should be  asked is how we got into this mess. Since the Minister for Finance took office in 1997 there have been surpluses of between €3 billion and €5 billion annually, but suddenly these surpluses have turned into a deficit of almost €1.5 billion. The reason for this is that over the past two years every measure taken by the Government was designed to purchase this year's election by hook or by crook and not to maintain a sound economy. The Government has succeeded and the poor people of Ireland will pay for that in coming years.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I refer to the Estimate for the Department of Health and Children. Because today is world day for the prevention of child abuse it is appropriate that I should deal with the lack of resources to ensure children are not abused and that those who are abused have adequate services available to them. There is no allocation in the Estimates to improve the necessary level of services to protect children or for the employment of an adequate complement of social service and child care workers to respond to children's protection and counselling needs. Children in need of social services or counselling should not be prevented from receiving care because of a lack of staff or resources.Waiting lists for social services exceeded 2,000 in certain parts of the area covered by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and children have been let down by the Government. While recognising the challenges and difficulties involved in staff recruitment and retention, staff vacancy levels of between 25% and 50% generate increased workloads for existing staff and undermine the effectiveness of service provision. The Minister has not allocated money for the establishment of a child death review committee, which has been demanded to ensure formal and standard examinations of the circumstances of unexpected child deaths. In the past two years there have been at least 21 instances of fatal abuse of children in Ireland. To determine what steps might be taken to reverse this trend, the Government should establish a child death review committee to examine the circumstances surrounding these deaths and to make recommendations for policies and practices that would help prevent such tragedies in the future.The American Academy of Pediatrics noted in its recommendations regarding child deaths and death review teams that the lack of adequate investigations of infant deaths allowed flawed systems to continue and were an impediment to preventing the death of other children at risk. The establishment of a child death review panel, which was a key recommendation emerging from a special conference on child abuse in March this year, will not now take place.I compliment the Children's Rights Alliance on its work in this area and for drawing these matters to our attention. The alliance advocates three steps to protect children, measures which have been recommended over the past year by the alliance's member organisations. I understand  they are under review in the relevant Departments for implementation this year but, on seeing the Estimates, there must be a serious doubt that any attempt will be made to prioritise their implementation next year.I raised one of the measures advocated by the alliance in the Dáil last week, the vetting of non-statutory staff who work with children. There is an urgent need to address the crisis in the community and voluntary sector with regard to the vetting of staff who work with children. Currently, vetting support provided by the Garda vetting unit is not extended to those outside the statutory sector. Voluntary organisations and other non-governmental organisations that work directly with children are not being given adequate assistance to ensure that protective staff are fully and effectively screened. Vetting support must be extended to these NGOs without delay but no money is provided in the Estimates to do so, which is a disgrace.

Everybody has to manage their personal finances and knows that income must equal expenditure. The management of a country's finances is no different.Unfortunately, the income available to the Government has decreased during the past few months. This is due to external factors such as the terrible events of 11 September last year and the general uncertainty surrounding the situation in Iraq. These factors have resulted in a decrease in the tax take available to the Government. It would be extremely foolhardy to expect a Government to continue to spend money it did not have.

On the capital side, more than €500 million will be spent on health infrastructure with another €500 million being spent on education. A sum of €1 billion will be spent on housing. Overall capital expenditure will be €5.3 billion.Overall spending on health will be increased by 6%. An extra €53 million is provided for the completion of an additional 709 beds in acute hospitals and €31 million will be provided for the treatment purchase fund. This will ensure that the Government continues to make waiting lists shorter by treating in excess of 7,000 extra patients in 2003. There will be an increase of €15 million for services for older people and services for disability will receive €28 million. An additional €7.5 million is being provided for child care services, which also covers child homelessness. A sum of €10 million is also being provided for general practice units and primary care co-operatives. I have worked in this area for the last 27 years and I believe this is a worthwhile investment.

I hope I can repay the confidence the people entrusted in me and that I can live up to their expectations.A firm approach to public spending is necessary. Worldwide economic growth this year has slowed markedly and the outlook for 2003 is not very different. The first priority must be to return to a sustainable rate of spending growth. This does not mean a reduction in absolute levels of spending or low levels of public spending, even though spending rose by 40% in the last two years. We cannot spend what we do not have no matter how desirable the objective.The Government chose to focus available resources on health, social welfare, education, transport and infrastructure, and I welcome that. There have been suggestions that the Government should allow a modest planned deficit. The Government's intention is to pursue a sustainable course, suitable for the needs of the time, and one that is capable of quickly restoring our capacity to meet our promises to the electorate, as we did after 1997.Next year, current spending will be more than €31 billion, compared to €17 billion in 1997. On the current side, 7% of available resources are being devoted to health, social and family affairs, and education. Health spending is up €520 million, or 7% on 2002, and €4.9 billion, or 141%, on 1997. Social and family affairs spending is up nearly €300 million, 3% on 2002, and nearly €4 billion, or 70% on 1997. Education spending  is up nearly €300 million, that is 6% on 2002, and €2.1 billion, or 71%, on 1997.While the €5.3 billion for capital spending being invested in 2003 is 6% less than the figure for 2002, it is almost 170% above the 1997 investment level. Almost €1.5 billion is being provided for infrastructural investment in roads and public transport. Over €1 billion will be available for housing, while health infrastructural investment will exceed €500 million. The education sector will also receive over €500 million for investment in school building and refurbishment, and over €470 million has been made available for water and sewerage services.I look forward to budget day and, indeed, to the next five budgets that the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, will introduce in the House. I also look forward to seeing existing anomalies in the tax system and laws being removed and all loopholes being closed off. The Opposition is in agreement that this is a time for prudent management of our national finances, but will they tell us where they would take the tough decisions? All I hear from them is an exhortation to borrow more.

I can never understand why people who bought second-hand houses did not receive a grant, yet those who purchased new houses did. Following the economic growth of recent years, many people are building houses in rural areas that are well in excess of grant size. That is their prerogative and they have chosen to do so. On budget day, the Minister for Finance should provide a tax break or some additional mortgage relief to those who were depending on the first-time buyer's grant.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	509	After being forced to plough through a speech like that from the Fianna Fáil script factory, the least Deputy Devins deserves is that the road in Sligo, to which he referred, should be reinstated.This combination of Government parties deliberately calculated some two years ahead of the 2002 electoral contest that it was going to buy the general election with taxpayers' money. In doing so Fianna Fáil demonstrated utter disregard for the public finances and a reckless lack of interest in the damage that might be inflicted on the economy. Less frequently commented on, however, is the craven self-interested acquiescence of those pillars of fiscal rectitude, the Progressive Democrats. Michael McDowell, as he then was, appealed to the electorate to save themselves from Fianna Fáil and the dangers inherent in allowing that party to govern alone. He never admitted that the damage was already done with the Progressive Democrats at the Cabinet table. He devoted his slot this evening to an attack on Deputy Joe Higgins's socialism and a declaration that he, the Minister, is not a communist. As a revelation, that admission ranks with the news that Fianna Fáil should not be let out alone or that the Pope is a Catholic.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, tries to hide behind the fig-leaf of two and a half lines buried away in the party's manifesto that the Fianna Fáil promises were predicated on the public finances. The public were well protected from that secret by an army of hand-holders and spin doctors, whose bivouac was the Treasury Management Building, and whose slogan was "It's showtime". In fact, Deputy McCreevy gave the highest possible profile to a definitive undertaking to the then Fine Gael leader that "no cutbacks whatsoever are being planned secretly or otherwise". It was the most deliberate, calculated untruth on a fundamentally important matter of policy ever uttered by an Irish Government Minister. It is unbelievable that Deputy McCreevy could have committed such a statement to writing without at least his Taoiseach agreeing to it and without the Tánaiste knowing about it.The Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, has just told us that growth came to "a virtual standstill in 2001", making the deceit even more unconscionable on the part of both Government parties.This week, the Book of Estimates revealed the full horror of the extent of the lie: jobs gone and more to go; young people to lose their homes; 200,000 low-paid citizens to be deprived of medical cards; 5,000 people sacked from CE schemes; the capital programme slowed further; and future employment strangled by further savaging the roll out of broadband. The list goes on.The approach to self-inflicted fiscal crisis is to abandon or suspend vital public investment projects rather than tackle the problem of inflation in construction, an industry which is, of course, dominated by the friends of Fianna Fáil. Dublin is choking and the Luas project is deferred for another year. The Minister for Transport watches over the disappearance of precious public resources into the pockets of contractors, as projects go over budget and behind schedule. His response is to adopt as his anthem the Johnny Logan song, "What's another year". Bus and train fares are also to be hiked, despite Fianna Fáil's assurance during the election that it "supports the idea of lower pricing for public transport during peak travel times", another untruth.The national road network needs continued investment. The response of the Government to its fiscal crisis is to suspend vital national road projects, while funding for non-national roads, including those in Sligo, is to be slashed by 27%. Soon we will again be negotiating lunar crater-style pot-holes.The Taoiseach's advisesr Senator Martin Mansergh muses on television that "it would be wrong to do long-term damage [to the economy] for short-term political reasons". If and when the Seanad comes to debate the Estimates, however, we know that Senator Mansergh will vote for this Book of Estimates and will probably speak in favour of them as well.In the field of education we need more investment. The decision of this Government is to cut investment in primary education by 4%, investment in secondary schools by 10%, and investment in colleges and universities by 29%. During the election campaign Fianna Fáil promised it would invest in schools "to ensure that every school attains modern standards within the next five years". In the field of education we need to improve and enhance access and second chance education. What has the Minister for Education and Science done since the election? He has cut the school retention initiative by €2 million, the back to education initiative by €3.8 million, and teacher recruitment and training by €6.7 million.During the election Fianna Fáil promised to introduce a socially enlightened and progressive measure, an increase in medical card eligibility to bring an additional 200,000 people on low incomes into the scheme. Now this promise also is gone by the board. In addition, there has been a steady stream of cutbacks announced in the health area since the Government's re-election. Even before the publication of these Estimates, the national treatment purchase scheme had been cut and the creation of frontline health jobs had been frozen. The drugs refund threshold had been raised and VHI premiums had been increased. This onslaught on public services, cutbacks in public initiatives and reneging on promises has one major overarching effect: it reduces the quality of life for the ordinary citizens of the State and, in particular, the quality of life and public services to the weakest sections of the population.What are we supposed to do? It seems we are supposed, like the children of Israel after the Babylonian sack of Jerusalem, to seek solace in readings from the Book of Lamentations. Or, as Deputy Fleming told "Morning Ireland", we can always go to the community welfare officer. The Government says nothing in this dreadful, inequitable and unethical behaviour is to do with it. It is all the fault of others – the world economy, September 11 and foot and mouth disease. The list is endless but it does not include the Government itself – its actions, mismanagement and stupidity. Of course it does not include lying and misrepresentation either. The Government claimed paternity of the economic boom that was in full bloom before it came to office but it now disclaims any responsibility for the reversal of engines.Deputy Ned O'Keeffe said people tell him that this is the most right-wing Government since 1921. There is no doubt about that. It is true. However, what will Deputy O'Keeffe and the other so-called rebels from Cork and elsewhere do in relation to the first-time buyer's grant tonight? The Government points to the economic argument that the grant ultimately benefits the builder, who pockets the grant through higher house prices. However, if this is what the Government believes, why did it not abolish the grant five years ago? Why does the Government not  claw back an element of the tax breaks showered on investors in the housing market? Why does the Government not claw back a proportion of the capital gains tax relief given to speculators? The Government contends that the cash value of the grant, at €3,800, is minimal relative to the level that home prices have reached. Again, if this is so, why is the grant only now being abolished? The Taoiseach says the purpose of the grant was to boost housing construction and that the grant has served this purpose. Again, why abolish the grant now? Why not last year or the year before or the year before that? The truth is that investors are earning more in rental income thanks to tax breaks from multiple properties than they are repaying on mortgages. The answer to these questions is that the Government does not really believe the arguments it is now adducing.The grant is also something else. In the context of soaring house prices, about which the Government has done nothing, people seeking to achieve the dream of a home of their own have to scrape together from various quarters the wherewithal for a deposit. They have to work hard and save diligently, chasing ever-rising prices. They have to turn to their parents and relations for help. They are forced to do almost anything to get in as they literally watch house prices rise daily. From the point of view of the personal finances of ordinary people in this desperate situation the grant is the small thing at the margin that can make the deposit possible and secure the down payment on the home of your own. That is what the Government has abolished in the name of necessity, in the cause of prudence and on the ground of sound finances.The Government is in the most awful financial mess of its own doing and as a result of its own mismanagement. It has decided to deal with the disaster it created by slashing public services and initiatives such as the first-time buyer's grant. Where are the measures to deal with house prices? Where are the policies to tackle the bottlenecks in the availability of development land and the release at reasonable, as opposed to speculative, prices of development land? They are nowhere to be seen and we know why. To go down that route would be to hurt the speculator friends of Fianna Fáil. To go down that route would be inconsistent with being the most right-wing Government since 1921. However, we know how Deputy Ned O'Keeffe will vote this evening. There is no doubt about how he and others on the Government backbenches who oppose this measure will vote. They know their place. It is not to represent ordinary people or to resist the attack of the Government on the quality of life of ordinary people. It is to act as dutiful lobby fodder for the Government and to parrot the scripts handed to them by the Fianna Fáil press office machine.In our schools and hospitals, in our towns and cities, in public utilities, State companies, in forestry and industry and at home, the citizens of the State are now enduring something entirely  unnecessary. The Government has a problem but in reality there is no threat to the State. Current spending is still showing a surplus. Ireland is not on the edge of ruin and the World Bank is not in the wings; we are not about to default. The Government created a mess, mismanaged its finances and got its sums and policies badly wrong. Now, like the Babylonians, its answer to its own mess is to attack the people.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	510	The Estimate for my Department for 2003 is €1,069,473,000, which represents a reduction of 5.3% on the 2002 Estimate. The Estimate has been structured specifically to encourage continued growth in the economy while at the same time recognising the overall imperative of reducing the growth in public spending. The fact is that we must acknowledge the changed economic circumstances in which we are currently operating but it is equally vital that we protect our economic competitiveness and retain the capacity to generate employment in key sectors. We have achieved that balance.I will deal with the Estimates for the enterprise development agencies under my remit, namely IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and Shannon Development. As the House can see from the figures in the Abridged Book of Estimates, the Estimates for these three agencies is substantial and totals some €280.591 million, accounting for some 26% of the overall voted amount. In line with the need to reduce public spending, the voted amounts for these agencies has been cut by an aggregate total of some 8.5%, or €25,993 million from the voted amount for this year.I will deal with the reduced administrative budgets later but now I wish to concentrate on the capital budget allocations. These reductions will impact on the capacity of each agency to provide support for industry with a consequent reduction in new approvals for grant-aid and equity investment as well as some prioritisation of other measures. Choices will have to be made in this tighter monetary environment.Confidence in the public finances is an essential prerequisite for sustained investment by indigenous and foreign investors. In the early to mid 1980s we had grants for everything, we had low business taxes – but high personal taxes – and we had bright educated people: unfortunately most of them were heading for the US, the UK or Australia because investors did not have confidence in our ability to manage our own economic affairs. The measured and prudent response to the downturn in the world economy in these Estimates and in the budget on 4 December is the surest way of sustaining a high level of employment and the level of investment that will create high quality jobs in the future.The challenge facing all the enterprise development agencies will be to find alternative ways to pure grant-aid to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and to continue to  encourage job creation in key sectors of the economy. When one considers the tightening rules relating to grant-aiding under the EU state aids regime and the changing world in which we operate, the emphasis for our development agencies has to be on providing the stimulus for innovation and generating new ideas. These ideas have then to be developed into commercial products that will create and maintain jobs in the longer term. Encouraging research and development activity is the key to meeting the challenge facing the Irish economy and ensuring that we maintain and expand the high employment levels of recent years. Consequently there will be a greater concentration on funding for research and development activity both in indigenous firms through Enterprise Ireland and through Science Foundation Ireland. Both organisations' voted amounts for this activity have been increased for next year over the 2002 figure. Commercialisation of such research and development is the basis for future sustainable job creation in Ireland in the changing global economy.Dealing with some specific subheads, I turn to subhead C2 which covers the IDA Ireland grants-to-industry Vote.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	511	What about the FÁS workers? Will the Minister come to that matter?
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	512	I will. The figures in the AEV show a small notional increase on the 2002 figure to cater primarily for the fact that grant approvals for a small number of largescale projects fall due to be paid in 2003. When these amounts are excluded IDA Ireland will incur a reduction in the amount of funding available for support to industry.Likewise, when one turns to consider subhead C3, it is worth bearing in mind that the 2002 voted amount included non-recurring expenditure in respect of development of broadband infrastructure. When this is excluded, the Estimate for 2003 shows a smaller reduction but will still allow IDA Ireland to continue in its property management work to help attract foreign direct investment to Ireland.When one considers the voted amount for Enterprise Ireland, under subhead D2, it is worth recalling that the agency also receives an allocation of funding from subhead F1. When added to the amount voted under subhead D2, Enterprise Ireland's funding shows a very small increase in 2003. However, within that amount, as I stated earlier, there is a noticeable shift towards research and development and away from supports to industry in the form of grant aid and equity.As Deputies are aware, in some cases the agencies pay out grants in arrears, based on approvals made in previous years. I assure the House that such claims for grants will continue to be paid on  foot of fully checked and approved submissions. The main area to be affected will be new approvals.Despite the reductions being imposed on the agencies, close examination of individual elements shows that the agencies can continue to fulfil their mandate successfully in 2003, albeit with a need for reprioritisation of tasks and measures.Science, technology, research and innovation are vital for the future. We must build the structures that support research excellence, enhance our ability to compete at the pinnacle of knowledge and produce the people, through our educational system, who will take on the new challenges. A cornerstone of this is building our research capability in our universities, institutes and enterprises – in essence, the research infrastructure that will make it possible.Central to this vision of Ireland as a country driving technological change is Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, which was established to implement the technology foresight fund of over €635 million. It will support projects in key technologies strategic to long-term national development and is a vital element in the Government's strategy to move Irish industry higher up the value chain. Since its establishment Science Foundation Ireland has funded 61 research projects across a range of research programmes with an overall financial commitment of €120 million over the next five years. SFI investments are targeted at research leaders as well as research teams to broaden and deepen national capability in scientific research in the areas underpinning biotechnology and information and communication technologies.The Government's commitment to research technological development and innovation is reflected in the Estimates. The subhead through which research and development supports are delivered, mainly through Enterprise Ireland on the indigenous side, has been increased substantially from €58 million in 2002 to €78 million in 2003. Science Foundation Ireland is still ramping its activity. Its budget has been increased from €35 million in 2002 to €70 million in 2003. It has been decided in the context of rationalising subheads to combine the research subheads of F1 and F2 into a new subhead F in 2003. This subhead will have a total of €148 million.In deciding on the 2003 allocation for labour force development and related areas, difficult choices had to be made. However, the Government was conscious of the need to maximise, within the current constraints on public spending, investment in measures that have a primary focus on employability. These include the provision of training and employment supports for the disabled and those experiencing difficulty in entering the labour market.I want to correct a common misunderstanding that has arisen about the level of funding available for FÁS training programmes. Some commentators have reported that these programmes  are to suffer a 41% reduction – Deputies have referred to this during the debate – but this is not true. Overall investment in FÁS training schemes in 2003 is being maintained very close to 2002 levels.

The reduction is €5 million, not 41%.

This discussion is about how a Cabinet and Government ruined our national finances, and the Book of Estimates proved this. Let the Cabinet and the backbenchers not hide behind Deputy McCreevy. They too have to take responsibility for the mess we are in.I am particularly interested in the health figures in the Estimates. It is a complete con-job to say that we will have an increase of 6% in the health services while the Minister and Cabinet know that health inflation is running at 10%. To the ordinary person, this means bed closures and cuts in services. If people do not believe me, they should listen to the recent critical remarks of the likes of Dr. David Hickey, the director of the kidney and pancreas transplant department in Beaumont hospital. People can say what they want, but the health strategy is in tatters.Capital spending has been cut by 7% and this is not an adjustment but an old-fashioned cut. We also saw the terrible plans to cut back on education and now we want our children to attend schools which are in terribly bad condition. Are we going back to the days of the hedge school? With this Government, it seems so.I urge the Government strongly to stop this drift to the right and not make ordinary people suffer. I challenge the people with the tunnel vision and the narrow economic view. There are other ways of raising funds without damaging the overall economy. One should ask the Revenue staff about the amount of money outstanding in  uncollected taxes. Its figure is €987 million and we all know that it errs on the side of caution.The Government has shown clearly the direction in which it is going. It saddens me to see and hear politicians rather arrogantly dismiss elected representatives when they allude to the cuts in health, education and the dumping of the €3,610 first-time buyer's grant at a time of a massive housing crisis. There is something sick about this Government and we need to make it better.Has the leadership of ICTU lost all its senses in even considering going into partnership with the most right-wing Government since the foundation of this State? Does it want to do a deal with a Government that has a policy of implementing cuts against the old, sick, disabled and homeless? I urge the leadership of ICTU to think again.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	557	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate.It is true that billions of euro were spent but not in the west of Ireland which has suffered very heavily. The problems in respect of unbalanced regional development will be compounded totally. The south and east of the country are 45% over target, and yet we are wallowing 39% behind in the west. We will have to put up with our second class roads for the next decade at least.What about the 25% cutback in the CLÁR fund, already spread over too many counties, which has gone down to €9 million? What about the forestry cuts and the 68% reduction in the western infrastructural fund, and how about the cuts in the REPS and the farmyard approved fund? What about the crisis in north-west Mayo, which Séamus Caulfield has highlighted? The 2002 census figures show that Mayo is the area of Ireland in most serious decline, crying out for proper infrastructure. We need urgent action. Shannon Area Development would certainly fit the picture here because otherwise there will be nobody left.What about the abolition of the first-time buyer's grant? I welcome the call to reverse this in the interests of equity. What about the defined revenue funding scheme that will allow people to stay in their own communities, such as older people who would otherwise go to nursing homes? They could very easily be supported in their own communities by this scheme. I hope the scheme will be dealt with adequately in the budget.I notice the comments of the Minister for Health and Children on BreastCheck, but where is the definite commitment towards it? I hope this will come. What about the situation in Mayo General Hospital in Castlebar, where we have an X-ray machine that has been broken since last March? People have to go to Galway for basic X-rays and barium meals, which any hospital worth its salt should be able to provide. Mayo General Hospital is the only general hospital in Mayo, but people have to travel many miles beyond for this basic investigation.What about the 700 hospital beds? They did not come to Mayo although we were promised 45. We lack 60 beds in total in our hospital. We have thousands of people in Mayo waiting for years for services and they have to travel a distance the equivalent of a journey from Dublin to Galway to avail of them – parts of Mayo are this distant from Galway. Older people have to travel this distance when they break a hip and this puts their lives in jeopardy.What about the other consultants we need – rheumatologists and ear, nose and throat specialists? People are waiting for years in terrible pain and that is not fair. People in Dublin would not put up with it so we should not have to? We hope our three orthopaedic surgeons will come, but we do not know when the posts will be advertised. We do not know when the ICU services needed to support them will be provided. We have great worries in this regard.When will the capital infrastructure be provided which we need to make Mayo competitive and keep people within their own area? While we need consultants in Mayo, 30,000 extra people are employed in the health services, of which doctors make up only a tiny percentage. What about the 200,000 medical cards? People really needed those cards and I am sure that some over-70s who got them – retired bank managers and so on – would have been quite delighted if people who really deserved them got them instead. That was very unfortunate.We have a great need for development in Mayo. Today I read the comments of the Taoiseach in the paper about broadband and I am worried about this because of the commitment made to place Mayo on an equal IT footing with the rest of the country. I would welcome the Tánaiste's comments on that. The severe cutback in the Estimates for broadband sends out a very wrong message. The Taoiseach has attempted to shift responsibility to the private sector to provide this service. It is wrong and it indicates that, as usual, County Mayo will have to wait until all other parts of the country have been serviced. County Mayo needs help now. So much for balanced regional development.

We may live on an island but our economy is one of the most globally connected in the world. For economic growth, job creation, building competitiveness and improving social justice, we must manage our economy prudently. That is what these Estimates do.The Estimates for 2003 take all relevant realities into account while, at the same time, ensuring that the economy will be shepherded safely  through a period of global uncertainty. I do not know whether to be saddened or amused by the positions adopted by the Opposition in this debate. It is not what they articulated in the general election campaign. It is not grounded on the open nature of our economy, nor do they give any recognition to the fact that the international economic context continues to be bleak. Ireland is not Tír na nÓg. We cannot carry on as if nothing has changed.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	563	That is what is being done through the Estimates. It is the right thing to do and it is what this Government will do.Those who talk about social inclusion must acknowledge that corrective action now will consolidate the enormous economic and social gains of recent years. Without such action now, we would risk rapidly eroding all that has been achieved. How would this promote social justice? Rather than face the reality of what is required to achieve lasting social and infrastructural progress, the Opposition choose instead to pretend that we can spend our way out of this downturn. We cannot and we will not.In formulating the Estimates, the recommendations of an independent review committee assisted the decision-making process. Government, however, is about listening to advice and then making decisions. It is beyond doubt that the spending increases of recent years could not be sustained indefinitely. Over the last two years alone, growth in spending was 40%. Taking into account the very high expenditure bases of all Departments and the consequent increase in services provision, the Government has made decisions around national priorities, both economic and social.In line with our overall objective to improve the general quality of life and to deepen national competitiveness, priority is being given to health, education, social welfare and transport infrastructure. With regard to health, the gross allocation for next year will be €8.9 billion, an increase of €520 million on 2002. That rise needs to be set within the context of a massive 147% cumulative  increase over the last five years. Of itself, it represents a clear demonstration of the Government's consistent commitment and determination to bring about substantive improvements in health care provision. However, the health delivery agencies also have a vital role to play, especially in the effective management of resources on behalf of patients and those on waiting lists, as well as on behalf of taxpayers generally.In education, the gross allocation for 2003 of €5.6 billion represents a €190 million increase on 2002 and brings the cumulative rise over the period 1997 to 2003 to 77%. The gross allocation for the Department of Social and Family Affairs is €9.7 billion, which on a pre-budget basis represents an increase of €300 million. Overall spending on social welfare has increased by €4 billion since 1997. It is self-evident therefore that the Government is according special priority to those sections in our society who are most marginalised or most vulnerable – those in need of health care those depending on social welfare payments for their incomes and those in education who will drive economic and social performance in the years ahead.To enable continued improvements to be made in building social fairness, special attention has to be paid as well to deepening national competitiveness. A key element of that is infrastructure investment.Having regard to the restraining effects on economic activity of accumulated under-investment, €5.3 billion will be invested next year in capital projects. By any objective reckoning, that is major expenditure. It is almost twice the equivalent rate for the European Union generally. Next year, €1.5 billion will be spent on capital investment in public transport, €1.02 billion on housing, a further €1.02 billion on health and education capital projects and over €470 million on environmental services.A significant easing in construction price inflation presents good opportunities now to achieve better value for money outcomes. In the round, the allocation for capital expenditure sets a correct balance for this economy and society. We will continue to invest in improving the competitiveness base of the economy while, at the same time, sustaining the gains achieved in promoting greater inclusion and greater equality in our society. As one would expect, the allocations to the higher priority areas have implications for those areas of lower priority.For my own Department, the 2003 Estimates provide a total of €23.641 million, representing a substantial reduction of 34% on the 2002 provision of €35.9 million. Nevertheless, I welcome the provision of a level of funding which I am satisfied will allow my Department to continue with the range of activities that it undertakes, reflecting the central role that it plays in advancing the priorities of Government. I strongly believe that these activities and services can continue to be provided, even with a tighter budget,  through the achievement of better value for money in the administration of the Department and the services it provides. This is something that my Department will be working very hard to achieve throughout the coming year.I am especially pleased that my Department will be in a position to give continued support to the very important work undertaken by the bodies mentioned below. The provision of funding for the National Economic and Social Council, the National Economic and Social Forum and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance will ensure that the very important roles fulfilled by them will continue. The National Forum on Europe made a valuable contribution to the Nice treaty debate and I welcome the provision of funding to enable it complete the work programme set out by the Chairman to further inform the debate on the future of Europe. The provision will also enable the Independent Commission of Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan Bombings to continue its work within the timeframe which it has indicated is required to complete its work. It will also enable the work of the Moriarty tribunal to continue.The Estimates provision will also enable continued support for the Information Society Commission, which has an important role to play in the continued development of the potential of the information society in Ireland. I welcome the increased provisions for the offices of the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions and the Chief State Solicitor. These provisions will enable the legal offices to cope with a heavy workload by providing additional resources to prosecute a backlog of cases.

The process undertaken by the Government was set within a wider consideration of fiscal developments in the wider world, where we rely heavily for trade and investment. In tailoring public expenditure levels to GNP economic estimates for 2003, we have  given greatest priority to the most vulnerable while, at the same time, protecting the competitiveness base of the economy. Fiscal prudence will guide this economy safely through ongoing global uncertainty.The policies of the Government will enable us to consolidate the huge economic and social gains of recent years. We will not abandon the low tax regime that has been the engine of our economic and social progress. Any short-term gain would cost us dearly in the long-term. We will husband our resources to support our priorities. Other issues, will for now, have to wait. This prudent approach will protect the jobs we have created and the progress we have made. I hope we will be able to assist the poor far better than the Labour Party when one of its Deputies held the Finance portfolio. For the future it will ensure that we are well placed to move ahead rapidly when conditions in the wider world permit.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	568	This year, after 22 months where public expenditure grew by 47%, the Book of Estimates should serve two purposes. First, they should indicate how the Government proposes to deal with the overall spending component of the public finances for 2003. Second, given the resources available, the estimates should indicate the Government's priorities within its overall policy framework. In fact, they are utterly meaningless – a miserable failure on both counts. Let us be clear: we do not have an economic problem but abject failure to manage the public finances and specifically to manage the current spending component of them.These estimates fail to give any indication of how the Government intends to manage overall spending for 2003. They fail because the Minister has not given any indication of what will be his approach in 2003 to public sector pay. He states that he will tell us on budget day, but what use is a Book of Estimates when we do not know what increase will apply to public sector pay, considering that it is the single biggest item in it, accounting for 50% of all current spending? He says that spending will increase by 3% next year but what he actually means is that spending excluding pay will increase by 3%. The stark reality is that we have no idea if the Government is doing anything meaningful to control the runaway train that public spending has become.The estimates also fail as an overall indicator of the Government's position on spending because there is no evidence that the Minister or the Government can restrict public spending to the levels declared in the Estimates. It could not do it in 2000, 2001 and 2002, so why should we believe that it can rein it back in 2003? The only way to give confidence that spending control will re-emerge is to see real evidence of reform that will deliver value for money. In this volume of Estimates there is not a single shred of evidence either in the Minister's statements or any other statement written by the Government's press officers.The Estimates' second function is to show where the Government's priorities lie and to inform people why these choices were made in times of scarce resources. The Estimates volume should be transparent so that, flawed as it is, it spells out clearly the impact on public services. Since last Thursday, all the commentators have talked about a 3% increase in spending next year. What 3%? It is based on the estimated outturn for 2003 notified by the various Departments to the Department of Finance, which is clearly washing its hands of them and I can see why. For ten months of this year the Minister let expenditure grow by 20% and miraculously the estimated outturn is back on target again to 14.8%. To achieve this, departmental spending in November and December will have to fall from 20% growth on last year to a 6% fall on 2001 levels.Deputy Parlon appears to understand this but I have trouble understanding it—
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	569	One has to cut spending.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	570	—because almost 75% of spending is on pay and social welfare and teachers, nurses, gardaí and old age pensioners are still being paid, while parents still pick up child benefit. If I have trouble in understanding that forecast of outturn figures, in consequence I have a problem understanding that spending is to grow by 3% next year, but if the 2002 spending in November and December continues as it has for the previous months, then these Estimates actually reflect a 1% cut, not a 3% rise, and that is before inflation. In effect, we have a real cut of more than 5% in public services.This party proposed a fiscal accountability Act which would do three things – impose transparency on public finances, force Departments to justify spending, and set out strong value for money conditions on all spending. We also favour the establishment of a team dedicated to reviewing value for money in the public service, whose reports would be published. We do not have such legislation but the Government should deliver on some of its objectives. For transparency on the capital side, it could publish a list of projects being funded next year – the roads, hospitals, and schools which underpin it. Let us stop this nonsense of telling boards of management in schools that they are suddenly on the list.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	571	Hear, hear.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	572	This is a list that goes on for years. The Government could establish a small trained inspectorate to prioritise a schools' buildings programme however cut back it was. It should publish the priorities and do the work. Likewise, the lists of hospital projects should be published with the tender, start and completion dates, as well as if they are over or under budge. Year after year we hear of capital projects costing in excess of the original budget.No one believes anymore that the budgeted cost of a project will be met by this Government. There are many reasons for this but one is raw politics. In an effort to placate local communities, angry about substandard, rat infested schools or long promised hospital or road improvements, announcements are made on local radio and in the local press. The planning stage is announced with great fanfare, followed by the announcement that a project has been approved for tender. Costs are incurred and tenders received but Ministers know in their hearts and souls that funding will not be available for years to complete the project. They go to meetings to discuss these matters but no one explains the value of a tender prepared in 2002 for a project that will not go ahead until 2005 or 2006. It is of no value at all and undermines democratic politics and the integrity and trust placed in Government Deputies by the electorate which they deceived last May.While on the subject of transparency, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government could publish a summary of the state of local authority finances including local authority budgets for 2002, their expenditure to September and the amount they borrowed. If he did that, we could understand the implications of the decision in the Estimates not to increase the contribution in 2003 to the local government fund. We know that local authorities are expected to cut spending by more than €105 million next year or else to increase charges, or more directly, local taxes, and that will impact on every single household. If the backbenchers on the other side, who were so vocal in the past two weeks on local radio, think they have trouble with the abolition of the new house grant, although they will vote for the Estimates tonight, they will find that there is even more trouble when it comes to deciding the estimates for local authorities, especially 15 months later when they knock on doors at election time after increasing refuse charges to €500 or some such amount. We will see what tune Deputies O'Flynn, McGuinness and others – who have said that their constituency has done well since they were elected – will sing when they go to the parliamentary party meeting then.

This is a major programme for Government. Offices have been built across the country and people appointed to high level managerial permanent posts but there is not a red cent to pay for all this. One county council, close to my own heart, is already €25 million overdrawn.  If the Taoiseach, Tánaiste, and the backbenchers, who were newly confirmed in Fianna Fáil at today's party meeting, think they were exposed to public savagery because of the cynical cut of the house grant, they may wait until they reap the whirlwind next February or March when this starts.

The Minister disavows responsibility because he gives the money to the health boards. He went outside the House today to meet the people from Monaghan, who are there for the third week in a row, and told them that he had no function, authority or responsibility for the closure of Monaghan General Hospital. If it was transferred to Midleton, Ballincollig or some such place, there would certainly be a change in ministerial responsibilities and ethos.

We have had increases in VHI charges and public transport costs, and I presume an increase in the cost of TV licences is on the way. The sick will bear the further cost of drugs, and third level education is becoming a luxury.Reform of public spending is vital. New thinking is required and systems that are 35 and 40 years old are no longer appropriate. Ministers need to show moral leadership in this regard but they have not done so. Such a change might be anathema to the Government but we must have it.Those vocal Fianna Fáil backbenchers have been telling their constituents for the past fortnight that they disavow what the Government has done and that they will change it in the Dáil. Their hour has come, the first of many.

They were right to do so because we are proud of it. We were elected in June for a five year term. That five year term will see the implementation of the vast bulk of that manifesto in the same way we implemented our manifesto in the previous five years despite the fact that we spent hours in this House listening to the Opposition telling us that we would not be able to implement any of it. In the end, about 97% of it was implemented—

Those decisions had to be made.During the election campaign I sat beside the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance at various party conferences etc. when the Minister for Finance was asked about his priorities in the event that, as every party in this House predicted, there is a budget deficit. He stated clearly that his priorities would be health, education and social welfare—

At the end of this five year term, we will have implemented our programme for Government.

In 1994, capital gains tax returns amounted to £59 million and the following year the return was £57. In 1997, when the change was made, it returned £168 million. Last year, despite the reduction from 40% to 20%, the yield to the Government was €876 million. If that was not a pragmatic decision to make and a correct one, I do not know what is. The talk about increasing taxation to bring in greater revenue is nonsense.

One would think we had a wonderful Opposition in this House, although we are anxious to have a good Opposition. To have a good Government it is important to have a good Opposition, but if the past few months are anything to go by, we are in for a rude awakening.

The fiscal position in the euro area and in the UK and the US has deteriorated and the same factors are at work in Ireland.

To do otherwise would be irresponsible. This does not mean a reduction in absolute levels of spending nor does it mean low levels of public spending given the levels of increases over recent years. It requires tough choices. It is easy to identify areas where additional money could be spent. The Deputies across the House have an exhaustive list but I have not heard one word about  spending programmes or schemes which they would recommend for closure.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	652	It is the Government's job to take responsibility.

The trite and very hollow criticisms of the Estimates by the Opposition are in stark contrast with their calls for control in public spending. Now that the measures are in place to control public spending it is not to their liking. Bellicose musings and cheerleading to the gallery by some of the Deputies on the other side might sound nice—

They want a strong Government which is prepared to make clear choices. Our willingness to cut back on the increase in public spending will help steer this economy through these uncertain times. This approach is critical if we are to avoid increasing personal and business tax rates.The Minister for Finance has reminded the House how our economic success in recent years has been built by putting sound taxation policies in place. Neither the Government nor the ordinary working person want to see these abandoned.

I repeat that on a pre-budget basis the Government will invest €36.7 billion in our public services this year. The impression is given that we have closed down totally. This is nearly double the amount spent in 1997.

This is a fundamentally flawed view and the conclusion drawn is incorrect.

The 10% rate of inflation refers to the trends in prices of those health related items which form part of the basket of goods and services which make up the consumer price index.

The simplistic comparison of CPI based data with the rate of increase in the Health and Children Vote presented in the Abridged Estimates is therefore both misleading and inappropriate.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	705	Health inflation is higher.

In relation to underlying inflation, the 2003 Estimates include adequate provision for the carry-over costs from 2002—

The Minister for Finance has indicated that the pay implications of any further increases will be dealt with on budget day. The 30% or so of health spending which is not related to pay covers a myriad of different elements such as food, light and heat and high  technology drugs and equipment. The increased provision is intended to ensure that the existing level of health service is broadly maintained in 2003 and allows for more limited expansion of high-priority areas such as cancer treatment.The new house grants scheme was introduced in its present form in 1997.

In 1997, only 17,000 new houses were built. Last year private housing amounted to over—

For example, the National Economic and Social Council has expressed the view that the general cash subsidies—

I fully supported that Bill on the basis that urgent action was required to deal with this serious issue. Waste management is a challenge for us all and some progress has been made in recent years. Economic growth and increasing affluence have resulted in more waste but we have been slow to recognise the consequences of this.It would be fair to say that central and local government, including Dublin City Council of which I am a member, procrastinated on this issue for years. It was only because of pressure from the European Union that we finally realised we had to bite the bullet on this issue. Progress has been made but as the saying goes, there is more to do. The Minister is giving problems of  waste management the highest priority in his Department.I am sure the Green Party is acting with the best of intentions in bringing forward this Bill at this time. Part of me has to admire its idealism. However, such idealism can also be viewed as naiveté and I firmly believe that if this Bill is passed, it will set us back years in our endeavours to grapple with this important problem. Chaos in the waste planning process would ensue and old controversies, which have finally been sorted out, would be re-ignited. In addition, waste management plans, which have finally been agreed after tortuous consultations, would not be implemented.On reflection, this Bill is irresponsible and bordering on reckless. Deputies Sargent and Gormley are trying to turn back the clock and this simply is not possible.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	734	I would like to believe the Green Party is acting out of conviction on these matters but I cannot help thinking that taking this Bill in Private Members' time at this point is seen by it as more of a publicity stunt in view of public meetings taking place this week on the proposed incinerator at Ringsend.As a member of a local authority, I always support the delegation of more powers to county and city councils. I had regrets about the provisions of the 2001 Act which made making and adopting waste management plans an executive function. However, the reality was, unfortunately, that local authorities were failing to act on this issue. The Act was necessary to ensure the waste planning process was finalised and that delays in bringing forward a regional approach and putting a waste management infrastructure in place were brought to an end. A situation whereby 90% of our waste was landfilled was no longer sustainable. Maybe at some stage in the distant future, these provisions can be reviewed but now is definitely not the appropriate time to do it.In this Bill, zero waste policies are being advanced as a sole solution. This is simply not a runner. Zero waste policies have been adopted in New Zealand and Australia, for example, but these plans remain aspirational and long-term and will not and cannot work on their own. The Government is right to pursue an integrated waste management approach. Such an integrated policy makes provision for recycling, landfill and incineration. In short, five forms of action are being pursued by the Minister: prevention; minimisation; reuse and recycling; energy recovery  and safe disposal. Such an integrated approach is the only practical way to proceed.There are concerns about incineration. It is a controversial subject, but incineration or thermal treatment is only one part of the Minister's overall strategy. Health concerns are the primary focus of this debate and that is as it should be. People's fears should be addressed and a rational and informed debate is required. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that incineration is a safe, tried and tested technology capable of meeting stringent environmental standards and which is widely used throughout the EU. In an Irish context, I believe the Environmental Protection Agency would operate the highest standards with regard to such facilities. This debate will continue which I welcome.I also welcome the new Government initiatives with regard to waste management. These include a national waste prevention programme, a national market development programme for recyclable materials and further producer responsibility initiatives in electrical and electronic waste in end of life vehicle and tyres, batteries, newsprint and so on. It also includes an office of environmental enforcement to improve enforcement performance, especially concerning illegal waste activities and a national strategy of biodegradable municipal waste to ensure the diversion of organic waste from landfill. It is intended to establish an environment fund to receive the proceeds of levies on landfill disposal and plastic bags and impose a ban on the landfilling of recyclable materials.In this regard, I call on the Minister to further develop the so-called producer responsibility initiatives and, in particular, to tackle the problem of packaging. Consumers do not have much choice with regard to packaging. Products which they require are presented on a take it or leave it basis. This problem should be addressed at source by ensuring that industrial and manufacturing entities present their products with as little packaging as possible. I hope the Minister will pursue this further and bring forward imaginative policies to tackle it either at a national or EU level.I also wish to deal briefly with the experience of Dublin city and county. A waste management plan for the Dublin region was adopted by Dublin City Council in 1998. Great progress has been made in its implementation. So much so, that the practices of citizens with regard to waste have changed dramatically. That did not happen by accident. Nowhere is this more evident than in the area of recycling. Dublin City Council has developed and is implementing a wide range of recycling initiatives, which are successful and are receiving wide public support. These contribute significantly to the reduction of waste volumes going to landfill. It is estimated that for the coming year, beginning November 2002, 15,000  tonnes of materials will be recycled, that is, diverted from landfill, as follows: 61% newspapers and leaflets, 34% mixed cardboard, 1% aluminium cans, 4% steel cans and 4% residues not suitable for recycling. The city council, of which I am a member, has put in place a wide range of initiatives and measures to deal with recycling that are having a real impact. The situation has changed considerably in Dublin, and in other local authorities. We have wheelie bins, the green Oxigen bins and the promise of brown bins. There has been major change. I believe the waste management strategies in place will be successful and I would not recommend any change at this time. By going back to the drawing board we would be slowing down the rate of progress.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	737	I wish to share time with Deputies Brendan Smith and O'Connor. It is my experience that an Opposition would usually temper its proposals due to the fear that, in the short-term, it may end up in Government and may have to stand over its proposals or that it may have them exposed to serious critical analysis. On reading the Bill, it strikes me that its proposers are in fear of neither outcome and they may be right to have that lack of caution for reasons I will set out in the course of the next few minutes.Following the landmark decision in July by Mr. Justice Philip O'Sullivan in the case of Wicklow County Council v. Clifford Fenton and Dublin Waste, it appears that local authorities' powers of enforcement of waste management legislation have been improved. The decision may well result in a clean-up bill of up to €20 million for the directors of the company personally, the High Court having lifted the corporate veil of the company's separate legal personality. It was a great decision and one which proves that waste management is taken seriously.Furthermore, the publication of the Bacon report on waste management together with the census figures published during the summer show that there is a great challenge in this area in the coming years. I believe that the polluter pays principle remains the most effective way to reduce waste and that commercial and industrial waste is, by far, the biggest contributor to our landfills. Incentives have to be provided to commercial and industrial enterprises to encourage them to adopt better practice in environmental policies. It is also essential that pay per weight be introduced as quickly as possible.One of the characteristics of the debate on waste management has been an exclusive focus on charges associated with the policy. The European Council Directive of 1991 was carried into effect by the Waste Management Act, 1996, and signed into law by the then Minister for the  Environment, Deputy Howlin. Since then, few of his Labour Party colleagues have brought themselves to support the polluter pays principle as enshrined in that legislation.In my time on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, three estimates have been passed containing a charge and on no occasion did any Labour Party councillor back the charge. A distaste for brave decisions clearly is not the exclusive preserve of Sir Humphrey Appleby and his kind. The Labour Party will have to critically analyse whether there is a dysfunction within its organisation whereby its councillors fail to carry through its national policies.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	738	We implemented it.
#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	739	The Bacon report recommends that new waste management strategies be prepared, incorporating a more realistic view of recycling targets and probable delays in the installation of thermal treatment plants. However, much of the assumptions on which the report is based have been proven inaccurate. In 2001, the Central Statistics Office predicted that Dublin would have the fastest growing population yet the recent census figures indicate that it is, in fact, the slowest growing area in the country. Furthermore, net migration has increased by 6.8% in the last six years, a much faster rate than had previously been predicted. What all of this means is that, at a practical level, some tough decisions lie ahead for local government. For example, the unpopular thermal treatment option may have to be swallowed.The previous Minister for the Environment and Local Government recognised the difficulties ahead when he withdrew the power to decide a waste management strategy from local councillors and empowered county managers instead. The Waste Management (Amendment) Act, 2001, which came into force in July of last year, provided that the making of a waste management plan would be the function of the county manager rather than the county councillors while the power to replace the plan remains with the councillors. While I regretted that at the time, I believe it was a necessary step.The Bill before the House is a step backwards. It is old battles being fought over again. We need to move forward and take tough decisions. One of the arguments against thermal treatment, and it is one which I stood over for some time, is that it discouraged recycling in the manufacturing industry. It was my view that industry, knowing that the final product would ultimately be incinerated, would produce material which did not necessarily have to be of a recyclable variety. Comhar – the National Sustainable Development Partnership – in its recently published report, admits that thermal treatment is inevitable, although stating clearly that it should be  kept to an absolute minimum. This is an independent body which represents many NGOs and other State bodies. It was my view that this would be a backward step in an effort to develop an environmentally sustainable future for industry in Ireland.However, in the past few years great steps have been taken to improve recycling facilities throughout the county. For example, in Dún Laoghaire, more than two thirds of residents have received green bins that allow them to recycle much of their household waste. The introduction of the plastic bag levy has virtually wiped out this insidious element of environmental waste and there is a much greater political will among younger politicians and civic instinct among the public to follow through on recycling, reducing and reusing, as Deputy Haughey mentioned.People are more prepared to make the effort required to protect our environment and I commend the Minister's commitment to the educational element of waste management. Furthermore, recent revelations regarding illegal dumping have emboldened local authorities in the use of enforcement powers. In general, the Act requires measures to be taken in regard to the disposal of waste and provides for councils to pursue anybody who disposes of waste in a way other than in compliance with waste licences.However, the need for enforcement and stronger fines would be reduced if proper incentives were provided. For example, most commercial and industrial waste is produced by enterprises that pay local authorities commercial rates. A waiver system could be introduced under statute that would allow local authorities to invite applications for reduced commercial rates from companies demonstrating best practice in the packaging, distribution and disposal of waste.Under section 176 of the Planning and Development Act, 2000, waste disposal installations for the incineration of waste are subject to an environmental impact assessment carried out by An Bord Pleanála. The board may refuse a proposed development where it considers that the development is unacceptable on environmental grounds in terms of planning and sustainable development. Environmentalists have argued that dioxins generated by incineration may negate any value to the community. There is an argument for considering whether incinerators should be proceeded with in the absence of a pay per weight system throughout the State.However, this also does not take into account the fact that the vast majority of waste and most illegal dumping is generated by constructed and other industries. Essentially, householders are the least of our problems. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is in the process of drawing up a new development plan and we are trying to incorporate incentivisation and the green business network as best practice.I have been appointed to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs and one of its functions is to adequately scrutinise all EU legislation. Had this committee been in place in 1975 when the first EU directive on waste management issued or in 1991 it would have provided a domestic forum for the discussion of the implications of the polluter pays principle. The committee will provide a new element to the decision-making process on European legislation. Tough decisions lie ahead and all parties will have to consider the greater interest of the community rather than short-term political gain. Mr. Justice O'Sullivan's decision is welcome in this regard.Whatever environmental concerns may exist with regard to incinerators, the recent Bacon report highlights that landfill is a thing of the past and radical and innovative change is required if this generation is to leave the country as it found it.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	740	I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute on this important matter, which has been discussed many times, particularly during the lifetime of the previous Dáil. This is also the first opportunity I have had to congratulate Deputy Gallagher on his appointment as Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government and I extend best wishes to him. He will bring great energy and ability to the Ministry, as he did to other Departments in the past.Realisable targets must be set when discussing waste management policy. The local authority in my area, Cavan County Council, has had difficulties because of out-of-date and unsuitable landfill sites in a number of towns. The local authority members and its executive, to their credit, set out on a policy which involved closing unsuitable landfill sites and developing one major site to service the needs of the entire county. That facility was developed with the assistance of substantial funding from the Department approximately 18 months ago. It is a modern, suitable facility which also contains recycling resources. It was constructed on the basis that it would have the capacity to meet the landfill needs of the county for many decades.I compliment the members of the local authority and the executive on their initiative in tackling a difficult issue. They consulted local communities to discuss the need to deal with waste management in a practical manner. They took into account the concerns of the local community and made decisions, which resulted in the establishment of a suitable landfill facility that will service the needs of the country for a long time.There is no point in political parties or environmental organisations setting unrealistic targets or talking about zero waste plans. There needs to be a better drive to educate people about the need  to segregate and minimise waste. I was abroad a number of years ago and I watched a report on Sky News regarding the success of the plastic bag levy, which was heartening.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	742	It was a substantial report. The reporter visited supermarkets in Dublin and Newry and highlighted the difference in the minimum number of plastic bags that was being used by shoppers in both supermarkets. Initiatives such as the plastic bag levy that capture the imagination of the people play a worthwhile role in minimising waste. I compliment the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on ensuring that proposal was implemented.I refer to litter in towns and cities. A tourist's first impression when visiting countries usually concerns the lack of litter or an unfortunate abundance of litter. Everyone who travels through the streets of our towns on weekend mornings is horrified by the predominance of litter on them. It is absolutely appalling that people can be so uncaring in the disposal of waste material. There is not only an extra cost involved in cleaning the streets, but a poor image is created for visitors.Deputy Dan Wallace initiated a number of grant schemes when he was Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, which provide assistance to schools to create awareness among children through competitions. The Minister, Deputy Gallagher is following suit but I would encourage an expansion of such schemes as that could mean a great deal. Such initiatives can ensure those who are at an impressionable age are guided in the right direction in terms of civic spirit and the need to keep the countryside as free of litter as possible.As Deputy Haughey pointed out, increased economic activity has led to increased usage of consumer goods, thereby creating increased waste, but there is little excuse for the widespread escalation in the disposal of litter throughout rural and urban Ireland. All of us have a part to play to ensure awareness is improved, particularly among young people so that when they reach adulthood they will respect the environment.Substantial progress has been made in recent years in the segregation of waste and in the number of centres and amenities that have been established. There has also been a sizeable increase in the number of Bring centres throughout each local authority area. The increasing number of facilities will ensure a widespread improvement in waste management nationwide.

I am sorry Deputy Boyle is not present. I have served with Deputy Sargent on the county council and I was a colleague of Deputy Boyle in another life. I compliment him on this Bill.This is an important issue and I am sorry there is disagreement about it in the House. Deputy Brendan Smith made the relevant point that litter is the important issue in our constituencies. Tallaght is no different in this regard from any other part of the country. People talk to their representatives about various issues but litter is always on the agenda. An educational process has to be implemented where this issue is concerned. Many of the calls I receive are from people asking me what the council intends to do about litter and I often bravely remind them that litter is created by everybody. Many people understand this but many others continue to litter and I still get calls from them asking me to intervene with the local authority when they have been fined. It is important that we give a positive message about our attitude to this issue.Waste is an issue of concern for everybody. Deputy Andrews referred to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Deputy Sargent will refer to Fingal County Council while Deputy Brendan Smith has just been talking about Cavan County Council. South Dublin County Council, which has been in existence since 1994, has been progressive on this issue. We spent much time this year convincing the council that it should not open a new landfill development near Corrageen in Tallaght. That issue crystallises the challenge we face. On one hand, we need to deal with the mountain of waste every household generates but, on the other, we have to figure out where it should go. We must have a policy to deal with it. People will say landfill is a great way to deal with waste but at the same time they do not want it near where they live. That is the difficulty. We have encountered it in Tallaght and south west Dublin just as my colleagues have in other local authority areas.I am still a member of South Dublin County Council and I am waiting to hear from the Minister how long more I can be a member.

I have been happy on the local authority and I would not be here if I had not been a member for ten years. I am proud of the efforts South Dublin County Council is making on this issue. Col leagues have mentioned the charges and how popular or unpopular they are. In my area, however, they have given the council additional resources which have allowed it this year to provide land after care, to operate Ballymount baling station and the Arthurstown landfill in County Kildare and to improve the refuse collection service. I will continue to make brave political decisions to ensure this work continues. As members of local authorities wrestle in the next month or so with estimates, they should understand the need to continue to support such work and to provide the services people seek.If one asks people what the local authority is doing, they will not talk about the grandiose development plans but about whether the bins are being collected, how quickly they are collected and how the service is being delivered. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important issue.

#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	750	Despite what Deputy Andrews thinks, the Labour Party has a substantial policy on waste management based on the principles of sustainable development and the polluter pays. I have a copy of the document with me and I will be happy to give him some copies to read and to pass around to his colleagues. The Labour Party also does not believe in double taxation or that a flat tax or the imposition of bin charges for waste management is a good idea.I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The option of recycling all materials back into nature or the marketplace in a manner that protects human health and the environment is laudable. I will support the Bill on the basis of the aspirations it contains although I would welcome further detail on how the proposals might be achieved.I wish to address two recent occurrences in this country which highlighted either the ineptness or the indifference of those who have responsibility for ensuring the safe recycling of waste or by-products. Ireland is highly dependent on its export food industry and, in particular, the green image that is so important to our markets abroad. The export of waste material containing hormones from a pharmaceutical company through a waste management company in Ireland to a further disposal company in Belgium led to a major animal and human health incident. The lack of clarity about the specific procedures and responsibilities of each party involved must be addressed. There is a need to revisit the legislation and the loopholes it contains which have resulted in the reputation of Ireland's waste management and disposal procedures being question able internationally and, even more importantly, a product originating in Ireland causing considerable havoc in Europe.The second issue is the disposal of clinical waste. There are specific and detailed procedures and standards for the disposal of clinical or hazardous waste. It is unacceptable that it is possible for a hospital management, for example, to be compromised by the discovery of clinical waste and confidential records in the middle of a green area. This happened in my constituency and in other areas. It happened in a location where children congregated to play. While I do not wish to see a situation develop where it is necessary to police a process of good waste management, the enforcement of waste management must be taken more seriously. Above all, the health and safety of the community must be protected and the highest standards must be enforced.The two incidents I have mentioned highlight the potential costs to the health of people or animals and to the economy. The wider environmental concerns are no less important for different reasons. Landfill has a limited shelf life but we need to know the Minister's proposals for incineration options. The issue of shortcuts through the planning process for the establishment of waste facilities has been dealt with already. Due to the possibility of shortcuts, it is crucial that the Minister informs the House of the proposed locations of regional incinerators.The science and technology of waste disposal and incineration is constantly changing and improving. However, our ability to detect smaller and smaller levels of undesirable toxic compounds arising from waste disposal, particularly incineration, is also improving. We also are now better able to establish the health consequences of even small levels of those toxic compounds. It would be most undesirable to proceed with one side of the technology without having a parallel acknowledgement of the possible negative impacts of taking them on board. I do not need to remind the House of the outcome of a small but significant change in technology for processing animal carcases in the 1980s.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	751	I am pleased to have the opportunity to discuss the future development of waste management and the crisis that exists with the disposal of waste. This crisis has developed as a result of the rapid growth in the production of waste in the past five years or so due to the economic boom, environmental concerns and pressure from the EU. For example, since 1998 there has been an increase of over 25% in the amount of waste collected throughout the country. At the outset, I said I would be honest and forthright in my contribution so while supporting the concept of the Bill, I believe that some clarification is  required. The concept of zero waste operates in New Zealand but having read all the relevant documentation, I have not seen a case where reduction, recovery and recycling in themselves have eliminated all the waste produced. Can anybody demonstrate that such a process works 100% anywhere? We all aspire to reach that target but so far it has not been done. If there is a waste management process that requires a facility other than reduction, recovery and recycling, I would like to see it in operation.I have a difficulty with politicians who oppose thermal treatment and landfill. If they are opposed to both systems and if reduction, recovery and recycling will not eliminate all waste, how will we dispose of our waste? Those are critical questions and the public cannot be fooled when it comes to answering them. We must be honest with people and state the facts.The Government's strategy of preventing, minimising, reusing and recycling waste for energy recovery has failed because the necessary infrastructure was not put in place. People are prepared to play their part in recycling, but green bins must be provided to achieve this. Many local authorities have been unable to provide green bins due to financial constraints and the Department of the Environment and Local Government has been negligent in not supporting them.More importantly, the Government has failed to provide a national recycling infrastructure. Notwithstanding the efforts of local authorities throughout the country, which have accounted for up to 50% of waste being recycled, unless such a national infrastructure is in place, much waste will be disposed of in landfill sites. Other countries have successfully dealt with recycling waste but Fianna Fáil has failed miserably to deal with the matter. The public and local authorities are ready to respond to the recycling initiative but the necessary national infrastructure is absent. Recycling is just part of the process of ensuring that we deal effectively with waste management.

During yesterday's debate, I was disappointed by the comments of the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, who was dismissive of the Bill which has created an opportunity to open up a debate on this important issue. I listened carefully to the last four Govern ment speakers, who are very fine people in their own right, but not one of them mentioned incineration, which the Bill seeks to address. They mentioned litter, including plastic bags, but not the possibility of incineration which the Government is hell-bent on introducing. It wants to burn waste instead of dealing with it properly.Many local authorities, including Galway City Council of which I am a member, have made great strides in facing up to the problem of waste management. Two and a half years ago the council set about dealing with this matter and has now achieved a reduction of 58% in the amount of waste being sent to landfill. This was done through an educational programme by environmental officers who attended public meetings and visited people's houses. Galway city residents separated waste into 11 or 12 categories but it was a sham because, except for the compost element, we were not reusing the recyclable waste. The waste that was separated was being baled for export, which is not the solution. This happened because the previous Minister did not address the problem of separating waste. The Government did not provide incentives to encourage the recycling and reuse of waste products. Subsequently, this year we abandoned what had been the best waste separation process in the world.I visited Nova Scotia which operates a much lauded separation system, yet Galway was light years ahead of Canada in what it was separating. However, we were light years behind them in the use we made of the separated recyclable waste. Galway city residents used to have four refuse bags to separate paper, cardboard, dry plastics and milk cartons. The situation has now regressed, however, because we are putting all that waste into one bin for baling and export because there is no market for it here. I challenge the Government to deal with this matter.The Progressive Democrats Deputies are missing from the Chamber which is a pity because I would like to have challenged my constituency colleague, Deputy Grealish, who was elected on an anti-incineration platform. He and his Progressive Democrats colleagues should vote with us against incineration which the Government is hell-bent on introducing. The Minister took the power away from local authority members and gave it to county managers. When the Minister orders the county managers to jump, they respond, "How high?"  That is why incineration will be introduced here, although I applaud the efforts of the Green Party to bring this matter up for discussion in the House.

The Minister, Deputy Dempsey, commissioned an analysis of all national and international documentation relating to the thermal treatment of waste and incineration. Unless and  until that report is published by the Health Research Board, however, we should not proceed further with plans for incineration. An incinerator is planned for a location beside my town of Drogheda, although it will be nearby in County Meath.Meath County Council has been shown up disgracefully with regard to one planning decision. Is the local authority more likely to reject an application for a créche or an incinerator on the same stretch of road within a mile of each other? County Meath turned down the créche on the grounds that the road carried heavy traffic and would thus cause noise and pose a danger to people. When it comes to incineration, planning is a joke because proper weight was not accorded to the arguments against the planned incinerator in County Meath when permission was granted for it.I also wish to raise the issue of so-called regional waste management plans. Each county council was given a copy of what was called a regional waste management plan but they never met as a group to discuss that plan, so at the very least it is a misnomer. It is ridiculous that each county council in turn voted for the plan except the county where the incinerator was expected, Louth. What would happen if there was proper regional planning? All the county councils in a given region should meet and decide where they are going on the issue. The Minister steamrollered legislation through the Oireachtas on foot of the vote in County Louth but I commend everyone in Louth who voted against the incinerator, including those from Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Labour.I commend the Green Party on this important Bill.

I will focus on the incineration aspect of this complex issue. I am aware the Minister for the Environment and Local Government is keen to see an incinerator near his constituency of Waterford and I do not doubt the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will speak eloquently in favour of an incinerator for Dublin city when asked to do so by the Government, but are they right? We are still waiting for a health report on incineration. There are increased levels in certain cancers in Ireland and even though the medical profession is satisfied that the MMR vaccine is not related to autism, we are still seeing a huge increase in levels of autism. Could all this be due to increased levels of known and unknown toxins in our environment? We simply do not know.There was a debate on incineration in Wexford recently and a council member went to the UK to investigate the issue himself. He concluded that incineration must be safe because the people working in the incineration plant looked healthy  and there were flowers growing outside. This is true but it is too simplistic a deduction when talking about the dangers of environmental pollution. Sadly, however, the Government is not interested in genuinely promoting a recycling culture. Incinerators may be safe but they are also expensive and in a perverse way they compete for the waste we should be trying to reduce and recycle.Ireland has an appalling record of illegal dumping and the Government is trying to build municipal incinerators in non-urban areas. This does not inspire confidence that the Government itself is confident about their safety. I am in favour of economic progress but I cannot support incineration unless I am absolutely satisfied we are not damaging the generations to come after us.

I compliment the Green Party on this Bill. If the Government was really serious about sustainable development it would support this Bill. The Taoiseach spoke very eloquently in support of sustainable development at the world summit and he should support the idea of each county looking after its own waste, which is logical in comparison with the regional waste management plans currently formulated.Let us forget about superdumps and incinerators, which are toxic health hazards, and let us be proactive and concentrate on recycling, which is more positive. The amount of recycling we are doing at present is abysmal in comparison with other countries. A superdump is proposed for Mayo but if that goes ahead there will be a revolution in Mayo as it will not be tolerated. Already we are getting waste from Sligo and we are to get waste from Galway, Roscommon and so on. There is no logic to that. Every county should look after its own waste. Incineration has been proven to be toxic. We need to get our act together on recycling, as that is the future.

He outlined in great detail his understanding of the waste issue, the current situation regarding waste management, regional waste management plans and his plans for the future. The central focus of this Bill is incineration, as it intends to take incineration off the Irish agenda, but the Minister insists this is not possible so obviously there is a dispute here. This debate will continue into the future.However, there is no dispute about the need for landfill now and, I hope, to a lesser degree in the future. The reality is that landfills are here to  stay for the foreseeable future. For that reason we must ensure that whatever we do now regarding landfills is done properly. We do not want to be apologising in five, ten or 15 years for our inaction, carelessness, refusal to act in the face of evidence or dereliction of duty in not putting safeguards in place to protect the public and the unborn. That is what concerns me. Evidence is emerging through research by the Trinity Centre for Health Sciences that mothers living in close proximity to landfills are much more likely to have children with birth defects – one result indicated to me is that mothers living within 1.2 miles of a landfill are two and a half times more likely to have a child with birth defects. That is an alarming statistic which cannot be ignored.Such information should spark an immediate review of the regulations governing the location of landfills and the review should take into account human beings as well as the environment, flora and fauna. I raised this matter with the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and although he acknowledged he was aware that the Trinity centre was engaged in such research, he said that because a report on the matter had yet to be finalised and published, he could not comment on putative findings.However, that research is being carried out and I have outlined the frightening results produced. It cannot be ignored. I therefore request the Minister to engage with the Trinity centre with a view to establishing the exact status of its research and the expected time of publication. I also request that further work on landfill selection be frozen until the research is published.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	762	I thank my Opposition colleagues for their support for the Green Party on this important Bill and for their kind words. Yesterday I listened to the Minister for the Environment and Local Government describe the Green Party as unrealistic and I was reminded of Des O'Malley when he was a Minister 25 years ago. He described those of us opposed to the proposed nuclear power plant at Carnsore Point in fairly colourful terms, saying we belonged to a flat earth society and that we were talking obscurantist nonsense. If we speed on to where we are now, the same rhetoric is being used by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government.I am afraid time proved us right because nobody in their right mind would support nuclear power. We have been proved right on other issues also, such as ozone depletion, global warming and climate change. There was a time when people said we were alarmist for talking about climate change, but now that is accepted as a scientific fact. The success of the plastic bag levy was mentioned, and that is another Green Party idea.This is not just about idealism, it is about science, which is on our side. In 50 years' time,  people will look back and be astounded by our primitive attitude towards waste management. Instead of burying our waste we now propose to burn it. It is not about the NIMBY attitude. As far as I am concerned it is not in anyone's backyard.Yes, I live in Ringsend and I have a personal interest in the fact that truck after truck will trundle past my door and the doors of my neighbours. I have campaigned vigorously on the issue of incineration for many years and have even received a gagging order from the courts. However, I campaigned sincerely on the issue and offered sincere solutions.Deputy McCormack has mentioned the campaign of Deputy Grealish in Galway. I was not aware of that. I am, however, aware that my constituency colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who has not even spoken on this Bill, campaigned on this issue. Leaflet after leaflet was issued expounding his virtues. As far as he was concerned he was the only person with the necessary clout, ability and expertise to stop the placing of an incinerator in the constituency. When he was not praising himself he was excoriating the Greens, whom he claimed would bring us back to the dark ages.  Now is the opportunity for the Minister and the Progressive Democrats to vote for this Bill. That would be a certain way to stop an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula. I do not see any members of the Progressive Democrats in the House. They are treating this exercise with contempt. All they can do is make their own ridiculous proposals for thermal treatment, known as the Herhof method. This method simply makes waste into pellets which have to be incinerated later. It does not meet with international criteria and is a ludicrous suggestion.Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats believe incineration offers a magical solution to the waste problem. One cannot defeat the laws of thermo-dynamics and make waste disappear. For every three tonnes put into an incinerator one tonne must be disposed of afterwards. How is bottom ash and fly ash to be dealt with? This is the real difficulty posed by incinerators.Does the Government believe incinerators will operate for 24 hours a day, 365 days a year for 30 years without a hitch and that the EPA will look after them? I do not. Private operators are concerned with making a profit and not with public safety. They are interested in getting as much waste into their incinerators and not with health and safety. That is why I have personal fears for the Poolbeg peninsula and for my constituents.The Greens offer real, reasonable and workable solutions. The zero waste concept works over a period of 25 years. We do not say we can get rid of waste. Landfill will always be part of the equation whether we have an incinerator or  zero waste, but it will be an entirely different type of landfill.

It also addresses the Minister's zealous admiration for incineration, which appears to be shared by the entire Fianna Fáil parliamentary party. British Nuclear Fuels changed the name of Windscale to Sellafield. Is the Minister now going to call incineration thermal treatment? Should his political career falter there will be an opening for him in BNFL's public relations department, such is his zeal for name changing.Fianna Fáil wants to see incinerators, not just in the open countryside but also in some of the most densely populated areas of the country. Ringsend has been dumped on for generations. It has suffered the landfill site in Poolbeg, cement plants and the annual conflagration at the car recycling plant. It is not good enough that one of the most disadvantaged communities in the country is to be dumped on again with the proposal for an incinerator on the Poolbeg peninsula.Incineration is expensive, produces climate change emissions, takes the pressure away from recycling and leaves a residue. Do we want to pay Treasury Holdings or its equivalent hundreds of euro per year per household to burn our rubbish? Is that Fianna Fáil's sad vision of the future? Incineration does little for job creation. One fellow drives the lorry and another pushes the button. This does not create jobs in a recycling economy. Incineration is incompatible with a serious attempt to create jobs within the recycling economy.Waste management is not rocket science, although some incinerator sales representatives would like to convince us that this is the case. We do not need this sort of technology. We need to choose the options which already exist and are working abroad.Ten years ago the Green Party members of Dublin Corporation directed the city manager to commission a waste management plan founded on the principles of city-wide waste reduction, reuse and recycling. We wanted this plan to be based on EU directives, to outline options for employment creation in waste management, to provide for source segregation of recoverables and to advance all of these issues. We were laughed at by the Minister's party colleagues but  we are not laughed at now. We need more than a discussion in the Minister's Department. We need action in these areas. Targets must be set. We do not want to continue with the predict and provide strategy which seems to be good enough for the Minister and his consultants.Incineration is not good for our agriculture, food or tourism industries. We can look abroad at many options. Australia places financial deposits on drinks containers to encourage recycling. That would prevent the Government from allowing the Irish Glass Bottle Company to fade away with the loss of hundreds of jobs.Our Bill calls for a total ban on incineration as a waste management technology and a major emphasis on recycling. We want the powers of county managers to introduce regional waste management plans rescinded. We were appalled by the divide and conquer approach shown by the former Minister for the Environment and Local Government and by the blow it struck at local democracy.Our proposals can work. The plastic bag levy  is successful and similar incentives could help us to reduce our waste mountain. We also need incentives from the Department for markets for recyclables. Where are the incentives? What Departments are using recycled materials? The Department of the Environment and Local Government is making strides in that regard but what are other Departments doing?We need to set a target for a waste free Ireland, perhaps by 2012, and we want to see clear and significant progress towards this goal. We believe a zero waste strategy would lead to innovation and would move beyond the incremental approach being furthered by the Minister's Department at present. Instead of embracing incineration we must opt for waste reduction, reuse and recycling, with well managed landfill for any waste remaining. This will ensure the clean, green image of Ireland is maintained and enhanced for future generations. Ireland's image abroad and our agriculture, food and tourism industries depend on it.I commend the Bill to the House.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	766	I thank the Minister of State for attending the House to take this matter. I am disappointed neither the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment nor the Minister of State at the Department, Deputy Michael Ahern, both of whom were present for the debate on Private Members' time, saw fit to be in attendance.Many people at IFI are rightfully angry. Their pension scheme was decimated and their redundancy payments totally inadequate. I understand a sit-in is under way in the canteen of the company's Belfast plant. The workers in Cork have said they have no quarrel with the liquidator, with whom they wish to co-operate. Their argument is with the Government. They have refused to take ammonia from the plant, which is leading to a dangerous situation.A number of weeks ago, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, told the House that the workers would get their money but they would have to sign a receipt which would not sign away any of their other rights. However, the workers, many of whom have given long service to the State and who paid their taxes and everything asked of them, have not received payments. I met a man over the weekend whose daughter is attending a third level college and he told me he will have to remove her from the college. He will not qualify for a grant despite the fact that he has no money except for what he is getting on the dole, and even that was secured with difficulty.Workers were presented with a document which, inter alia, states: “I hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive any rights that I, or any other person claiming in respect of me, may have to make a claim arising against the trustee . . . ” It goes on to stipulate that the worker will indicate the form was signed without coercion. This is a form of blackmail on behalf of the Government. Why did it not provide each worker with €5,000, as was promised in this House, in return for a signed receipt? Why did it go back on its promise and demand that workers sign away their rights?I understand that issues such as life policies, benefit in kind and other policies have been lost to many workers. One worker is very ill and his family is worried that all his rights and entitlements may be lost. If he signs this form they will be lost.The Government has treated the workers at IFI very badly. They wanted to negotiate. It appears there was a provision to allow for redundancies, but before they were paid the rug was pulled from under them. How would the Minister of State react if this happened in his constituency? Knowing him as I do, I am sure he would be up in arms about the way the workers are being treated, as am I and others in his party in Cork.I hope that the Minister for State has something positive to say. They are worried also that when planning permission was granted in 1975, a bond was entered into by NET on behalf of the State and this may impact on payments to workers and creditors. Who is responsible for this bond? The workers and I are trying to get an answer to that question. Through a parliamentary question, the Minister told me that the clean up would cost €3 million as the site has to be returned to a greenfield site under planning law. From where will this money come? The company is in deficit to the tune of €44 million, of which the State has written off €34 million. There remain many creditors and workers who are worried. I implore the Minister to give positive answers and withdraw this appalling demand that the workers sign this document. I understand that they were so angry that they tore it up when they were presented with it. The Government should pay the €5,000 promised in the House and meet the workers. ICI will meet them on Friday, and I hope that the Minister will meet them then also. I hope there will be good news for this group of workers who have been loyal to the State. There were virtually no accidents or strike days in that plant. It is an appalling example to give to the private sector where companies might also be under pressure. Let us right the wrong as best we can.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	801	—and while there is no legal obligation on us to provide severance payments, we have established a trust for the distribution of ex gratia severance payments to the workers and agreed to provide a total of nearly €24.5 million to the trust. This ex gratia fund is in addition to around €11 million in statutory redundancy and other payments which employees will receive, either as preferred creditors in the liquidation of IFI or directly from the relevant Government agency. Thus, a total of over €35 million will be available for workers or the equivalent of average  payments of over €57,000 per worker. Both the Government and ICI believe that in setting up the ex gratia fund they are providing severance arrangements which are fair and reasonable in the circumstances. It will be a matter for the fund's trustee to decide, after consultations with employee representatives, how payments from the ex gratia fund will be made. There is no reason why such consultations cannot take place immediately and enable the trustee to make arrangements for payments in the near future.Both shareholders have also responded favourably to concerns raised by the unions that employees could find themselves facing immediate financial problems. We have now provided funds to the trustee which enable him to make payments on account from the ex gratia fund of €5,000, or three months pay if lower, to each former full-time IFI employee with pro rata payments to former part-time employees who lost their jobs as a result of the liquidation. This is to help them manage their financial situation through the short-term pending agreement with the trustee on the shape of the final scheme. Such interim payments have been available since last Monday and a number of workers have now received payments. I note what the Deputy stated about people not receiving payment and will ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy on this tomorrow.However, it is regrettable that not all staff availed of this facility. I understand that workers have some concerns about a waiver form which they are required to sign to obtain payments from the ex gratia fund, the form to which Deputy Stanton referred. Unfortunately, there would appear to be some misunderstanding around the nature and extent of the waiver. For the sake of clarity, the following is the position. Employees are not being asked to give up their rights to claim in the liquidation of IFI. Payments out of the ex gratia fund will be totally unaffected by any payments which employees in the Republic of Ireland receive from the liquidator as preferred creditors or directly from the relevant Government agency. This includes the normal statutory entitlements such as redundancy, minimum notice and so on.In addition, the equivalent payments to staff in Northern Ireland will be treated in the same way for the purposes of the waiver, even though these may rank as ordinary unsecured creditors under Irish insolvency law. Where employees have other claims against IFI, which would rank as ordinary unsecured creditors, they will have to agree that payments in respect of such claims will be reduced by the amount of any payments which employees receive from the ex gratia fund. This would mainly cover claims such as periods of notice which are longer than the relevant statutory minima. If a payment in respect of such a claim is greater than the payment received from  the ex gratia fund, employees will still be entitled to the excess from the liquidation. In addition, IFI employees will be asked to waive all claims against the trustee and the sponsors of the ex gratia fund.The arrangement is designed to ensure that employees cannot, in effect, be compensated on the double for the loss of their jobs, that is by both the ex gratia fund and the liquidator. It also seeks to ensure that all employees, regardless of location or differences in terms and conditions of employment, are treated in a fair, equitable and broadly equivalent manner. It is accepted that the details of these arrangements may appear complex and the trustee has been asked to arrange a process for explaining and reassuring IFI employees on this issue.Even though it is now over a month since the company announced that it was to close, the position in relation to pensions remains unclear. This is unavoidable given the complexity of pensions issues generally. However, it is unfortunate that there still appears to be a lot of incomplete and sometimes conflicting information circulating at present regarding the position of the various schemes. Nevertheless, it is understood that the pensions funds face potential difficulties, which in the case of Belfast, seem to be particularly serious. For a number of reasons, such as the different regulatory environment, the position of the schemes covering workers at the other locations seems to be somewhat better. However, I should point out that the problems seem to stem mainly from the impact of adverse stock market movements on the pensions funds' investments. IFI has been meeting its obligations to the various schemes on an ongoing basis.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	804	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and the Minister for coming to the House.I put this matter down as a direct result of a telephone call from a councillor colleague in the far west of Cavan last night. I was frightened by the case of a man over 80 years old, with a medical card and old age pension, who has been living in a nursing home for the last two years. His wife lives alone in a traditional country cottage and has to provide €60 out of her pension to retain that person in the home. The health board had rightly demanded that the nursing home carry out repairs to the home, which obviously cost it money, and it had to increase its charges. The health board subvention section has said it does  not have any money and it has put this man on a waiting list. It has indicated that if money becomes available, it will subvent that extra €60. That is extraordinary.I was present in the House yesterday when various Ministers outlined the massive funding that had been given to different areas. A total of €8.2 billion is available to the Minister for Health and Children this year, with a budget of €8.9 billion predicted for next year. That is sizeable funding in anybody's book. The people on this side of the House have not argued about the amount of money available but about the way it is being spent. One cannot help but wonder why a woman who lives alone in her declining years, who has given a lifetime's service to this country, has to pay €60 out of her pension to retain her very ill husband in a nursing home. I emphasise that it is not an expensive nursing home. It is one of the smaller ones in County Cavan but it is doing an excellent job. A cousin of mine who reached the age of 104 remained there for many years. The service this nursing home provides is tremendous.In the same discussion I was informed of a case involving an 82 year old lady who benefited from the home help service and had a visit from a health board official. As we all know from our parents or otherwise, elderly people always like to offer a cup of tea to visitors and, despite the problems faced by this woman, she made a gallant effort to make a cup of tea for the health board official. Unfortunately, in doing that she showed that she had some ability and she subsequently lost her home help. How low can we go in terms of looking after those who kept this State going when times were not so good and when there was no Celtic tiger?I know of another case where an aged person had their ten hours home help service cut to five. Is this an era of good management or one in which the rich get richer and the poor get poorer? I know of many other cases, including one involving a 95 year old lady who has a full pension, medical card, etc. This woman's daughter is being asked to pay a sum of money also in spite of the fact that she is looking after her own seriously ill husband. Where will all this stop? We used to have a caring society. These questions would not have been asked many years ago but these people are being forced to pay this money.I am advised that the subvention budget is overrun, but there should not be a limit on the subvention budget. If the elderly need care and nursing homes are available, and the means test criteria have been met, there should not be a waiting list for subvention. Whatever way the massive amounts of money available to health boards have to be redirected, the elderly, the disabled and those who need home care should not be discriminated against.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	805	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter on the Adjournment. The various specific cases referred to by the Deputy were not comprehended in the notice of the matter which the Deputy indicated he intended to raise on the Adjournment. I take it from what the Deputy said that the first matter he outlined is the one that was brought to his attention recently, and I will arrange for the offices in my Department to examine that matter and revert to the Deputy on it. I will instruct them to read the "blacks" of the debate in the morning to see if they can address the issues raised by the Deputy, which appear to be raised in the context of the Estimate provision for this year rather than the announced provision for next year.As I am sure the Deputy is aware, under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. It was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which enable health boards to enter into arrangements with private nursing homes, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged are private arrangements between the nursing home and the individual resident.The 1993 regulations are administered by the various health boards. A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example, in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the individual health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in accordance with the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.Significant additional funding has been provided since the nursing home subvention scheme was introduced in 1993. In 1994, in the first full year of the operation of the scheme, £12 million, or €15.24 million, was made available. This year, the additional funding provided by my Department has brought the amount available for the scheme to €102 million.As the Deputy will be aware, in line with a Government decision, an expenditure review of the nursing home subvention scheme has been undertaken by my Department in association with the Department of Finance. It is the intention to bring forward proposals in relation to whatever additional measures may be necessary  arising from the expenditure review, together with the experience gained from the operation of the scheme since 1993. As announced in the health strategy, it is also intended to amend the nursing home subvention scheme to take account of the expenditure review of the scheme and to introduce a pilot home subvention scheme in consultation with the Department of Social and Family Affairs.On the issue of the home help service, I regard this service as an integral part of community support services for older people and substantial additional funding has been provided in recent years to improve the service. It is my intention that the development of the home help service will continue to receive priority so that it can be extended to cover more applicants.Government policy in relation to health services for older persons was outlined in the report, The Years Ahead, and reaffirmed in the review of that report which was published in 1997.We value our older persons and we must place particular emphasis on an approach which aims at maintaining them in dignity and independence at home, restoring to independence at home those older persons who become ill or dependent, encouraging and supporting the care of older persons in their own community by family, neighbours and voluntary bodies, and in providing a high quality of hospital and residential care for older persons when they can no longer be maintained in dignity and independence at home.Our commitment to these principles has been clearly demonstrated by the additional resources allocated to services for older persons in the past five years. In 1997, an additional £10 million was provided, increasing to £36 million in 2000, £57 million in 2001 and €87 million in 2002. Since 1999 a number of additional allocations have been made to develop community services for older people: €7.5 million to enhance the scope of the home help service; €12 million for the improvement of community support structures, specifically geared towards the support of older persons in their homes through a range of measures; €6 million for carers support and in 2000, as a once-off measure, an additional £2 million was provided to health boards specifically to make available aids and appliances; and €3.5 million has been provided to a number of voluntary groups, such as the Alzheimer Society of Ireland, for the provision of day care services, and the Carers Association.The health strategy acknowledges that the Irish population is ageing at a rapid rate. Most Members of the House are well aware of the statistical change that is under way in this regard. Under the public private partnership initiative, the Government has provided for 850 beds in 17 units divided between the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the Southern Health Board in the coming years.When the Minister meets with voluntary organisations who lobby on behalf of older persons, they generally tell him that they can see an improvement on the ground in the services being provided for older people. Happily, it is only on rare occasions that there is a waiting period for nursing home subvention or home help. I will provide additional funding for services for older persons in 2003.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	806	This matter has come to my attention with the publication recently of the annual report for 2001 of the Garda Complaints Board. The report expresses utmost concern that there was much delay in the installation of equipment and cameras in cells and interview rooms in Garda stations. In 1979 the Barra Ó Briain report into the detention of suspects in Garda custody was published. It was initiated in 1977 after the allegations about the heavy gang activities in the mid-1970s. It recommended that all interrogations and interviews should be recorded on video and tape.Twenty-three years later the Garda Complaints Board is expressing concern about the slow progress in this matter. Clearly the absence of such equipment hampers the work of the Garda Complaints Board. There have been many complaints in recent days about that body because nearly all its investigations tend to run into the sand. The reason partly is that conflicting statements are made and there is no evidence in the case of interviews taking place in Garda custody to verify statements. This equipment would be a protection for gardaí and suspects. Video and tape evidence could be used in the event of a complaint or a court case.The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said that he had no intention of introducing the equipment in all Garda stations. In a report in The Irish Times on 14 November a Garda spokesperson said that the Department was in ongoing talks with the Garda authorities on the widespread installation of cameras in the reception and cell areas of Garda stations. The spokesperson was unable to say when a concerted installation process might begin. Only a handful of stations have the equipment installed. In some stations the equipment is available but the cameras are not. An effort is not being made and the discussions which are ongoing between the Department and the Garda leave something to be desired.I ask the Minister of State to make a proactive statement tonight as to when the Department and the Garda authorities will finish these discussions and when equipment will be installed. The efforts of the Garda Complaints Board are largely in vain on this matter and it makes it more difficult  for it to unravel the validity or otherwise of complaints. It is about time this matter was put to rest.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	807	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I wish to set out the position with regard to the introduction of closed circuit television systems in Garda stations. The Minister is very conscious of the general potential of modern technology to enhance the criminal justice process, including of course the safeguarding of the rights of those in custody. A system for the video recording of interviews of persons in Garda custody has been widely installed in Garda stations over the past two years. This represents a significant additional safeguard against ill-treatment of those in custody as well as acting as a protection for members of the force in certain circumstances.In this regard, the Minister is aware that the issue of installing closed circuit television cameras in Garda stations has been raised by the Garda Complaints Board in its report for 2000, which was recently laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. In that report, the board recommends the use of CCTV, particularly in the reception and cell areas of Garda stations. It points to this being a common area of complaint and a difficulty the board is faced with when no independent third party evidence is available. In this regard, CCTV evidence available from both street and business cameras has proved useful to the board in the investigation of a number of cases, including allegations of serious assaults.This recommendation of the Garda Complaints Board, founded as it is on its experience of investigating complaints arising from incidents in Garda stations, deserves serious consideration and the Minister has asked his officials to examine the proposal, in consultation with Garda management, to work through the issues to which the proposal gives rise and to see how best the matter might be taken forward. Discussions have commenced with the Garda Síochána on the matter, and the Minister looks forward to considering the conclusions of the examination of the proposal.

One garda accepted bribes, another in Louth was involved in child pornography and dozens of gardaí in Dublin refused to co-operate with the Garda Complaints Board to protect their colleagues from disciplinary action as a result of their reaction to a  non-violent demonstration. Articles were also published in other publications on the same day relating to the investigation of the entire Donegal division of the Garda Síochána by the Morris tribunal. There have been many Garda irregularities and abuses in other parts of the State over the years, more recently during the election campaign in north Kerry.Society needs a police service and the police service requires the support of the community which it serves. It is imperative that there is total transparency and trust between them. The Minister is aware that in many parts of the country that trust is long gone. It is imperative that the issues of Garda misconduct are thoroughly investigated and appropriate disciplinary measures taken. The investigations must be independent, fair and transparent and must be seen to be such by all involved.There is corruption, wrongdoing and bad practice within the Garda Síochána at many levels and ranks and it reaches all the way to the top. Fundamental reform of our policing system has never been more urgent and it is just as much a priority for this State as it is for the North. The Minister has recognised this need and has announced a package of reforms, but they do not go far enough. Comprehensive root and branch reforms are needed and they must be prioritised on the Government's agenda. The Minister's proposals for an inspectorate is not enough. The programme for Government mentions an independent inspectorate with the powers of an ombudsman, but there is no valid reason we should not go ahead and establish an ombudsman. All signatories to the Good Friday Agreement agreed it is essential that policing structures and arrangements comply with certain acceptable standards. The practice of gardaí investigating themselves is not only flawed but goes against everything that could be construed as being in the public interest.We must end this deeply flawed practice of internal investigations. There must be an end to the hush-money in the form of out of court settlements and we must get rid of the toothless Garda Complaints Board which admitted in its own annual report that it is not sufficiently independent from the Garda to be effective. Sinn Féin proposes a range of measures for police reform in this State, and they do not differ significantly from those which we promote in the North. These include the establishment of a fully independent, transparent and representative policing board, the establishment of a fully independent Garda ombudsman to investigate complaints against the force as a matter of priority, human rights training for all Garda and the mandatory video-taping of interviews with suspects.We believe that the Morris tribunal as presently constituted is unlikely to get to the core of corruption and abuse by the Garda. Its terms of reference are still too limited. Sinn Féin sup ports the call of the McBrearty family for the expansion of the terms of reference of the tribunal. The Garda Commissioner, the Attorney General, the DPP, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, his predecessor and the Donegal State solicitor all have knowledge of the affair. All of those individuals, organisations and State bodies who have any level of connection to this case must be called to account. The McBreartys and others have to find out why the Garda and the State authorities initially failed to act on serious accusations of Garda corruption and intimidation.The tribunal's terms of reference must also be widened to cover the killing by loyalists of the Donegal Sinn Féin councillor Eddie Fullerton in his home in 1991. We are also concerned that the tribunal must not be compromised by the appointment of a head investigator, Garda Michael Finn. Given the outstanding question marks that hang over his involvement in the Nicky Kelly case, he is arguably not impartial and he is certainly not seen to be impartial. Sinn Féin will have grave concerns about the effectiveness of the Morris tribunal if it does not widen its remit. We want it to work and it can work but the terms of reference should be widened by this House and not by the judge himself, as he has stated. It is up to the Minister to take responsibility for this and not to pass the buck.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	809	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I welcome this opportunity to set out for the benefit of the House the current position regarding the establishment of a Garda inspectorate. Firstly, with regard to the existing complaints procedure, the Garda Complaints Board has provided and continues to provide a very important service in the investigation of complaints against members of the Garda Síochána.This has been highlighted most recently by the investigations carried out by the board arising from the 8 May demonstrations in Dublin. The board has indicated that it has investigated a total of 37 related complaints. Arising from these investigations and the internal Garda investigations, the Director of Public Prosecutions has directed that prosecutions be instigated against seven members of the Garda Síochána. The Minister wishes to acknowledge the important work done by the board in the investigation of this major incident and the other complaints with which it has dealt.However, there is a need for change, which is recognised by the board itself. In this regard, the House will be aware that the programme for Government has a firm commitment to introduce new legislation for the creation of a Garda inspectorate which will have the powers of an ombudsman and which will provide a completely new system of independent investigation and oversight of  complaints against members of the Garda Síochána. The Minister has reaffirmed his commitment to the introduction of this legislation as a priority, and in this regard the Bill to introduce the inspectorate is planned to be published in 2003. It will not provide for a policing board, which the Minister does not see as relevant to the issues facing us.The Minister regards it as one of his highest priorities to foster support and trust between the Garda Síochána and the public and to maintain a high level of public support and confidence which the Garda Síochána have rightly enjoyed over the years. This new system will make an important contribution to this objective by providing for the objective and independent scrutiny of Garda actions.I must emphasise that this is part of a wider programme of reform, both legislative and administrative, of the Garda Síochána being developed in close co-operation with Garda management. This programme will put in place measures for the enhancement of the strategic management and development of the force, the strengthening of its operational and investigative capacity, and the devolvement to the Garda Commissioner of the authority of accounting officer, all of this in a framework of transparency and accountability. The Minister believes that the measures proposed will significantly strengthen and enhance the capability of the Garda Síochána to meet the challenges ahead.The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 21 November 2002.

The comments of the chief executive of the Consumers Association of Ireland in relation to Ireland's image as a tourist destination are broadly consistent with some of the findings contained in recent visitor attitude surveys carried out by Bord Fáilte. Nevertheless, it is clear that there are strong messages coming through from the consumer and we must heed them. While they continue to represent a minority view among the total numbers surveyed, the number of continental visitors, in particular, who see Ireland as a good value for money destination has declined in recent years.I have repeatedly stated that, as a tourist destination operating in an increasingly value sensitive market place, Ireland cannot afford to lose its competitive edge. We need to remember that value for money is the real issue, not price. Price and quality are the key determinants of value for money. Any increase in price levels which is not accompanied by an increase in quality and standards runs the risk of undermining the sector. Visitor concerns about price levels seem to relate to the cost of goods and services purchased during their stay rather than the price of holiday offers, access or accommodation. There is little in the visitor attitude surveys to suggest any deterioration in standards of service or the quality of the facilities on offer. The most recent survey shows that more than 90% of visitors were satisfied with the friendliness and hospitality experienced while on holiday here.

US visitors have traditionally been high spend, longer stay tourists. With visitor numbers falling by 13% in 2001 and a further drop of 10% forecast for 2002, the downturn in US business has had a negative impact on those sectors of the industry that rely heavily on this market, particularly the coach tour business.The explanation for this downward trend lies primarily in the continuing fall-out from the atrocities of 11 September. More US holidaymakers are choosing destinations which are close to home and accessible by road. In addition, air access capacity to Ireland has been substantially depleted as a result of the 11 September attacks, with peak capacity down 20% on 2001. Demand has also been affected by continuing weakness in the US economy, with more expensive long haul holiday plans being replaced by more affordable short haul trips.Conscious of the difficulties in generating business from the US, I have been anxious, since my appointment as Minister, to address these difficulties and help reverse the downward trend in this vital market. In terms of investment in tourism, 2002 has seen the largest ever budget being deployed for the international marketing of the island of Ireland as a tourist destination. As a key market for tourism, a substantial element of this marketing budget has been directed at generating business from the US.

This is one of the key tourism commitments in the Agreed Programme for Government. The National Tourism Development Authority Bill, the text of which was approved by Government earlier this week, will  form part of the Government's legislative programme for the current Dáil session.

Under the sports capital programme funding is allocated to organisations and clubs to assist them in the provision of sports facilities, while under the local authority swimming pool programme grants are available to local authorities towards the cost of building and refurbishment of swimming pools. The proposed community facilities fund, as set out in the Agreed Programme for Government, will be created under the local government fund to support the development of facilities not covered by existing schemes. In view of the Deputy's interest in the proposed fund, I will bring the matter to the attention of my colleague, the Minister for the Environment and Local Government, whose Department has responsibility for the local government fund.

#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	825	I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 85, 86 and 88 together.The Christmas bonus for job initiative, participants will be paid by FÁS in the week commencing 2 December 2002. The PPF mandated review of active labour market programmes, which includes JI, is also being progressed under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, chaired by my Department. I expect the standing committee to give early consideration to publication of this report in view of the likely public interest in its findings. The outcome of these initiatives will inform the Government's consideration of options for the future of CE and JI.FÁS is also currently carrying out an internal review of the community employment and JI programmes which should be finalised early in the new year. This review will consider the future operation of these programmes in the provision of labour market services for the long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged persons. Eligible participants on JI are taken on for a three year period on the basis of annual renewable contracts. If the Deputy has concerns about a particular organisation issuing contracts to participants for a six month period, he should submit the details directly to FÁS for consideration.There were 2,582 participants on JI in January 2000, 2,762 participants in January 2001 and the number at the beginning of November 2002 is 2,611. Funding has been provided in the Estimates for an average participation rate of 2,500 in 2003. A list of the organisations currently participating in the programme and the number of participants in each case is set out as follows. The specific address of any JI project is available from FÁS if required.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	828	The Retail Price (Beverages in Licensed Premises) Display Order, 1991 requires that the price of alcoholic and soft drinks be displayed immediately outside or immediately inside each entrance to a licensed premises. The purpose of the order is to ensure that consumers are aware of the prices charged before they elect to enter a licensed premises.I am opposed to the reintroduction of price control. It is an ineffective and discredited policy instrument that has no place in a modern economy. Greater competition in the licensed trade would be the most effective way of bringing about a reduction in the prices of beverages sold on such premises. In that regard, a review of the licensing regime is being undertaken by the Commission on Liquor Licensing. The commission was established in 2001 by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	829	The abuse of a dominant position by one or more enterprises is  prohibited under section 5 of the Competition Act, 2002. The remedies available for aggrieved parties are to take an action against the enterprise allegedly perpetrating the abuse for relief by way of injunction to stop the abuse or for damages or both. Alternatively, an aggrieved person can make a complaint to the Competition Authority who are empowered to investigate and bring to court any infringement under the Competition Act, 2002.Under the Competition Act, 2002, I have established a new regime for media mergers. I have incorporated the recommendations of the Commission on the Newspaper Industry into the merger provisions of the Act. From 1 January 2003 all media mergers – media covers newspapers, periodicals, broadcasting services and broadcasting services platforms – will be assessed under the following criteria: the strength and competitiveness of media businesses indigenous to the State; the plurality of ownership; the plurality of ownership of particular types of media businesses; the diversity of views in Irish society; the maintenance of cultural diversity and the position in the media market generally of any of the enterprises involved in the proposed merger or take-over or of any of the enterprises with an interest in any such enterprises.In circumstances where the Competition Authority decides that a media merger be put into effect or put into effect with conditions, I will ultimately decide on the merger. These new criteria will focus attention on factors which are special to the media sector and will ensure that the special status of the media in Ireland is protected. I do not have any plans to undertake any examination into competition in the newspaper market at present.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	830	The current installation aid scheme, which was introduced by my Department with effect from 15 February 2001, applies to farmers between the ages of 18 and 35 who have been set up in farming for the first time on or after 1 January 2000. Farmers who were set up in farming for the first time prior to that date are, therefore, ineligible under the current scheme and must apply under the previous scheme, the national scheme of installation aid, which was in force at that time. Applications can be made to a local office of my Department.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	831	The level of grant currently payable to young farmers under the installation aid scheme is €9,523 which, when introduced on 15 February 2001, represented a 34% increase on the premium payable under the previous scheme. I have no plans at present to apply to the European Commission for approval to further increase the level of this grant.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	832	The person named received an 80% advance payment under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme for the amount of €128 on 16 October. This represented payment on two animals which were found eligible under the scheme. The person named also had an animal under query for this scheme. The query has now been resolved and payment will issue on this animal shortly. The person named submitted three applications in respect of EU special beef premium 2002 for a total of five animals. An 80% advance payment has issued in respect of these animals.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	833	The person named has ten animals eligible under the 2002 slaughter premium scheme. Nine of these animals are also eligible under the national envelope top up scheme. The 80% advance payments for the amounts of €640 and €164.52 issued on 16 October 2002 for the respective schemes. The person named has made no special beef application. The person named will be paid his full entitlement under the 2002 area based compensatory allowance scheme shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	834	Under the regulations for the TB eradication scheme, a farmer whose herd is locked up due to tuberculosis cannot buy in cattle until his herd has one clear test and he is subsequently given permission to purchase cattle by his local district veterinary office. Under the EU regulations governing the direct payment schemes an applicant for special beef premium must have, at the time of application, eligible male cattle in his ownership and possession, proper to the age category for the appropriate premium being claimed. The farmer must be in a position to sign an undertaking to own, possess and maintain the animals at a specified location(s) on his-her holding for a two month retention period following application. A holding is defined in the regulations as all the production units in the State managed by a producer.As special beef premium payments in excess of 15 livestock units and extensification scheme payments are linked to the eligible forage area declared on a producer's area aid application, animals must be retained at specified locations on the producer's holding for the retention period. However, special provisions apply in respect of the special beef premium scheme for animals purchased by herdowners and held in feed lots. Producers are advised to contact my Department's special beef premium unit in Portlaoise in order to acquaint themselves of the full requirements in relation to this matter.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	835	I introduced a scheme for the distribution of the balance of the Agenda 2000 milk quota among certain producers. Producers who satisfy certain criteria and who had been involved in the farm modernisation scheme or the reduced interest scheme for farmers in financial difficulty during the early 1980s or who were affected by an outbreak of animal disease in their herds during the late 1970s were eligible to apply.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	836	The 2002 area aid application of the person named has been fully processed with an area determined for payment purposes of 15.69 hectares. The person named was paid her full entitlement under the 2002 area based compensatory allowance scheme on 18 November 2002.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	837	The person named was not the registered herdowner at the date of application for ewe premium in December 2001. She has since become the registered owner and payment of the 2002 ewe premium will be made shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	838	The person named applied on 66 animals under the 2000 suckler cow premium scheme on 31 May 2000. An inspection of his herd was carried out on 20 July 2000 and it was found that the person named had applied on one of these animals twice and that one animal had an invalid tag number and was deleted from his application leaving 64 potentially eligible animals. Two animals were absent at inspection and these were rejected.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	839	The person named applied on 14 cows and two heifers under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 15 January 2002. My Department wrote to the person named on 19 August 2002 requesting calving dates for three cows and also requested him to provide confirmation that a fourth cow, which had a last calving date of 15 March 1998, had calved subsequently. The person named provided details of the calving dates for two cows and confirmed that the third cow was in fact a heifer. The person named notified my Department on 31 October 2002 that the fourth cow had calved in 2002 but that he had registered the birth of the calf with incorrect dam details on the cattle movement monitoring system. This error has now been rectified and his application under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme is being processed for payment.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	840	The person named applied on 17 animals under the 2002 suckler cow premium scheme on 22 March 2002. An inspection of his herd was carried out on 9 August 2002. During this inspection it was found that one animal in his herd was not compliant with animal identification and registration requirements, resulting in a reduction penalty which will apply when balancing payments are made in the new year. My Department wrote to the person named on 11 November 2002 advising him of his non-compliance with the requirements and giving him the opportunity to  have this decision reviewed by writing to my Department within 21 days. He informed my Department of his acceptance of the decision on 14 November 2002. His 2002 suckler cow premium application is now being processed for advance payment and this will issue to him shortly.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	841	I fully support the introduction of a mechanical classification system and I will continue to do everything possible to progress the matter. The decision to allow technical grading is one which will be taken at EU level.Mechanical grading trials were carried out in Ireland in August 1999 and March 2000. Similar trials were also carried out in Germany, Denmark and France. The consensus of opinion was that the trials in Ireland had been carried out in a highly professional manner. While the three machines involved achieved high accuracy results in relation to conformation and meat content of the carcases, they were less accurate in relation to fatness and, in general, failed to attain the standards set down by the EU Commission in a draft regulation setting standards to be met by these machines prior to their approval for classification purposes.Following discussion in the beef management committee, the Commission agreed to carry out a pilot test to examine whether the standards and procedures set out in the draft regulation were practicable. Germany was selected as the venue for the pilot test and a trial was carried out in September last year in which my Department was involved. Based on the results of this trial, a draft regulation is now being formulated by the EU Commission which will set down the standards to be met by the machines and the procedures for approving them. Publication of such a regulation will clear the way for the development of a machine capable of meeting the required standards in Ireland.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	842	As indicated in response to Question No. 264, on 5 November 2002, the purpose of the European Commission review of the laying hens directive is to assess the results of scientific research into the welfare of laying hens which will be available at that time. There are several  ongoing research projects in this area geared towards providing the scientific information necessary to advise member states during the review in 2005 and my Department will take careful note of such research. It would not be prudent to anticipate the scientific evidence at this stage.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	843	An application under the installation aid scheme was received by my Department from the person named on 26 October 2001. The conditions of the scheme provide that the educational requirements must be attained by the applicant within a period of two years from the date of set up. Certain certificates in agriculture are acceptable under the scheme for this purpose. However, as the applicant has not provided my Department with the details of his qualifications, I am unable to confirm whether or not he meets the terms of the scheme.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	844	The person named participated in the 2001 extensification premium scheme opting for the census system. Under EU regulations, the Department is required to carry out a percentage of on-farm checks in order to ensure that the stocking density payment limits are not breached. On-farm checks are carried out from records held in bovine herd registers which farmers are obliged to maintain. The number of bovine livestock units to be taken into account in any case is ascertained from the number of animals over six months present in the herd on the census date. On the basis of the findings at all five census dates for 2001, my Department considered that the person named was entitled to extensification premium at the lower rate and payment issued at this rate.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	845	As the national TB and brucellosis eradication programmes must comply with the terms of EU legislation relating to movement and trade in bovine animals, the question of amending the testing rules for cattle as suggested does not arise. The relevant EU directive only permits movements of animals from officially TB-free herds. A bovine herd can only retain officially TB-free status if, among other things, all animals in the holding, with the exception of calves under six weeks of age which were born in the holding, are subject to routine tuberculin testing at yearly intervals. The recent requirement for marts to display the date of the last test will assist farmers in managing their trading business so that out of date test situations will be avoided.

The exemption is only available to individuals who are resident here for tax purposes. Section 195 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, formerly section 2 of the Finance Act, 1969, allows the Revenue Commissioners to make a determination, under guidelines drawn up by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, and the Arts Council with the consent of the Minister for Finance, that certain artistic works are original and creative and generally recognised as having cultural or artistic merit. Earnings derived from such works are exempt from income tax.

The scheme is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to those who suffered hardship in localised flooding in the Athlone area and in several areas of the south-east and east of the country. The Irish Red Cross Society will administer the scheme and will be advertising it in the media this week. Application forms will be available by ringing the free phone number provided or can be obtained from the Irish Red Cross Society's network, the Garda, community welfare officers, health agencies, local authorities and charitable organisations. It should be emphasised that the scheme is designed to provide humanitarian assistance to relieve hardship arising from damage to people's homes and not compensation for losses.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	848	There already exists a relief of stamp duty for the transfer of property between close relatives, namely, consanguinity relief. Under this relief, conveyances on sale and voluntary dispositions of property, other than stocks and marketable securities, between certain relations are taxed at half the  specified rate. The transferee must be related to the transferor in one of the following relationships – lineal descendant parent, grand-parent, step-parent, brother of a parent, sister of a parent, lineal descendant of a parent, brother, sister, lineal descendant of a brother, or lineal descendant of a sister. The cost of this relief in a full year is estimated as €4.5 million.As the Deputy will appreciate, given the forthcoming budget it is not appropriate for me to comment at this stage on the possibility of changes in the tax treatment of such transactions. However, I should point out that section 104 of the Finance Act, 1993, was brought in specifically to close a stamp duty loophole in relation to the exchange of real property and I have no intention of weakening this anti-avoidance provision.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	849	The current position is that, under section 664 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, there is an exemption from income tax in respect of the first €5078.95 of annual leasing income, where the leasing is for a period of not less than five years, and in respect of €7618.43, where the leasing is for a period of not less than seven years. The exemptions are available to lessors of agricultural land aged 55 years or over or to those who are permanently incapable by mental or physical infirmity of carrying on farming. These tax exemptions apply only in respect of leases to qualifying lessees. In this context, "qualifying lessee" specifically excludes from the scope of the relief any leases made between closely connected relatives. As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the usual procedure in the period prior to the budget, it would not be appropriate for me to comment one way or the other in regard to the suggested taxation changes referred to by the Deputy.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	850	Section 48 of the Finance Act, 2001, provided for an extension from the then existing 5 April 2001 deadline until 31 December 2002 for the special incentive stock relief of 100% for certain young trained farmers. As the Deputy will appreciate, in accordance with the usual procedure in the per iod prior to the budget, it would not be appropriate for me to comment one way or the other in regard to the suggested taxation changes referred to by the Deputy.
#CharlieMcCreevy	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-party	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcCreevy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	851	The Deputy is referring to a relief known as young trained farmers relief. This relief was introduced by section 112 of the Finance Act, 1994, which provided for a two thirds reduction in stamp duty on the transfer of land to a young trained farmer. This relief was introduced on foot of commitments in the Programme for Competitiveness and Work for a three year period until 31 December 1996.In the context of structural reform identified in the Partnership 2000 programme, section 126 of the Finance Act, 1997, extended the relief for a further three years, up to 31 December 1999. Under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, the two thirds relief was increased to full stamp duty relief in section 126 of the Finance Act, 2000, for a further three years until 31 December 2002. It is estimated that the cost of this relief in 2002 will amount to €9.4 million.For the purposes of the relief, a young trained farmer is one who is under 35 years of age at the date of execution of the transfer; is the holder of one of the specified qualifications, for example, the Teagasc certificate in farming; or, if born before 1 January 1968, has three years experience in farming together with satisfactory completion of Teagasc training courses in agriculture and horticulture of 180 hours' duration. Where the transferee has completed at least one academic year of the Teagasc certificate in farming at the date of execution of the transfer, he or she may obtain the relief by way of a refund provided that the qualification is obtained within three years of the date of execution of the transfer.As the Deputy will appreciate, given the forthcoming budget and the ongoing discussions with the social partners regarding a potential successor to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, it is not appropriate for me to comment at this stage on the possibility of extending this relief for a further period.

As the responses were evaluated on the basis of value for money criteria as set out in the RFT, I am satisfied that the contract represents the best value for money for these services. My Department continuously monitors the market to ensure that this remains the case and the contract provides for reviews where the situation changes.In pursuing the standard open EU procurement exercise for these services, my Department complied with all notifications required to the Official Journal of the EU. A prior indicative notice was sent on 23 February 2001, an open procedure notice was sent on 23 March 2001 and an award of contract notice was sent on 19 August 2002. In addition, all tenderers were individually notified of the result and debriefed.

Four members have been appointed to the board to date: the chairperson, Judge Kieran O'Connor, Dr. Helen Cummiskey, Dr. Ruth Pilkington and Professor Desmond Greer. Further appointments to the board will be made as required. Office accommodation has been secured for the board at Belfield Office Park, Clonskeagh, Dublin 4. A secretary and registrar have been appointed to the board and administrative and legal teams are being assembled.As the Deputy is aware it is important that the procedures and practices laid down by this board should be as sensitive and user friendly as possible. With this in mind, the board has taken the time to consult a number of interested parties, including a number of solicitors, prior to the completion of the application form and a guide to the application procedure. The board has now set a provisional date of 2 December 2002 for formal establishment and I assure the Deputy that my Department is providing every possible assistance to the board to achieve this target.

In line with a commitment under the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness, my predecessor, Deputy Woods, established the action group on access to third level education to advise on the development of a co-ordinated strategy to increase participation of students from disadvantaged backgrounds, mature students and students with a disability at third level. The action group's report was published in July 2001. To date a number of measures have been taken in response to some of the main recommendations in the report.A new millennium partnership fund for disadvantage was introduced with effect from 2001. The fund provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. Area Development Management Limited under whose aegis the partnerships operate, accepted my Department's request that it would administer the fund for the 2001-02 academic year. The total allocation for the 2001-02 academic year was €1.2 million, with 37 partnerships and community groups receiving allocations from the fund.For 2002-03, I have increased the provision for the fund to €2 million. ADM Limited which is continuing to administer the fund, has notified 50 area partnerships and community groups of their allocations in respect of the 2002-03 academic year. In this regard, Tallaght partnership has been allocated €80,000 in respect the 2002-03 academic year.

I have asked officials of my Department to examine how best this commitment can be implemented over the next five years and to consult with the partners in education in that regard. On completion of the examination and consultation process, decisions will be taken as to the appropriate implementation measures and the timing of their introduction.

The priority for the tourism industry for 2003 has to be to sustain strong international marketing campaigns, to ensure that Ireland remains in the minds of potential visitors and to meet the more intense international competition that has emerged recently. Tourism Ireland and Bord Fáilte are working in close consultation with the industry, North and South, on their marketing programmes for 2003. This close interface with the industry will ensure that the programmes are soundly based and target the available resources where they can deliver the greatest dividends. I look forward to launching the new 2003 programmes in December.My objective during the recent discussions on the Estimates for 2003 was to ensure that sufficient funding would be available within the tourism budget to mount robust marketing campaigns in our key target markets next year. I am particularly pleased that the Government has agreed to increase the tourism marketing subhead by 20% to €30.4 million which is the highest in the history of the State.Other public sector support available to the tourism industry for the period of the national development plan from tourism agencies under the aegis of my Department include Bord Fáilte's tourism product development scheme, funded under the two regional operational programmes, and CERT's training programmes, funded under the human resources operational programme. Full details are available directly from the relevant agencies.

All objects in the care of the Museum are there because each is interesting in its own way. However, it is impossible to display all interesting artefacts at the same time. Exhibitions are developed to place the most significant objects on display to the public and in a setting which places them in a context that adds to understanding of them. There are exhibition strategies for further developments at the Museum of Decorative Arts and History at Collins Barracks and at the Museum of Archaeology and History in Kildare Street. The National Museum has an ongoing practice of facilitating loans to venues that meet the necessarily stringent requirements of security, safety and public access. To date, a number of loans have been made to local authority museums.

A positive performance is predicated on a number of assumptions, including a steady recovery in the economies of our main source markets, namely, Great Britain, the US and mainland Europe, a restoration of air access capacity on key routes and no further setbacks in terms of military conflict in the Middle East.My view is that the medium to long-term outlook for the tourism sector remains bright. As long as we maintain our international competitiveness in terms of pricing, access and the quality of our product, the sector should in time overcome its present difficulties. In this context, the Government will continue to offer appropriate levels of support to the industry, while seeking to ensure that it gets the best return on its substantial investment in the sector.

My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.The total funding allocation for the swimming pool programme is €57.14 million. This has not been cut or amended in any way. I am satisfied the Estimates provision for 2003 for the programme is sufficient to meet the anticipated demand for funding, given the pattern of drawdown to date in this multi-annual programme.In the case of Ballybunion health and leisure centre, a preliminary report submitted by Kerry County Council has been assessed by the Office of Public Works, which has requested further information on the breakdown of costs for the proposed facility. The completion of the first stage of the pool process, the approval of the preliminary report, will be considered further, once this additional information has been received from the council.

The Irish Film Board in response to the publication of the Abridged Estimates 2003 stated it is committed to the delivery of its planned programmes and acknowledged the figures allocated for 2003 provide workable parameters for doing so.

These, in order of progress, are: preliminary report, contract, documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors, the Office of Public Works, evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.In the case of Dunmanway swimming pool, contract documents have been submitted by Cork County Council and assessed by Office of Public Works. Cork County Council should now, on the advice to my Department from Office of Public Works, appoint a company to operate the pool, as it previously advised it would. The council has been requested by my Department to conclude this appointment process and thus enable any revision of the contract documents to be carried out before they are approved by the Department. The proposal will be considered further, once this action has been taken.

I understand this is being undertaken with a view to the course commencing early in 2003.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	907	Responsibility for the determination of eligibility to a medical card is, by legislation, a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board, in this case, the South-Eastern Health Board. My Department has, therefore, asked the chief executive officer to investigate the matter raised by the Deputy and to reply to him directly.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	908	Following a comprehensive review of acute hospital bed capacity needs, the Government decided, in the context of the health strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. Earlier this year, I announced the first phase of these additional beds with the commissioning of an extra 709 beds in acute hospitals at a cost of €65 million.I am pleased to inform the Deputy that 38 of these beds were approved for the North-Western Health Board region, including eight beds at Letterkenny General Hospital. The board has submitted proposals to my Department for the provision of additional beds at Letterkenny General Hospital. This proposal will be considered in the light of the availability of capital and revenue funding.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	909	The provision of medical services in the case of a person from County Mayo is the responsibility of the Western Health Board in the first instance. However, I have made inquiries of the Western Health Board and I have been advised that the person in question is on the waiting list for a lung transplant. I have also been advised that the question of when a lung transplant can take place is dependant upon the availability of a suitable matching donor organ. All patients receive appropriate clinical priority while on the waiting list. Pending the establishment of lung transplantation in this country, an agreement is in place with the Freeman Hospital in the United Kingdom for the treatment of Irish patients.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	910	The number of persons covered under the medical card scheme at 1 August 2002, the latest date for which figures are available, was 1,200,162. This represents 31.2% of the population. Based on data provided to my Department by the GMS (Payments) Board, the estimated annual cost of extending the medical card scheme to a further 200,000 persons would be in the region of €150 million. This figure does not take into account any adjustments which might have to be made to reflect the outcomes of industrial relations negotiations with primary care contractors or any savings which might arise under the long-term illness and drugs payment schemes.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	911	Additional funding has been made available to the North-Eastern Health Board in recent years to provide a range of services, including residential, respite and day services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Responsibility for the allocation of such funding is a matter for the North-Eastern Health Board. Decisions in relation to the precise details of the services to be provided from any additional funding and the individuals who will benefit from  those services are a matter for the relevant health boards, in this case, the North-Eastern Health Board. The Deputy will appreciate that I cannot, at this stage, comment on specific funding for any element of the health services in 2003 prior to the conclusion of the annual budget discussions.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	912	The draft report, Men and Domestic Violence: What Research Tells Us, was commissioned from external consultants by my Department in collaboration with the North-Eastern Health Board. The report is a literature review of research carried out abroad on domestic violence and it was undertaken because of the lack of data on male victims of domestic violence in Ireland.The draft report was presented to my Department in October 2000 and was then sent to relevant official agencies seeking their views. As a number of issues were raised during this consultation process my Department has arranged for the document to be peer reviewed. I will take a final decision on publication of this report when this process is complete. As well as funding this research, my Department has made funding available to the organisation, AMEN, which provides services to male victims of domestic violence. Details of this funding to date are set out in the following table:
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	913	The influenza vaccine is available free of charge from general practitioners to medical card holders at risk of contracting the disease; the "at risk" group includes those aged 65 or older as well as those with specific chronic illness, such as chronic heart, lung or kidney disease and those with a suppressed immune system. Individuals who are in an at risk category who do not have a medical card are entitled to the vaccine free of charge. However, the fee for administering the vaccine in such cases is a matter between the general practitioner and the patient. I take this opportunity to encourage those in the at risk group who have not yet availed of the vaccine to do so without further delay.In excess of 500,000 doses of the influenza vaccine have been made available this winter. The current influenza campaign commenced on 23 September 2002 and will run until early 2003. As the campaign is still ongoing, health boards have not yet compiled definitive figures as to how many people have availed of the vaccine. In order to ensure maximum uptake, particularly in the at risk group, a national influenza advertising campaign was co-ordinated by the health boards executive on behalf of all health boards. The campaign took the form of advertisements on local and national radio as well as notices in local and national papers. In addition, it is at the discretion of individual health boards to organise other local and regional initiatives in order to further promote uptake.Influenza is a highly infectious viral disease that can affect large numbers of people. Complications are common and hospitalisation rates are high in both the elderly and those with underlying disease. The vaccine provides up to 90% protection against the disease and is highly effective against the complications of influenza. Its impact in reducing mortality from influenza in older people is well documented. However, as its protection lasts about one year, it is important that people at risk of contracting influenza are vaccinated every year against the most recent strains.

Provision has been made for an increase in the public hospital statutory in-patient accommodation charge from €36 per day to €40 per day subject to a maximum payment in any 12 consecutive months of €400. In addition, the charge for private and semi-private accommodation for private patients in category one and category two public hospitals will increase by 10% as follows:
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	916	I propose to take Questions Nos. 190 and 192 together.The drugs payment scheme with a monthly threshold of £42 replaced the drug refund scheme and the drug cost subsidisation scheme with effect from 1 July 1999. The monthly cost to the Exchequer of the scheme when the threshold for refund was set at €53.33, £42, and the monthly cost of the scheme when the threshold was raised to €65 per month – 1 August 2002 – are set out in the following table. August 2002 is the latest date for which figures are available.The information requested by the Deputy regarding changes to the drugs payment scheme is not to hand as a final decision regarding restructuring, if any, has not yet been made.

The matter was investigated by the South-Eastern Health Board and the Garda Síochána. I was made aware of them in October on receipt of a copy letter from a member of the public. It is now a matter for the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse to consider whether any person subjected to abuse in St. Michael's should bring it to the attention of the commission.
Question No. 192 answered with Question No. 190.

The pre-budget Estimate for 2003 provides for an amount of €970 million for the General Medical Services (Payments) Board, an increase of €230 million, 31%, over the 2002 figure. The eligibility guidelines for medical cards will be reviewed by the chief executive officers in the context of this funding level. I cannot as yet say what the guidelines will be.

The strategy has prioritised a systematic and co-ordinated set of measures for preventing and reducing road accidents. It establishes quantified targets for achieving its objectives, the principal of which is to reduce road deaths and serious injuries each by at least 20% by 2002 relative to 1997. Priority is accorded by the strategy to actions targeted at speeding, alcohol, seat belt wearing and vulnerable road users. A timetable for key actions in these and other areas is also set out.The strategy is monitored by the high level group on road safety, whose first progress report, July 1999, second progress report, August 2000, third progress report, July 2001, and fourth progress report, August 2002, detail progress with key actions. Copies of the first three reports have been circulated to all Deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library. Copies of the fourth progress report are being forwarded to all deputies and are also available in the Oireachtas Library.The fourth progress report shows that real and worthwhile gains are being made in road safety within the framework of the strategy. Between 1997 and 2001 there has been a 13% reduction in road deaths and provisional figures indicate a 43% reduction in serious injuries. The interim targets fixed by the strategy for achievement by 2000 have been well met. Progress is also ahead of target in extending low cost accident measures across the national road network, with 365 schemes completed on the national network by end 2001 with a further 32 approved for 2002.

The First Schedule to the Act contains the list of the 69 offences that will attract penalty points and the number of points that apply to each offence. The extension of the operation of the penalty points system to all the offences listed in the First Schedule of the Act will be pursued with a view to applying the penalty points system fully by the end of 2003. The website is being updated and it is intended to pro vide additional information on the site, including updates as the penalty points are extended.

As the maximum speed limit on motorways is 70 mph it is considered appropriate that provisional licence holders should be prohibited from using motorways for safety reasons. There are no proposals to amend the Roads regulations, 1994, in this regard.

In this regard, the equal opportunities child care programme, established in April 2000, has been developed with the  objective of significantly increasing the number of child care places and improving the quality of child care services to enable parents to avail of work, education and training opportunities. A sum of €437 million has been made available for this purpose from the Exchequer and the European Union.While this group was approved for a staffing grant of €190,461 as a contribution towards the costs of staff working directly with children in April 2001, to date no application for capital funding under the programme has been received in the name of this group. Should an application for capital grant assistance be received, it will undergo a technical appraisal process by ADM Limited on my behalf to determine whether it complies with the programme objectives, following which a decision on funding will be made.

While I am not in a position to say when these works might commence, they will be progressed as quickly as possible and without undue delay.All such works to Garda stations are carried out following an assessment of the situation by the Office of Public Works. Agreement is reached between the Garda authorities and that office on the extent of each project and, having due regard to overall Garda building programme priorities and the availability of financial and other resources, appropriate arrangements are made to have the works completed. In all the circumstances, a meeting as suggested would not serve any useful purpose.

He was called for interview on 18 May 2000 but failed to attend. The person was  notified on 19 May 2000 that consideration was being given to deeming his application abandoned and was given 14 days to inform the Department in writing of the reasons his application should not be deemed abandoned. No correspondence was received from him, and on 16 June 2000 he was notified that the Minister was proposing to make a deportation order in respect of him under the power given to him by Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999. He was informed of the following options; to make written representations to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform setting out reasons he should be allowed to remain in the State, to voluntarily leave the State or to consent to deportation.The person sought to re-enter the asylum process in July 2000. His application to re-enter the asylum process was considered by the asylum division of the Department. On 24 August 2000, his legal representatives were informed that the matter had been considered and that the decision to deem his case abandoned still stood. A further opportunity was afforded to him to submit representations as to why he should not be deported. In response, his legal representatives made a detailed submission dated 1 September 2000 to the Minister pursuant to Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999, setting out why this man should not be deported and should be granted leave to remain in the State. A decision on this application is still pending.

Local service delivery enhances co-operation from those people working with the Probation and Welfare Service who are residing in the locality. In Dublin, the Probation and Welfare Service has been successful in establishing offices in Dún Laoghaire, Ballyfermot, Tallaght, Finglas, Crumlin and Clondalkin. These offices are sited in local communities, alongside businesses, over shops and within industrial units. No complaint has been received by the Probation and Welfare Service to date from any member of the public about the behaviour of those attending a local office, nor has any complaint been brought to the attention of any officer of the service about the behaviour of those attending a local office.The premises at Donaghmede Shopping Centre were identified by the Probation and Welfare Service and the Office of Public Works as being suitable for a Probation and Welfare Service local office. This facility is necessary to serve the needs of the Donaghmede and surrounding areas as well as for the delivery of new obligations on the Probation and Welfare Service for family conferencing under the recently enacted Children Act, 2001. A lease with the owners of the Donaghmede Shopping Centre for the proposed Probation and Welfare Service office was arranged with effect from 1 June 2001. The amount of rent payable on this lease is €152,368 per annum and the office is 7,200 sq. ft in size. Following this lease agreement, planning permission was sought and obtained earlier this year to adapt the premises to service the needs of the Probation and Welfare Service.

These range from small enclosures to large castles and with the exception of some 740, all are found on private lands. Of the 740 in State care, some  55 have a guide service. While these sites are preserved and presented primarily as examples of excellence in the conservation of our built heritage they also play an important role as an educational resource and in promoting tourism. The NDP programme for investment in national monuments is under way and this will address conservation work at a number of the 720 sites in state care. There is no proposal to undertake a comprehensive assessment of the sites not in State care for development purposes.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	938	The national building regulations prescribe minimum construction standards for buildings, including dwellings. Part D requires works to be carried out with proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.Compliance with regulations is primarily a matter for the designers, builders and owners of the buildings involved. Local building control authorities are responsible for monitoring and enforcement of compliance with them. Under the regulations the authorities are empowered to inspect buildings, issue enforcement notices for non-compliance with the regulations and initiate court proceedings.The careful selection by clients of competent building professionals and contractors should help to ensure that buildings are designed and constructed in accordance with the regulations. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client commissioning the building and the builder, enforcement of this contract is a civil matter.In the case of new houses Home Bond and Premier Guarantee independently indemnify house owners against major defects of a structural nature for ten years following completion of the building work.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	942	All social housing developments funded by my Department are initiated by the relevant local authority either directly, as in the case of local authority housing, or indirectly, with local authority approval, to a voluntary or co-operative  housing proposal. As the Minister responsible for housing and urban renewal I have been assigned responsibility for overseeing the promotion of social housing programmes by my Department.Letting of local authority dwellings is a matter for local authorities to be carried out in accordance with their schemes of letting priorities which set down the criteria under which houses are let to tenants. Making or amendment of a scheme of letting priorities is a function reserved for elected members of an authority. Individual lettings, in accordance with the scheme, are an executive function.The allocation of dwellings provided by the voluntary sector is made by the voluntary body concerned in consultation with the relevant local authority. No less than 75% of these units for letting must be allocated to households on the local authority waiting list.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	943	I propose to take Questions Nos. 218 and 223 together.Tenants of local authority housing already have the option to purchase their homes. As regards housing provided by approved voluntary housing bodies with funding from my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance and capital loan and subsidy schemes, there are no plans to make provision in these schemes for the purchase of houses by tenants.A tenant purchase scheme is not desirable at this stage of the development of the voluntary housing sector as the sale of housing units would undermine the capacity and resources of voluntary housing bodies to manage and maintain their estates and continue to provide further housing projects to meet pressing needs.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	944	This scheme has been approved for construction under the serviced land initiative. Sligo County Council expects to resolve outstanding planning issues in the near future with a view to commencing construction early next year.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	945	My Department has not set a general  income threshold for eligibility for local authority housing. In assessing the housing needs of applicants for local authority housing, local authorities have regard to a number of factors including means. Any review of income thresholds is a matter for each local authority having regard to local circumstances.The income limit for eligibility for the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes was revised to €32,000 for a single income household, with a pro rata increase for a dual income household with effect from 1 January. While there are no plans at present to revise the maximum income limits, my Department is keeping the terms of the schemes under review.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	946	The minimum deposit required under the shared ownership scheme is €1,270. In the context of the termination of the first-time buyer's new house grant, the minimum deposit required under the affordable housing scheme has been reduced from 5% to 3%. The variable interest rate is 4.3% for both schemes and a five year fixed rate of 5.3% is available under the affordable housing scheme only. Mortgage protection insurance at a rate of 0.67% is also payable. The maximum housing loan which a local authority may advance is €130,000 and this may relate to the purchased equity of a shared ownership house. My Department has not set a limit on the cost of houses which may be purchased under either scheme. Local authorities should have regard to local circumstances in operating the schemes, including determining maximum price limits. These issues are best determined by local authorities.A rental subsidy is available under the shared ownership scheme and a mortgage subsidy under the affordable housing scheme. The subsidy, which is related to household income in the preceding tax year, is as follows:
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	947	The disabled persons and the essential repairs grant schemes are administered by the local authorities in accordance with the legal framework laid down in section 6 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 1979, and statutory regulations made under that Act. The schemes enable city and county councils to grant aid necessary adaptation works to a house to meet the needs of an elderly or disabled person.Significant improvements have been made to the terms and conditions of the disabled persons grant scheme in recent years with a doubling of the effective maximum grant since 1997 from €10,158 to €20,320 currently. The grant now covers 90% of the approved cost of the works compared to two-thirds in 1997. The recoupment rate from my Department to local authorities in respect of grants paid has also increased from 50% to two-thirds. A disabled person's new house grant of up to an effective maximum of €12,700 has also been introduced.In recent years the amount of recoupment payable by my Department to local authorities under the essential repairs grants scheme has also increased significantly. Prior to December 1998 local authorities were recouped 50% of each essential repairs grant paid up to a maximum of €1,143 in each case. Since that date two-thirds of the amount of grant paid is recouped, up to a maximum recoupment of €6,353 in each case. The effective maximum essential repairs grant has increased from €2,286 in December 1998 to €9,530 currently.While there is no proposal to change these schemes at this time, my Department will continue to keep the terms and conditions of the schemes under review. Copies of leaflets outlining the operation of these schemes are available in the Oireachtas Library. Further details of the operation of these schemes, together with application forms, are available from local authorities.

Information and communication technologies offer new solutions to traditional problems of disadvantage and social exclusion and the CAIT initiative has made a critical contribution within the context of wider social inclusion objectives.Funding in excess of €7,448,000 has been committed to 121 projects under the CAIT I and CAIT II initiatives to date. Under the first CAIT initiative, the Brothers of Charity Services in Roscommon received €75,549. This funding is being used to provide assistance in technology and training, together with a supportive environment, that will encourage people with learning disabilities to access and to benefit from information and communication technologies.On 5 May my Department received the proposal for funding submitted under the second CAIT initiative by the Brothers of Charity Services. A firm of independent assessors evaluates every proposal submitted. This application was not selected to receive an allocation of funding under the CAIT II initiative. The organisation was notified of this decision in writing on 9 October and a copy of the assessors' evaluation report was also enclosed.

In this regard, it is intended to undertake a review of the programmes and activities which come within the remit of my Department with a view to achieving optimal coherence across the various schemes. Any proposals in relation to the future administration and delivery of these programmes, including the community development support programmes, will be considered in this context.Arising from section 4 of the Public Service Management Act, 1997 the secretary general of each Department submits a draft statement of strategy to the Minister of their Department for approval within six months of the Minister's appointment. The process of preparing a draft statement of strategy for the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs covering the years 2002-05 is well advanced. This will incorporate a mission statement for the Department.

The average payment was €135.63.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	957	I propose to take Questions Nos. 233 and 234 together.Social welfare legislation provides that, in order to be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, a person must satisfy the conditions of being available for and genuinely seeking work. A person who fails to satisfy these conditions on an on-going basis is not entitled to an unemployment payment. It is accepted that periods of unemployment are a normal feature of the dancing and other artistic professions and people in those professions can qualify for payment when they are out of work.Where a person is seeking work in his or her usual employment, he or she would normally satisfy the conditions for receipt of payment, provided there is a reasonable prospect of securing work of that nature. It is accepted that people engaged in a profession such as dancing and seeking employment in that profession would be required to train on an ongoing basis for that purpose. In situations, however, where it is clear that there is no employment available in a specialised field within a reasonable period of time, the unemployed person would be expected to broaden his or her search to include other types of employment. The applications of these conditions is the same for members of the artistic professions as for other claimants for unemployment payments.Where a person is dissatisfied with a decision to refuse him or her an employment payment, he or she may appeal the decision to the social welfare appeals office.

On receipt of the completed form, her entitlement to retirement pension will be examined by a deciding officer and she will be notified of the position.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	959	The policy of the social welfare appeals office is to hold hearings at venues as convenient as possible to the appellant. In the Dublin area appeals are heard at the appeals office headquarters. The rest of the country is divided into seven circuits, one of which covers County Mayo. Each circuit would include venues located along the route.The number of cases which can be taken at an oral hearing session will depend on the complexity of the cases involved. Some appeal hearings can be disposed of within ten to 15 minutes whereas other hearings relating to more complex issues could take up to a half-day.There is no set regularity for holding oral hearings in County Mayo or in any other part of the country. In any given week there will be approximately five appeals officers on circuit outside of Dublin. The number of occasions when an appeals officer visited the County Mayo circuit during the period from 1 January 2002 to 31 October 2002 was 18, in the course of which 391 cases where dealt with. The corresponding figures for 2001 was 16 visits, involving 289 cases. Details are not available for the length of time appellants from different parts of the country are awaiting oral hearings.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	960	Entitlement to adoptive benefit, as in the case also of maternity benefit, is contingent in the first instance on a person's entitlement to the relevant leave. In order to qualify for adoptive benefit or maternity benefit, a person must first be entitled to adoptive leave or maternity leave, as appropriate. The duration of adoptive benefit and maternity benefit is also aligned to the duration of the appropriate leave. In line with the increase of four weeks extra maternity leave and maternity benefit from February 2001, the duration of adoptive leave and adoptive benefit was similarly extended by four weeks at the same time. Adopting parents are now entitled to 14 weeks adoptive leave and adoptive benefit.Since its introduction in 1995, the duration of adoptive leave has been set at four weeks less than the duration of maternity leave. This is explained by the fact that an adopting parent does not face the same health and safety considerations which arise for pregnant workers, particularly in the last four weeks of pregnancy.The duration of adoptive leave is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who is currently reviewing the provisions of the Adoptive Leave Act, 1995. The implications of any proposals emerging from this review on the operation of the adoptive benefit scheme will be examined in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-20 00:00:00	Prelude	961	My Department is committed to providing a quality customer service to all its customers. This includes ensuring that applications are processed and that decisions on entitlement are issued as expeditiously as possible having regard to the eligibility conditions which apply.Entitlement to carer's allowance is based on an applicant satisfying medical, means and residency conditions. There is, in certain cases, an unavoidable timelag involved in making the necessary investigations and enquiries to enable timely and accurate decisions to be made. In addition to the work my Department has to carry out, there is an onus on applicants to furnish all necessary documentation. Time can elapse through delays by persons applying for the allowance not supplying all the necessary information in support of their claim.The average time for deciding an application for receipt of carer's allowance is ten weeks, although in many cases they are processed within a far shorter timeframe. Many applicants for carer's allowance are already in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payments will normally continue until entitlement to their carer's allowance is determined.The staff and other resources available to my Department are regularly reviewed having regard to the workload arising and other competing demands; the available resources are then used to best advantage in discharging my Department's obligations towards our customers and in implementing cost-effective controls to prevent and detect fraud and abuse.If the Deputy has a particular case(s) in mind where a delay is being experienced, perhaps he would let my Department have the relevant details.
