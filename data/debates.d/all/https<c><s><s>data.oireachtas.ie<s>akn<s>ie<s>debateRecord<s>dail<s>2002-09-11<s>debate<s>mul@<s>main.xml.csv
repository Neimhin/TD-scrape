#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I wish to share my time with Deputy Hogan and Deputy English. The issue to be put before the people again is a second chance for the electorate. Having considered at some length the issues involved in the Nice agreement and with all sides having had the opportunity to voice their opinions, the voters will go to the polls again a little over a year after the previous Nice referendum. There are those on the "No" side who have said that we cannot and should not put the case again so soon as nothing has changed. However, things have changed considerably. For example, the Forum on Europe has taken place and has gone around the country taking opinions on board. Considerable discussions have taken place among all the political parties, both for and against Nice, and there can be no doubt that much more information is now available to the people.One of the changes for the better is that the Oireachtas has much more control than it had a year ago. The Government, at the behest of the Opposition parties, has created a situation where the Joint Committee on European Affairs is in a position to have discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and civil servants before any decision is taken in future. While that does not affect the current Nice treaty, it will affect every other treaty. More importantly, it will affect all directives and instruments enacted by the European institutions for transposition into Irish law. That will bridge a gap which has been a cause of considerable problems in the context of the suggestion that there was a democratic deficit. I believe any such deficit is now being addressed. Under this provision the Houses of the Oireachtas will have an opportunity, before decisions are made, to influence the outcome and will have an opportunity to comment on the outcome afterwards. In that regard, a major bridge has been crossed. That opportunity was not available to the Houses of the Oireachtas in the past, except in an informal way. It has now been formally put in place.Everybody should be encouraged to express their views. We have to challenge each other's views and sometimes our own. One of the arguments advanced by those on the "No" side is that we will be suddenly beset by hungry hordes from eastern Europe who have nowhere else to go. That is most misleading and it is a sadly mistaken view, as evidenced by previous experience in relation to the accession of new member states including Ireland, Spain and Portugal. In no case was there any mass migration from one country to another. In any event, a central concept of Europe is to ensure that the quality of life and the standard of living of all the people in the Union is improved. The emphasis is on raising standards rather than depressing economies. That is the positive view of the situation.However, there are other agendas. Some people do not want the European Union to expand. Some people on the "No" side have said it is possible for five countries to join without any changes such as those envisaged in the Nice treaty. That may be true but the reality is that there are more than five countries ready to join. Who wishes to tell the other five or six countries that they will have to wait? It is in the interest of the Irish people and the future of our economy that we vote "Yes". Otherwise, the train will have left the station and we will not be on it. We will have relinquished control over its direction of travel and the stations at which it will stop. We joined the European Union not only to gain from it, but also to contribute to it.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I welcome the opportunity to support the Bill which is before the House to advance the cause of Ireland's involvement in the European Union through the Treaty of Nice. It is worthwhile recalling the background to the formation of the European Union, including the difficulties which emerged from the Second World War and the political, economic and social stability which the European Coal and Steel Community and the Treaty of Rome gave to Europe at a time when the political situation was very fragile. That is often underestimated by later generations who have enjoyed the fruits of economic success through membership of the European Union since Ireland's accession in 1973.Political stability is crucial to economic success. In central and eastern Europe, there are many examples of instability creating serious economic difficulties, migration and lack of social cohesion for the people of those countries. It would be remiss of us not to spell out the message to the Irish people, in the context of this referendum, that a "Yes" vote is a vote for stability of the European Union. That aspect should not be taken for granted. Many people feel that the accession of ten new member states to the European Union will resolve the instability which has existed in central and eastern European countries over the last ten to 12 years. Russia has just progressed through a small part of its democratisation and nobody should underestimate the level of instability that still exists in the former states of the former Soviet Union. Russia is far from being able to stand on its own two feet and instability will continue in that part of the world. In that context, it is even more important the EU has countries that are members and friends on its borders which can honour the stability pacts which will form part of the membership and accession rules so important to the enlargement of the EU.History shows that Ireland has been a huge net beneficiary of the EU since 1973. Many of the people who campaigned for a "No" vote in 1972 have never admitted how wrong they were in terms of the level of employment creation and that, far from our culture being subsumed into a wider European culture, our cultural identity is stronger than ever as demonstrated by the wider appreciation of our music and arts. The low taxation regime, the export markets and the opportunities for job creation that have been given to our business community and from which workers have benefited are unparalleled in our history. Europe has been a tremendous contributor to the low tax regime as well as the market penetration we have achieved for our business products in the last 30 years.The Tánaiste mentioned that if, in 1973, larger countries like France and Germany had vetoed Ireland, there would have been great disappointment and anger that we could not join just because they did not wish to grow the EU and bring Ireland on board. Had it not been for larger countries such as Germany, and its former Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, the idea of smaller countries having a major say in the development of the EU would not have developed. The "No" campaign gives the impression that if one is small and part of a big club one has no influence, but that depends largely on oneself and one's negotiating capacity. It also depends on the attitude of the larger states that have greater influence and history has shown that those larger countries have been more than willing to bring forward positive measures to assist smaller countries like Ireland in the context of the EU, particularly Germany. Indeed, Germany pays the piper in relation to the financial aspects of the EU and has been more than generous to the Irish economy, has contributed to its success and has assisted in vital national interests brought forward at Council of Ministers meetings.Enlargement of the EU will happen anyway. The Treaty of Nice proposes to change the rules to improve the cumbersome situation that pertains with ten applicant states. It proposes to change the way the business of the EU is carried out in order to make it more efficient. All our constituents recognise the unwieldy uncertainty about the way decisions are made and their impact on the ordinary citizen. One of the few complaints I have is that the Single Market is not seen to be beneficial to the consumer. The many EU directives issued regarding competition law, business regulations or farming regulations are not seen to be palatable or consumer friendly to citizens. The Government can do more to ensure the consumer has more information and greater opportunity. It should create less bureaucracy and more user-friendly policies that are promulgated at national level to implement the spirit of the EU directives as they impact on us.If we want more employment and market opportunities, we should vote "Yes", otherwise we will lose friends in Europe, certainly among the applicant countries, their peoples and governments. We should support it not only to make the EU larger and more politically stable but also to allow Ireland to continue to be a major player in the EU and benefit from it as we have done since 1973.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	8	As a young Member, it is appropriate that I speak on the treaty as it represents the future of my generation. Two generations in Ireland have accepted with open hands the benefits of Europe, including farmers in terms of the CAP and workers in terms of social charters. They have welcomed the massive injection of Structural Funds from which all generations have benefited. As we approach a major crossroads in the future of European affairs we seem to be reluctant for various reasons to go forward.As a young man and a councillor in June 2001, I decided to vote "Yes" but I was not sure I was right. Over the past 12 months, I have come to realise I was right and I am happy to take the jump now. I urge the people of Ireland to vote "Yes" to the Treaty of Nice, to take a step into a new and enlarged Europe which will give us more opportunity than pitfalls. Joining the EU in the first place gave the people of Ireland great opportunity. From what my parents and elders have told me, life certainly improved for them so I see no reason why an enlarged Europe will not bring even greater opportunities for us.Many of the benefits have been highlighted by many in this debate including those advocating a "No" vote. Ireland, as a country, a nation and an economy, has jumped in leaps and bounds in the last three decades. Sadly, not everyone has benefited from the improved status and well-being but that is due to poor management and an ineffective Government. This must change but it is not a reason to vote "No" to the Treaty of Nice.The reasons people are wavering on making a decision are widely varied so much work needs to be done to clarify the issues over the coming weeks. Many people have been fed untruths or exaggerated fears on the subject. This debate should help provide the correct information. The people have genuine fears that bad news might follow if the Treaty of Nice is passed. It will not, but the justified fears come from a lack of trust which has been fuelled by the aftermath of the general election. A long list of bad news has appeared from nowhere and, although I do not wish to dwell on it, the Government has a great deal to answer for. I ask the people to heed our party leader, Deputy Enda Kenny, who said that a "Yes" vote on the Treaty of Nice is not a vote for the Government, it is a vote for a strong economy, new opportunities and a secure future, amongst other things.As I said in a speech in Navan last week, my decision to vote "Yes" to the Treaty of Nice is simple and logical. I have listened to the pros and cons and, in my opinion, the pros carry more weight than the cons because the pros are definite whereas the cons are maybes. By voting "Yes", we will definitely become part of a larger Europe with larger markets and more opportunities and will definitely have a stronger and more respected voice in Europe as well as happier neighbours among the applicant states who will want to do business with Ireland and visit as tourists and spend money here. They will resent us if we vote "No". The cons are based on maybes. We might lose out on Structural Funds, we might get less money for our farmers, we might lose a European commissioner at some stage for a couple of years, but it is up to us, by using our strong voice to make use of the definites and banish the maybes.I take my lead on this from my friends in Meath who have become totally European in their thinking from their travels, the Internet, cheap international flights and the breaking down of borders. My friends have made contacts in the countries that wish to join us – a right they have earned. After much soul searching, I cannot come up with one plausible reason or practical excuse when I meet these people as to why our answer should be "No". Those in the "No" camp can sabre-rattle and scaremonger but they have not come up with one plausible reason for people to vote "No" and, to take the example of the Good Friday Agreement, I ask the "No" camp to demonstrate what would replace the Treaty of Nice. They can enjoy their moment, they have had their fun but let us now put hearts and heads together, look at the bigger picture and think laterally and not just about the next election. Think of "Sergei" from Poland, "Natasha" from Hungary, "Antonio" from Croatia. Will those in the "No" camp meet these people and explain to them what they are trying to sell to us? It is time to cop on and get real. Let us pull together on this. In Europe we stand united – without it, where are we?Last December, I visited Berlin. While I was there I went to visit the little museum at Checkpoint Charlie. I was only 12 or 13 years of age when the Berlin Wall came down and the effect it had on people and the division it caused did not hit home with me until I visited the museum. The wall itself has vanished and the intimidation, fear and inhumanity have been replaced by hope. Many people look to us for hope now. Who are we to lay the foundation of another wall by delaying enlargement? By voting "Yes" we will help to put walls and iron curtains firmly into the annals of history.Cuireadh an díospóireacht ar athló.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	15	Just short of 30 years ago Ireland joined the European Economic Community. Some 50 years after independence, we were still widely seen as an adjunct to Britain and not without some reason. Most of our trade was with Britain, our currency was sterling and we had no control or influence over our interest rates. Our industry was very basic. We were hugely dependent on agriculture but could do nothing to influence international agriculture prices.We had little enough influence in European or world affairs. We had no European Commissioner and there were few, if any, Irish people working in European institutions. There were no international meetings in Ireland. The North had descended into violence and disorder, but there was no prospect that Ireland could bring an American, European or international role to play to help build peace.Within the country women were banned from the workplace if they got married. Equal pay for equal work was just a dream and we had no equality legislation. Our environment had no effective legal protection. Our cities and towns were smoggy. It could take two or more years to get a telephone having paid a deposit. For decades motorways had been built in Britain, France, Germany and Italy but in Ireland we just had a few miles of dual carriageway and many humpback bridges, bad bends and accident blackspots.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Exactly. People of my age and older will remember being taught in school that Ireland was "a small peripheral country with no natural resources". The lesson of geography was that we were poor and peripheral.Our history lesson, however, since 1973 has taught us the opposite. Politically, socially and economically Ireland has gained much from European membership. In short, one could say it was then that we had we had no money, power or influence. We have been there already and things have changed for the better in the 30 years of our EU membership.When we were accepted for membership of the EEC and we voted strongly in favour of it, we started a long-term journey of development and progress in all areas of national life. It was a great act of vision for Irish voters in 1973 to reject the "poor and peripheral" destiny for Ireland. It was real leadership on the part of two Taoisigh, Seán Lemass and Jack Lynch, to bring over a decade of hard work since our first application for membership to a successful conclusion.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	19	Yes, but I am talking about the two Taoisigh involved in our application to join. I am happy to acknowledge the important role Dr. FitzGerald played as Foreign Minister and in other respects.We started to build the economic and political standing we have today. We moved out from the shadow of Britain in terms of trade, our currency and international relations to the point where we could reach a fully mature relationship with Britain in the Good Friday Agreement, which is very much in the context of equal EU membership.We built more of a role for ourselves in the world, our economy developed and we diversified trade. We built up jobs that rode on the crest of international markets rather than struggled in the backwater of a dependent relationship with Britain. We developed our education, skill levels, infrastructure, environment and social protection. We began the long march towards real equality for women in the workplace and in a wider society. We found again that we were a European nation in a fully developed sense with balanced economic and political relationships across Europe. We took our place, a natural place, at the European table where decisions were worked through and shared for all member states of the European Union.In all this we showed we had not forgotten that in each millennium this island of ours was never locked and inward looking. We were always fully open and European – in pre-history, before Christ and after the Romans. The Irish were at the court of Charlemagne. We were part of the European theatre in the centuries of political revolution. Our struggle for independence inspired others across the British empire and beyond.If we had lost a way to express this heritage fully by the late 1960s, then our membership of the European Union brought us back to where we have always belonged, the heart of Europe. Since then we have played our role in building European institutions to resolve the protracted conflicts of the 20th century, culminating in the fall of the Berlin Wall and the Iron Curtain.As we all know, the last 30 years have not been a story of smooth progress onwards and upwards for our economy. We messed up our economy in a big way in the 1980s. Membership of the European Union did not guarantee success. It did not save us from ourselves and it never could. It was never the case that the European Union would run the country for us. It still does not and it will not do so now or under the Nice treaty.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	22	I am not assigning blame to anyone. I am talking about all of us as a nation.We have key areas of national policy where we have to take responsibility for getting it right or wrong ourselves – for example, the national finances and tax and health policies. Fortunately, we have recovered from our self-imposed economic failure after many difficult years. The European Union was a great help to us while we corrected our national finances, worked hard to be competitive and brought in the right tax and employment policies to encourage investment and enterprise.The process of recovery from mass emigration and mass unemployment was faster and more sustainable by virtue of the help we received from the European Union. Our full and active membership of the EU has meant that we can attract jobs and investment. We are part of the European Single Market. We helped shape the rules of that market and we share its benefits and responsibilities. Without it Ireland would never have seemed as attractive a place for international investment and Irish businesses would never have been able to grow jobs and look forward as they have since 1973.It is very difficult to underestimate the importance of our decision 30 years ago to join the EEC, as it was known then. It has always been important for us to actively engage with Europe and the people chose to do so in three subsequent referenda. The "No" result in last year's referendum on the Treaty of Nice, however, called into question the direction of our development since 1973. It would have been wrong to reject, ignore or undermine the fact of that result and the Government has listened to what it meant.Many people did not vote last year. I accept that they may have felt they did not have enough information to make an informed decision and that they believed the Government should have done more to give them real reasons to vote "Yes". Some people may have voted "No" for that reason and I accept my part of the responsibility for that, along with the responsibility to act in the national interest in response to it. As political leaders, members of the Government were reminded by last year's vote not to presume that our proposals will receive the assent of those we serve. The message sent out by last year's result has been received in this House, in Government Buildings, in Brussels and in other European capitals.A majority of a minority voted last year against a treaty designed to extend membership of the EU to more countries and to offer to them some of the opportunities we have enjoyed for 30 years. I do not think the Irish people wanted to say "No" to new member states last year, as this would involve turning away countries that suffered for 45 years under internal totalitarian rule, dominated by an external superpower and prevented from acting in accordance with their European heritage. I do not think we wanted to say "No" to the jobs and investment that arise from our participation in the Single Market. I do not believe we intended to say "No" to our influence in the community of nations that is the European Union. I do not consider that Irish people want a sudden about turn in our European role. If we reject the Nice treaty again we will, in effect, reject all these things. This is how such a decision would be viewed among our fellow member states, among applicant countries and among international investors in Ireland.The job of bringing jobs to Ireland will be harder if we vote "No". Some on the "No" side claim this is not the case or that it ought not to be so, but the world will make up its own mind. Whether we like it or not, a rejection of the treaty will be perceived negatively rather than positively for Ireland.A "No" vote would be an immediate slap in the face for applicant countries. Analysis conducted for clients of Citigroup, one of the world's largest banks, recently found that a "No" vote would be damaging for applicant countries, as it would begin to cost them millions from the day after the referendum. This is not a theoretical damage that would begin later, but right away and in real money terms. The cost of borrowing would increase for such countries, as investors would see their delay in joining the EU as making their government bonds less attractive. Analysts for Citigroup pointed out that applicant countries would be delayed from joining the EU until 2006 or 2007, instead of 2004. This view outside Ireland contrasts with that of "No" campaigners here that a "No" vote would not delay or stop new member states joining. The latter view is simply wrong and is not accepted by the applicant countries. It is not shared by observers who make their living by judging international markets.The Citigroup analysts believe a "No" vote would be bad for Europe. They told their influential audience that a "No" vote would be viewed as another example of the EU's failure to pursue difficult matters, a failure which has usually been negative for the euro. The sum total of a "No" vote would be a reduction in new jobs for Ireland, a delay and an immediate cost for applicant countries and a negative signal to send to Europe. This would not represent a great achievement for Ireland. We can hope that analysts will not be hard on us and that they will talk about things other than money, but we know that they will as that is the way of the world. We can choose to work against the world or to make it work for us. A "Yes" vote will be a decisive confirmation that we want to make the world work for us, rather than trying to work against it.In the forthcoming referendum, we can choose to tell the countries of central and eastern Europe to wait to join the EU while we try to ensure Europe does things our way. We can try to assure them that the wait will not be long or costly, but that would not be fair, responsible or credible. By 1973, Ireland had waited more than ten years to be allowed into the EEC, as a result of a political row between France and the United Kingdom. We had done nothing wrong, we had offended no one and we were not a threat to anyone. Our path was blocked and our progress held up, however, for reasons that had nothing to do with us and were outside our control. It was unfair and it cost us at least ten years of development. Are we willing to do the same to applicant countries today? I cannot believe that we want to impose on them the frustration of the delay that was imposed on us. They have done nothing wrong, they have not offended us and they are not a threat to us. How can we impose on them a cost and a delay for reasons that have nothing to do with them? There is no point in pretending that would not be the real effect of a "No" vote. When they eventually join, what will we say to them as we try to develop trade, political and cultural links? I do not believe, as I have said, that the people want to do this to the countries waiting to join the Union.Ireland has changed and grown since 1973, just as the EU has changed and grown. We have worked in a Community that has grown to 15 member states. The voting rules have changed, the Single Market has been brought in and the euro has been introduced. We have lost nothing and gained a great deal as a result of these changes. There have been rule changes before, new member states have joined and new markets have opened. There have been constant challenges in pursuing our interests in managing the Common Agriculture Policy, as well as regional, monetary and social policies. The changes brought about by the Nice treaty will not change fundamentally our ability to secure our interests in Europe while contributing to the welfare of all. They certainly will not wipe out our national identity. After 30 years of EU membership, has Ireland ceased to be identifiably Irish? Has the Netherlands lost its identity during almost 50 years of EU membership? Has Portugal ceased to be Portugal since 1986?Eurosceptics and "No" campaigners claim that the EU is a conspiracy by the large powers, Germany, France and the United Kingdom, that wish to dominate all other member states. They argue that the Nice treaty is their method of finally getting their way, but this is simply not true. Why have France and Germany waited since the 1950s to lord it over everyone else? Why have they given up their second commissioner? Why do they accept voting weights that are under weight relative to their large populations? Why do they share decision making with us at all? Is it not absurd to claim that after 30 years of successful membership, we are about to lose our identity and succumb to the power of large states? It is absurd and wrong. It cannot be defended by reference to the contents of the treaty.I could continue for a long time refuting the false claims and myths put about by those urging a "No" vote. Fundamentally, however, people are looking for positive reasons to vote "Yes". They want to hear from the Government why we should approve the changes in the Nice treaty. They want to hear about the real consequences of voting "Yes" or "No". They do not want exaggerations or myths. In effect, voters are asking for reasons to vote "Yes" and saying that they will think about them seriously. I can give three such reasons.First, a "Yes" vote will help us create more and better jobs. Ratification of the treaty will help jobs, but a failure to do so will hinder job creation. A bigger Europe will mean more opportunities for employment, trade and investment, if we continue to work hard and stay competitive. It sends a positive signal internationally. Second, a "Yes" vote would be a boost for others in Europe who were denied for decades the opportunities and freedoms we take for granted. The hallmark of Irish people is hospitality and generosity. At the heart of our identity are the values of solidarity and fair play. We have never sought to progress at the expense of others, we have never blocked progress for other people and we have never refused to help. Third, if we vote "Yes" we can make the EU work for Ireland and for Europe in the rules agreed in the Nice treaty. We have nothing to fear from these changes; we have nothing to lose and much to gain. We have made a fair and balanced deal with other member states to protect our national position in key areas such as taxation, voting weights, equality between members as regards commissioners and protection of the rights of member states that are not involved in enhanced co-operation. The protection of our military neutrality has been made clear. In this referendum, the Government is offering the people the ability to make absolutely certain that only they can decide if Ireland is to join a European defence programme at any time.As we face this momentous decision, I urge people to inform themselves by listening to the debate and by reading the information. I urge women, particularly, to think of the progress that has been made and the help we will continue to get from our membership of the European Union. I ask the electorate to reflect on where it wants Ireland to go after 30 years of membership. I call on voters to trust their instincts for an open, confident and caring Ireland and to vote "Yes".

Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go mbeidh an Stát ábalta conradh Nice a dhaingniú i dtreo is gur féidir líon na stát san Aontas Eorpach a mhéadú go luath. Tá sé iontach tábhachtach go gcaitheann saoránaigh a vóta sa reifreann seo. Tá súil agam go nglacfaidh muintir na hÉireann le conradh Nice an uair seo le tromlach mór. Déanfaidh sé maitheas dúinn mar bhallstát den AE má labharfaidh an tír le guth láidir aontaithe ag glacadh leis an gconradh; ní amháin go ndéanfaidh sé maitheas do mhuintir na hÉireann ach déanfaidh sé maitheas do na stáit atá ag iarraidh theacht isteach san AE. D'éirigh go maith linn san AE agus is féidir linn an seans céanna a thabhairt do thíortha eile.This is an important debate dealing with legislation that will allow the people to revisit the ratification of the Nice treaty, which they rejected by way of referendum last year. It is most important that there is a high turnout in the forthcoming referendum, that as many citizens as possible make a statement on this treaty which has wide implications, not alone for the future of this State but the future of the applicant countries and the European Union. It is incumbent on all EU citizens to inform themselves as comprehensively as possible on the Nice treaty and its contents.It has been the trend that Irish people have cast their votes on EU treaties in line with the views of the politicians they support. This was clearly not the position in the previous referendum. There was a widespread view that the implications of the treaty needed to be more fully explained. The major responsibility falls on the Government but it is also the duty of all politicians to inform themselves and the electorate of the true facts surrounding the treaty.The debate must also take an overview of the strategic interests of this member state, the EU and the applicant countries. Votes should not be cast in the context of narrow sectional interests. Some people on the "No" side hold the view that if a "No" vote is carried on this occasion, things will carry on as before. That will not be the case. Neither should the referendum on the Nice treaty be used as a vehicle to punish the Government for the deceit that was a feature of its general election campaign. There will be an opportunity to do that in the local and European elections in 2004 and in the forthcoming general election, whenever it takes place. In this referendum we are being asked to make a statement on the national interest. Strong feelings which may exist about issues unrelated to the treaty should be put aside.While subsidiarity has been for a long time a buzz word of the European Union, there is a communication gap between the institutions of the Union and its citizens. This is an unhealthy situation and, if not rectified, will seriously inhibit progress. The institutions of the European Union have an urgent responsibility in this regard. The European Union Bill produced by the Labour Party provides the basis for much greater democratic accountability for Ministers attending the Council of Ministers.As a result of enlargement and inward migration from central and eastern European countries, a perceived threat to employment and pay and conditions has arisen as an issue. It is regrettable this issue has been introduced by the "No" side. It is reassuring that the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is satisfied that there is no significant threat to employment or pay and conditions. Mr. David Begg, General Secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, is on record as saying it is unlikely that large numbers would move to Ireland from central or eastern Europe. He went on to say that research has shown that Germany would be the prime destination for 37% and Austria for 24% of would-be emigrants. The popular potential destinations for Poles and Hungarians are the United States, Canada and Australia. Mr. Begg also pointed out that surveys showed that short and medium term labour migration would be more common than permanent emigration. Two thirds of all potential emigrants declared that they did not want to leave their country on a permanent basis. Congress is on public record as saying that Ireland needs a coherent immigration policy that would match the number of people coming here with the economy's capacity to support them. David Begg stated that fears about immigration could not be brushed aside but the important question of a coherent immigration policy should not be confused with negligible migration from accession countries. It should not be, he warned, used as a weapon in the Nice treaty debate.In August 2001 I was a member of a parliamentary delegation led by the then Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Pattison, to Slovakia. We spent a good deal of our time explaining that in spite of the rejection of the referendum to ratify the Nice treaty, the Irish people were not opposed to enlargement of the European Union. In turn the Slovakians impressed upon us the great efforts they were making to be ready for membership of the EU. There are similarities between Slovakia now and Ireland of 30 years ago. Slovakia, like the other applicant countries, has much to gain from EU membership, but so too does the European Union.There is no doubt that enlargement will happen if Ireland rejects the treaty for a second time. The European Union will find another way. If this is the case, however, how will the applicant countries look at us and how will the other member states react? There would be a loss of goodwill towards Ireland that would take a long time to get over.During the summer of 1972, I spent weeks campaigning for a "No" vote in the referendum on EU entry. A great fear on the left at the time was the danger to the future of our traditional industries. I was on the losing side but unfortunately those fears were realised in significant part. In spite of that, however, I have long been convinced that membership of the European Union has contributed to social and economic development that would have been impossible had Ireland remained in isolation. I do not accept that voting for the ratification of the Nice treaty is damaging to the national interest.The greatest monument to the European Union is that since its inception there has not been a war within its borders, in contrast to the two major wars that took place in Europe in the course of the first 45 years of the last century. There is, however, terrorist activity, organised crime, violence and a worrying level of fascism within the borders of the European Union. For all that, the potential to deal with crime on a co-operative, cross-border basis, through the EU, presents the best possibility of success. Those of us on the left must focus on enlargement of the Union and press for policies that provide for sustainable development.Ireland should make a strong, confident statement taking into account the fact that we have been successful within the EU. That success will continue and now we have the opportunity to provide for potential member states to benefit in the way we have done. There are many red herrings in this debate and people have strong views on issues that are not directly relevant but, in terms of enlargement, there is only one honourable and proper way to go.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I am glad of the opportunity to address the House on the legislation to enable the holding of the referendum on the Nice treaty which will come before the people shortly.I cannot let pass the statements made by the Tánaiste in the opening stages of whose speech we saw revisionist history. When talking about the successes of the European Union it is remarkable that any Tánaiste could produce a script which neglects to mention probably the greatest European that this country has ever produced, Garret Fitzgerald. It is sad that she should address the matter in that way going on to say, "We messed up our economy in a big way in the 1980s."  If I recall rightly, Deputy Harney came into this House under a certain flag in 1977, sweeping in under the great proposals and propaganda that were to brush aside taxes on cars and all sorts of things. Even neutral economists have said it was there that the problems of our economy started. I do not accept that absolutely because there is a lot more to it with, for example, demographic trends contributing to what happened. For the Tánaiste to glibly say that all our problems started in the 1980s – and she was part of it – is revisionism gone mad.

It is important that Ireland ratifies the Nice treaty and I hope the people will come out in their droves this time and back further progress within Europe. The EU movement has been a tremendous success. Over the past 30 years while Ireland has been a member we have seen major changes. Our role as peacekeepers has extended, our prosperity has improved and there have been dramatic changes in employment and unemployment while the UK market upon which we used to be so dependent, now represents just a fraction of our total exports. That has made for tremendous differences.The euro is now being used by 12 countries which is tremendous from the point of view of doing business. I remember reading a report of a fictionalised journey around Europe by someone who imagined starting the trip with £100 and going to each of the European capitals starting from Dublin where they changed the money into lire before going on to Rome. At the end of the imaginary trip when the money was converted back into punts there was £6 left, without having spent anything in any of the capitals, the money having been lost through foreign exchange charges. That was a huge burden on doing business within Europe which the introduction of the euro has changed. It is very good for business. Business people trading abroad have to fix prices between six and ten months in advance and the euro has been a stabilising factor in those exchanges, which has made a significant difference. It has solidified many jobs which is worthwhile in itself.Deputy Parlon, from his previous incarnation, will be aware of the impact the EU has had on the environment, particularly on the farming community. In some ways farmers would say it has been negative, but overall, in the context of caring for our environment, the EU has had a colossal impact for the better. I heard people talking about special areas of conservation where there were difficulties, but those difficulties were created by the Government which allowed such huge areas to be included and failed to negotiate on our behalf. Let us not blame the Europeans for things that are not their responsibility.At a public meeting called to complain about the difficulties with kerbside petrol pumps, which were to be abandoned, I remember a former Deputy blaming Europe. They are still going to be abandoned incidentally. Europe had nothing to do with it; it was an initiative taken for good health and safety reasons by the Government. It is the Government of the day that negotiates what happens in Europe and what is agreed to, so let us blame it if it does not do the job.The way forward is that when major negotiations, such as those for the Nice treaty, are going on, there should be far more input from this House prior to the event. What happens now is that the Minister goes off, negotiates and comes back with a fait accompli. There should be a lot more discussion with interested parties and I hope the revamped European committee of this House will have a far greater input and say into what happens whereby we can reassure the people that things can improve.Another great myth is that we are going to be gobbled up by Europe and that our language and culture will be destroyed and lost forever. At what stage in our history have the Irish language and culture been as strong as they are now? More gaelscoileanna have been opened in the last ten years than in all the time before, while we have seen the growth of Scór and other competitions which have done a lot for culture and heritage. That has nothing to do with suppression by Europe, in fact there are European funds to support such initiatives which have been very good for us.The previous speaker mentioned being in Slovenia and meeting people there. I was in Poland four or five years ago and I met many people who were extremely anxious to have access to Europe as quickly as possible. They saw tremendous benefits for themselves and their people in the opening up of European markets to their output. When you look at their farming methods it is obvious that there will be great improvements in what they can do when that happens, which I welcome. It is only fair that we should facilitate giving them a leg up. I was more recently in Cyprus which is a troubled country with a firm divide between the Greeks and the Turks. Many people in Cyprus, particularly in the Irish community, feel let down by Ireland.I am tempted to say that the Government should call for a "No" vote because it is making such a mess of things and its hypocrisy regarding health charges and increased taxation is turning people off. I spoke with a teacher the other day who is absolutely pro-European and a historian who said he will be voting "No" on this occasion despite voting "Yes" the last time because nothing has happened with regard to benchmarking and supervision in schools. The Government has made no effort to resolve those issues.In Johannesburg the Taoiseach advocated greater overseas aid and asked other countries to follow Ireland's example in this area, yet he had recently cut the overseas aid budget by €32 million. That is hypocrisy of the highest order. It is disgusting and will rebound on the Government.

In advocating with all the passion I can muster a "Yes" vote in the forthcoming referendum, it is unnecessary to reiterate the compelling arguments made in the House for a "Yes" vote by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, on 4 September 2002 and the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 10 September 2002. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs said of the treaty: "If ratified, it will help to transform Europe's economic and political landscape to the advantage of us all."  The Taoiseach yesterday set out in great detail the economic benefits and financial transfers that have accrued to Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs also correctly reminded us: "Since the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s, the democracies of central and eastern Europe have placed their accession to the European Union as their highest priority."The partition of Europe by an iron curtain after the Second World War completely distorted the true nature of Europe. The reality is that Prague, Budapest and Warsaw are at the very heart of Europe not just in a physical sense, but also in the true historical sense. The era of Walesa, Gorbachev and Havel saw that curtain torn down. The Treaty of Nice is very important because it consigns that curtain to the bin of history.Those Members of the House proposing a "No" vote completely omitted to refer to the desire of the applicant states of central and eastern Europe to join the European Union. If, as the "No" advocates would have us believe, the Treaty of Nice is bad for Europe, why would these countries be so anxious to join the EU? It is presumptuous, if not insulting, to suggest the governments of these countries would advise their peoples to sign up to a bad deal.In his speech to the Dáil on 4 September 2002, Deputy Gormley stated: "The Nice debate ought to be about the future direction of Europe."  I and many others agree that there needs to be considerable debate about the future direction of Europe. There is a very large question to be addressed as to how far we should pool our sovereignty to secure common objectives. However, as Deputy Gormley knows well, this is not what the Nice treaty is about. I have no doubt that the European convention chaired by the former French President, Valerie Giscard d'Estaing, will bring forward ideas and proposals to initiate such a debate on the future of Europe. It would be a travesty, however, if countries such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland and others had to await its outcome given that it may last many more years and its conclusions are uncertain. These countries require and are entitled to be at the very heart of Europe.Deputy Ó Caoláin of Sinn Féin is still wider of the mark. He stated: "The Treaty of Nice is not about enlargement."  I doubt the 12 applicant countries would agree with that statement. He also stated: "It reduces the democratic power of the people in each state because it reduces the sovereignty of the nation state."  This statement sounds like 19th century nationalism. The point the Deputy entirely misses is that the Irish people have, in a series of European referenda, agreed to limit our sovereignty to advance a common purpose in Europe. He may not be aware that where there is a conflict between the Irish Constitution, Bunreacht na hÉireann, and European law on matters relevant to the European Union, European law prevails. While this is a reduction in sovereignty, it is one the Irish people have willingly accepted as a means to advance a common aim. Deputy Ó Caoláin further stated that the treaty "must be revisited and renegotiated". This is political naiveté or jingoism at its best.The political reality is that the Treaty of Nice was a very difficult treaty to negotiate. It involved long, difficult and complex negotiations and compromises between the existing member states. Were the treaty to be unravelled, one might never get the genie into the bottle again. Perhaps this is what Sinn Féin really wants.It is time for both the Green Party and Sinn Féin to come clean on the Nice treaty. Both parties say they are in favour of enlargement, but in reality they are prepared to derail an agreed enlargement process for their own ends. They say it is bad for Ireland and Europe, yet this is a treaty to which many of the countries in the historical heart of Europe are eager to subscribe. They should come clean and stop playing political games with the future of Europe. This is not the time for any political party or individual to seek to advance their own domestic agenda at the expense of the Irish people or the people of Europe.
#EoinRyan	unknown-#EoinRyan-party	unknown-#EoinRyan-dob	unknown-#EoinRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	30	The Nice treaty is about ensuring that the enlargement of the European Union can take place in a structured and streamlined manner. Decision making procedures in Europe have to be changed to accommodate a European Union comprising up to 27 member states. There are currently 15 members of the European Union and it is likely that ten further applicant countries seeking to join will conclude their accession negotiations with the Union before the end of the year.When the European Economic Community was founded in 1957, decision making procedures were put in place for a founding community of only six member states. These decision making structures need to be modernised to guarantee the European Union can operate effectively into the future. If the old structures remain in place, legislative logjams will arise. This is the reason reform of the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is now being addressed. As the Minster for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, stated last week in the House, the Nice treaty "is a fair, reasonable and balanced deal" which protects the interests of smaller member states. In the context of the reform of the European Commission, Ireland and the other small member states did particularly well.From 2004 onwards the five larger member states, namely, France, Germany, Britain, Spain and Italy, will lose their right to nominate a second member of the European Commission. In real terms, this means Ireland has the same rights of representation on the European Commission as the larger member states. Even after the European Union grows in size beyond 27 member states, Ireland's position on the European Commission will be distributed on the basis of strict equality and rotation between larger and smaller member states.The European Commission is an important institution as it controls the operation of the Common Fisheries Policy, the Common Agricultural Policy, the Common Transport Policy and competition matters. Those opposing the Nice treaty are trying to put around the line that we are losing our right to nominate a member of the European Commission. Nothing could be further from the truth. The only people losing a commissionership are the five larger member states and thereafter a system of equality will operate. This is certainly a good deal from the perspective of Ireland and the smaller member states.Majority voting in a range of economic and social matters has been in operation in Europe for some time. Under the Amsterdam treaty, the European Parliament received the power of co-decision in environmental, transport, consumer protection and public health issues as well as on employment matters and social affairs.On the environmental issue, time and again the Green Party returns from Europe and reminds us of various legislation and decisions made in Europe to protect our environment, yet it opposes Europe during every single referendum campaign. I do not want to get into the policy of Sinn Féin which is one of complete political opportunism. The party does not even believe what it says.

That is the sole preserve of each Government, which is as it should be. When negotiations on the Nice treaty took place two years ago in France, there was little appetite among the EU leaders to take away any powers regarding taxation from member state Governments. Who is in the best position to deal with taxation issues? The answer is clearly our national Government and local authorities. I firmly believe this will continue to be the case indefinitely because it is right.Another line put out by those who oppose the Nice treaty is that a vote for it will result in a possible loss of foreign direct investment to countries in eastern and central Europe. I point out to the opponents of the treaty that Ireland currently competes with countries such as France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Britain for foreign direct investment into Europe and we do extremely well.

It is in our national interest to support the provision of the Nice treaty because it will guarantee that enlargement of the European Union can proceed. Enlargement of the EU offers real opportunities for Irish business. As an exporting country we should embrace the new challenges and opportunities that have been presented to us. It is important that the Nice treaty referendum is carried out in a calm and reasoned manner, that people know exactly what they are voting for and that the issues are not obscured by the Opposition.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	41	I am pleased to have the opportunity to make a contribution in support of the Bill. The Nice treaty and European Union enlargement are in the interests of the Union. They are in the interests of the candidate countries and in our interests. I welcome the Government's decision to put a second referendum to the people.Some speakers referred to the low turnout in last year's referendum. The highest turnout for a referendum here was in 1937 when the draft Constitution was put to the people by Eamon de Valera and his Government. The next highest turnout, 70% of the voting public, was for the referendum on joining the European Union in 1971. It is regrettable that the turnout at the last referendum on the Nice treaty was as low as 34%. I hope an informed debate will ensure a much higher turnout and participation by the electorate in the forthcoming referendum. The only glimmer of hope I got from the last referendum was that 53% of voters in County Cavan voted in favour of the treaty. Apart from two Dublin constituencies I think it was the only country where the majority voted in favour of the treaty. I hope that vote will be replicated on this occasion.It is disappointing that there was a low turnout by the electorate for the referendum on the Good Friday Agreement in May 1998. That was the first opportunity for voters in the Thirty-two Countries to vote on the same issue on the same day, but in the Republic only 56.26% of the electorate turned out to vote. That is disappointing, particularly for me coming from Ulster.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	43	Hold it at the weekend. The day a referendum is held can be used as an excuse by some people not to vote. A referendum could be held any day of the week, but that would not encourage the large percentage of the electorate who do not to vote to vote.The European Union traces its origins to the signing by six countries of the Treaty of Paris in 1951, which established the European Coal and Steel Community. It took until 1973 for the first enlargement of the Community when Ireland, Britain and Denmark joined. Further expansions in 1981, 1986 and 1995 brought the Union to its current total of 15 member states. It can be argued that none of the previous enlargements matches the importance of the enlargement now in prospect, as 12 countries are in accession negotiations. Current indications are that ten new states may have concluded negotiations by the end of this year and entry in 2004 is a real possibility for them.The importance of this enlargement, however, is not in its scale. Fundamentally, it represents a historic moment for Europe, uniting the Continent peacefully for the first time on the basis of democracy and respect for fundamental human rights and the rule of law. Why are these countries so eager to join the European Union? Why have they made the sacrifices required in terms of economic restructuring and why are they prepared to abide by the disciplines of the Single Market and the single currency? The applicant states see in the European Union a political and economic opportunity to improve the quality of life of their citizens without sacrificing their independence.Sovereignty is not about saying "No". Rather it is about maximising our influence, creating better conditions for our employment prospects and trade and contributing to the international fight against international crime. The more isolated a country becomes the less genuine influence it can assert over its destiny. Outside the European Union, would Ireland have any control over matters such as duties on exports, investment opportunities for businesses, exchange rates or other international affairs? This is why the applicant states, which in general are the same size as our country, see the European Union as their best hope of protecting and guaranteeing real independence.I do not wish to suggest that the European Union is perfect. That is far from the case. It is easy to spot the flaws of the Union, but most institutions, local, national or international, have such failings. Politics is about achieving change and reform where required and preserving what works well. This is as true in Europe as it is in Ireland.I mentioned the origins and forthcoming enlargement of the Union. It was widely recognised before the Amsterdam treaty that reforms and changes were required to prepare a Union originally designed for six members to accommodate up to 27 member states. Some of these changes were agreed at Amsterdam, but it was generally recognised that further specific modifications would be required before further enlargement. The negotiation of the Nice treaty returned to these issues, which are generally described as those left over from Amsterdam. A balanced agreement, acceptable to all, was eventually agreed. The Nice treaty is of far more limited scope than the Amsterdam or Maastricht treaties, although the changes made are crucial in ensuring enlargement can proceed.Anti-Nice campaigners, particularly during the last referendum, focused on many red herrings, either making the false argument that Nice is not required for enlargement or saying that Nice compromises neutrality, even though it makes no change whatsoever on that front. Those who speak about the democratic deficit fail to acknowledge that if such a deficit exists, it is primarily located in this country and is our responsibility to overcome. Opponents speak of a loss of power or influence without indicating how a small country like Ireland could exert influence outside the European Union. I am pleased about the new arrangements made in the Oireachtas to ensure legislation is discussed in detail at the committee on European affairs and within this House and that there will also be briefings in advance of Council of Ministers meetings.While failure by this country to ratify the Nice treaty would be a problem for the European Union, ultimately it would be a more serious problem for this country. Many speakers focused rightly on the advantages that have accrued to this country since our accession in 1973. Earlier this morning the Tánaiste spoke about the lack of development in this country and the difficulties for our agricultural industry in obtaining markets. The Minister for Agriculture in the 1960s, Mr. Paddy Smith, was my predecessor in the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. During his time in the House he served for a period with the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. As a youngster I remember him speaking about the absolute frustration at Oireachtas level in regard to the lack of markets and export outlets for our agricultural products. Prior to 1973 the only place to which we could export our agricultural produce was Britain. What strength or negotiating capacity had any Minister going to Downing Street or Whitehall when he knew that if the British refused to take our produce there was nowhere else to go with it?That the situation has changed dramatically is because of the initiative and foresight of the people who decided that we should seek membership of the EEC. That membership has been extremely beneficial for this country. Previous speakers have outlined the advances in farming and the role of agribusiness in the development of rural Ireland and in the creation of jobs throughout the country. Are we to believe that we would have markets for any of these products outside the EU? The reality is that we would not. We do not want to revert to the day when we were dependent on one country for our exports. I would have thought that those who profess themselves interested in Irish independence and sovereignty would be wary of ever having to be dependent on one neighbour for the export of our produce to create jobs at home.The Nice treaty needs to be ratified to ensure that the European Union can be enlarged. Let us show the generosity other countries showed to us when we were allowed to gain membership of the EEC. Let the citizens of those countries who have been deprived of fundamental human rights and a proper standard of living get the opportunity to improve their lot by joining the EU.

Throughout this so-called debate we have had to beg and borrow time. This debate on the Nice treaty is a farce. My Green Party colleagues are grateful for the snippets we have been allocated by the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party. Thanks to a Government decision that flies in the face of democracy, the "Yes" side has been mainly talking to itself. As a result very few people outside this House are listening. One does not pay much attention to a soliloquy, but one might have become engaged in interesting and informative debate. That has not happened. The Government and most of the pro-Nice treaty Opposition contributors have failed to muster even a half-interesting or detailed contribution. We have not had a single argument in favour of the treaty, based on the treaty itself.

#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	46	There has been much talk of the historic advantages of European membership, with which I agree. However, it has mainly been talk about our alleged disengagement from the heart of the European Union. Mark my words, if there is any fallout from the rejection of this treaty again it will lie in the hands of this incompetent Government that has failed to respond adequately to the rising cost of labour vis-à-vis eastern European and Asian economies and has failed to provide the significant indigenous research and development investment required to compete at an added value level, something akin to that in a similar sized country such as Finland.It is the Government side that is scaremongering, not the "No" side. They are the ones sowing the seeds of disengagement. They are accusing Irish voters of being at worst selfish or at best misled or even stupid, yet they have rightly been accused by the pro-Nice treaty Opposition parties of not properly arguing Ireland's corner at the Nice Summit. These same parties think nothing of campaigning now for the very same flawed package – but that is another story. So far in this debate the "Yes" side speeches have been hugely repetitive, patronising, arrogant and sometimes wholly untrue. Look at the role model we have been given – a Taoiseach who five years ago promised a referendum on Partnership for Peace but has so far failed to deliver the goods, possibly because his mind has been on other things such as the national stadium farce. The Government did not deliver the goods at the Nice Summit and now is promising Armageddon if the Irish people do not submit to its bullying.As my Green Party colleagues said earlier in their contributions – in the scandalously short time they were allowed – the treaty is flawed from every angle: Article 133 on the facilitation of the global corporate agenda; Article 214 on the right to choose our own commissioner; Article 17 which incorporates the military provisions of the Western European Union into the EU; Article 25 which establishes the political and security committee which will direct military intervention, up to and including the aggressive waging of war and which envisages a role for NATO. I could go on.My colleagues have commented on qualified majority voting and enhanced co-operation and some of the areas where we will not have a veto anymore and where the Government could have argued our corner differently. In these so-called difficult negotiations it is a Government's responsibility to argue the case on behalf of its people; it did not do so. The people are now being asked to decide if they would like the treaty as a whole. If they do not like it they have to vote against it because they cannot pick things out of it. They did it the last time and they will do it the next time.The biggest red herring of the entire campaign is that a rejection of the Nice treaty will somehow prevent enlargement. The Green Party supports enlargement and would not be fighting this flawed treaty if enlargement was prevented. The Nice treaty's so-called protocol on enlargement has little to do with EU enlargement and a lot more to do with shifting the balance of power between the 15 member states. If one sticks closely to the wording of the Nice treaty on the matter, many of the enlargement issues are not even in the treaty itself but in annexes and declarations. The actual institutional conditions for EU membership for applicant countries are not even part of the treaty. The Nice treaty's protocol on enlargement relates only to the removal of the system of one commissioner per country once there are 27 member states. It actually abolishes the protocol on enlargement in the Amsterdam treaty which allows five new countries to join the EU without the institutional changes taking place and, as I pointed out earlier, with other changes more can join.It is worth looking at the Amsterdam treaty's protocol on enlargement on this issue. If I had €50 for every time a Member of this House on the pro-treaty side asked which five countries I would let in, I would be a millionaire. It is possible for more than five countries to join. I will not go into the detail now because of the limited time available. Article 1 states:At the date of entry into force of the first enlargement of the Union. the Commission shall comprise one national of each of the Member States, provided that, by that date, the weighting of the votes in the Council has been modified.That is all it says. If agreement can be reached on trade-offs between the loss of a second commissioner to the larger states for a gain in increased voting strength, then each state will have only one commissioner. It does not state anywhere that it has to be done. It just says that provided by that date, if the trade-off has been agreed, then it will be done. Article 2 states:At least one year before the membership of the European Union exceeds twenty, a conference of representatives of the governments of the Member States shall be convened to carry out a comprehensive review.Was the Nice Summit not a comprehensive review, whether the Nice treaty is accepted or not? The Treaty of Amsterdam does not stop more than five additional states joining the EU – the article provides for a "comprehensive review" and no more. Romano Prodi said there is no problem in having up to 20 members, after which one just has to add a clause of accession. Hopefully there will be a new review for the constitutional debate on the convention process of the envisaged new treaty in 2004. More time would have been required for me to go into the real nitty gritty of the treaty.I reiterate the Green Party's position in regard to the enlargement of the EU and our rejection of the notion that the Nice treaty opposes enlargement. We support EU enlargement and continue to support the decision of the Irish people to reject the Nice treaty. It is bad for democracy and bad for the future of the EU which is going in a certain direction with which we disagree. This treaty is facilitating that change of direction. We hope that the Irish people will once again disagree with it.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I am delighted to have the time to speak on this subject. Fine Gael has taken the lead in getting the "Yes" campaign off the ground in the forthcoming Nice referendum with the slogan: "Europe, yes, let's talk about it". It is a self-explanatory slogan and one that the Government did not adopt in the last campaign. The Irish electorate was taken for granted and, on 7 June 2001, it voted "No" in the Nice referendum by 53.87% to 46.13%. The turnout of 34.8% was the lowest for an EU referendum in Ireland.Let us talk about Europe. The "No" campaign argued, and continues to argue, that Ireland will lose money, power and influence and violate its military neutrality if the Treaty of Nice is ratified. It is a well-known fact that Ireland has been a major beneficiary from the EU. However, any future reduction in Structural and Cohesion Funds will have nothing to do with enlargement or the Nice treaty. It is a direct consequence of the success of the Irish Celtic tiger economy, which resulted in Ireland having the highest GDP per capita in the EU.In essence, the treaty is about enlargement. It adjusts and amends Europe's decision-making institutions, rules and procedures in anticipation of enlargement by up to ten countries. Member states have negotiated the Nice treaty to provide for the future growth of the EU and almost all of them have now ratified it. A decision by Ireland not to ratify it will be seen as a withdrawal by Ireland from the European consensus. Since we are relatively small and so trade-dependent, more than any other member state our economic prospects are tied to an intimate and central involvement in the EU.Leading international companies are currently investing in excess of €5 billion in new facilities in Ireland. We have every prospect of augmenting this level of investment within the next few years as long as we are seen to be outward looking, competitive and willing to take on every challenge that faces us. Our attractions will quickly wane if we are seen to be turning our back on the future of Europe.Last week in my own constituency, 400 job losses were announced at Tellabs in Shannon. Do we want to continue down this road? Decisions made in Brussels can have a profound influence on the environment for the future in investment and Ireland must be centrally involved in policy making if it is to influence thinking in this way.Ireland has received €35 billion from Brussels since 1973 or nearly €10,000 for every citizen in the country. Irish exports, upon which hundreds of thousands of jobs depend, have increased from €1 billion in 1973 to a staggering €93 billion today.Our interest rates and mortgage rates are at a record low. An enlarged EU will attract additional investment and increase the export opportunities for industry in Ireland. We should not forget that when we joined the EEC, our GDP was 58% of the EEC average, today it stands at 120%. Having availed of the benefits of membership, how can one justify pulling the ladder up behind us and denying other countries the same opportunities? We have a moral obligation to help the countries of central and eastern Europe successfully complete the transition to free market economies enjoying fundamental human, political and economic rights.Many of the citizens of these countries already feel, because of the long drawn out process that is involved, that the EU does not really want them. At the recent Seville Summit the Czech Prime Minister, Mr. Milos Zeman, said Ireland would be a selfish nation if it did not ratify the Nice treaty on this occasion. Our failure to do so in the past has provoked similar viewpoints within the EU. These uncertainties only play into the hands of reactionary political forces in their respective countries.With regard to the European Parliament, the Nice treaty extends the upper limit on the number of MEPs to 732 compared to the present number, which stands at 623. Ireland's present quota of 15 MEPs will fall to 12. If enlargement negotiations proceed successfully, this new allocation of seats will take place for the first time in the 2004 elections. However, the reduction in seat allocations will only be implemented to ensure that the limit of 732 seats is not breached and it will still leave Ireland with over twice as many MEPs per voter as Britain, Germany, France and Italy.Enlargement is also in our economic interest. It will bring another 100 million consumers into the Single Market, an ideal opportunity for our already successful exporters. It will also remove the threat of political instability on our borders. We could easily have had a repeat of what happened in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in other parts of eastern Europe. If this had occurred, EU member states would have had to invest substantial moneys in defence and policing their borders. The consequences of such a scenario would have impacted negatively on the EU economy as a whole.Furthermore, a successful enlargement will be a fulfilment of the vision of the founding fathers of the EU. Just as the EU in its present form symbolises an end to the bitter legacy of two world wars – France and Germany fought against each other and are now allies – a new enlarged Europe will bring an end to the legacy of the Cold War and ensure peace and stability.Ireland will not lose money due to enlargement. The present strength of the Irish economy places us at the top of the EU league and, as such, we qualify for less funding. Ireland's power and influence will remain strong in the Council, the Commission and the Parliament and in excess of what one would expect given its population. By ratifying the Nice treaty the Irish people will be supporting the creation of an even larger European Union at peace with itself and contributing to global peace.
#GerardMurphy	unknown-#GerardMurphy-party	unknown-#GerardMurphy-dob	unknown-#GerardMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	48	The European Union is a remarkable achievement by any standard and yet there is no real standard by which we can judge it. It is unique in having grown from two countries to 15 and is now planning its most significant enlargement to date.The accession of Greece in 1981 and Spain and Portugal in 1986 became possible only with the restoration of parliamentary democracy in these countries after long periods of dictatorship. The principle that European co-operation is founded on the rule of law and protection of fundamental rights was formally expressed in a joint declaration of the European Parliament and the Commission in 1977. It was later affirmed in the Treaty on European Union.Membership for these countries was seen as contributing in no small way to reinforcing their new democracies. Many of the 12 applicant countries are confident their membership, if allowed by the Irish people, will equally reinforce their new and fragile democracies.When Spain, Portugal arid Greece joined the original institutional arrangements were still able to cope, but with the inclusion of Austria, Finland and Sweden some cracks began to appear. It became clear at this stage that some institutional change would be necessary if expansion beyond western Europe was to happen.The Nice treaty is about facilitating this expansion to include 12 countries in central and eastern Europe. They wish to return to Europe and, as members of an enlarged Union, consolidate their transformation to democratic government. The Polish and Lithuanian Governments have stated on many occasions that they see joining the EU as consolidating their democracies. Many other governments of central and eastern Europe constantly tell us that joining the European Union will consolidate the progress they have already made and ensure they continue on the democratic path. The European experience over 50 years reinforces these convictions. There is half a century of peaceful co-operation between former enemies and a successful incorporation of new members like Greece, Spain and Portugal wishing to reinforce their restored democracies. On the other hand recent events in the Balkans have shown how instability of borders and ethnic cleansing can destabilise the entire region in the European Union.There is only one issue – a change in institutional arrangements that will allow EU expansion and still favour a coalition of smaller countries against bigger states. I am confident that if the Irish people voted solely on the provisions of the Nice treaty, there would be an overwhelming vote in its favour.Those opposed to the treaty continue to muddy the waters. Even the performance of this Government before, during and after the recent general election should not be allowed to distort the Nice issue. The passing of the Nice treaty is of fundamental importance to Ireland. By passing it we show ourselves and the world that we have not turned into the selfish and inward looking nation that some of the anti-Nice campaigners portray us as. I am convinced that we remain a nation willing to share our good fortune and extend a hand of friendship to the applicant countries which see their future as fellow members of the European Union. It is hard to understand the reason the opponents of the Nice treaty want to prevent or slow down access by other states. The benefits for us have been enormous, as they will be for the new members.Europe stands for stability and security, sustainable development and prosperity, justice and social inclusion, all built on a democratic system. The European Union has delivered for us and will deliver for the new members also. We now have recognition of educational and skills qualifications; an effective competition policy and the application of regulations and standards and consumer protection. The Single European Act gave treaty status to environmental policy, based on principles of prevention, rectification and pollution responsibility. Directives apply to areas such as air and water pollution, waste disposal, noise and the transportation of dangerous substances.In the area of justice and social inclusion we now have the European Social Fund and European labour laws. Directives on mergers, employee consultations, as well as wide ranging health and safety regulations, setting minimum standards, are now in place. We have equal opportunities and equal pay for equal work; equality of access to employment; equality in social security and maternity benefits and leave during pregnancy. We also have prohibition of discrimination in the area of crime prevention. We are combating drug trafficking and fraud, and have judicial co-operation in civil and criminal matters with customs and police co-operation.These directives and co-operation agreements have greatly enhanced our quality of life and the more central and eastern European countries which join and adhere to these standards the more secure will be our future. Nobody can doubt the impact the European Union has on our economic well-being. We now have an economy capable of competing with the best, an economy capable of producing more and more products for which we must find customers. With expansion, massive new markets will open in central and eastern Europe giving us the opportunity to grow, find good jobs for our young people and generally improve our standard of living.I am advocating a "Yes" vote in the forthcoming referendum. Our strength, post the Nice treaty, may be collaboration with some of the smaller countries wishing to join us now. We can work together to ensure the rights of smaller countries within the European Union are upheld. A "No" vote would be disastrous for us, but it would be an even greater disaster for those countries now wishing to join the European Union.

The Callanan name returns to this House after 20 years when my late uncle served here. I am proud to carry on his great work.In the coming months the people will make a decision that will affect, not just this country, but Europe as a whole. There are currently ten countries on the threshold of the European Union asking us, the Irish people, to allow them to become members of a Union from which we have benefited since 1973. All sectors have gained from our membership of the European Union, agriculture having gained most.The European Union has been the engine for growth for Irish agriculture and the agri-business sector over the last three decades. Irish agriculture has not just benefited financially, the European Union has also enabled it to modernise. The benefits of EU membership to Irish agriculture and the food industry have been enormous, amounting to almost €30 billion since we joined. Without the European Union Irish farmers would be significantly worse off economically and socially. However, small farmers in the west have not done so well owing to the way EU money is distributed. If one has a small number of animals, one gets the same rate of payment per head as farmers with a larger number resulting in small farm incomes remaining very low. This system must be adjusted in favour of small farmers.The increase in the volume of paperwork involved for farmers has also become a nightmare. This must change. The Department of Agriculture and Food must become farmer friendly and departmental inspectors must work with farmers to ensure they receive their full entitlements.The addition of a large number of small member states under this treaty can be to our advantage. We have much in common with the applicant countries and can develop this common ground into new and valuable alliances for the future, especially on matters relating to agriculture. Eight of the applicant countries—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	86	The truth is that if the debate focused on the facts, people would see that there is absolutely nothing in the treaty that should cause them concern or difficulty. Many of those advocating a "No" vote have, therefore, to cast around for spurious arguments to distract the people from this essential truth. Now, as in the previous referendum, many of those on the "No" side have tried, in the absence of strong arguments, to foment and create confusion. Having sown the seeds of doubt they will then urge those who do not know how to vote to vote "No". I urge those who do not know to ask for advice. They should get the facts and realise there is nothing to be concerned about.I challenge all participants in this debate to end the histrionics, barnstorming and the hyperbole. Let us all agree to stick to the facts and deal with the issues. The people deserve no less. Our people have shown time and again that they are committed to playing a full part in Europe and have been wise in all the decisions they made on Europe.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	88	They did not listen to the naysayers back in 1973, or when the Single European Act was voted on. This nation has prospered and done well because we have had the confidence to stand on our own two feet.The people do not believe that the European Union is perfect in every respect. We can all point to areas where improvements can be made. Yet the people are sensible enough to recognise that there is no reason to turn their faces against something because it is not perfect. The Union has been a vital factor in making Ireland the country it is today – confident, outward looking and successful. It has provided the context in which our national independence and sovereignty has been brought to its fullest flowering. We have heard throughout this debate from speakers from all parts of this House that Ireland and its people have thrived and prospered as members of the European Union. We could not have achieved what we have without the framework of the Union, nor without the enormous support – particularly financial support – and encouragement it offered.Nobody is suggesting that, in reaching a decision on how to vote on Nice, we should be unduly influenced by the fact that we have received a net contribution of over €34 billion from the EU. It is, however, a fact worth recognising. Ireland relies on exporting what it produces. It has benefited enormously from the creation of the Single Market, to which the Green Party objected. We have risen to the challenge of dealing with a market of 380 million consumers and we will rise to the new challenge. Many Deputies referred to the high level of foreign direct investment, particularly that of US companies, and the impact a "No" vote will have on that.A "No" vote is not cost free. Let us listen to what the people who know rather more on this issue than Deputy Boyle does. In July the Economist Intelligence Unit report on Ireland concluded that in voting "No" the Irish people "risk a lot". The assessment points out:One in six Irish jobs depends directly or indirectly on foreign firms. If the Irish shoot down Nice, rightly or wrongly, it will be interpreted abroad as a move away from Europe. Investors will sniff uncertainty. More uncertainty means less investment and less investment today means fewer jobs tomorrow.It may be that Deputy Boyle knows more than they do, but I doubt it.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	90	Let us look at what the chief executive officer of the IDA has had the courage to put on the record in spite of the efforts to censor him. Last Friday week in the Irish Examiner he said: “The vote on the Nice treaty will be widely seen by investors and potential investors as indicating the degree of our engagement in the EU, whether we are participating at the heart of its future development or whether we are marginalised”. I know there are people who, for their own reasons, wish that we would be marginalised, but I am surprised that Deputy Boyle is one of them.Because of Deputy Boyle's misleading contribution in this House I want to look at what the business community in the Munster region has had to say. In the Irish Examiner of 30 August, the Cork Chamber of Commerce said a “Yes” vote would be good for Europe, good for Ireland and good for Cork. Deputy Boyle clearly disagrees.

Any uncertainty regarding our involvement in Europe will impact significantly on both.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	94	In the same edition of the Irish Examiner, Humphrey Murphy of Global Stainless Steel said “EU enlargement will provide major opportunities across all industry sectors. Failure to ratify Nice will isolate us to the edge of western Europe”. Brian Molally, the general manager of Janssen Pharmaceutical Limited was quoted as saying:This company originally established in Ireland because, apart from financial-operational reasons, we saw Ireland's membership of the EU community as being extremely valuable to our world wide operations in Europe. Further development-expansion followed, taking into consideration Ireland's continuing commitment to participate to the fullest degree at the heart of EU affairs.

Our farming leaders are also clear. John Dillon said "[It is] inescapably in Ireland's interest to ratify the Nice treaty and retain our influence at the centre of the EU decision making process". David Begg in making an extraordinary contribution at the Magill Summer School in July said:Most foreign direct investment is here because of access to Europe. People argue about whether that would be affected if we achieve "pariah" status. Maybe it will and maybe it will not – but as the representative of the workers in the factories funded by that investment, I am not willing to risk voting "No".Deputy Boyle is clearly willing to risk voting "No".

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	108	The national development plan, which will play a vital role in creating a basis for our continued prosperity is dependent, to a very large degree, on our relationship with Europe. Practically no area of Irish life has been untouched by our membership of the European Union and the people know that its impact has been overwhelmingly positive. We have heard speakers address the benefits it has brought to business, farming, education, women and our security and prosperity as a people. Our partners in Europe, in assisting us, were motivated by the same spirit which should move the Irish people now. They demonstrated a sincere and generous wish to share peace and stability with fellow Europeans and recognised that, as neighbours, we have a shared interest in looking after and securing each other's welfare. That is not just philanthropy, it is enlightened self-interest. The enlargement of the European Union is about spreading the benefits further and creating opportunities for us all. As the leader of the Labour Party put it so succinctly, "the Treaty of Nice is about one thing, facilitating enlargement – no more, no less".I wish to return to the Cork Chamber of Commerce comments, obviously dismissed by Deputy Boyle. It is good for all of the towns, cities and counties of Ireland, it is good for Europe. The Deputy's proposals are bad.

Therefore, Ireland shall not participate in their adoption. Ireland shall not contribute to the financing of the operational expenditure arising from such measures.',and a Protocol to that effect being attached to the next EU treaty.".This is, in effect, a Danish protocol. In the debate in this House on the last Nice treaty referendum I sought such an amendment but at that stage, with only two Green Party Members in the House, we did not have the numbers to get a vote. It will be quite different this afternoon and we will have a vote on this issue. In this regard, we are trying to give the lie to the Government's assertion that the Seville declarations deal with the thorny issue of Irish neutrality. I wish to state the position of my party clearly, as I have already stated it quite a number of times. Irish neutrality no longer exists. The fact is that we have sold out and that it has been progressively eroded over a number of treaties.Undoubtedly, the Amsterdam treaty was the most significant treaty in terms of the erosion of Irish neutrality. The Government does not even call it "neutrality" but refers to it as "military neutrality". The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, treated us to one of the finest scaremongering speeches I have heard in this House for quite some time. He must rate as the greatest scaremongering hypocrite in this House, given his stance after the treaty, all of the record here and his current statement that we are playing with fire. I shall return to that later and we shall see how he will react.Having attended the Convention on the Future of Europe and, I must concede, having a long-standing interest in European affairs, the Minister of State knows that the so-called neutrals, Sweden and Finland, no longer refer to themselves as neutral but as non-aligned. My question to the Minister of State is this: is Ireland a neutral state now or are we simply non-aligned? Let us be accurate and truthful about this. The Minister of State has spoken of truth. Let us have the truth and let us discuss it as openly as we can. This House is accountable to the Irish people and we should be honest with them.There has been blatant dishonesty on the question of neutrality. Last week, two members of my party tried to highlight the hypocrisy of the Irish Government by protesting at Shannon Airport against the fact that military planes are landing at Shannon. Are these planes part of an attack on Iraq? We have repeatedly tried to get a debate in this House. It is quite amazing that no journalist has asked the Taoiseach or the Minister for Foreign Affairs about the Irish stance on a possible attack in Iraq. The British Prime Minister, Mr. Tony Blair, has been outlining his Government's position on this issue, as have Mr. Chirac and Mr. Schröder. However, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs say absolutely nothing on the matter.In this amendment, we are trying to secure a Danish-type protocol. The Minister of State will immediately point out that Denmark is a member of NATO. This may be, but as a UN member state we should look to it as a way of dealing with military issues rather than to the EU. There is no escaping that the Treaty of Nice advances militarisation within the EU by creating the new Military and Security Committee. The Seville Declaration simply says we will have a referendum if we choose to join the military alliance. It states the obvious – that we are non-aligned – but it does not get us out of our commitments as part of the European Rapid Reaction Force – a force consisting of 60,000 military personnel which can operate 4,000 kilometres from EU borders.This will not come cheap because, as the Minister may know, they are trying to create a force to rival that of the US. In my speech last night I quoted a phrase which is often heard in the European Parliament, namely, that Europe is an economic giant but a political dwarf. They are trying to create an economy to which the euro is central in terms of integration, but they are also trying to create a political giant with further integration and centralisation, a fundamental part of which is to create a military force.The Green Party believes our defence should be realised as part of the UN. We have a proud and honourable tradition in the UN. Unfortunately, because of our commitments as part of the Partnership for Peace, the Petersberg Tasks and the J Articles we have had to slim down our UN commitments completely, including the cessation of our long involvement in the Lebanon which is regrettable.This amendment reflects the belief the Green Party holds that Irish troops should only serve with the UN and that the EU should not develop a military wing. The EU's greatest achievement has been to bridge gaps between old war enemies through co-operation in peaceful endeavours. There is another way forward and we should not go down the military route. If the Government had been sincere, it would have inserted this type of protocol and insisted on it. At the very least it should have secured a promissory declaration which is how the Danish Government proceeded. The Maastricht treaty was rejected and the Danish Government secured the promissory declaration before it went back to get the treaty ratified and this declaration was attached as a protocol to the Amsterdam treaty. We do not have anything of the sort because the Seville Declaration means nothing in these terms. A protocol would be legally binding whereas the Seville Declaration is not – it does nothing. Throughout this campaign we will try to expose the hypocrisy and empty words of the Government.Deputy Roche referred to the economic implications of this vote and there are many. This military might it is proposed to build will not come cheap, a fact that at least the Belgian Finance Minister, Mr. Didier Reynders, has recognised. At the moment the European Rapid Reaction Force is totally dependent on NATO hardware – it cannot go it alone. Mr. Reynders has proposed levying a new EU tax on all citizens in the EU. That is honest and upfront and something one will not get from this Government. The Government says it will not cost us but it will if we are to have the same military hardware as the US. Few Irish citizens will wish to pay such a tax at any time in the future.The protocol says that we will not pay for operational expenditure. We see this as including any costs in the military or defence area including what the EU is terming "common costs". In mid-June 2002, European foreign ministers agreed at the General Affairs Council that non-military costs of EU military operations are to be financed from a common budget, while the military costs will be considered as individual costs and will be financed on a "costs lie where they fall" basis. Common costs for an EU-led operation include transport, administration, locally-hired personnel, communications, transport within the operational area of headquarters, barracks, public information, representation, hospitality and so on. We already know that inter-operability – bringing our Army up to scratch so it becomes inter-operable with NATO as part of the PfP so we can carry out the Petersberg Tasks – will cost a lot too. The Green Party does not want the Irish people to fund this. It is a reasonable request and a matter of morality because we have a proud tradition of neutrality.We do not want to become involved in the European arms agency – another body that has been discussed in the convention on the future of Europe. This protocol is necessary. The Government should have included a protocol when negotiating the treaty. Not doing so exposes them as hypocrites on the question of neutrality which is why I move this amendment.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	121	The Irish people should be very afraid because of some of the myths which have passed as high principles of governance or even morality, as Deputy Gormley claimed. I would have some understanding of Deputy Gormley's view if, when he advocates Ireland's non-involvement in any alliance, he similarly advocated that we equip ourselves to deal with the basic defence of the Irish people, which is the first duty of a Government. This is the first anniversary of the events of 11 September 2001 in New York. If the Irish-registered Ryanair jet which was subject to a hijack attempt in Stockholm a couple of weeks ago had been headed for Irish airspace, we would not have had the capacity to do anything about it. We would have had to rely on Britain or NATO or someone else.Furthermore, if an aircraft takes off in Irish airspace and even if we know it is heading for Sellafield, we do not have the equipment or capacity to deal with it. The Deputy and his party cannot have it both ways. They cannot say we cannot be a member of an alliance and simultaneously say our Defence Forces should not be equipped to deal with all eventualities to protect the lives, well-being and property of Irish citizens. There has been too much political cowardice with people benefiting themselves because it is profitable to push that line. I hope, with my hand on my heart, that we do not have to come into this House at some stage in the future and talk about any horrendous events which may happen and for which we ourselves are not equipped to deal with. We have outdone each other in denuding the State of the basic clothes of self-defence. It is fine if people believe we should not join an alliance but let us be prepared at least to defend ourselves.I find it extraordinary that the Green Party here talks as if it was speaking for the Green Party globally. The Green Party in Germany seems to take a far different view.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	123	It is extraordinary that Sinn Féin is not only in the same stable as the Tory Party but on the Mrs. Thatcher wing of the Tory Party. The one thing that broke the yoke of British control on this country was the European Union. Previously, when Britain devalued, we devalued. When their Chancellor of the Exchequer set new interest rates we had to reset ours. The European Union which gave us sovereignty and independence and which gave us the opportunity to get out from behind our island neighbour is being attacked by the right wing of the Tory Party and their fellow travellers in this instance, Sinn Féin. What nonsense we have to listen to in this regard.I am worried about the large consensus that exists regarding neutrality. With the exception of a few people who have thought it out I do not believe it is based on any principles that people understand. I am speaking not just of political parties in the House but of the churches and many other people. We are all meant to genuflect in the same direction. I fear when any policy is elevated to such a high level without the principles being thought out and debated. That speaks volumes of us as a people no matter what the policy. Another fear is that if the argument is correct, and perhaps it is because I do not have the monopoly on wisdom, then it should not be departed from by stealth. We should understand the principles on which it is based. We should know what the policy is and on what basis it exists so that it is not departed from and we can spell it out.The fifth and 13th Hague Conventions of 1907 set out the principles on which neutrality is based. As far as I can recall the basis is that we would be absolutely neutral as between all belligerents. We have never been neutral in that sense. Patrick Keating and others have done interesting research on this and have made a major contribution to how this has evolved in our psyche. People believe this is written into our constitution. It is not nor is it in any law. It is time we had proper debate in this House on a real White Paper on defence and security – not on what passed for a White Paper and was all about securing the minimum numbers possible on the pay roll and defence services and for keeping it under control. We need a proper debate on defence and security issues which are the concern of Members of the Oireachtas. These are the issues we should address. We are not addressing them but taking it as a given that they have been discussed and debated and that we all know the basis on which the principle is established. We do not. Some Members may have a highly developed views on this and I respect the views Deputy M. Higgins has expressed over the years. However, I do not believe most Members of this House or the Seanad have thought this out.It is extraordinary that Deputy Gormley says we should look to the UN and not the EU. We should look to the United Nations for the authority to carry out certain exercises but should we look to the UN rather than the EU generally? The UN is controlled by Russia, China, France, Britain and the United States. Should we look to them and not the European Union where we have our own permanent place at the table? That is an extraordinary suggestion. The UN itself has argued that regional organisations will have to take on the responsibility of carrying out some of the UN mandates. That is what the Petersberg Tasks are all about and humanitarian tasks such as search and rescue. There could even be a role for regional organisations in terms of the environment.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	125	Deputy Gormley is like other people to whom I have sat and listened who want to interrupt others because their argument has been exposed. The part of the Petersberg Tasks which say they would carry out the tasks of combat forces in crisis management on a case by case basis is proper and civilised. That is the business of government in which we are quite properly involved. It was passed by the people in the Amsterdam treaty.Again, I find it extraordinary that a rapid reaction force to deal with events largely outside of the European Union, and by agreement we can agree whether we are involved or not in a particular exercise, should be denounced. It is a relatively modest force of 60,000. I cannot remember the actual figure for the total defence force of the Union but it is in the region of three million. Comparatively this is a small figure. Are Deputy Gormley and others suggesting that the European Union, through a rapid reaction force, would have no business getting involved in Srebrenica or some other form of Srebrenica? I hear scoffs from the back. When I was Minister for European Affairs I sat on radio and television panels and listened to people like the Tánaiste, when she was in Opposition, saying we should use our great moral authority of neutrality to talk sense to these people to bring an end to the terrible genocide. That is rubbish. Somebody had to go in there and sort it out.

That is the moral issue. For us to elevate our own self-serving interests above the interests of suffering people is an abomination. Because that abomination had such widespread support I hope it does not fly in the face of God and that some calamity will some day present itself on our own doorstep. Then we would quickly see the wringers of hands and the mourners looking for somebody to come to give us succour. God help us then, but I hope there is some sort of rapid reaction force somewhere that will come to our assistance.I am not an enthusiastic supporter regarding the extra wording being included by the Government in the new Bill, but it is the de facto situation and debunks the issue and elevates it to constitutional language. It clarifies the issue and makes it clear that if we are to participate in a common defence at some stage in the future we would have to put a vote to the people. Strangely, especially following the passing of the Good Friday Agreement, I do not think we would need any referendum to join NATO. Certainly we would not need one to join some alliance with Britain. Northern Ireland has been in NATO since 1949. Following the passing of the Good Friday Agreement we could probably do anything we wanted. However, if we want to join a European common defence, the only area that is actually spelled out, we would have to go to the people. Yet, this is the one area that people represent as a danger to our military neutrality. What a load of nonsense. It does not add up.Denmark is an interesting case. Not only is Denmark a member of NATO, as Deputy Gormley pointed out, but it is not a full member of the Western European Union because it does not want to know about the Western European Union or the EU being involved in defence and security matters. Denmark wants NATO and nobody else. That is the Danish concern. Denmark is not concerned with defending any of the points raised by Deputy Gormley. Denmark is not a member of the Western European Union although it is a full member of NATO for the reason that it does not want any dilution. It wants NATO and nothing else. So, to quote Denmark as an example is quite extraordinary.My final comment is on the following wording of the amendment moved by Deputy Gormley, "Ireland does not participate in the elaboration and implementation of decisions and actions of the Union which have defence implications". There will be defence implications if we participate in an EU discussion about reducing the amount of arms produced in Europe. Are we to be prohibited from participating in such a discussion if we agree to this amendment? That is clearly what Deputy Gormley's amendment means.I wish to make a second point about the use of the phrase "defence implications" in this amendment. It is quite legitimate for us to talk about common defence policy, as it is entirely different from common defence itself. The State, through its representatives in the Government, has the authority to participate in discussions on common defence policy, armaments or any other matter of interest to it. States have to take an interest in defence issues and I have no difficulty with this country discussing common defence policy with other friendly states. Common defence policy should not be confused with common defence; NATO is a common defence alliance, but the EU is not. An amendment that prohibits discussion of anything with "defence implications" is not very well thought out and I do not intend to support it.Many people believe that the EU should not be involved in defence and security matters. No issue, in my opinion, is more central to the raison d'être of the Union than stability, security and defence. It should not be forgotten that 60 million Europeans, most of whom were in the prime of their lives, died in wars in the first half of the last century. Some Members of the House were alive at that time, although I was not. Both the First and Second World Wars started in Europe and shortly after the end of the latter war, a small number of European visionaries came together to declare that such wars must never be allowed to happen again. The resources of war, such as the steel from which weapons were fashioned and the coal which was used for energy in wartime, were pooled. The Common Market and the European Economic Community grew from the initial European Coal and Steel Community, and the European Community and the European Union developed later.We cannot have prosperity without peace and stability. Instability will flourish in eastern Europe if we do not extend the privileges of membership to the applicant states. Some Members, as well as others outside this House, have said that enlargement can proceed without ratification of the Nice treaty, but that is not the case. The Amsterdam treaty provides that weighting in the Council of Ministers and representation on the European Commission have to be addressed if more than five member states are admitted. The treaty imposes a real restriction to the admission of more than five countries. We cannot choose between ten applicant countries that are equally well prepared, that meet the acquis communautaire, are fully democratic, have suffered to get their economies into shape, have changed their legislative bases and have applied for membership. It is not fair to leave one country out while bringing its neighbour in. Could there be a greater recipe for disorder and instability?Many people believe such disorder will not happen again, but it happened in Yugoslavia in the last decade. We thought it would never happen, but it did. Extremists in many countries, including Austria, are constantly trying to drum up dissent. It takes very little for such people, whether they are on the right wing or on the left, to win a loyal following. We must not forget that millions of people cheered speeches made by Slobodan Milosevic on the steps of the Parliament Building in Belgrade. Perhaps they did not realise what they were letting themselves in for.There is a terrible air of unreality in this House. Quite frankly, I sometimes feel I am in a minority in the House on these issues.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	146	It is a shame that there is such division in the House, but perhaps it is also useful that the division is used to address moral issues. I do not feel threatened by this Green Party amendment and I welcome this opportunity to discuss alternatives to it. The Labour Party was anxious to support the Forum on Europe, which elicited a number of anxieties and real issues that arose from the result of last year's referendum. It was quite clear at the forum that people are worried about Ireland's involvement in defence and military matters, particularly neutrality. Worries about transparency in relation to foreign policy, particularly defence policy, still arise. This is handled to some extent in the Europe Bill which will have to be processed before 9 October. My party's position is that it would be disingenuous to support this amendment, having negotiated with the Government about the inclusion of a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution. We believe such a reference to be legally enforceable, achievable and within our remit. The alternative proposed today by the Green Party is not as easily enforceable legally and not as strictly within our jurisdiction.Deputy Gay Mitchell knows why I have disagreed with him about neutrality for many years. It is not fair to suggest that the discussion is one between realists, who are militarists, and soft people, who believe in diplomacy. The Deputy mentioned the 60 million European people who died in wars in the last century, but I remind him of the interesting developments following the Second World War. Following the horrors of Dachau and other concentration camps, it was suggested that there was such a thing as an immutable basic universal human right, located in the human person. The human rights movement originated at this time and its great moral thrust came from the experiences I have mentioned.A form of economics which was not based on individualism but on the reconstruction of the economics of Europe, developed between 1947 and 1977. It was based on Keynesian principles and was described as les trente glorieuses by the French school of economics. Under this form of economics, the state accepted responsibility for high levels of post-war unemployment, health issues, housing, public utilities and other matters. These 30 years were followed by les vingt douloureuses, 20 years of the rise of the right in Europe, the beating back of state regulations and state activity, an increase in individualism and, interestingly, the rise of war-like soundings. The period following the death of 60 million people is interesting as it contained the enormous waste of the deflection of resources into the Cold War, with the accompanying destruction of societies on both sides of the Iron Curtain.This House has a responsibility. The Green Party and Sinn Féin are right to raise the status of diplomacy in an era of military posturings. The issue of transparency does arise because this is not a matter of our being neutral on paper. It is a matter of what transparency we allow for logistical discussions of defence co-operation and relationships within the European Union. There is nothing soft or vague about it. It is the stuff of Parliament and the public are right to be interested in it.Tugadh tuairisc ar a ndearnadh; an Choiste do shuí arís.

#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	150	Before we broke for lunch, I indicated the attitude of the Labour Party to this amendment and said that I very much welcomed the discussion it facilitated. I had been outlining my disagreement with the rather shrill contribution of Deputy Mitchell. The morality of different positions was referred to in the proposal of the amendment and in Deputy Mitchell's reply and I address that because it is a very important issue.I concluded my previous remarks by saying one cannot argue for a kind of realism, the content of which is militarism requiring the provision of defence capacity, as the only basis of practical policy and as somehow an alternative to the complicated opportunities of diplomacy which are perceived as being softer. Deputy Mitchell invited the public to be afraid, basing that fear on a lack of capacity to defend ourselves. That has many echoes of Cold War thinking, but the fear we should have is of the collapse of diplomacy in relation to military posturing. The collapse of diplomacy has meant the loss of authority by the General Secretary of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, in relation to the members of the Security Council, particularly its permanent members, and a perceived distance between the moral instinct of the General Assembly and the abuse of their positions by those permanent members.Ireland ran a campaign for membership of the Security Council on a platform of reform of the UN about which we have not heard a single word since it became a member. It also ran on the basis of a commitment of 0.7% of GNP in overseas development aid, which it has broken, and it has offered rhetorical flourishes in Johannesburg when it might have been required to offer more solid commitments.The reason it is right for people to table amendments to flush out the Government's position and justify the Labour Party's third reform initiative coming out of this debate – the European Institutions Bill – is that certain kinds of accountability are required. I represent as many plain people as Deputy Mitchell does and they ask me rather direct questions too, one of which I put to the Minister of State. Is it not poisoning the atmosphere in which we are trying to achieve something if he cannot tell us whether our Government supports Mr. Blair's initiative for war, President Chirac's suggestion that Iraq be given a three weeks to readmit inspectors or the German suggestion that a considerable body of proof is required before a strike on Iraq can be justified? After the event there will be parliamentary questions in November when tens of thousands of people may have been killed and then we will have a statement in relation to other initiatives saying that the Quartet has met and been very concerned about Gaza and Jenin. The Irish people are saying they are willing to share sovereignty, but want to know what was said in their name in relation to fundamental principles.I ran into all of this as far back as 1981 when I published an article in Studies arguing for a foreign policy committee, an ad hoc one having been established. It was opposed tooth and nail for years, but the principle was that things could have been discussed there before they became a reality. There is a message for members of Fianna Fáil in this. As a former Minister, I inherited a habitats directive from the European Union and although I have never regretted signing it, the opposition to its implementation should have been debated when it was being drafted. There is no point in the Government saying that all of this should have been known and that everything is fine when it is fudging our foreign policy.The plain people Deputy Mitchell thinks should be shaking in their beds until we have the capacity to blow planes out of the sky also say other fundamental things. For instance, they say that perhaps the reason we do not voice our opposition to regimes being toppled and various aspects of the abuse of human rights is that, as the recipient of the largest share of foreign direct investment from the United States, we are not free to do so. There is also the matter of the very welcome interest shown by the United States in the Northern Ireland peace process. When one discusses these matters quietly over a glass of red or white wine, one is told by various people that they are interested in the achievements of quiet diplomacy. The good old embassies have no problem in rounding up a troupe of gin and tonic servants to run off to hear the different versions of events.There is a real gap and a real anxiety which leads people to assert that there is such a thing as an Irish foreign policy. While I accept we have to place our foreign policy in a pool of sovereignty with other nations with which we have co-operation, we are still entitled to hear what it is. Currently, we do not get many opportunities to do so. In October, when the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs is reconstituted, one will find that it is poorly staffed and financed, has little research capacity, that, once appointed, its chairperson will be briefed by the Department of Foreign Affairs and that, apart from a few set pieces, statements and so forth, it will not get very far.It is time the Government side stopped abusing those of us who have a genuine concern about transparency in Irish foreign policy. Having entered into talks with the Government and obtained a specific reference to neutrality in the Constitution, a place I have described as appropriate and judiciable and in which jurisprudence can be lodged with safety, the Labour Party recorded a real achievement. The approach taken is better than aspiring to seek to influence the other member states in other ways. I also doubt whether a protocol is achievable.The difference between Deputy Gay Mitchell and me is that I very much respect the position of those arguing against a European armaments industry, an unaccountable foreign policy and the absence of transparency. There are other issues at stake, which are neither abstract nor academic and were not invented by me. Perhaps one feature lost during the Second Stage debate was the very fine contributions which referred to Article 133. How do the Minister of State and the Government respond to the suggestion that financial interests have a greater influence on European decision making than Irish citizens and have found it easier to access the Commission on issues of trade? As all these issues are very real, we do not need lectures on the need to have, as it were, anti-aircraft installations around the country.I also want to reply explicitly to a question as old as James Dillon, namely, the notion that neutrality is a concept which was somehow invented. In 1972 Tony Browne and I wrote a booklet on positive neutrality for the Labour Party which drew on writing on neutrality as old and older than James Connolly's first writing. We used the concept of positive neutrality, not to describe some kind of impotence, but to show how one would use one's position as an opponent of empire and war to try to conduct diplomacy using transcendent principles by which people could live, operate and resolve conflicts.That was the background to neutrality. The problem was the fudge that emerged later. Let us examine the position of Members of this House when I entered it in 1973 or even as early as your election to the House, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Members loved to get up on their hind legs and declare Ireland to be militarily neutral but not ideologically neutral. What did they mean by that? They meant that if it came to a choice between Franco and saving the Spanish Republic in its day, they would choose Franco. For a time certain Members on the Fine Gael benches, notably James Dillon, were suggesting that Ireland should become the 51st state of the United States. The irony is that the dishonesty on neutrality came from people who did not want to declare on whose side they would line up if it came to a choice between the western anti-communist rhetoric, the Soviet Union and what was described by various people writing from the perspective of India as "The Third Way". India, which had achieved independence, argued that one did not have to choose between an abused communist system in the Soviet Union or the western system because there were other countries emerging into the family of nations.Reference was made to Patrick Keating. I challenge Members to refute that our best period was during the Aiken era when we carved out a particular character to Irish foreign policy. What were its constituent parts? We gave a lead at the time, the legacy of which is that we continue to lead in the area of non-nuclear proliferation and the declaring of nuclear arms illegal. Certain Members accused people who raised the issue of neutrality of being somehow vague – cowardice and hypocrisy were the phrases used. The slide has been on their part because their position is that we should adopt an approach which would allow us to avoid ever having to criticise anything about the West. How can they justify this?The argument between the Green Party and the Labour Party is about how to achieve a particular end. It is a respectful difference of opinion. I respect the position of Green Party members and I am sure they respect mine. The notion that realists are somehow playing a game is destroying political trust in this country. The House would be surprised at the number of people throughout this country who ask questions every day about our attitude on all foreign policy issues, from Palestine to Gaza and elsewhere. There is a far greater interest in all these issues than the Government realises.The way to approach the people is for the Government to admit to them that it did not explain what has been done in their name in Europe, that it went into Intergovernmental Conference processes which were not open and drafted and participated in treaties from which there has been no comeback for the people in general and the Parliament in particular. It should apologise for this and tell the people it understands the reasons they voted as they did in the last referendum, that it is making changes and that, having listened to their concerns about neutrality, it will, in future, have an anticipatory discussion about major changes in the European Union and Ireland's relations to it, including resourcing our capacity to examine issues in advance.All this would be very positive. There is no point in painting a picture of oneself as being sophisticated when in fact one is avoiding all the moral issues. As a member of the Cabinet during the crisis in Srebrenica, I do not claim that moral questions are easy and I am reluctant to use this category of morality as an example. Faced with a human rights situation of the magnitude of Srebrenica on one's borders, which is the morally superior position – to be impotent or consistent with one's previous position that one cannot become involved? One is challenged in such circumstances to take moral action. However, while action is required, it also means that if one is to create for oneself a capacity to act in such situations, one must create all the necessary transparencies, including those related to the logistics of sharing information, mechanisms of control, possession of weapons, consultations, training and other matters. We are not doing this. If one fudges the relationships between those with a simplistic military agenda and those with a defence agenda which is shaded, one loses one's capacity to have an authentic response to issues as morally challenging as the one I describe.Having argued in good faith for a particular inclusion in the Constitution, we intend to stick to it as our preferred position. At the same time, it is very important to realise, accept and listen to the value of this debate which has introduced issues neglected for too long.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I will make a short contribution now and take up other issues later. The polarity of this debate is healthy. This is the type of debate we should have had, but which we have always ignored. Deputy Michael Higgins was right when he posited the extraordinary dichotomy we face. How can one not be morally outraged by Srebrenica? How could we have sat on our hands if during the last years of the last war we were aware of what happened in Bergen-Belsen or any of that? One could not choose to be neutral in the sense of being absolutely neutral between the real horrors and the other possible situations there.I would not agree with many of the points Deputy Mitchell would make. One of the marvellous outcomes of last year's referendum, which some Deputies opposite may dismiss, is that we have reached a point where we are about to put wording into our Constitution which had nothing to say on this issue. I acknowledge the role played by the Opposition parties in facilitating and helping to reach this state. I have had many interesting discussions with people from the Labour Party and Fine Gael. I take great pride in the additional words proposed to be added.One of the points made by Deputy Higgins could not have been better made. A proposition, although perhaps idealistic, had been made in the proposal put before us by the Green Party and Deputy Higgins has reflected on the realism of the situation. We have an opportunity to write something into our Constitution at this point, which will be justiciable within the terms of our Constitution in our State.The amendment by the Green Party, in effect, tries to posit that Ireland should take a stance similar to that taken by Denmark. With respect, the circumstances are not the same. Deputy Higgins made the point very well that the amendment we intend putting into the Constitution is a positive reaction to the position Irish people proposed or found themselves in last year.With regard to the Danish situation to which Deputy Gormley referred, the opt out clause they sought to enter was done post factum. They had already agreed the Maastricht treaty. They found themselves in a dilemma and went back to Edinburgh in 1992 in relation to that. Four years later they obtained a protocol which is annexed to the Amsterdam treaty. Historically, that is the position as the Deputy described it and he was accurate. The position here, however, is slightly different and that is why Ireland should not consider such an option. Deputy Higgins outlined the position more eloquently than I have heard anyone else do. These are issues of which we should take possession. We should first close any lacuna that may exist. There is no direct comparison between the Danish situation at that time and the Irish situation now.It would be a mistake to apply Danish circumstances to Ireland's situation. Denmark was seeking to opt out of commitments it had made. That is a fundamental point of which we should not lose sight, although I am not accusing Deputy Gormley of doing so. The Danes made commitments in Maastricht which they then found impossible to keep because of a decision of their people. They needed a legal instrument to rectify a situation to which they had committed themselves.The Danish position was also different in other ways. Deputy Gormley mentioned that Denmark is a member of NATO and I agree with him that is neither here nor there in terms of this issue.By contrast, we are not seeking to opt out of this provision. That is why the issue of a protocol is ill focused. We are not seeking to opt out of the Nice treaty or from any of the EU treaties that preceded it. Moreover, the main treaty provisions on security and defence policy are laid down in treaties other than the Nice treaty. That is a point on which Deputy Higgins touched. That is why the Labour Party agreed that this is a better course of action. We are addressing something that is not in the Nice treaty but something that is significant here. We cannot seek an opt out clause from a treaty in respect of an issue that does not exist in it. That is not logical.Irrespective of what Members may think of the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties, they are endorsed and in place. Our policy of military neutrality is fully protected under those treaties and under the Nice treaty and the guarantees we have guarantee our position in that regard. The Declarations of Seville make it clear beyond any reasonable doubt that is not only our reading of our position but the reading of our position by the other member states. No one can scoff at the Declarations of Seville and say they are of no consequence.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	160	That is a point of view, but I would question its validity. I do not believe one can simply dismiss the views of all the other member states.Because of what happened last year we have reached a point where we are about to achieve something which I regard as immensely positive. If the people of Ireland vote "Yes" in the upcoming referendum, this Bill and that referendum will give people the opportunity to put into their Constitution for the first time a protection that will provide that not only this Government but any future Government cannot become involved in the adventures of common defence. That is a positive step forward.The bottom line is that Ireland is not opting out of playing a constructive role in peace and stability in Europe, but neither is Ireland opting into a situation where we would play warmongers in Europe. That, obviously, would not attract attention from any shade of opinion in this House or outside it. It would be profoundly wrong to isolate ourselves. Ireland will continue to play a positive and constructive role, but it will be one involved in peacekeeping and humanitarian activities and not one involved in warmongering.One issue, on which Deputy Gormley touched, but which has not been addressed in the debate is that of financing. This issue is dealt with in the amendment. There is no question of Ireland being put in a position to finance an EU operation that does not meet with our approval. I do not know if that is what Deputy Gormley intended to say, but if it is, I respectively point out that he was mistaken. That is not the case. That does not and will not happen under these arrangements. In approaching the financial issue, I draw attention to the general principle, which is reflected in the conclusions of successive European Councils, that participation in any form of crisis management mission is voluntary. In the framework of financing, that has been agreed. Full respect has been maintained for the treaty provision that member states who choose to formally opt out from any operation will not be obliged to contribute to the financing of that operation. That is an important point. Ireland will participate in humanitarian crisis management missions and I do not believe any one would object to our doing so. That is where we find our true status as a nation and where we have gained such respect in the world. We will do so on a case by case basis and subject always to UN authorisation. We should not lose sight of the fact that the triplock arrangements are in place and will continue to be in place.For the first time we are having the kind of debate on neutrality and what it means in this State, that we should have had during the past 40 to 50 years. That may be something we will address in the upcoming session in the forum, but we should be under no delusion that this formulation offered by the Green Party is in any way an improvement on the current arrangement. As Deputy Higgins said, it is not, and it is not for all the practical, pragmatic and realistic reasons he outlined.The discussion we have had on this issue is the type of discussion we should have had over the years. It is healthy to disagree in a democracy, but we need to get our thinking clear on what we mean by neutrality. I do not believe it is a choice of impotent diplomacy, on the one hand, and militarism on the other as suggested by Deputy Michael D. Higgins. That is an equally false argument. It certainly would not be the view held on this side of the House nor do I think it would be the view of the vast majority of the Irish people. All we can do is determine our own destiny. In the upcoming referendum we are giving the people the opportunity of writing something into a Constitution which is silent on this issue. The electorate will have the opportunity to say "Yes" to an amendment which will give them the one guarantee they can count on – that given by a sovereign people to themselves in their fundamental law – that the Government cannot enter, now or in future, into any form of common defence without first putting it as a referendum to the people. This is remarkable progress and we should celebrate the fact that we are making such advances.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I thank the proposer of the amendment which gives us an opportunity to discuss this aspect of foreign policy that we have shied away from over the years. While I do not agree with his view in its entirety, I listened with great interest to my colleague, Deputy Michael D. Higgins, as he elaborated on that subject. The time has come for us to have a debate on neutrality and the longer the debate goes on the better. We should not denigrate one another but should seek a consensus once the debate is over.My colleague, Deputy Gay Mitchell, may have been misunderstood. He made a very interesting speech in the House today as he did last week in his Second Stage speech on the Bill. He pointed out the dangers that exist in a situation of neutrality because it is dependent on the extent to which the country has the resources to defend itself. If we go back to the 1930s there were a certain number of neutral countries throughout Europe, but, with one or two exceptions they did not fare very well when war came. There was very little respect for either their boundaries or citizens in time of war. The idea of neutrality is a fine one and I support the call to avoid war in all circumstances where it is possible. However, let us not forget that in the past 60 years when there was one particularly awful war in Europe those neutral nations were unable to prevent war taking place. I do not think anything can be achieved once there is an aggressor to voraciously plough ahead to achieve his objectives. I have studied the events of that era, but have yet to see how a policy of neutrality could have prevented the conflict given that there was an individual driving the warmongering.I fully appreciate the reservations of Deputy Michael D. Higgins, and others, in regard to a breach of our established policy of neutrality. There is a grave danger in this era of modern technology that smaller neutral countries may find themselves vulnerable to attack from aggressors who have no regard for boundaries or policies of neutrality. What guarantees do we have? People may say Deputy Gay Mitchell is scaremongering, but I think he is being realistic. While we might not agree with what he is saying it is important that we listen to him as part of this debate. He proposed a scenario where a hijacked plane might head for a neutral country. To what extent would our neutrality protect us? I presume we would call on our neighbours, both within the EU and elsewhere, to assist us. Maybe they would and maybe they would not. We must live with the reality of such an event taking place. Gone are the days when Ireland was an insignificant country on the western shores of Europe with no meaningful role to play except to talk about things. We are now a more important location and we have an influential role and every time we opt out to return to the periphery it diminishes our importance, which is not in the national interest.I would far prefer to be at the table influencing decisions on defence than to be outside the room and have others taking the decisions in my absence. That is a personal position with which not everybody may agree, but at least this country would have some opportunity to influence the decisions. If there was a negative outcome then it is true that we would be tarred with the brush of guilt along with the others who made the decision. In the past 150 years in Europe I have yet to see how neutrality served the purpose that was originally intended. My worry is that one's neutrality will not be respected by others. What will happen then? If there was an attack on these shores we could not have a referendum to determine if we would defend ourselves. I presume some kind of action would be taken somewhere, that somebody would be inspired enough to call for help or for us to take action ourselves. We will have to have sufficient resources to be able to defend ourselves in such circumstances. If we do not, then to whom can we turn for help?The Irish military authorities have for many years wished to be in a position to influence defence policy in Europe in a positive way.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	163	No. That would not be a fair assumption at all. They wish to avail of the information available at first hand rather than to get a condensed version for the minions. They wish to be in an influential position. I have no reason to believe the Irish military authorities are warmongers. I have no reason to believe they will launch an attack on anybody. They have conducted themselves with great valour and are a credit to the nation on all the peacekeeping missions in which they have been involved over the past 50 or more years. We should not doubt their motives. They have very good reasons for wishing to be in the inner circle dictating policy. If that were the case, at least we would have the compensation of being able to say we tried to use our influence in a positive way for the benefit of all. They would also have the right to say, "We do not agree and will not proceed," as have other European countries in the past.I do not wish to go back over the Second World War again, which is what comes to most people's minds. Somebody mentioned Spandau, Dachau and various other places. I do not propose to discuss that area, but have no doubt that every Member of the House has studied European history very carefully, including its most recent history. It is beyond belief there are atrocities comparable to those that took place in the course of the Second World War, carried out by numerous, so-called civilised societies against each other. The inhumanity displayed during that era surely had no boundaries. Therefore, I do not for one moment accept the notion that other peaceful means could have been readily found at the time.There comes a time in everyone's life when one has to stand up and be counted on one side or the other. With regard to European defence and security in the future, we must ask ourselves if it is reasonable to expect that we can be part and parcel of a Union, to which we contribute and from which we draw and to which we are committed in every way except in respect of defence, and expect that Union to look after all our interests in all eventualities for ever more. I am not so certain. It is a little like somebody saying he or she will avail of the cover of an umbrella but would like somebody else to carry it when the time comes to do so. I am not so sure that everybody accepts that as being a fair commitment in terms of everybody accepting his or her responsibilities.At least on this occasion we can air our views. One of the things we have not been able to do since I first came into this House is to have an adequate debate on this subject. Therefore, I look forward to a continuation of this debate. I have every confidence in the ability of every Member of this House to make a valid contribution based on his or her experience, knowledge and ideology. I have no reason to doubt that whatsoever. I hope there will be, in the course of what will follow on the referendum on the Nice treaty, an opportunity to further this debate.I know it has been identified in some quarters that neutrality was a major issue in determining the outcome of the last referendum. I do not think so. It was an issue like many others, but it was not the major one that some would have me believe. For example, in respect of the 17% who voted "No," one will find that many of them regarded neutrality as a major issue, but what about all the others who did not vote? What was the issue for them? Was it the same? I am not so certain. From what I am aware of, based on research done in this regard, that was not the case.If this is sufficient to achieve a result in the Nice referendum, then I am for it. I am willing to make that sacrifice and help in any way I can. This was referred to by other speakers also, even though I do not necessarily agree with them. I hope we will not live to regret the issue of neutrality and the particular attachment in the amendment now being pursued. I hope we will not live to regret it in the short-term because we are all freely capable of coming to a conclusion without compulsion from any quarter. I hope events do not take place to cause us to regret any decision we might now make on neutrality.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I strongly support this amendment. I welcome the positive co-operation among the "No" campaigners in this debate. It is important that the democrats, particularly the progressive forces in Irish society, work closer together in the real interests of the people. On the "No" side, we welcome the proposal by Deputy Gay Mitchell and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, to have a broader discussion on neutrality.When we talk of neutrality and the desire to retain a strong, independent foreign policy and keep and develop our relationship with the United Nations, we do not mean sitting on the fence, whether in the Middle East, the former Yugoslavia or Rwanda. It is wrong to distort the key moral issues in this debate. Let us not forget the brave Irish people who gave their lives on UN missions working for peace, equality and justice in the world. They died in the interests of peace. They certainly did not sit on the fence. I challenge Deputy Gay Mitchell and other Deputies on this question. Yes, defence issues are important moral questions, as is expenditure on nuclear and chemical weapons, particularly when people are hungry and without water.The "Yes" side should not distort the main issues in this debate. People have every right to bring forward ideas that will reduce conflict in the world and stop the drift towards militarisation and war. These are the brave people who have risked their necks for world peace. I remind Deputy Gay Mitchell and many on the "No" side that those who died on the Rainbow Warrior, for example, did not sit on the fence. When a foreign EU government bombed their boat, these peace activists did more for world peace in a week than so-called EU warlords in nuclear clubs.Let us consider East Timor and the role of the United Nations there. This is another example of where a strong mandate can be implemented. Let us call a spade a spade and let the people know there are Members in this House who now challenge world leaders who can spend a fortune on defence, yet when it comes to our fire or health service or a disability Bill, there is always a problem in getting the funding or keeping the public finances in order. It is typical that in recent days we could spend €1.5 million on a Minister's toilet, yet cannot afford a caretaker in many inner city schools. This is the type of everyday occurrence that ordinary people have to put up with and regarding which we have to listen to debates every day in the Dáil. Consider the fire officers of New York and London in recent days. Tony Blair and George Bush have a problem in finding the finance to pay them, yet they have absolutely no problem in spending millions getting ready for another war on Iraq. This nonsense from the major political parties must be challenged, particularly in the Dáil.I welcome the fact that we now have a group of Members in this House who will not always go with the flow and will challenge the political elite in this country and also bring forward radical alternative proposals regarding important world issues, particularly important peace issues. That is the reason I support this excellent amendment from the Green Party. It is a strong, positive amendment which sends out a strong message to the people of Ireland, the European Union, the Middle East, Africa and Asia. Above all, it shows vision for the future. I urge all Deputies to support it strongly.I strongly endorse what Deputy Joe Higgins said in respect of one minute's silence for the victims of the massacre of 11 September in America. Like Deputy Higgins, we also send our sympathy to the people of Iraq and to the families of civilians in Afghanistan who have died over the past couple of months. Our foreign policy and the kind of views we put forward show that Ireland is on the side of the poor in the Third World and other regions and, as such, we are seen as a distinct country with a different view of the world.The discussion on Irish neutrality, the Treaty of Nice and the Seville declarations has raised many questions. Many people are asking what legal status these declarations will have to which the reply is none whatsoever. A declaration is a statement of intent and has no legally binding status. A declaration attached to a treaty does not alter the provisions of the treaty one iota. It is the treaty which becomes law if and when it is ratified. The Nice treaty is unchanged since its rejection by the Irish electorate in June 2001. The answer to whether these declarations mean the Government is really committed to Irish neutrality is, sadly, "No". The Government defines Irish neutrality as Ireland not participating in a mutual defence pact – our not being automatically obliged to help defend another EU state under attack. We are not so obliged and nothing in the Nice treaty ever stated we would be. What it does confirm is that Irish participation in the European Rapid Reaction Force will operate up to 4,000 kilometres outside the borders of the EU. I stress the words "outside the borders of the EU". This force will see Irish troops operating offensively not defensively – I have no problems with people defending their country – alongside troops from other EU countries and in co-operation with the nuclear armed NATO military alliance. This is the real world and the Minister of State should realise that these are the issues about which people are concerned. If this is not a breach of Irish neutrality, what is? That is what the Nice treaty entails and nothing in the declarations rules this out.Inserting a guarantee of Irish neutrality into the Constitution would only help if it meant we would not participate in offensive operations outside the EU. The Government might introduce a constitutional amendment that ruled out Irish participation in defensive arrangements but that would allow it to send troops to fight outside the EU with the Rapid Reaction Force. That type of constitutional amendment would be irrelevant and useless.On the point of whether the Government and the Dáil will hold veto power over when Ireland contributes to any particular operation of this EU military force, the Government can decide as it pleases. It has a Dáil majority so it can ensure parliamentary approval for anything it wants. The Government has already allowed US forces the use of Shannon Airport – Deputies will be aware of the protests there over the past couple of weeks. It has also allowed EU war planes to carry out exercises over our air space. The Government cannot be trusted to defend Irish neutrality. That is what people are saying. It has already shown that it will join up to military adventures when asked to do so. In the meantime, even before a particular operation comes up for discussion, Ireland will be involved in planning and purchasing equipment for this Rapid Reaction Force so our neutrality will be eroded before a shot is fired. That is the bottom line.The Government says it will only commit Irish troops abroad when there is a UN mandate to do so. Do we trust it? The current Taoiseach said in 1996 that joining NATO's Partnership for Peace without a referendum would be a serious breach of faith and fundamentally undemocratic. He then went along and signed us up for the PfP without the promised referendum. This shows what political promises and declarations are worth. In any event, a UN mandate is no guarantee of goodness – some 5,000 Iraqi children die every month as a result of UN mandated sanctions.Those of us who hold strong views on supporting the United Nations are also critical that it does not do enough. We do not accept the proposition that Britain or America should be the police men and women of the world. That job belongs to the United Nations. If there are flaws in the United Nations, we should correct them and we should not allow America and other big countries to undermine its authority. The vast majority of Irish people have a strong regard for the United Nations. It is in our blood and our history to be international peace brokers, respecting different traditions and trying to take our place on the international stage.There are people within the Defence Forces and PDFORRA who are strongly supportive of NATO. We do not, however, stand up to them. People within the leadership of the ICTU breach policy even though congress policy is to defend Irish neutrality and have independent foreign policy. There is nothing wrong with challenging these people; we have a moral duty to do so.Questions of trust, neutrality and foreign policy are linked to this amendment. Many people who listened to the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, over the past number of weeks will note he has presented the "Yes" vote in a very dynamic way. If one looks at his record and comments in June 2001, he shared many of the reservations I have expressed today. I would like to quote from what the Minister had to say in this regard and perhaps he might clarify matters when responding to my queries. On 21 June 2001, Deputy Roche, in the Official Report, volume 538, columns 1058-61 stated:It is foolhardy to talk about another referendum at this stage unless something fundamental changes. To attempt to rerun a referendum as a means of reversing the democratic decision taken by the people would be rightly regarded as an affront. Something fundamental will have to be changed in the Nice treaty before we can even contemplate putting it before the people again.On 13 December 2000, Deputy John Bruton, then leader of Fine Gael, stated:This is one of the weakest negotiating outcomes achieved by an Irish Government in a European forum since Ireland joined the Union . . .I would like to remind Deputy Durkan of that one.

I mentioned the ICTU and the Defence Forces earlier. I would be very concerned if a section of leadership within congress were breaching policy. I have a problem with the Defence Forces being very political and politicised. I have a genuine fear in that regard. Some of the statements made by the Defence Forces over the past couple of years in relation to NATO and European military forces are a little too political for my liking. I am a firm believer that the Dáil and democratic Government of this State should be the policy and decision makers. I respect all views and it is essential we hear them. As a democrat, I strongly support that view – I am a member of a group called Democrats Against Nice.It is essential that people understand that there are people within this State who strongly believe Ireland should be a broker for peace. We strongly believe Ireland should be out there. In this regard, I think of families in the Lebanon and the Middle East who had a fantastic regard and respect for Irish soldiers on United Nations missions and how they won the respect of many different sides to that conflict. I thought of the presents I saw given by these Lebanese families, at the height of very negative and violent conditions, and how the Irish soldiers enjoyed the warmth and support of these people.I support this amendment. I want us to look forward but try to capture the impartiality and respect we used to have. Many people genuinely fear that we are losing it. I heard the Tánaiste speaking of the Roman Empire and someone else talking of the British Empire and we are now talking about a European empire. I get very worried about that. In case people have not read their history books, empires do not work. The vast majority of EU citizens did not get a chance to vote on this treaty. We are lucky to be given the chance to vote on it, even if the "Yes" parties did not accept the result of the last referendum. It is essential to have a wide-ranging debate on this issue.I thank the Green Party for tabling this amendment and urge all Deputies to support it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	173	I support the spirit of what the Green Party is trying to achieve with this amendment. Essentially it seeks a legally binding commitment that this country will not, at any stage, join a military alliance of states. I will not vote for it but I will support any call for a division on it. I understand that it has been tabled to assist discussion, but it would allow for the ratification of the Treaty of Nice. There are many more problems with that treaty than the issues of militarisation and foreign policy. The amendment says Ireland will not prevent the development of closer co-operation between member states in the area of defence. We should be absolutely opposed to the military alliances that exist and those that are intended to be created in the future. I do not believe this State should stand aside and merely say it will not participate in, for example, common defence but will allow others to go ahead and make plans in that area. What is intended regarding the undoubted plans to militarise Europe has the most serious consequences for the future of the peoples of the continent and the future of the world.It is very clear from the Nice treaty that it is the intention of the major powers to move to what is euphemistically called a common defence. That is a code for a military alliance between the major powers in particular and other countries as well. The annexes that accompanied the French Presidency report are quite detailed in the plans and propositions regarding the military structures which should be set up within the EU. The direction and thrust of the major EU states is crystal clear. The Presidency report on the European security and defence policy includes:to launch and conduct EU-led military operations in response to international crises, the European Union will be able to carry out the full range of Petersberg tasks as defined in the Treaty on European Union: humanitarian and rescue tasks, peace-keeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management.What does "tasks of combat forces in crisis management" mean? The same annex states: "The main challenge for member states is to develop military capabilities which can be put at the disposal of the EU for crisis management purposes. The aim is to mobilise member states' efforts in this sphere."  It is very clear that a very broad mandate is being put in place allowing the military powers in the EU to come together. Various tasks are euphemistically referred to without spelling out that crisis management can mean that the EU will, at a certain stage, throw its weight into the internal affairs of countries outside the EU when it suits the economic or political policy of the Union.The plans for the military structures which are already being set up within the EU are particularly alarming. These are very clearly spelled out in the French Presidency report. These structures are not suddenly appearing now, they have been developed over a period of time to a stage where they are now at a fairly high level of sophistication. The annex says:As provided in the Helsinki report, the European Union Military Committee – EUMC –, established within the Council, is composed of the Chiefs of Defence – CHODs – represented by their military representatives. The EUMC meets at the level of CHODs as and when necessary. This committee gives military advice and makes recommendations to the Political and Security Committee, as well as provides military direction to the European Union Military Staff . . . The EUMC is the highest military body established within the Council.The Nice treaty gives a treaty basis to the political and security committee to direct a policy with regard to the common foreign and defence policy. Here we have a sophisticated political and military structure allowing the EU to act as a military force outside its borders. That vindicates the point I have often made that the real intention of the EU, especially the bigger powers, is to see themselves as both a partner and a rival to the United States in world political, economic, military and diplomatic spheres.It is common knowledge that many people in Brussels get quite annoyed that the financial supports the EU gives to various sections in the Middle East does not garner it the same diplomatic clout as the United States because it is perceived as not having a coherent military structure. We have a responsibility to be quite clear on what is intended. We should take a strong stand against any development which would see the EU developing like the United States of America whose foreign policy has had a disastrous effect on the peoples of the world.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	177	I am specifically addressing the motion and am arguing why I could not agree with the phrase that "This State will not prevent the development of closer co-operation of member states in the area of common defence." I am not dwelling too long on this point. The world stands on the brink of a war led by the United States on the people of Iraq. We do not want to set up another massive capitalist economic power with a military wing which will adopt a similar role in world affairs in the future. The other reason for opposing so-called common defence is the provision in the Nice treaty that the progressive framing of a common defence policy will be supported, as member states consider appropriate, by co-operation between them in the field of armaments. Allowing a common defence to proceed would give moral consent to the armaments industry in the EU. This industry is not widely publicised or discussed in the mass media but its production of obscene weapons of mass destruction annually within the EU amounts to an incredible €55,000 million. Common defence allows the development of that type of Europe, even if Ireland is not direct participating in such defence. The interests of the people of Europe and the world demand that we absolutely oppose the armaments industry and call for its end in Europe and elsewhere. The huge resources criminally wasted in the production of arms should be diverted instead to the well-being of humanity and the transformation of the world in which we live.The declaration on so-called neutrality which accompanies the Nice treaty is a sham. It provides that the Irish people would have to vote on a formal proposal to enter a military alliance but, in reality, successive Governments, including the present one, have acted and act as if they were not neutral and were part of an alliance. If the United States and Britain start to drop bombs on Iraq, will the Government again make facilities at Shannon available for war planes to refuel and assist them in other ways? These are not the actions of a state which takes neutrality seriously.

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	184	When my colleague, Deputy Gormley, moved this amendment three hours ago we did not realise that it would excite so much comment. I welcome the opportunity to respond to the debate.The amendment is an attempt to give Irish constitutional form to the protocol secured by Denmark on the Treaty of Amsterdam. This was promised to Denmark because of its refusal to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. It is worth noting the similarities and highlighting the differences between Ireland and Denmark which are nations of similar size and population. Denmark is somewhat smaller geographically but is similar in its rural-urban make-up. It is also quite similar spatially since much of the population lives around its capital city and the rest is diversely spread throughout the countryside. Ireland and Denmark have much in common. Denmark is a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and, in securing the protocol to the Treaty of Amsterdam, it sought to have nothing to do with the Western European Union. We believe that, likewise, Ireland should have nothing to do with the Western European Union. However, we are also of the opinion that the country should have nothing to do with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. We believe in a policy of active neutrality and have campaigned for the putting in place of legislative and, more important, constitutional measures that will help protect what is commonly perceived and accepted as a positive policy of neutrality in this country. Unfortunately, I do not believe that the measures proposed by the Government in the Bill will help us to achieve this.I welcome the tone and content of Deputy Michael D. Higgins' contribution, which represents a vast improvement on much of what was said on Second Stage. The word "neutrality" is not mentioned in the Schedule, which leaves open so many doors for Ireland's participation in military alliances and conflicts which do not have a European Union context. Under the current wording, we could quite easily join the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and we would not need to have recourse to any vote of the people to allow us to do so. As neutrality seems to be the love that dare not speak its name in respect of the Constitution, we cannot accept what the Government is proposing. It is on those grounds we put forward the amendment.Other Members highlighted the economic cost involved in and even the necessity of having a military outlook towards defending the European Union, in the first instance, and then Ireland as a nation. There are obvious questions which arise in terms of from whom we need to defend ourselves and the context in which such a defence would be required. These are perhaps pertinent queries today, when we are celebrating the anniversary of an horrific act of international terrorism. I do not believe that the ferocity of hatred and zealousness which inspired the 11 September attacks on New York could be directed towards this country, particularly in light of the way we practised our foreign policy in the past. The effects of that type of hatred have shown themselves in the aftermath of the 11 September attacks on the United States with, for example, the deaths of thousands of innocent people in Afghanistan. Are we not in a position to accept that what happened on that day and the subsequent events affected the most powerful political, economic and military nation in the world? America is a country which is armed to the teeth and has always believed itself to be prepared for any eventuality. When the time came, however, everyone witnessed what happened at the World Trade Centre.I cannot accept the arguments put forward by Deputies Mitchell and Durkan that we need, similarly, to engage in an exercise in purchasing for ourselves a military expertise or might that will protect us from unforeseen circumstances which cannot be explained or envisaged. An active foreign policy that promotes Ireland in a positive light is our best protection. We need to pursue a policy of "jaw-jaw" instead of "war-war".Our other objections to what the Government is proposing – which we are trying to change by means of our amendment – revolve around the fact that anything that has already been agreed and has compromised our position as a neutral nation is having an ongoing effect. United States' military aircraft and personnel are still in a position to use Shannon Airport, we are still participating in the Partnership for Peace and we can still become involved in a rapid reaction force, albeit agreed through the Treaty of Amsterdam. We are committed, in economic terms, to ensure that we have an inter-operability with the defence forces of other nations that are involved in those arrangements. I do not believe it is honest to state that the expense only arises as and when we decide to become involved in a particular operation. Those expenses occur on an ongoing basis and they result in our having to make choices now with regard to what are our capital expenditure priorities and how these are going to affect other areas of crucial public expenditure. By committing ourselves to such military bodies, we are compromising what we can do in the health service, in the education sector and in other social areas. The effect will be quite marked.Comments have been made about the effect of foreign direct investment. Deputy Higgins made a fine point about such investment, namely, that we need to recognise that most of it comes from a particular source – the United States. Is our need for such investment predicated on engaging in unquestioning support, in terms of our foreign policy, for the Government of that country and its actions?

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	190	I will conclude on the point relating to foreign investment. In my view, the points made earlier by the Minister about foreign direct investment being scared off if we do not behave or vote in the correct way merely undermines our right as a nation to plot our own course in the world and act in a way we believe might influence international behaviour. For these reasons, our amendment is well argued and should be accepted as a preferable option to the proposals the Government has put forward in the Bill.I am sorry Deputy Joe Higgins does not feel able to support the amendment. I wish to explain to him that it is put forward in the context of being one of several measures we would like to see changed in the Bill. It will be the totality of the views of Members of the House in considering our amendment which will determine whether we will accept the vote at the end of the day. On those grounds, perhaps the Deputy might reconsider whether he will support the amendments we are putting forward.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	191	Deputy Boyle explained that since the amendment was moved we have listened to a number of quite interesting contributions. This is the only real opportunity we have to debate issues in the House because the Second Stage debate is often a set-piece during which Members read from scripts. I will now respond to some of the issues raised since I moved the amendment.Deputy Mitchell argued that, for example, the amendment would not prevent an attack on Ireland and that we would have no defence if terrorists hijacked a plane and used it attack this country. The United States has the best resourced intelligence service and military forces and is the most powerful nation in the world, but it could not prevent the attack on the Twin Towers. The Deputy claimed that neutrality would not help us in the event of an attack but I am stating that his arguments in relation to it – I am trying to adhere as rigidly as possible to the substance of the amendment – are completely and utterly false. By playing a role in the world and, as Deputy Higgins stated, engaging in diplomacy, I believe we could solve a number of major problems. Bombing Afghanistan, as America opted to do, has not solved matters. By playing a positive diplomatic role and solving the difficulties in the Middle East by stating that we mean business in terms of resolving the impasse in Palestine, we could possibly bring an end to our troubles. Deputy Mitchell's argument is extraordinary. He used the word "extraordinary" approximately five times in his contribution, but I will not repeat that particular feat.The Deputy then referred to Srebrenica. How would the amendment provide assistance in respect of that city and what happened there? It is instructive to look at what actually happened at Srebrenica rather than just referring casually to it. There seems to be an idea that a mention of Srebrenica will deflate all arguments on neutrality. That is simply not the case. What happened was that the Dutch, in particular, did not play their role effectively and the French general who was asked to bring in air strikes refused to do so. That was the crucial difference. Two members of NATO, the Dutch and the French, contributed to the terrible massacre which occurred at Srebrenica. On that basis, I argue that bringing Srebrenica into this debate is entirely a red herring.Other issues have been raised. I have great regard and respect for Deputy Joe Higgins who referred to his party's amendment in relation to neutrality. However, there is no specific mention of neutrality in the Government's amendment, nor is there any specific mention of a UN mandate. The Minister of State should tell the House why. I have asked him a number of questions already and I am still awaiting answers. Why are we referred to as a former neutral by NATO countries? Why do the Finns and the Swedes no longer refer to themselves as neutral but as non aligned? I expect answers from the Minister of State to those questions. Why is there no mention of a UN mandate? The reason is, very simply – and I regret being so cynical about this – that the Government wishes to have it in legislation, rather than in the Constitution, so that it can be changed at the stroke of a pen. That has been done many times in the past, as in the case of the Referendum Commission. With the greatest respect to Deputy Higgins, I hope he appreciates the possibility that governments may act in that way and that, at some future time, they will do so. On the rapid reaction force, there is no need to have a UN mandate. That is the factual position and, in this debate, we have not had answers to these very specific problems.The Minister of State, Deputy Roche, has spoken of a changed context. The context has not changed and that is why we have put forward this amendment. The Seville declaration did not change any context. The only change is that Deputy Roche is now a Minister of State. Now that he has got his ministerial merc and the other perks of office, there is an about turn. Suddenly, it is no longer an affront to democracy to have a second referendum – it is now quite acceptable. That is why I have felt compelled to accuse him of hypocrisy. It is blatant hypocrisy on his part to push this referendum at the Irish people for a second time.I ask the Government to consider my party's amendment which carefully addresses the function of the European rapid reaction force. The Minister of State has referred to common or mutual defence. What is really at issue with the rapid reaction force is mutual offence, operating outside of EU borders. Common or mutual defence is an antiquated notion at this stage. It is part of the old NATO architecture. NATO, as I know from my visit to its headquarters more than a year ago, is trying to modernise. It recognised that it had to revise its structures and it did so by incorporating the Partnership for Peace. The Partnership for Peace saved NATO and we are now members of it. The notion of common defence is a redundant concept at this stage. There is now a completely different security architecture in which mutual offence is the by-word.For all those reasons, this House ought to accept the Green Party amendment which, as Deputy Boyle has said, is part of a package which will safeguard Irish neutrality and ensure that we will not have to pay for weapons of mass destruction – the term now being bandied about so frequently by President George Bush. There is no doubt that we are now part of a European rapid reaction force with nuclear capability. Britain, France and other EU countries have nuclear capability. Deputy Durkan's argument that it is preferable to be at the table to decide on these issues is quite bizarre. It would be an equally good argument for joining Fianna Fáil in order to make them good and to ensure they make the right decisions. At some point, one has to make a decision that one will not be part of something that one does not wish to touch with a barge pole. That is how I and my party feel about the European Rapid Reaction Force and that is why we have put forward this amendment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	192	In making my short contribution, I hope to avoid repeating arguments which have been made already. Not being a legal constitutional expert, I am not sure whether certain clauses at the start of Article 29 have greater force than others. In a sense, the first two sections in Article 29 encapsulate the intention of my party's amendment. I argue that our amendment is closer to the spirit of the Constitution than the alternative which the Government is offering. In those first two sections of Article 29, Ireland "reaffirms its devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation among nations, founded on international justice and morality" and "affirms its adherence to the principle of pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination". I submit that what the Government is proposing is, in spirit if not in legal technical terms, in breach of those two statements.One of the main reasons for the defeat of the first referendum on the Nice treaty was that the Irish people still adhere to the sense of the first two sections of Article 29. They genuinely believe the best way forward in international dispute resolution is through international arbitration and judicial determination, not through the creation of rapid reaction forces which can never be neutral or uninfluenced by issues of material or political gain for one country over another. That is at the core of the Green Party amendment and was also at the core of the rejection of the previous referendum. The people have realised the direction the Union is taking and that the Nice treaty is one of a series of treaties bringing this country in that direction. The people do not wish to go in that direction in this specific area.Given the much quoted comments of the Minister of State that the treaty would have to be changed significantly, it is incredible that the Government did not follow the Danish example by seeking a change in the treaty or, if that was not possible, a commitment such as the Danes received that the position would be changed in the next subsequent treaty. That solution is the essence of our amendment. We have a further amendment which takes out the requirement for a protocol in the treaty or in a subsequent treaty and keeps the essence of the commitment we are seeking in our own Constitution.It may still be possible under the Treaty of Nice conditions that such a common defence pact would have to take account of our constitutional requirements. That may become a legal debate but at least it could be something we could hold as a line. The amendments proposed by the Government and the Labour Party miss the main point. We do not object to a common defence – we would come to our neighbour's aid. Rather, we object to a common offence which, as Deputy Gormley said, involves activities outside the European Union countries. These are two simple points but they bear repeating. I support this amendment because it is closer to the intentions of the Irish people and the framers of our Constitution and I hope all parties in this House share its sentiments. Indeed I know many members of Deputy Roche's own party do, although they cannot say so publicly. This referendum is not about party politics. It is about individuals saying what type of country they want and what its role should be in international affairs. I hope the Minister of State bears this in mind and does not forget his own people and where they stand.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	193	This is a minor housekeeping exercise which may be dealt with on Report Stage, so I will keep it brief so as not to take from other Members' speaking time.As we debated this Bill, I asked why it was entitled the Twenty-sixth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2002. Perhaps it is because I am a conservative in constitutional matters, but I would have thought it was the 24th amendment of the Constitution, albeit the 26th attempt at amending it. Perhaps that could be explained at a later stage.In relation to the wording of the amendment, the Irish translation from the English text has been faithful but it states "Ní bhíonn Éire páirteach", whereas, it should probably read "Ní bheidh Éire páirteach". Similarly, in the English text, it should probably state "Ireland shall not", because what it purports to change, in relation to the legislation, is in the future tense. That is a minor editing point which can be handled later.In reply to two small points that have been raised – and I accept there is a difference in interpretation – following from Deputy Eamon Ryan's point relating to Article 29 in which he correctly quoted sections 1 and 2, one could also argue that it behoves one – the principles having been stated that constitute the peaceful settlement of disputes – to define what one means by neutrality. That is what motivated the choice of the Labour Party. Having accepted the spirit of Articles 29.1 and 29.2, it was considered preferable to define what one meant in terms of a practical venture from out of the Constitution which is why it is defined in terms of military and defence matters.It is also interesting to note that while the amendment accepts the principle of not interfering with other states' exercise of co-operation, it is in that sense accepting autonomous versions of sovereignty. In the later amendments, which are not entirely consistent with it, a different version of sovereignty is sought, because it exercises sovereignty in the later sections to seek to curtail the exercise of other states' right to co-operate. In fairness, the amendment on which we differ is consistent – being the one the Green Party tabled on the last occasion and on which it has developed its arguments.In relation to the issue of UN established forces there is a real difficulty. We need to consider whether we should solve the matter in terms of constitutional reference or in relation to amendment of the Defence Act. Replies to parliamentary questions on this precise point are less than satisfactory in this regard. There is some confusion as to what is a "force established by the United Nations", what is a "force established with the authority of the United Nations" and what is "action taken in the spirit of the United Nations"? It should be judged entirely in terms of the discussion, to which I referred earlier, about the ambiguity and the need for transparency in how these textual references are used. They are not the same. Again, one must return to previous arguments made in the discussion about the Petersberg Tasks.The attitude of the permanent members of the Security Council of the United Nations and their possession of a veto means there are particular tasks which the refusal of enabling action from the Security Council might prevent but which human rights requirements might demand. Why, for example, has there been such morally intolerable silence about what is taking place in Chechnya? The answer is that with a Russian veto on the Security Council, they will not discuss Chechnya. Likewise, with the Chinese veto, they will not discuss Tibet and with the US veto, they will not discuss prisoners in the US and so it rolls on. One must take account of that. Therefore, on balance, the appropriate route to take is that of amending legislation. However, in fairness to those participating in the debate, there should be some response from the Government to say what accompanying changes it envisages to the Defence Act because amendment is necessary.

#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	195	That is not a point of order. The Deputy made his contribution and I call the Minister of State.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Although the debate was valuable, we have not progressed the argument over the past hour and a half. The first fundamental point, made by myself and Deputy Michael D. Higgins, is that the protocol arrangement which is proposed in this amendment is not just inoperable, it is inappropriate and is far weaker than that proposed. As Deputy Higgins said in his final contribution, it is far better to write these issues into our Constitution. He also pointed out that we are trying to deal with our sovereignty rather than trying to impose it on anyone else. He spoke of a future reference to one of the other Green Party amendments which I hope we will reach.Deputy Finian McGrath seems to think that political debate is about assertion. He suggested that Irish troops are now to be involved in offensive operations. I have no idea where he got that idea from because it is simply untruthful. It ill behoves any Member of this House to make assertions which are simply not true. Perhaps I misheard the Deputy and, if so, I apologise but I am fairly clear that is what he said. The Deputy also ignored any reference to the issue before us which is the type of phrasing we want to put into the Constitution.Deputy Joe Higgins' contribution was interesting because, in contradicting the contributions from the Green Party Members, he recognised the significance of the phrase "common defence" and his understanding of that phrase is in concurrence with mine. The Government proposes to insert that particular set of words, which have a specific focus, into the Constitution and by so doing will give the Irish people the best guarantee they can have. Returning again to the point made by Deputy Higgins in his contribution, if one examines Articles 29.1 and 29.2, it clearly follows that this is the appropriate way to move forward.Deputy Boyle referred to a protocol and to the Danish situation. With all respect, there is a difference between the situation now and the situation in which the Danes found themselves after the Maastricht treaty. The reason a protocol is not appropriate now is that we are not trying to take something out or to move away from something that is in the Treaty of Nice. There is nothing in this regard in the treaty of Nice so the concept of using a protocol as the Danes used it with regard to the Maastricht treaty, and got it adhered to following the Edinburgh Council and put into the Amsterdam treaty, is inappropriate. It is not the appropriate way to move and there is no logic in making that parallel. Deputy Boyle may nod all he wants but if he says with as much vigour as he can that this is Christmas Eve, it is still not Christmas Eve. The reality is that there is nothing in the treaty that would be taken out or deferred from by way of a protocol.In deference to the Ceann Comhairle's judgment I simply make a reference that Deputy Boyle is off mark on foreign direct investment but I have already dealt with that.

If we were to take the advice of Deputy Boyle, who is playing with fire in this regard, we would lose many more jobs. We would be placing ourselves in a peripheral position in Europe. As The Economist's intelligence unit said we would create question marks about where we stand and we would make things extremely difficult.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	207	We are. One other issue that has struck me is that one of the parties who argued long and hard on the issue of neutrality, Sinn Féin, is not here throughout this entire part of the debate. That is reprehensible because we all remember in the last referendum campaign that party's attacks and complaints about militarism. I would have expected Sinn Féin members to be here if they had something to say on the issue. I give credit to the Members from the Green Party who have been present for the past three hours and to Deputy Finian McGrath, with whom I disagree, and Deputy Joe Higgins who are here and making a contribution. I find it astonishing that a political party that made such a big issue of this last time out does not even bother to sit in the Chamber.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	211	Deputy Gormley asked specific questions about the Finns and the Swedes. It is up to them to decide what is right and appropriate for Finland and Sweden. It is not up to us to decide for them. The interesting point which illustrates—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	213	Well it is of interest regarding the Deputy's attitude. The Finns have always used the term non-aligned. The Swedes too are interesting and I had an interesting discussion with the present administration of Sweden as to why they have used the word "non-aligned" as opposed to neutral. The interesting point is that their argument asks the question – neutral against what? That is what determines their attitude. They have also argued that "non-aligned" is a more accurate description of where they are at.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	214	And where we are.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	215	We go back to the outset of this debate. The Deputy said that reference to Srebrenica had nothing to do with this debate. Unfortunately it does if we are discussing what we mean by neutrality. I have always taken the view that it is difficult to be neutral in the absolutist sense. Faced with a great good or a great evil I am not sure what the Deputy would choose but I would choose good rather than evil.The Deputy mentioned the specific issue of Srebrenica, and it was raised by several people. It illustrates something interesting. It confronts us with the issue of the impotency of a number of institutions we have always had as touchstones, including the United Nations. The operation that broke down there was a UN operation. I am not sure who did or did not give the orders but I have read the facts in recent material.The key issue here is how we deal with the issue. We all agree that our neutrality was an issue in the last referendum. It was dealt with and it is one of the issues to which the Government has responded specifically. We did negotiate the Seville Accords. It can be argued that these contributions by 15 member states and by ten applicant countries are of no significance. I would disagree because I believe that a solemn, political undertaking given by a group of nations has significance. I have not reached the Deputy's point of cynicism yet. Even if the Deputy is right, what we are doing today and when we give the people the choice when they vote in the referendum is that for the first time in our history we are writing into the Constitution a specific prohibition to any Government to enter into a common defence without first having a referendum of the people.As Deputy Michael D. Higgins as pointed out, that is the most appropriate way of achieving that desire. I hoped that people who seriously cared about the neutrality of this nation would have seen that as a major and progressive step forward. There was a good deal of debate. This was not a set of phrases plucked out of the air. The context has changed dramatically because for the first time the people will be able to put into the Constitution the only kind of guarantee that really counts – the guarantee by the sovereign people to the sovereign people in perpetuity that no Government can enter into a common defence without their prior approval in a referendum. That is significant progress.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I will be brief as I do not wish to prolong this. My colleague, Deputy Eamon Ryan, made an important point regarding Srebrenica. It is not a case of a "do nothing" attitude. We have supported, as can be seen from the voting record, UN action in East Timor and other countries and we supported UN action in Yugoslavia. An analysis of what actually happened reveals clearly that the fault lay with the Dutch who behaved in a disgraceful way. There is no way we would condone that sort of cowardice. Ours is not a "do nothing" attitude. We are talking about a constructive neutrality.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I am sorry, but I was not saying that it was.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	218	This is the impression that was being created. When confronted by a great evil what does one do? I and my colleagues say we do something. In regard to the question of what is going into the Constitution I have asked a direct question. Why is there no mention of neutrality? The Minister says that he wants to use the word "neutrality" and not the concept "non-aligned", which is more accurate. Why is it not put into the Constitution?The Minister's colleague, Deputy Cowen, talks constantly about the UN mandate. Why is that not put into the Constitution if it is so important. The Minister has failed to answer those two fundamental questions because he does not have the answers. This amendment is a piece of fluff, a way of pulling wool over people's eyes. As this debate progresses in the coming weeks and members of my party discuss these issues on television and radio with the Minister of State, the true extent of this deception will be revealed. The Government's proposal will be defeated on that basis.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	219	Many people would have been much happier if the common defence question had been spelt out much more clearly. The overwhelming majority of people in this State would prefer if we did not support the attempts of the big powers to coalesce, pool their armaments and use their military and economic might to malignly influence economic conditions in poorer countries. It would be far better to respect the opposition of the majority of the people, which was one reason the treaty was rejected last year. I do not believe that the section of the Bill that the Government is putting to the people goes far enough in respect of common defence. The implication is that the country will stand outside such an alliance, but will do nothing to stop the undoubted thrust of powerful EU states in the direction of militarisation.Today is 11 September and today, of all days, this issue should stand clarified in people's minds. The horror inflicted in New York a year ago resulted directly from the manner in which the major powers used and abused their power and armaments for decades in pursuit of economic goals and the maximisation of the super profits of their major corporations. It is twisted logic, therefore, that such a horror was visited on thousands of innocent Americans.Many of us are disturbed that the media here and throughout Europe stopped still today to mark the first anniversary of 11 September 2001. While we were shocked by the horror and unspeakable anguish suffered on that date, and endured to this day by many, we feel strongly that it is criminally negligent that the suffering of hundreds of thousands of poor people in the Third World as a result of the actions of the western powers is dismissed as nothing. Their plight does not receive acres of newspaper space and hours of television time. As we prepared to stand in the House today to honour thousands of last year's innocent victims, I insisted that we should remember the innocent victims of the great powers, whose suffering is equally real.Deputy Gay Mitchell attacked the Green Party and others for advocating the United Nations deal with security matters, as opposed to an EU military force. I disagree in that respect with my colleagues in the Green Party and Deputy Higgins of the Labour Party, with whom I agree on many international issues. I do not believe that the United Nations, as presently constituted, is an organisation which we can trust to defend the civil rights of the world's poor or to stand for the type of world where justice is implemented in the economic, social and political spheres. The five permanent members of the UN Security Council contain some gross violators of human and civil rights. Russia has played a monstrous role in crushing the people of Chechnya. China routinely smashes all opposition within its borders, including that of free trade unions and minority religions. I do not believe we should look to such countries as an alternative to the European Union.The horror of 11 September 2001 would be unthinkable in a world in which economic management and political structures are transformed to the extent that people no longer feel they have to visit horrific destruction on others. The €55 billion wasted on armaments each year in the European Union, as well as the hundreds of billions of dollars wasted by the United States and others on the armaments of destruction each year, should be directed to transforming the lives of hundreds of millions of poor and impoverished people. If other massive resources, such as the energies of thousands of scientists and others playing ancillary roles in the armaments industry, were diverted to eradicating the problems of poverty, hunger, sanitation and conflict, there would be no al-Qaeda and no dictatorships. We would have a transformed world. Why do people not talk about taking such measures as a solution to some of the world's problems? Resolving such problems involves shifting power democratically from multinational corporations to ordinary people. These issues need to be addressed radically.An unfortunate tragedy for the people of the United States is that the organisation which carried out the atrocities on this day last year was called into being by the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia when the jihad was declared in Afghanistan. Fanatics were called from all over the Muslim world to be armed and trained by the countries I have mentioned, with dire consequences for the people of New York, Algeria and other places where the horror campaign was pursued. The issues we are discussing should be dealt with in a more radical way, rather than tip-toeing around with a structure here and a structure there, a solution too often suggested in this debate.

We would all favour a better world if such a thing were possible. In response to Deputy Gormley's most recent contribution, I point out that the issue of neutrality is addressed in amendment No. 7 in his name. We are not discussing that amendment at this stage.

Perhaps he will tell us if Ireland is neutral in the face of international terrorism. Obviously not. Are we neutral when it comes to a choice between good and evil? Obviously not. Were we ideologically neutral during the Cold War? Clearly not. We have to use words with precision when we introduce them into the—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	233	There is no point in continuing in this manner because we owe it to ourselves to listen. When we import terms into the Constitution, we must be clear what we mean by them. The issue is not as well defined as Deputies would strive to suggest to the people. They can sneer and snigger, but they will avoid defining precisely what they mean every time. Every time the question is asked they will slither away from the answer, they will have another question. The question, however, must be answered before we put this into the Constitution. That is the reason the constitutional amendment as it is framed is superior in every regard to this loose formulation which the Green Party would have us introduce, a formulation which would end up being determined, not by the Irish people, but in court.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	234	This is incredible. There is now a Seville declaration to protect neutrality that the Minister of State says he cannot define properly but about which he has an intuition. I do not know where he is going with this, but he is tying himself in knots.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	235	I will not allow the Deputy to do what he always tries to do. We have a precise formulation in the phrase which will be put to the people. The Deputy is trying to suggest, and anyone with any sense—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	237	—will see this, that we should go back to what the Danes did in the Maastricht treaty. What they did is of no relevance whatsoever to the situation in which we now find ourselves. We are offering the people in this amendment the best guarantee they can possibly have – their own guarantee. As Deputy Michael Higgins said, it is the appropriate guarantee because it is written into the Constitution. If that could be improved, fine, the Deputy should come forward with an improvement, but the suggestion that there is some magic solution is not good enough.The people must be offered certainty, they must be offered something relevant. What the Deputy has been suggesting for the last three hours is not just inoperable, it is also inappropriate. The suggestion that we should import what the Danes did way back in the Maastricht treaty is irrelevant in this situation. The suggestion that we could insert a protocol removing ourselves from something that is not in the treaty is not only irrelevant, it would also be dishonest to put such a proposition to the people. We must come into this House and honestly deal with the situation that faces us. To suggest that something that was relevant in the Maastricht treaty is relevant now is not honest and not an appropriate response to where we find ourselves. To suggest that we can put words that we do not properly define into the Constitution is not truthful and a service to the people.We are offering in this amendment the first opportunity the people will have to write into the Constitution a guarantee given by themselves to all generations of Irish people to come that no Government can enter the issue of common defence without a referendum. That is remarkable progress. The Deputies may wish to dismiss it, they may wish to slither away from the reality that they must defend what they are trying to do, but, as has been pointed out repeatedly, the proposition they are taking has no relevance. The concept that what the Danes did in the Maastricht treaty is a precedent is not just inaccurate, it is also irrelevant. The Danes were trying to exclude themselves from an undertaking they had given in the Maastricht treaty which they could not operate any further. That is the reason it was appropriate for them to go for a protocol at the time. That is not an appropriate way for us to address this issue. The situation was addressed clearly by Deputy Michael Higgins when he pointed out the reason this is the appropriate way to approach the issue.

The Government is committed to maintaining a force of 850 troops for use in UN peacekeeping missions, where we have an extremely honourable record. It has now also committed 850 troops to a European rapid reaction force which would operate under the Petersberg Tasks. It is clear the Defence Forces cannot maintain two such military units and we must make a choice as to where we allocate our resources. With the exceptions of the IBEC and Cork Chamber of Commerce cumainn, all Fianna Fáil cumainn would say – in the honourable tradition of the Minister of State's party – that they want the Defence Forces to wear the UN helmet and not operate under an EU force. That is the decision that the Government must take when it votes on this amendment.

I cannot understand how it is suggested that in the event of something like that happening we would have to have a referendum. We could not allow anybody to help or save us. Simplistic solutions are being put forward in relation to what happened in Bosnia and that part of Europe that has caused problems over the past ten years or so since the fall of the Berlin Wall. I support strongly the notion of working under the UN Charter, but the UN failed in that case sadly and other means had to be found to protect the people. We could have sat by as a neutral country, as could all other European countries, and perhaps it would have been the right thing to do, but a lot of people died. The people out there did not think we should stand by or detach ourselves from reality. Deputy Michael D. Higgins and I were both members of the Committee on European Affairs at that time and the ambassadors from all surrounding countries – Italy, France and Germany – were called before the committee. These all had an input but were manacled and could not take action for one reason or another. The killing went on all around them. I do not suggest that would be replicated here, but a serious danger is emerging.Other people read and hear what we say and take it on board. In the present global climate, there are those who have the power and resources to be able to take on a small country readily and easily. They do so and will not respect anybody's neutrality and I merely point out that in those circumstances telling an aggressor they cannot act in a certain way because we are a neutral country just would not work.

I make it a point never to interrupt another speaker and I hope that those who have arrived in the House in recent years will try to continue that tradition.Those are my views and I hold them sincerely. They might not be correct – although I hope they are – but they are mine. I fully respect the points made by Deputy Michael Higgins who is equally committed to peaceful resolution of conflicts that have arisen and who has done a tremendous amount of work, much more than he would ever take credit for. We do not agree fully on this matter although we have agreed on others in the past. We need to tell the House what we have learned over the years from our experiences and let people make up their own minds.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	257	When the Minister speaks in regard to the section on common defence and gives it massive historic importance, we should point out how limited it is as it refers simply to decisions taken by the European Council. It is a very narrow provision relating simply to the EU and common defence and is not by any means an assertion that this country will be genuinely neutral. The amendment for which the Minister claims historical recognition makes no provision for the possibility of the United States of America and Britain launching a criminal assault on the people of Iraq which would undoubtedly cause thousands of innocent people to die. It would happily allow this Government to support the USA in such a criminal endeavour and it is, therefore, important that we see that it relates to one narrow aspect of militarism as far as our globe is concerned. We cannot allow the Minister to give the impression that it allows the Government to claim that it rejects all military alliances. Clearly, this and successive Governments support and have supported major powers acting in their own interests and brutalising many poor peoples around the world.Cuireadh an leasú.

In Part 1, page 6, lines 7 to 11, to delete subsection 8º,andIn Part 2, page 6, lines 21 to 25, to delete subsection 8º.After a lengthy debate on the issue of neutrality and its constitutional position I would like to move to a second area of major concern to the Green Party in relation to the Treaty of Nice and its possible effect if ratified and accepted by the electorate. “Enhanced co-operation” is a term which, on the surface, appears innocuous and even benign, but which might have a more proper role in the fiction of Orwell or Huxley. It is a combination of words meant to have a positive purpose, but which, when examined, have an altogether more sinister intent.It is not easy to object to a better or improved way of working together. That means that we have to justify what we are saying. The operative term here is "we"; who are the "we" and who is defining it. In terms of future development, the European Union is no longer likely to be a collection of equal status states but is developing into a two-tier model with various degrees and classes of membership. On these grounds enhanced co-operation should be very much objected to. It could also be said that forms of enhanced co-operation already exist. It has been put to us on the "No" side of the argument that we presume to speak on behalf of applicant countries and their interests. If one takes that argument and puts it to its other extreme, then the process that existed in terms of the community model that a ratification was not possible until all 15 countries agreed to it, was ignored. The Irish electorate chose not to ratify the Treaty of Nice in 2001, as was their sovereign choice, and did so before any other sovereign government in the EU chose to embark on its ratification process. We had the first attempt at enhanced co-operation by 14 member governments choosing to ignore the decision of the Irish people. That is enhanced co-operation in reality; that is enhanced co-operation in practice.We have our own peculiar form of enhanced co-operation in the operation of this House. We have classes of membership for political parties depending on how established they are and how many Members they have. The idea of political parties having equal access, status and opportunity in this House is a very good metaphor for how the EU is likely to shape up in the coming years, should we agree to this direction and should the people be persuaded by the type of emotional bullying and blackmail that has been engaged in during this debate to date.If we look at the phrases that accompany the idea of enhanced co-operation in regard to the Treaty of Nice we see clauses such as: "shall be aimed at safeguarding the values and serving the interests of the Union as a whole by asserting its identity as a coherent force on the international scene". This seems to be the very act of nation building; taking upon the organisation of the European Union those rights and decisions that should properly be the decisions of a sovereign nation state. There is further talk "of enabling the Union to develop more rapidly into an area of freedom, security and justice while respecting the powers of the European Community". Again, we are in Orwellian-speak here with the juxtaposition of terms such as "freedom, security and justice" with a term such as "respecting the power". We are talking about a political system that is getting further and further removed from the ordinary citizen. What enhanced co-operation is about is defining the right to make decisions on behalf of a broad mass of people with minimal input on their part. On these democratic grounds the Green Party is very strongly opposed to what is being proposed here.The qualifier in regard to enhanced co-operation is that "Member States which are not party to such co-operation shall not impede the implementation thereof by participating Member States". I suspect it will be an argument made by the Government and other parties supporting the idea of the Treaty of Nice and its proposals on enhanced co-operation that we should not interfere in the actions of other member states. It might even be argued in regard to the debate we just had on neutrality where we did make that distinction that it might be inconsistent on our part. The argument I make in that regard is that, unfortunately, in the sphere of military affairs and defence policies there is already an infrastructure that was put in place that pre-dates the European Union. It exists as a political reality that we have to face.The problem with enhanced co-operation and what is likely to follow the decision making structures that evolve in this way, is that we will be allowing on one level, either through our participation or our non-participation, decisions to be made that will have an impact on us as a nation or will have an impact on the cohesion of the European Union as a political structure that can work in its proper interests of members and citizens. An example of that could be in regard to the applicant states where we see their introduction into membership of the EU that is on a take it or leave it basis.In regard to how we proceed with this amendment, I put it to the House that the greatest concern outside the neutrality and military aspect, as far as the Green Party is concerned, is the existence of the democratic deficit which is further entrenched through these provisions and the distance between how individual citizens are interacting with the nation state. We see this most particularly in this country in how people are being lectured to on how they should, or should not, have a role in how Europe is being developed. I await with interest the arguments that will be made against this amendment.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	285	I see this as being a very critical component of the Nice treaty. I actually see it as one of the main reasons the treaty is being brought forward by the European Union states at this time. The provision for enhanced co-operation which is hereby provided really responds to the impatience, especially of some of the larger states, to move ahead with projects of their own, particularly in the context of an enlarged Union where they might feel themselves dogged by weaker states less economically and politically developed and less equipped in various ways coming into the Union.Instead of moving forward as one Union of 27 states, they are hereby putting in a provision whereby a number of states, which will in effect be the most powerful ones, can move ahead rapidly to suit their own interests. Therefore, it is clearly naked self-interest on the part of some of the major powers within the EU that dictates this particular provision for enhanced co-operation. This is why, when we were being told in the course of the debate that the Nice treaty is absolutely essential for enlargement, we responded that many key provisions of the treaty are not essential for enlargement and that this is one of those. If they want to go ahead and enlarge the EU they could do so without putting in the provision for enhanced co-operation. More than anything else, this justifies the claim made by me and others that enlargement was the means by which they levered other key provisions, particularly that pertaining to enhanced co-operation, into the treaty because it is how some of the key powers wish to move forward.The provisions in the articles whose deletion we have recommended should make very disturbing reading, particularly for the smaller states within the EU, because it is quite clear that in matters of crucial self-interest – economics, foreign policy and other matters – they will be left behind should it suit the larger states. That is what this provision is designed to do.We must stress that this provision is couched in very vague terms, which means it can have a very wide remit. What precisely does enhanced co-operation mean? The Government and EU, to enable a better, more full and honest debate, should outline the areas where this could become a reality and the effect it would have on how the EU moves forward. This is because it is laying down very vague but very general principles that can have a very wide application in economic matters. As stated in Article 1.6, it can apply to joint action or a common position and the foreign and security policy, and only military or defence implications – it is narrowed down to that – are not included.With regard to enhanced co-operation in respect of common foreign and security policy, it is allowed that a qualified majority is sufficient to enable a group of states to move forward. That has very sinister connotations because it means that a group of states – it will, in all cases, be the larger ones – can conspire among themselves to advance their particular interests in dealings in the international arena. Eight states, for example, as opposed to the 27 of an enlarged Union, could do so.In the past ten years, with regard to matters of critical foreign policy, we have seen interference by some of the major powers outside their own borders, with very dire results. For example, the German interference in Slovenia at the beginning of the 1990s had an extremely negative effect on the whole region. Germany actively conspired with the Slovene Nationalists to bring about a set of circumstances in which Slovenia, in a very pre-emptive fashion, declared a secession from Yugoslavia.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	286	What a tragedy.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	287	The result was to give a carte blanche to all the Nationalists within the Yugoslav Federation and the reactionaries such as Milosevic to jockey in their own self-interest and in the interest of the cliques around them, using their positions as different national entities within the federation, with catastrophic consequences.This is not about denying any nation the right to self-determination, to which every nation, including Slovenia, has the right. If, instead of interfering in that extremely negative way at the beginning of the 1990s with what was a powder keg in the Balkans, the thrust of policy and resources concerned how the people of the federation could have moved forward by way of mutual co-operation between the different nationalities, with resources being poured in, the horror that emerged in the Balkan war could have been avoided entirely. That was a very concrete example of how a major, powerful country within the EU could interfere in foreign policy to the grave detriment of a people, in this case the people of the former Yugoslav Federation.The Minister of State may shake his head. I ask him to respond to the points that are being made concretely because the provision for enhanced co-operation gives powers such as Germany, France and others the right to move ahead at a rapid pace in similar circumstances in other areas of the globe. They can do so by qualified majority. Therefore, if the Irish Government took a different line – let us say, optimistically and hopefully, a line in the best interests of the ordinary people of whichever country was the subject of designs by the major powers – it would be left on the sidelines. This is because it could be outvoted in providing enhanced co-operation in regard to a crucial issue such as that. That is a key point in terms of how the provision affects foreign policy.Article 1.9 refers to enhanced co-operation "enabling the Union to develop more rapidly into an area of freedom, security and justice". How could it be that some states may move "more rapidly into an area of freedom, security and justice"? If we take those words at face value, does that mean that those left behind will be less free, less secure and less just? What is the meaning of this? To find the meaning, we have to decode much of the language that exists in this treaty. The words used do not take on their normal meaning. This means a number of states could move to create a zone within a zone within the EU. We had a disgraceful example of this during the EU summit in Gothenburg last summer. A few chiefs of police in Sweden, which was hosting the EU summit, unilaterally revoked the arrangements of the Schengen Agreement overnight. They then incarcerated peaceful protesters in buses – one group had travelled from Germany – and prevented them participating in peaceful demonstrations in Gothenburg. I know some of the activists involved. They were brought to a disused military barracks, held there all day and were then sent, under armed escort to the Danish border to be further escorted to Germany. We witnessed a similar situation during a recent meeting in Spain. Peaceful protesters travelling from Portugal – EU citizens – were arrested by the Spanish police and prevented from entering Spain. What then do we mean about freedom, security and justice? It means states can make arrangements which can give rise to situations such as I have outlined.It is very interesting to note, when it comes to economic matters, that Article 1.11 provides that enhanced co-operation does not distort competition. This ensures the economic thrust towards privatisation of state enterprises, deregulation of services and the smashing of state subsidies – this will apply in particular to some of the eastern European applicants – is not allowed. This means the policy of the European Union which is dictated by the European round table and other major industrialists continues to be implemented. That is, essentially, a carte blanche for the exploitation by multinational corporations. Some of the workers in eastern Europe, coming out of a grim Stalinist dictatorship will suffer the depredations of the multinationals.Article 1.12 suggests that enhanced co-operation shall be open to all member states who join the EU. A situation could arise in regard to foreign policy and economic matters that some states, particularly weaker ones, will not be able to keep pace. Therefore, while allowing this in practice, it is very likely that what one will have is an increasing division between blocks within the EU. That is why we said this leads to a two-tier and two-speed Europe.We will also have the spectacle within the Council of Prime Ministers that while all members of the council shall be able to take part in the deliberations in regard to enhanced co-operation, only those representing member states participating in enhanced co-operation shall take part in the adoption of decisions, which is ludicrous. One could then have a situation whereby Governments representing their people, who may have very strong views on a particular area of enhanced co-operation in foreign policy, may speak at a meeting but may not vote when those participating move to take a decision that may be inimical to the interests of the people of Europe generally. We will have a two-tier system within the one room as provided for here. Some Prime Ministers and Ministers will be able to vote on particular issues with others being able to speak but not vote. It is clear that we are setting up a situation whereby the main players within the EU shall not allow themselves to be hindered when they wish to move forward with projects that suit them.

#ConorLenihan	unknown-#ConorLenihan-party	unknown-#ConorLenihan-dob	unknown-#ConorLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	291	While I have a few points I would like to raise, I am intrigued by the reference to people emerging from a grim Stalinist dictatorship and the depiction of eastern European countries as somehow emerging from that into becoming second class citizens. Deputy Higgins also made reference to the Slovenian people. He appears to be suggesting that the Slovenians would have been better off if they had been maintained within a structure created by a kind of Stalinist dictatorship in Yugoslavia where they would not be allowed to leave and so a gentle revolution would allow them to enhance and improve their mutual respect within the Yugoslav structure. Whatever the reasons for the blood letting in the Balkans, there is a longer historical lineage than the mere creation of the single structure created by Tito following the war. This is total madness. It is a view of history totally without rationale. We should not suggest people should be imprisoned in structures of that kind.It is deeply ironic that so-called left wing Deputies in this House are making the case against enhanced co-operation which is the subject of the amendments before us. The whole idea of enhanced co-operation is almost intrinsically left wing. It is inclusive and allows people who have reservations and do not wish to move ahead with certain ideas, structures and policies to opt out. It is the idea of a multi-speed Europe whereby people can actually pick and choose at which level they wish to participate. I do not see this as a menacing and threatening thing. It is an opportunity for smaller countries – and larger countries if they so wish – to opt out of areas of co-operation. It is almost a negation of some of the fears stirred up on the opposite side of the House in regard to this treaty. Small and big countries will enjoy the protections created by this treaty.Deputy Higgins spoke of big countries while conveniently forgetting that it requires a minimum of eight countries for any move on enhanced co-operation to occur. If memory serves me correctly, there are no big countries in Europe in terms of rich, heavyweight industrially populated states. Therefore, by definition, to move to a position of enhanced co-operation will require the consent of a smaller country other than those depicted and spoken about. Enhanced co-operation is almost the incarnation of political correctness at a European level. It allows people to pick and choose the level of co-operation for which they want to opt, which is good. It underpins and protects Ireland's unique position.One of the huge canards being introduced into this campaign is the notion that the other countries can, under enhanced co-operation, move ahead with changes regarding our taxation code, specifically corporation tax. One of the great achievements of this treaty which does not seem to have received as much publicity as it should have is that it copper fastens our low corporation tax rates. Some of the larger countries are very jealous of our low corporation tax rates and have indicated on many occasions in the last decade that they would like to see them changed to their higher rates. One of the logical consequences of a "No" vote to this treaty is that the big countries will come after our tax rates again. The Treaty of Nice protects our tax rates because it requires unanimity—

Its members voted "No" in great numbers in the last referendum because they had the fear that the treaty would facilitate an attack by the larger European countries and bureaucrats against our very low corporation tax rates. They were obviously mistaken in forming this opinion.I was intrigued by Deputy Boyle's statements earlier, which displayed a degree of snobbery normally associated with the right rather than the left, when he suggested that because of our concerns on foreign direct investment, we should not be influenced—

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	300	Deputy Joe Higgins referred to Slovenia earlier. I was out of the House to attend a meeting of the Joint Committee on European Affairs and had the opportunity to meet with the Slovenian ambassador. Slovenia is about to have a referendum on joining the EU. If what Deputy Higgins suggested had taken place, they would not be in a position to do so. Opinion polls indicate that between 60% and 70% of the population will vote and Slovenia will not be a net beneficiary when it joins. I do not think the alternative was between what happened and total peace. The alternative was to leave them under Milosevic's Yugoslavia rather than under his Serbia. The Deputy is really arguing against his own point when he says that this happened. That happened outside of enhanced co-operation. The very point is that it happened outside the institutions of the European Union. The Italians, Greeks and Germans all had their own interests and the Russians had a particular interest. The Muslims were left out on their own. I do not think Deputy Higgins's argument stands up.I wish to refer to a briefing document available from the Institute of European Affairs. It was prepared by Mr. Tony Brown, an eminent and prominent member of the Labour Party. He is a man of great dignity and has given a great amount of time to the idea of a peaceful and stable Europe. I am honoured to be able to quote him. His document explains the issues on this question. It states:It [enhanced co-operation] allows some member states to move forward in a specific policy area at a faster pace than others, which are unable or unwilling to do so. But it also ensures that all member states are entitled to join in when they are able and wish to do so. The issue is whether enhanced co-operation will do no more than accommodate diversity in an enlarged Union, or will lead to two classes of EU membership.That is really the issue. He goes on to discuss how this happens and gives examples:For example, in the 1990s there was general agreement that major improvements should be made in workers' rights and other social policies, but the UK disagreed. It was therefore decided that the UK should be allowed to remain outside the arrangement while the others went ahead with the so-called Social Chapter of the Maastricht Treaty.That was an example of enhanced co-operation and how they got around it. It is not all negative.It is worthwhile to spend some time on the issue of enhanced co-operation because it is an interesting development. Like any part of foreign policy, it is an area this and every other State will have to participate in and watch with care. It is not the bogeyman. If we want to participate with seven other member states in some sort of fisheries co-operation we should not have to put it to the people in a referendum. The Government is elected and paid to take these decisions and to account to this House. We cannot have referendums on such issues, as one of the amendments suggests. Another amendment which proposes to delete subsection 8º would delete the proposal to come back to the Houses of the Oireachtas.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	302	It is an extraordinary suggestion to make.Mr. Brown makes the following points regarding enhanced co-operation:Under enhanced co-operation a number of EU member states – less than the full membership of the Union – may co-operate more closely in certain areas of activity on the basis of rules laid down in the treaties. The Amsterdam treaty in 1997 set down general rules and conditions for enhanced co-operation. These provisions were never used but there was a growing recognition that, in an enlarged Union, situations might arise where a number of member states might wish to co-operate in a policy area where they had a common interest and where others did not. It was considered essential that any such initiative should take place inside, rather than outside, the structures of the European Union and its institutions. For these reasons, the rules governing enhanced co-operation were re-examined in the discussions which led to the Nice treaty and amended provisions were included in the text of the treaty.The Nice treaty sets out these amended rules for accommodating diversity in an enlarged EU. The most important of these are as follows:Any initiative for enhanced co-operation must involve a minimum of eight member states but must be open to any others which wish to join at a later stage. The initiative must have the aim of promoting and furthering the objectives and interests of the Union and must not be exclusive or divisive. It must respect the treaties and the institutional framework of the Union. It must also respect the existing body of EU rules and laws, and must not infringe on areas within the Union's exclusive competence – such as the Common Agricultural Policy. Enhanced co-operation cannot operate to the detriment of the political or economic rights of other member states. Enhanced co-operation may not apply to military or defence matters. Before any initiative can be authorised it must be established that its objectives cannot be attained within a reasonable period by working within the existing treaty provisions.The decision to allow an initiative to proceed will be made in the Council by qualified majority vote but with a right of veto for individual member states in the general area of common foreign and security policy.Could anything be more surrounded by proper checks and balances? Nothing in that would lead to some of the outcomes which have been suggested.Tony Brown further states in the document he wrote for the IEA:In a union of 27 member states under the enhanced co-operation rules, an initiative by any eight would require the support of at least another six to produce a majority under the qualified majority voting system. That means it would require the support of at least 14 of the 27 member states because of the way qualified majority voting will work afterwards.All of this must be taken into account in the arguments being made.The proposed constitutional amendment makes specific provision for possible Irish participation in enhanced co-operation initiatives should we so choose at some stage in the future. I have outlined examples of enhanced co-operation such as the Social Charter, EMU and Schengen. Under enhanced co-operation it will be necessary to use the institutions of the Union, for example the Parliament and the Commission. Commissioners take an oath of office and their job is to protect and uphold the treaties of the Union. Pursuing enhanced co-operation through the institutions of the Union, even if we are not involved, is a guarantee that our best interests will be served. There is nothing to stop three, five, six or eight members coming to arrangements themselves. That is what happened in the case of the recognition of the former Yugoslavia. It is worth debating this issue. The Deputies who tabled these amendments have done a service by bringing the issue to the floor.

#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	304	However, I hope they will recognise that they are not the only ones doing a service in this House. Other Members must point out the reality of what is contained in the treaties and how the system works.I find it difficult to see why subsection 8º should be deleted. It states that the State may exercise the options and discretions provided for under Articles 1.6, 1.9, 1.11, 1.12, 1.13 and 2.1 of the treaty, referred to in subsection 7º of this section but any such exercise shall be subject to the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas. That is a perfectly reasonable safeguard. Deputy Higgins's amendment seeks the deletion of only some of those sections so that we could only participate with the prior approval of a referendum. I do not see how that arises since we do not have the right to exercise discretion in the area of common foreign and security policy. It could be something as innocuous as fisheries, sport or an environmental matter. Some member states might wish to move ahead with a particular initiative in these areas and if we did not want to participate the issue would have to go to a referendum. I do not understand the logic of these conclusions and I do not support these amendments.I am glad that there are checks and balances in regard to enhanced co-operation. They are not there only because the Irish Government wants them. The British, German, Italian and French Governments also want them. They too are afraid that, without checks and balances, other members could run away with the kitty. It is not simply a group of larger member states deciding to pursue enhanced co-operation so that they can further their own ends. I am indebted to Tony Brown for spelling out that for any initiative to proceed not only would at least eight members be required but, under the operation of QMV in an enlarged Union, at least 14 of the 27 members would have to agree. There are sufficient checks and balances and I particularly welcome the involvement of the institutions of the European Union as that is our best guarantee, particularly in regard to the role of the Commission.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	305	Of all the debates we have had on the Treaty of Nice, the most difficult one to understand is the extraordinary knee-jerk reaction on the issue of enhanced co-operation. It is difficult to understand what is the bogeyman here because of all the issues involved, this is the one with which we should not have a problem. Tony Brown's analysis is extraordinarily good, incisive and factual. It deals with the issues as opposed to creating myths.I am at a complete loss about some of the amendments. The overriding point we must bear in mind is that the proposed amendments would seriously disadvantage Ireland. They have no bearing on the place of enhanced co-operation within the body of the laws of the European Community and would prevent Ireland becoming involved in enhanced co-operation at any stage even where it was in the clear and obvious interest of the Irish people to do so. Why would any Irish parliamentarian want to disadvantage Ireland? I cannot understand the logic of this.The second point touched on in the Brown document was summarised by Deputy Mitchell. Enhanced co-operation is a way of bringing within the general encompass of the Union issues which member states could, in any event, do outside where we would have no say, no rights or involvement. Member states, as sovereign nations, could still make decisions outside enhanced co-operation unless we are going to deny them the opportunity to make decisions in their own right in areas which are not now touched on by the treaties. I do not think anybody on the "No" side wants that; I would be amazed if they did.I agree with Deputy Joe Higgins's analysis to some extent. Different views were taken outside of any control and this precipitated a set of circumstances which led to a blood-bath. The point the Deputy made increases my mystification at the way the issue of enhanced co-operation is being dealt with in the debate. The Green Party's suggestion is even more astonishing. It argues for the very flexible and variable geometry for which enhanced co-operation provides. The Green Party wants to opt out of European security and defence policy. Fair dues to it, that is a point of view. It does not want to opt out of the whole of Europe, but some sections of it. In these amendments, the Deputies are, therefore, trying to deny Ireland the very thing that enhanced co-operation will offer, namely, the flexibility of which it or any other member state might wish to avail. That does not make any sense.It is valuable that we are having a debate on enhanced co-operation because it is one of those phrases which people use flexibly as if everyone understands what it means when, of course, the opposite is frequently the case. Enhanced co-operation is simply a device to enable groups of at least eight member states to take forward a project in which all member states do not wish to participate. It will not put a gun to anyone's head. Deputy Mitchell did everyone a considerable service by reminding us, for example, of when the Thatcher regime in the United Kingdom wished to stymie an extremely positive step on the Social Chapter. I refer to the forerunner of enhanced co-operation which allowed those member states which were progressive in the areas of workers' rights, the rights of women, working hours and paternity leave to move forward. Had that flexibility not been available to us, we could only have moved forward at a pace dictated by Mrs. Thatcher.The idea that enhanced co-operation somehow will allow the big countries to disadvantage their smaller counterparts is patent nonsense. In the case to which I refer, if a degree of flexibility was not available a single big country with its own extreme right wing views could have prohibited, as Tony Brown points out, one of the most progressive moves forward in Europe in recent years and stopped the EU taking steps which have been to the major advantage of working people. As Deputy Mitchell pointed out, there are stringent safeguards to protect the EU and the rights of member states. The relevant issue is that eight plus six, or a total of 14, member states can come together under QMV and this will determine what happens.It has been stated that enhanced co-operation will somehow create a two-tier Europe. This is an extraordinary item of mythology which has crept into the campaign to date and which must be addressed because it is fundamentally dishonest. In the first instance, it is pure conjecture that all the big countries will have a mutuality of interests and that they will gallop ahead and leave the rest of us behind. Not only is it pure conjecture, it is pure myth. The pace at which we will move under enhanced co-operation will be determined by ourselves. No one can say that Ireland must move at a particular pace. Under enhanced co-operation, there is a flexibility that did not previously exist. The idea that enhanced co-operation could create a two-tier Europe is a baseless myth.The provisions regarding enhanced co-operation make only the most modest amendments to the arrangements which are already in place and which have already been availed of under the Treaty of Amsterdam. They make it possible, where appropriate, for groups of member states to co-operate on specific issues where they have a sovereign right to do so in any event. Where those member states wish, among themselves, to go forward without doing damage in any way to the other member states they can do so. Again Deputy Mitchell made the point, which is also contained in the Brown paper, that they can do so under the most stringent conditions. It is not the case that they can suddenly decide to stick it to the small countries, quite the opposite.Enhanced co-operation will not create a two-tier Europe and it will not disadvantage any small state. The enhanced co-operation procedures will do precisely the opposite. It will be significantly to the advantage of small states that that degree of flexibility is present and that the damage which could be done to the interests of a small state which wishes to move forward but cannot do so at a particular time will be overcome.Enhanced co-operation can only be used as a last resort and, for some reason, that issue has not been dealt with in the debate. It can never be used in respect of security or defence issues. I may have misheard Deputy Higgins – if I did I apologise in advance – but I believe he was straying towards suggesting that it could somehow do so. If I did misinterpret his comments, I hope he will clarify the position later.For a project to get under way, a QMV of the Council of Ministers and over 71% of the votes – representing at least 62% of the population of the Union – will be required. That is a very high threshold, even if we ignore for a moment the strictures that will be imposed in respect of areas on which member states will not be able to move.A question has arisen in the general debate on this matter regarding why we need enhanced co-operation at all. The answer should be self-evident to anyone who has had any experience of being involved with a club, a social or community organisation, a trade union or a political party. In a Union of 27 member states, it makes sense to allow the possibility for some flexibility. As someone who has lectured in the area for many years, I must point out that one of the faults of the earlier treaties of the European Union is the degree of inflexibility they contain and the fact that, under their provisions, one found oneself absolutely committed, irrespective of prevailing circumstances, except in extremely limited cases when derogations could be sought.The idea that a state, of its own free will, can opt in or opt out is an enhancement of the current position. It is not only an enhancement, it is an arrangement which supports sovereign decision-making powers on the part of small states. If we consider the Union as it stands, there is always a degree of moral pressure to move at a certain pace. Enhanced co-operation will mean that a small country like Ireland or any of the new incoming states – it is up to them to speak for themselves – can determine what is in their best interests with regard to how they move forward on a particular issue or whether it is appropriate for them to move forward at all. There is tremendous moral pressure on states, as is the case with individuals, to move at the pace the group wishes to determine. Enhanced co-operation gives us the opportunity, which was previously lacking, to move forward at a pace which does no damage to states.There is also, as already stated, the exercise of free will. Deputy Joe Higgins stated that a small group of the big member states will be able to rush ahead and leave others behind. In my opinion there is no basis for that argument. In the first instance, the Council would have to approve a project by means of a QMV procedure and, therefore, the larger states cannot merely proceed on their own. The support of a majority of member states is required, so the smaller states will have to be included. Given that 62% of the population of the Union will have to be involved, the smaller states cannot be disenfranchised or placed outside an arrangement. The bottom line is that in the areas in which we would prefer some activity on the part of the bigger states, they would be free to move forward without undergoing the process of enhanced co-operation by exercising existing sovereign arrangements. The problems Deputy Higgins outlined could well occur outside the new arrangement and within the existing EU, as evidenced by the specific historic instance to which he referred.I wish to refer to a number of specific flaws in the amendments before us. Amendment No. 4 would remove the subsection which enables the State to exercise options or discretions provided for under the Nice treaty in the area of enhanced co-operation. In my view, everyone accepts that this is the intention behind the amendment. Under the current arrangements, we have the option of enhanced co-operation subject to the approval of the Oireachtas. An equivalent provision already exists in relation to the Treaty of Amsterdam. While this does not necessarily prevent Ireland from participating in any enhanced co-operation group, it would remove the certainty of constitutional cover for such participation. It was largely to ensure complete certainty in this area that, on balance, it was felt necessary to put the question of ratification of the Nice treaty to the people in a referendum.This goes to the heart of the issue because, as Members will recall, we made amendments to Article 29.6º of the Constitution which states that "The State may exercise the options or discretions provided for in Articles 1.11, 2.5 and 2.15 of the Treaty referred to". The need for a referendum in that regard is due to the existence of that provision in the Constitution. I do not see enhanced co-operation as any threat to this country.Amendment No. 5 seeks to prevent the State from exercising certain options and discretions provided for in the Treaty of Nice. Deputy Joe Higgins may have intended to include all of the options but, in his amendments, he has only included some of the options. Accordingly, acceptance of his amendments would have the perverse effect of running directly counter to the case he proposes. I appreciate that he is operating very much alone in putting forward these amendments and I suggest that he may have accidentally excluded some material.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I appreciate the Deputy's point and he knows where my sympathies lie. I have been harassing the Minister for Finance on his behalf. Perhaps Deputy Joe Higgins may wish to respond to my point with regard to the unintentional exclusion of certain options. I suggest there is a danger in that regard from his viewpoint. The references he proposed to delete are in Article 1.6 which provides for enhanced co-operation in CFSP, excluding security and defence matters, subject to unanimity; Articles 1.11 and 1.13 which consolidate and revise the provisions applying to enhanced co-operation generally, including conditions which must be met and safeguards which apply; and Article 2.1 which provides the arrangements for enhanced co-operation in regard to Community first pillar matters. If the Deputy looks again at his amendment, he will see that he has omitted a few of the references. The references he proposes to maintain are in Article 1.9 which revises the arrangements for enhanced co-operation in the justice and home affairs area and Article 1.12 under which enhanced co-operation must be the last resort open to all member states.I now turn to amendment No. 6. The Bill as drafted requires the approval of the Oireachtas for Irish participation in enhanced co-operation groups and the amendment would require approval in a referendum. I see nothing to commend the idea of subjecting the Irish people to one referendum after another, although Deputies who have referred to the position in some other democracies may well have a point. For example, there can be a considerable number of referenda per year in Switzerland or in some states of the USA. We may well be approaching that point and I have no problem in asking the people for their view on important issues.

I was responsible for drawing that upon myself. The amendments, if accepted, would place Ireland at a disadvantage as the only member state debarred from ever taking part in enhanced co-operation regardless of the issue, the interest or the advantage to Ireland. I cannot believe it was the Deputy's intention that his amendment should have that effect. As the Government has made clear on many occasions, we are fully satisfied with the safeguards attached to the use of enhanced co-operation. These safeguards are simply consolidated in the Treaty of Nice – there is no new invention. They fully protect the interests of member states, including Ireland.It is useful to remind ourselves, as Deputy Gay Mitchell has done, of what is involved in those safeguards with regard to enhanced co-operation. First, they can only be used as a last resort. In my personal view, it would be much better that the process of enhanced co-operation should involve the states, outside the context of the EU, making decisions which they have a sovereign right to make in any event. The second safeguard is that enhanced co-operation must respect the treaties and must remain within the limits of the powers of the Union. Third, it must not undermine the Internal Market or economic or social cohesion. I believe Deputy Joe Higgins may have made a dismissive reference to that important safeguard. As I pointed out in my reference to Mrs. Thatcher's effort to move Europe forward beyond the dark ages in terms of industrial relations, everybody accepted enhanced co-operation as positive in that case. Fourth, enhanced co-operation must not constitute a barrier or discrimination in trade between the member states. There is nothing sinister in that but there was a dismissive reference to it earlier in the debate. Free movement of goods and services between member states is a fundamental basis on which Ireland, as a sovereign nation, took a decision to join in 1973. Failure on the part of the EU to prevent that type of discrimination would be a retrograde step. It must involve at least eight member states and it must respect the rights of states which do not wish to participate, an important point.There is an historical background of 50 years. The fiftieth anniversary of the coming into effect of the Treaty of Paris was 23 July 2002. In that period, including the history of the ECSC, the EEC, the EC or the EU, there is not a single instance in which other member states combined to bully a member state in a manner detrimental to its interests or its rights. There is absolutely no evidence of that ever happening and I challenge those who suggest that the bogeyman is just around the corner to produce evidence of the bogeyman's existence. It is a disservice to the Irish people to completely distort and misrepresent the reality of history. One of the prerequisites of enhanced co-operation is that it must be open to all member states. There cannot be an exclusive club of eight, nine or ten large states getting together to do something in which they prohibit other states from participating if they so wish. If any member state wishes to engage in the enhanced co-operation process, that process is open to them and the project must be approved by the Council of Ministers by a vote representing a minimum of 62% of the population of the Union. Those are very substantial safeguards against the notion which has been put forward time and again that an exclusive cabal of the larger states could come together. That is not possible and the safeguard arrangements prohibit it from happening.It has been suggested that enhanced co-operation can somehow be used to get around the other treaty requirements on issues of security and defence policy. Enhanced co-operation can never be used in security and defence policy and it is a disservice to the Irish people to suggest otherwise. Enhanced co-operation in the CFSP area is subject to the veto arrangement. Accordingly, we cannot find ourselves disadvantaged or placed offside in that regard. In voting "Yes" in the proposed referendum, the people's consent to Ireland's participation in enhanced co-operation groups will be subject to the important proviso that the prior approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas will be necessary. That arrangement under Article 29.6 was entered into when enhanced co-operation first raised its head. It was one of the contributions of the Labour Party towards putting instruments in place to protect and enhance the interests of the Irish people. That contribution should be handsomely acknowledged in this debate.The Government believes it would be needlessly complicated and hopelessly impractical to hold a referendum every time we wish to participate in enhanced co-operation, as the Green Party proposal suggests. Even with participation, each time we wanted to participate in enhanced co-operation, we would do so only of our own volition and only when it was in our interest. To hold a referendum on every occasion would be an impossible imposition and we cannot find anything to recommend it in amendment No. 6.We believe that an expanded Union of 20—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	319	There has been a huge amount of bogeyman-ism in it. I sat silently throughout the contribution and that silence and patience were sorely tested when I heard some of the mythology being re-issued. I am simply rebutting the points which are without foundation, baseless and have been put about simply to cause fears among the people. In deference to the Deputy, I will move on because there are two other points I want to deal with.Within a Community of 27 members, individual states – particularly the ten that are about to join if we vote "Yes"– require the flexibility that enhanced co-operation allows. We all require flexibility from time to time. I am enamoured by the extraordinary dedication I have seen in all ten applicant states to getting a huge volume of Community law enacted and preparing themselves for the requirements of entry. It would be a disservice to those states if somehow enhanced co-operation were not there. It would be in the interests of those states in whom the Deputy professes some interest. It is primarily for those states to decide what suits them but, in my experience and in my discussions with all the states that have applied – including one or two euro-sceptics – they all accept that enhanced co-operation is a prerequisite in their cases.Deputy Lenihan raised a point about enhanced co-operation and taxation and a great deal has been made of this issue, although not by Deputies in this House. It has been suggested that a group of EU states, through creating an enhanced co-operation group, could somehow coerce Ireland into changing its rate of corporation tax. That is not the case, it cannot happen and it will not happen. The setting of corporation taxes is, and will remain, the preserve of the sovereign governments. It is wrong of people to suggest that anything else is the case. One of the major achievements of the negotiations in Nice was to retain the sovereignty in that area. Any change in the area requires a unanimous vote by the Council of Ministers. Ireland will not support it, so unanimity will be impossible.There is a major advantage to Ireland in getting some of the smaller states in because they share our views on the sovereignty of taxation. The irony is that, if we vote "No" we will be shutting out our allies on this and other issues. Enhanced co-operation allows a group of states to co-operate on a given project to a stringent set of safeguards and cannot be used in the area of taxation and certainly not to disadvantage any state. We should debate the facts rather than the mythology.
#MichaelDHiggins	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-party	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-dob	unknown-#MichaelDHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	320	In deference to the movers of these amendments who also have another group of amendments to be discussed, I will be brief.I cannot claim to speak with such certainty as other contributors in relation to enhanced co-operation. The manner in which it will be used will inevitably be influenced by the political coloration of Europe at a particular time. Anyone who examines the evolution of the treaties and the different practices that arose within them will notice defining moments in the Community. As one moves from those moments to others, one will see times when, for example, during the debate on the Social Charter, a particular political complexion pertained in Europe. When Europe went to the right, it had particular consequences on the decisions taken. It is entirely wrong to think politics does not matter – that it does not matter whether Europe goes to the right or left. It is crucial. The Trojan horse in Europe may well be Mr. Blair at the moment in relation to a common security policy. His actions are appalling and disgraceful in terms of what he represents, but that is for another day. Long before this, the British attitude to the Social Charter was entirely negative and destructive. It was based on an ideology of a labour market that would have removed from it all restrictions and social protections.It is appropriate we raise that this afternoon because, long after we have voted on the referendum, the biggest debate – one that is staring us in the face – is that on the future of workers rights within the larger European Union. It will arise among workers within the current Union who are losing under the right wing regimes. In Britain, under a Labour Government, they are losing protection in relation to pensions, social security, job entitlements and a raft of other areas. There will be confrontation in this area.I cannot operate with the same certainty as some of the other speakers in relation to enhanced co-operation. I cannot say whether it will be used in a malignant or benign way. It is impossible to extract politics from it. I put it to the Minister of State when he uses the phrase "what is in our national interest", that our national interest is not best served when one examines who has gained most during our best years of economic performance. There is a huge difference between the people who gained most in terms of capital accumulation and the workers who have seen their real wages decrease because of the cost of housing, the journey to work, the extension of working hours and so on.In my second stage speech yesterday, I pointed out that unskilled workers in the United States between 1973 and 1993 had to work 245 hours more per annum to stay in the same place in relation to their living standards. That view prevails in Europe. It may be that a Europe of the right may attempt to construct a labour market with what they would call flexibility but which would be at the cost of workers' rights. That would be a malignant outcome but it is equally possible that some of the applicant countries are capable of constructing a benign proposal for social co-operation within the treaties and in accordance with the eight or ten treaty-based requirements, given their experience of the adjustment from the Russian economy in the post-1989 period when a Russian Mafia was created with the assistance of the International Monetary Fund, without much of a whimper from us. They offer for example, social protection. It is also possible that people might use enhanced co-operation in a benign fashion to construct regional initiatives in relation to, for example, the Baltic which could involve an environmental project.I intend to keep to my word and be brief. I have a difficulty with amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6. As I read it as a Legislator, if the Minister accepted those amendments he would have left a constitutional capacity that is in the Amsterdam treaty intact and would have removed the capacity to act on it, which seems extraordinary. If one wanted to pursue the logic of that backwards one should have proposed this amendment to the Amsterdam treaty and opposed enhanced co-operation almost ab initio in that treaty. My memory of the discussion on this point in the Amsterdam treaty is that this did not happen.We then come to the point which suggests that people who would want to argue in favour of amendment No. 4 would remove section 8 from what is being proposed. Deputy Boyle suggested that it might be inconsistent if it was taken in the spirit of the previous discussion. I will not pursue that, but another point that might be more provocative to him is that it could be suggested that it creates a second-class citizenship for Europe within the European Union. If one was part of a community that accepted a treaty-based relationship to other countries, including the Amsterdam treaty, and one had uniquely removed one's own capacity for enhanced co-operation, one would be at an extraordinary disadvantage regarding either the malignant or benign outcomes. This seems to be creating an incapacity rather than facilitating the matter.An argument could also be made from the point of view of consistency. I have come to the conclusion that the arguments on sovereignty are not as convincing as previously, as the worst influence on the European Union is not coming through the mediation of nation states or the European Council but from elsewhere. The European Round Table was mentioned earlier. Its attempted influence on the European Commission in regard to international trade talks is more dangerous than anything that happened by way of influence in the Council. The most dramatic influence on Prime Ministers at European Council level might have been, for example, activities by companies such as Monsanto. In the United States attempts were made to lobby the Taoiseach on St. Patrick's Day to vote in a particular way on an issue regarding genetically modified food in the European Union. The influences on the Union are many and it may well be that the Council itself is not the place of greatest danger.If we are to accept the sovereignty argument, which I have said I do not accept unconditionally, my view is that, to be effective in protecting workers, social movements will have to be constructed on a European basis. Much of the evidence in Ireland both socially and environmentally is that we will probably achieve most in that area. There is an inconsistency in terms of the sovereignty argument. One amendment in this group seeks to disable ourselves, while the others do not go so far as to seek to disable anybody else. It would be more consistent if they did because the treaty based argument in that sense would be that the founding treaties of the European Union envisaged the entire community of Europeans moving together at one pace within a set of principles that would almost never change. From once we accepted the process of treaty changes and accepted that the process of treaty formation has not finished we cannot argue against having different initiatives.I could give a final benign example. At one stage the Swedes wanted to protect children from television advertising. That unfortunately did not come to fruition. I tried the same here and was supported by some others. If one wanted to do that it would be a good idea in regard to enhanced co-operation. Enhanced co-operation could be used if one wanted to regard films, broadcasting etc. as cultural issues rather than commodities.I have some sympathy for the people making the case being debated. In asking whether a malignant or benign outcome is more likely in regard to capacity, the history of the Union, particularly in times of right or right of centre governments – we currently have a right of centre market fundamentalist as Minister for Finance – is that the Internal Market has been facilitated at the cost of social cohesion. For example, the Commission has disestablished many forms of regulation and has removed the state from many different areas. People regard this as progress but it is not inevitably so. State monopolies have been broken up to create private, unaccountable, unrelated monopolies. Even conservative economists are now writing about the present position in Europe as one where there is a crisis of regulation post deregulation of state activity. In other words, totally unaccountable, unregulated private entities, such as Kirsch in broadcasting, have emerged and are more dangerous and deleterious in their effects on those who view and consume than the state ever could have been.The same thing is happening in regard to energy supply and so forth. Many people have a reasonable doubt that the balance of outcomes regarding enhanced co-operation may well be to drive forward forms of market fundamentalism that are anti citizen and so pro market that they will be anti consumer. They will be so unregulated that they will be negative in their consequences. That said, we are not served by the removal of ourselves, as proposed in amendment No. 4, from the capacity to be involved in the debate on enhanced co-operation.

It is a flexible approach to the various problems that will inevitably be experienced by an enlarged Europe. Deputy Mitchell referred to a number of these. I am not sure if he referred to the euro but that too is an example of enhanced co-operation which has operated well within the European Union.I was not going to speak on this matter but when I heard Deputy Boyle propose the amendment I felt I had to come and address the House. He uses reckless language to propose his obviously sincere views. He used phrases like blackmail and emotional bullying. He referred to this section as sinister and described enhanced co-operation as meaning many different things but not as we all understand it to mean. Deputy Gormley also adopted this interpretative view in his understanding of peacemaking, describing it in his initial contribution on Second Stage as a euphemism for war.

Although these words were not arrived at lightly, the nay-sayers claim that the black arts are being performed in Brussels by small cabals of those who wish to undermine the political will of the majority of Europeans.Deputy Joe Higgins described enlargement as a Trojan horse for enhanced co-operation and said that facilitating such co-operation was the treaty's real purpose. Enhanced co-operation was the last thing I imagined the Opposition would pick up on when I first read the treaty and its various précis. While I do not wish to tell Opposition Members how to approach their task, it is not a good idea to use the blunderbuss against everything. I realise they may have legitimate concerns about one or two aspects of the treaty, but they seem to have decided to oppose it all and to criticise everything, which is an inappropriate way for an Opposition to go about its business. The language used by certain Opposition Members throughout this debate has been reckless.I am quite convinced that although there are potentially malignant outcomes to enhanced co-operation, as Deputy Michael D. Higgins mentioned, that potential will not be realised. The treaty contains many safeguards, such as the veto that applies to the Common Foreign and Security Policy, or the fact that enhanced co-operation does not apply to defence matters.Tugadh tuairisc ar a ndearnadh; an Coiste do shuí arís.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Why are we holding this referendum? Deputy Andrews said that enhanced co-operation forms a small part of the treaty. Of the three legal grounds cited by Deputy McDowell when he was Attorney General as necessitating a referendum on the Nice treaty, two concerned the treaty's provisions on enhanced co-operation. If the treaty was about enlargement, as Members have suggested, it is questionable as to whether a referendum would have been necessary in the first instance. Deputy Andrews may disagree with the former Attorney General that enhanced co-operation is an integral part of this treaty, but Deputy McDowell was responsible for bringing this matter to a national vote.Those who follow European negotiations know that the French and the Germans introduced enhanced co-operation at Faro in 2000. The former Portuguese Prime Minister, Antonio Guterres spoke in Nice of "an institutional coup d'état". It has been said that we are using emotional language, but these words were spoken by a Portuguese statesman. We have been told that the Nice treaty will not lead to a two-tier Europe, but in response I quote Jacques Delors who spoke in a French newspaper of creating "a Union for the enlarged Europe, and a Federation for the avant-garde". That sums up the two-tier Europe that we have mentioned so often in this debate. Our old friend Joschka Fischer told an audience at Humboldt University in Berlin that enhanced co-operation is vital for his vision of the development of the EU.Enhanced co-operation is part of the federalist dream. It is an extremely powerful bargaining tool. When larger nations are in difficult negotiations, they will be able to refer to enhanced co-operation provisions to tell smaller nations that they intend to proceed without them. Our esteemed Taoiseach will say that he wants Ireland to be part of the premier league and we will become involved in enhanced co-operation. That is the way these things work.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	333	If it is as harmless as those on the other side claim, why did we boast after the negotiations on the Amsterdam treaty, which were mentioned by the Minister of State, that we had a veto on flexibility, as enhanced co-operation was then known? The problem with those on the "Yes" side is that they are inconsistent. We are familiar with this inconsistency having listened to the Minister of State's speeches in recent days. The Government's remarks on this topic do not add up. The introduction of enhanced co-operation as part of the Nice treaty will mean that the power of individual member states to veto fundamental change within the Union has been removed. We have heard many speakers refer to the fundamentally undemocratic nature of a veto. If it is undemocratic, however, why did the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, today boast about Ireland retaining a veto in relation to tax harmonisation?It is most unacceptable that EU institutions will be involved in the implementation of enhanced co-operation and will bear the administrative costs of such activities, as set out in Article 1.13. It is possible, therefore, that a member state which does not support the implementation of a particular enhanced co-operation initiative may find itself indirectly funding the administrative costs of its implementation. The implications of enhanced co-operation for military and defence matters are not clear. Article 1.6, which inserts Articles 27a, 27b, 27c, 27d and 27e into the treaty, states that enhanced co-operation initiatives permitted under the treaty "shall respect the principles, objectives, general guidelines and consistency of the common foreign and security policy" but that they "shall not relate to matters having military or defence implications". It is difficult to envisage how an enhanced co-operation initiative falling broadly into the area of common foreign and security policy, whether consistent with EU policy or not, could not have military or defence implications. The Minister says he is clear about this, but I am not as I see it as a grey area.There are no safeguards on the process of authorisation for enhanced co-operation initiatives. Article 1.9, which replaces Article 40 with Articles 40, 40a and 40b, specifies that while member states must submit a request for an enhanced co-operation initiative to the Commission, the Commission can decide not to submit the proposal to the Council of Ministers, as long as it gives a reason for doing so. Article 40a states, however, that in the event of the Commission refusing to forward the request for enhanced co-operation, "the member states may then submit an initiative to the Council designed to obtain authorisation for the enhanced co-operation concerned". This is an extremely worrying provision, as I do not know if it will be possible for member states to proceed regardless if the Commission, which is deemed to be the guardian of the interests of the Union as a whole, decides not to forward the enhanced co-operation proposal to the Council for authorisation.Although these articles refer to the need to consult the European partners on certain requests for enhanced co-operation and the possibility of referring requests to the Council of Europe, neither of the institutions is given the power to block or refuse such a request. This cannot be considered to be a satisfactory system of checks and balances, as the Minister argues, to prevent groups of member states from potentially abusing the enhanced co-operation mechanism. Enhanced co-operation is an important aspect of this treaty because it cannot be sidelined. The Minister of State should be aware, as someone who is involved with the Convention for the Future of Europe just as I am, that the enhanced co-operation provisions of the Nice treaty significantly advance the federalist project. The enhanced co-operation provisions of the Nice treaty significantly advance the federalist project. They pre-empt the deliberations of the Convention on the Future of Europe. What is the point in having a debate on a federal Europe if a treaty has already been ratified that takes a significant step in that direction?This is a major part of the Nice treaty – the establishment of an inner club. It is a federalist idea. Those countries, particularly the French and the Germans, have grown impatient with the dilly-dallying of those who are less integrationist than they are. That is why it is in the treaty. As I said on Second Stage, this treaty is fundamentally about deepening, not broadening. That is why it has been introduced. We know we can enlarge without this treaty. That has been confirmed over and over again. I was told today that even Pádraig Flynn has said we can go ahead with enlargement, that there is a plan B. This has been confirmed by Mr. Prodi, Giscard d'Estaing and by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell.This is a fundamental part of the treaty and I hope we can go into in more detail during the debate itself. There is no doubt that we are seeing a shift in the manner in which the European Union operates. There is an inconsistency in the Government's argument. It previously tried to retain a veto in many areas but now it argues that the veto is not that important. A veto on flexibility now disappears. The inner club can be formed and that will lead to a two-tier Europe. The Government claims the veto still exists in relation to tax harmonisation but the inner club will form a tax harmonisation area. That will probably be one of the first things it does. We will be outside it. We will be told that tax harmonisation is going ahead and the question will be if we want to stay outside. The Minister may want to stay outside but he will not be in the premier league if he does.

It is based on the premise that Ireland's role in Europe would always be that of beneficiary of someone else's munificence or sufferer of someone else's actions. It takes the view that Ireland would never be the instigator of and would be unlikely to benefit from enhanced co-operation. It would do no harm to be less hard on ourselves on occasion. Ireland has played a strong and central role in Europe although it is true that sometimes we had to be dragged along. We saw that with some of the social and environmental changes, changes that would be welcomed by the Deputies who have tabled these amendments. Deputy Michael Higgins referred to the habitats directive that he introduced. I would not come from the same perspective on the directive but there are benefits in the short-term and in the medium and long-term arising from the European initiative which we did not embrace with any great enthusiasm.

Modifications that could have been to the benefit of the country were not made.We can err by regarding Europe as an alternative entity of which we are sometimes a part but more frequently we regard it as ‘out there' in the way councillors say that the council decided, as though it was something removed from one's own remit at which one could only frown disapprovingly. That is a fundamental weakness in our approach to Europe and in our approach to this treaty.Deputy Michael Higgins is right – the political driving forces in Europe will be determined by the make up of the governments. I do not concede, however, that the make up of the governments of the four or five big states will set the agenda. Neither do I accept that Ireland cannot be a beneficiary or instigator of enhanced co-operation. On the contrary, one of our weaknesses – and this is an accusation I would level at those parties who embrace Europe enthusiastically – is that enthusiasm has frequently not been matched by the kind of action that would give Ireland's participation an extra edge and lead to a greater sense of participation by Irish people in European institutions.I argue with the philosophy of the amendments but the debate they have engendered is important. I do not share Deputy Gormley's fears about co-operation. Ireland can choose the path of being an active participant, even a prime mover, on occasion. This has been a weakness in our approach to Europe: while on occasion we have excelled, we have not taken as broad an approach as we might have.I welcome the new provision in the Constitution in relation to the need for a referendum on a common defence policy. I share the philosophy of the Minister when he argued that there was a need for more public participation by way of referenda. An example of such a system exists in Switzerland. We frown on referenda and regard it as a parliamentary weakness if the people have to be consulted. It is as if Parliament forever decides for the people. I would argue that there are many issues on which people should be consulted but I would not go along with amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 6.I was delighted to hear a number of Deputies who would not normally be interested in my area express their concerns about Shannon Airport. They were coming from a different perspective but they were raising an issue close to my heart. A question that then springs to mind is whether our neutrality has been affected by the considerable number of US flights that have used the airport in recent years. I do not think it has but I am interested in the Minister's view on that. It impinges on today's date. There had been considerable fears that changes relating to qualified majority voting would have a negative impact on the negotiation of bilateral rights with the USA. That decision I was happy – or unhappy as the case may be – to establish was made on ratification of a previous treaty and does not arise on this occasion. Much of what we have heard, said and read about the Nice treaty would make us look to an outsider like a nation which thinks that participation in the Union involves insisting on being beneficiaries in all respects and on having no responsibility to initiate things. We would be seen to take a very blinkered view on a certain number of issues and, while I disagree very strongly with some of what Deputy Mitchell said, there is an underlying honesty in his call to address issues.This Nice debate has been radically different from the previous one and Committee Stage has been much more interesting. As is the nature of Committee Stage debate, the inherent provisions of the treaty were addressed, which many engaged in the last debate failed to do, in a way that Second Stage could not allow. There were many complaints from people in various parties and from Independents that they were unable to get a speaking slot, which sadly is also the case if you have the misfortune to be on the backbenches of the Government side. I tried to pick the best amendments to allow me the opportunity to make some of the points I wished to make and I am delighted to have this opportunity. I would like to have been able to come in earlier on the neutrality and common defence elements because today's debate has been useful and far-reaching.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	337	The issue of enhanced co-operation is not new as has been said by many, but it is important that we establish what is new in the Nice treaty with regard to it. What is new is the loss of the veto which Ireland and other small countries have valued for its provision of some kind of bargaining power. If the veto is to be lost in a large number of cases – the number 30 has been mentioned – then we are going to see a change in the manner in which debates and negotiations take place. That is a fact of life and it is important to discuss it. It is also important that we recall our involvement as members of the eurozone. The discussions to establish that were not easy and involved deciding whether Ireland would go ahead without the UK given the amount of trade we engage in there and across the Border. There were pressures on us to go ahead even though we wanted to go in when the UK went in.This is one of those issues where we have to realise that there will be difficulties for Ireland and other countries, particularly the smaller ones, which do not have the number of votes in qualified majority voting to give them a sway of any significance. It is therefore very important that we debate the scenarios we may face in the not too distant future. As mentioned by Deputy Gormley and others, enhanced co-operation is the essential reason we need a referendum and it is absolutely important and appropriate that we make it a central part of our discussions on Committee Stage. I have a problem, as do others, with the term "enhanced co-operation" which might mislead somebody hearing it for the first time. It does not convey exactly what is being planned. It could mean any number of things and someone hearing it for the first time could speculate on them all. I wonder if the more appropriate term "innercircle arrangement" could be used by way of explanation.

Their priority in many cases, though it is not unanimous, is to become member states while states already fully participating are trying to create a different kind of EU before they get in. That should be honestly faced up to; this is not just a treaty about enlargement. If it were simply about enhanced co-operation we would not be needing this bizarre second referendum. Like Deputy Mitchell and a number of other Deputies, I met the Slovenian ambassador but when I asked him about a plan B, he was not aware of one.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	342	There is no plan B.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	343	The Slovenians are not the only ones who are not being told about that plan, in fact very few of us are, and although it is not being widely talked about, it is certainly being discussed. That is part of the pressure being exerted for a "Yes" vote, but if we were getting all the information we would be told about the alternatives in an honest, up-front manner.The Slovenians are probably so busy translating the 20,000 rules and directives they have to accept lock, stock and barrel before they can become members that their priority is to engage sufficient translators. I get the impression talking not just to the Slovenian ambassador but to other representatives of applicant countries that they are like people visiting a show house. One does not see the faults too easily when one goes into a show house and it appears that it is fairly rosy in the garden. The rules will have changed and it will not take long for them to see that the house they have moved into is not the show house. When the rose-tinted glasses are no longer so rosy, they will see more clearly that they have come into what is not so much a club as a lions' den in terms of the future they face, particularly in relation to trade agreements and the economic restructuring they are embarked upon. That economic restructuring will be difficult to maintain. It is important that they realise, as the Taoiseach said in 1996 and I quoted on Second Stage, that the EU is a mixed bag and one has to take the rough with the smooth. Enhanced co-operation sets an agenda that could be quite rough for a number of countries. While it may be called flexibility, enhanced co-operation also demonstrates an agenda to push the European Union along a federalist course.A reading of Article 111 or Article 2.1 which refer to the removal of the veto in the area of enhanced co-operation, makes clear that shots are being fired across the bow. As this is part of the longer term agenda, it is important for all our sakes that we try to imagine and visualise what it will mean. The harmonisation of taxation, for example, could, as Deputy Gormley stated, become part of an inner circle arrangement soon after the current period of development in the European Union. If we continue with our current policy which, I understand, is in the interest of inward investment, this arrangement will lead to the establishment of a harmonised taxation regime to which Ireland may not belong. The choice facing us will be stark. Do we agree to such an inner circle arrangement and raise taxes or do we essentially move outside the inner circle of the European Union? Given that these decisions may have other implications for us, I hope the Government has given them consideration. What would the Minister of State decide in such a scenario?There is a broader agenda at work in terms of enhanced co-operation process or inner circle arrangement. This is the removal of the veto in Article 2.13 and Article 2.14 which deal with Structural Funds and Cohesion Funds respectively. Clearly, it will be necessary to provide considerable Structural and Cohesion Funds in the enlarged European context. A considerable number of cheques will have to be written and at this point they will be relatively blank. With seven of the 345 votes in a 27 member European Union, Ireland does not have a huge amount of influence in terms of the level of Structural and Cohesion Funds which will be required. The Minister of State may argue that there is a particular game plan or that decisions have already been taken, but as things stand the removal of the veto in the treaty means we are signing a blank cheque. This is likely to be an important factor in the support of the new member states. As with other aspects of the European Union, the Government is duty-bound to indicate the level of costs this country will be asked to pay.Another aspect of enhanced co-operation which must be debated in terms of its cost is Article 1.13 which states that the administrative funding of enhanced co-operation arrangements is to be borne by the European Union as a whole. As flexibility allows a number of countries to move ahead or sideways of their own accord, it is logical that the funding for the administrative costs of such a move should be borne by the group in question. It appears, however, from Article 1.13 that the EU as a whole will be asked to fund the costs of such arrangements.I listened to Deputy Killeen argue that we should not be too parochial and avoid viewing the European Union from the perspective of whether Ireland is a net beneficiary or net loser in financial terms only to proceed to make his main point on Shannon Airport. This was a very interesting example of parochialism. When all is said and done, the cost to this country of grand plans such as enhanced co-operation, the Rapid Reaction Force and other developments which are mentioned in idealistic terms in the treaty, which is no bad thing, will mean that cheques will have to be written and taxes raised to pay for them.It is important that, in asking the people to vote on the treaty for a second time, we give them all the information required to make an informed decision. After all, the first question any household planning to build an extension asks is: "What is the cost?"  It is also the first question a household planning to send children to college asks. Developments in the European Union should, therefore, be costed. It appears this has not been done. While it is important to discuss principles and ideas, costs associated with the area of enhanced co-operation and the Rapid Reaction Force have not been mentioned.It is interesting that the Government has been forced to cut back – a word which appears to be forbidden – on a number of very important projects, one of which, the "Bertie Bowl", would not at any rate have been value for money. There have also been cuts in health and education spending, the cancellation of the Sikorsky helicopter deal—

I have one brief additional question. If we were fundraising for the Rapid Reaction Force and were required to buy five tanks, would we be allowed to refuse to do so if we argued that we could not afford to pay for them as we had hospitals and schools to fund or would we be told that because we had bought into the deal, we have to pay for our side of the bargain? The applicant countries would like to have that question answered as well.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-09-11 00:00:00	Prelude	354	I will do my best in the 90 seconds remaining. I thank everybody for their valuable contributions on the debate on enhanced co-operation. Enhanced co-operation is a third way between the old veto and the forced co-operation which has very often been a feature of the European Union. I am pleased Deputy Gormley accepts that we continue to have a veto in the area of taxation. When I referred to people on the "No" side deliberately misleading the people on this issue, I did not intend to include the Deputy in that group. I ask him to accept my bona fides on this matter.The treaty and the enhanced co-operation arrangements will have no impact on our taxation system. It cannot affect it as unanimity is retained on taxation. I wish to correct Deputy Gormley who misquoted – I am sure accidentally – Jacques Delors on the issue of the inner core. He and others also misquoted a few other people, including myself, on other matters. Jacques Delors was specifically referring to a permanent inner core.Commissioner Verheugen has made it clear that enlargement as envisaged in the current process, that is, the accession of ten member states in 2004, cannot happen without the Nice treaty. We should not delude ourselves that this is not the case. The Danish Prime Minister, Mr. Rasmussen has made the same point as has Mr. Prodi recently, for which the Deputy's comrade-in-arms, Justin Barrett, described him in most uncomplimentary terms. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to work out that an institutional framework established 50 years ago to deal with six member states simply cannot accommodate 27 members without reform. As we debated this issue already, I will not stretch it.Deputy Sargent spoke of his concern for the ten applicant countries. I do not want to personalise matters, but in our dealings with them we experienced the extraordinary intellectual level at which they conduct their debates. It would do us credit if we could conduct our debates at the same level. I was immensely impressed by each state's negotiating teams. Deputy Gormley has had more experience than I of that, as I have only been involved in the convention recently. It has been enlightening to observe the teams. I have no fears for their capacity to negotiate. We will have to grow in negotiating terms and conduct our debates in future in a more informed and more intellectual level because of their involvement.Deputy Killeen indicated – I am not sure whether his point was parochial or it echoed something Deputy Sargent's colleagues said – his concerns regarding over-flight and landing facilities at Shannon. Over-flight and refuelling facilities for the states whose forces are engaged in bringing to justice those who attacked the citizens of the United States on 11 September has been absolutely in keeping with UN Security Council Resolution 1368.
