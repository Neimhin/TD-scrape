            <p eId="para_3">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 2 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4">Under the direction of my programme manager, Mr. Joe Lennon, the primary function of my special advisers is to monitor, facilitate and help secure the achievement of Government objectives and to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the programme for Government.  The role and duties of special advisers are described in section 11 of the Public Service Management Act 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_5">My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis.  He monitors and reports to me on progress in implementing the programme for Government.  Each of my advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers.  They attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities.  They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of the Government.  Special advisers are also tasked with giving me advice and keeping me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, environmental, administrative and media matters and performing such other functions as may be directed by me from time to time.  A number of my advisers have specific responsibilities relating to speech drafting.</p>
            <p eId="para_6">During 2010 there have been a number of changes in personnel among my special advisers.  Mr. Declan Ryan is no longer special adviser in the Department of the Taoiseach.  Ms Deirdre Gillane was appointed as my special adviser on 31 May 2010.  She is tasked with supporting the programme manager in co-ordinating the implementation of the programme for Government by liaising with a number of Departments.  The role involves attending meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7">In addition, in view of the coterminous nature of special adviser appointments with the terms of office of Ministers, it was necessary to re-appoint Mr. Padraig Slyne as a special adviser following the change in Government Chief Whip earlier this year.  The net result of these changes is that I now have six special advisers, which is one fewer than at the start of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8">The Government spent €6.2 million on special advisers, media advisers and other personally appointed staff in 2008.  How much was spent in 2009 and to date in 2010?  Given the truth of the figures emerging, what is the Taoiseach's view on continuing with this kind of personnel?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_9">I do not have the wider Government figure.  The issue is that the total spend in Departments is of the order of €50 billion.  Advisers were brought in to assist Ministers independent of departmental advice in 1992.  They augment and supplement that advice and they are provided with an opportunity not just to advise the Minister, but to have other cross-departmental responsibilities and to integrate the efforts of various Ministers in broad policy areas and whatever other tasks that Ministers of the day prescribe to them.  They have been an addition in helping that policy formulation effort.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_10">I recall the appointment of political programme managers in 1992 by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party but their remit was somewhat different in that it was to iron out difficulties between Ministers before issues arrived at the Cabinet.  The programme manager remit in that regard continued between 1994 and 1997 with considerable success.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">A special adviser was appointed to the Minister for Health and Children and his salary was €156,000.  He has resigned because his remit was up for whatever reason.  Will that position be filled?</p>
            <p eId="para_12">The Taoiseach stated advisers are there to streamline policy.  The Fine Gael Party published a detailed document to restructure the health system entitled FairCare under which, at the end of a five-year period, universal health insurance would be introduced.  The Minister for Health and Children offered an 11-page critique of that document and when my party asked the Department for a copy, we were told it was not available in the Department and that it had been prepared by her political adviser.  That contradicts the Taoiseach's statement regarding the role and remit of advisers.  Surely at a time like this, the Government should not pay political advisers to critique other party's proposals at public expense when the Department is available and has views on such proposals, no more than the Minister's office.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_13">One would expect policy advisers to be able to advise on policy, whether it is Government policy or suggestions from other parts of the House or other parts of society about issues under the remit of the Minister concerned.  These are independent of and specifically different from the normal Civil Service advice which is given regardless of political affiliation in any case and which is a departmental view.  Special advisers have a remit to do what perhaps the Civil Service cannot do.  I do not see any difficulty with the Minister being briefed on aspects of any proposal which may have merit or those which perhaps do not withstand scrutiny.  This is a normal part of democratic debate and policy formulation at all times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_14">Does that extend to being paid out of the public purse merely to offer a critique of Opposition parties and their proposals, particularly when the Department the person is supposed to be advising says it is not its responsibility?  It seems as if Ministers can have persons appointed to them to spend their time dealing with proposals from other parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">The Taoiseach will know that as an election approaches the Government always makes available to Opposition parties a costing process through the Department of Finance for whatever proposals they may have.  In 2008, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, spent over €514,000 on personal appointments, including advisers, which did not include the adviser to whom I am referring.  The Minister was actually over the quota for her allocation of advisers but the Taoiseach and his predecessor condoned the fact because she was then the leader of a minority party.  Now that she is no longer in that capacity, what is the situation as regards advisers and personal appointees to the Minister for Health and Children?</p>

            <p eId="para_21">With regard to the official or the person concerned, advices were also being given to the Department of the Taoiseach on general health areas and there is an active Cabinet sub-committee on health which was also being serviced by work from that individual as well as from the HSE and from the Department of Health and Children.

            <p eId="para_53">I was referring to the Department of the Taoiseach and I was quite clear about that.  There was no movement away from that.  Does the funding continue?  Why is that the sole Department from which moneys are made available to cover particular advisers?  On that occasion, the Taoiseach also said that advisers give added value to Departments.  What added value can the Taoiseach point to in regard to any of the advisers funded by the Department of the Taoiseach at the Department of Health and Children?  Were they involved in the debacle of the botched planning of the national children's hospital?  Last March, the Taoiseach stated that spending on advisers is not excessive in the circumstances.  He cited the returns with regard to seven advisers at that point.  Surely, albeit that there are only six currently, from what the Taoiseach has already told us in his reply, does he not think that efficiencies in the public service must begin at the top and that this is an excessive number?  Is there call or justification for special advisers to be brought in when there is clearly a resource available to the Taoiseach in his permanent staff in the Department, as there is in all other Departments; people who have gained a wealth of experience and knowledge from their exposure in permanency going through a series of Governments who would be in a position to offer the critical advice one would think the Taoiseach might require from time to time?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_44">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_54">First, there has been much reduction in administrative costs in my Department the same as other Departments.  The cost this year compared to last year is down 27%.  From memory, the cost for 2009 compared to 2008 is down by over 20% and the reduction on the previous year is in the high teens.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">The question arises as to whether one believes the Taoiseach should have any independent advice at all.  If one does not believe the Taoiseach should get such advice I presume one would not agree with any of those expenditures.  Anyone who is knowledgeable about the Department of the Taoiseach would recognise that there is a need for advisers to assist with all of the co-ordinating work that has to be done right across Government and a need for the Taoiseach's Department to promote cross-sectoral issues, be that in health or elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">The budget of the Department of Health and Children is more than €15 billion.  Half of the funds collected this year in taxes is going on health.  On the question of independent advice, sometimes if the argument suits, the criticism from the Opposition is that we are not taking outside advice but when we are talking outside advice we are told we should take inside advice exclusively.  No matter what one does someone will have a view suggesting that this or that should not be done.  The bottom line on the specific matters raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin is that the payments to the Department of the Taoiseach no longer continue as the person in receipt of that salary through the Department is no longer in the job.  That is the answer to that question.</p>
            <p eId="para_57">Deputy Ó Caoláin suggested in his first question, before the Ceann Comhairle's interruption, that €500,000 was being made available by my Department to the Department of Health and Children.  That is not the case.  There was never €500,000.  The sum of €514,000 referred to by Deputy Kenny relates to money paid for through, I presume, the Department of Health and Children for staff employed directly in the Minister's office in the Department of Health and Children.  I do not have the figures.  Perhaps the Ceann Comhairle had not drifted quite as far as people suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_58">On the question of advisers in the Northern Ireland Executive, colleagues of the Deputy have many advisers as well.  I do not see an objection in principle there.  Perhaps a bit of consistency in this jurisdiction would not go astray.</p>

            <p eId="para_61">On the sum of the €500,000 to which I referred, that was what I understood to be the case.  If it is not, and it only relates to the post of the adviser who is no longer employed, so be it.  We can check those details subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_62">Is there any value for money review on the number of advisers across the board?  Has an evaluation of their value or worth been carried out other than the fact that it is great to have the camaraderie, support and occasional note offered to the Taoiseach?  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, does that frequently.  It is important that there is an assessment of public moneys being expended.  We might not be allowed to ask how many advisers are employed across all Departments.  We only know of six for the Taoiseach's position.  How many would there be across all Departments?  There would be a significant number, greater than the number indicated earlier to Deputy Gilmore.  It is reasonable to ask if a value for money audit has ever been carried out on such a significant number of people brought in, particularly in these difficult and straitened economic times.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_63">It is down to the officeholder to determine value and if he wants to retain an adviser.  To do the job and to obtain advice independent of the Civil Service — while not denigrating the quality of Civil Service advice — and to complete the perspective, people in high office need to make the best possible decisions.  It is a matter of opinion, it is not an exact science.  We have in the system a small number, relative to the total number of people available to the Government, who come in from outside, some of whom are known to officeholders when they employ them, while others are not known.  Not all of the people who work for me were known to me personally.  They are committed to the task they have been given and work to advance Government policy, along with people in the public service, permanent civil servants and others, and to implement Government policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_64">If this is isolated, people try to suggest that it costs a great deal.  In terms of the cost of the public service, these are small numbers but they are valid nonetheless.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_82">I propose to take Questions Nos. 4 to 16, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">During the remainder of 2010 I intend to travel to meetings of the European Council in Brussels on 28 and 29 October, and 16 and 17 December; and to the British-Irish Council Summit in the Isle of Man on 13 December.  I hope to visit China early in 2011, subject to the timing being settled by the Department of Foreign Affairs, in consultation with the Chinese authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_84">I had extensive contact with other EU leaders at the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on 16 September and at the EU/ASEM summit on 4 and 5 October.  In addition, I met the Prime Minister Mr. Cameron in Downing Street on 23 June, and the Prime Minister of Finland, Ms Kiviniemi here in Dublin on 7 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_85">I was accompanied at the European Council meeting on 16 September by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Mícheal Martin, and the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche.  The meeting focused on maximising the benefits of the EU's strategic partnerships with other countries.  The Council acknowledged that Europe faces a great many challenges at present, many of which demand a co-ordinated external response.  In this, we need to make full use of the potential of the new arrangements under the Lisbon treaty.  Particular focus was given to upcoming summits with key partners, especially those with China and India, and the Council agreed to return to the subject of our transatlantic relationship at its next meeting.  The Council also had an early discussion on our approach to the G20 meeting that will take place in November.</p>
            <p eId="para_86">The President of the European Council, Hermann Van Rompuy, briefed the Council on progress being made by the task force on economic governance, which he is chairing.  The Council welcomed the considerable work that has been undertaken to date, including agreement on the so-called European semester.  The Council also adopted Declarations on Pakistan and the Middle East Peace Process.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">The eighth Asia-Europe meeting, ASEM 8, which took place in Brussels on 4 and 5 October, dealt with a wide range of issues of interest to both regions under the overall themes of global financial and economic governance, sustainable development, international co-operation on global and regional issues and the future of ASEM.  I addressed the conference on the issue of disarmament and nuclear non-proliferation, recalling Ireland's strong association with the non-proliferation treaty, NPT, and calling for a renewed effort to ensure its full implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">In advance of the summit, I participated in a business forum in Brussels organised by Enterprise Ireland which focused on IT for health care, one of Ireland's fastest growing export sectors.  I also took part in a breakfast meeting with the Asia-Europe Business Forum organised as part of the summit.</p>
            <p eId="para_89">The summit provided an opportunity to meet on the margins with a number of Heads of Government of participating countries, including Premier Wen Jiaboa of China, Prime Minister Gillard of Australia, Prime Minister Bouasone of Laos and President Zapatero of Spain.  I met Prime Minister Kiviniemi of Finland in Government Buildings on 7 October,  It was her first visit to Dublin since she took office in June of this year.  Our discussions focused on Ireland and Finland's shared interest in innovation as an engine for growth and jobs as well as economic and EU matters.  Later that afternoon, the Prime Minister and I addressed a seminar at Dublin Castle on combining Irish and Finnish strengths in innovation.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">I expect to see the President of the European Commission at the next meeting of the European Council on 28 and 29 October.  The main items on the agenda on that occasion are economic policy, including consideration of the final report of the task force on economic governance, preparations for the G20 summit in November, preparations for the Cancun conference on climate change and relations with the US ahead of the EU-US summit.</p>

            <p eId="para_91">Regarding the Taoiseach's meeting with the Finnish Prime Minister, has he taken note of the advances made in Finland because of its Government's intervention through investment in the training of teachers?  It has had a beneficial impact on the quality of Finland's education system.  Did the Taoiseach discuss this issue with the Finnish Prime Minister?  If not, would he be willing to have officials from the Department of Education and Skills involve themselves in what has been a fundamental transformation for the better of the Finnish education system?</p>

            <p eId="para_92">The Finnish Prime Minister was accompanied by the education Minister from Finland, who had separate meetings with the Tánaiste.  Perhaps a question to her directly would elicit the information the Deputy requires.  It was not discussed specifically.</p>

            <p eId="para_93">In terms of the preparation of a four-year fiscal presentation, does the European Commission have any involvement with the Department of Finance and the Government, in light of the targets that have been agreed between the Government and the European Commission?  Will he confirm whether Commission officials have been to Dublin or are in any way involved in the framework process?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_56">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_94">As the European Commission has made clear, the drawing up of the four-year plan is a matter for the Government.  It is our own decision.  As members of the euro area, in terms of the normal arrangements that are in place, the European Commission is kept fully informed of developments and overall thinking in Ireland.  There is interaction with the European Commission as an institution and others within the European Central Bank and elsewhere regarding growth forecasts, trends, medium-term projections, etc.  It would be important to point out that this work is being carried out by the Department of Finance but there is continuing discussion with the European Commission so that it understands precisely the thinking behind the work that is ongoing.</p>

          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_57">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_95">If Commission officials are discussing matters with officials from the Department of Finance and in view of the fact that the Government has made briefings available to the Fine Gael, Labour and Sinn Féin parties, does the Taoiseach consider that it would be appropriate to allow the same Commission officials to meet Opposition parties to get their view on the perspectives being prepared for the next four years?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_58">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_96">It is important to point out that it is the Irish authorities who are formulating these proposals.  The International Monetary Fund people, the EU Commission and all the various international bodies such as the OECD and others have their own views of how world growth projections are likely to go, what the issues are and the various economic models they construct in order to proceed.  The Department of Finance takes into account or takes note of all these views and they feed into the dialogue that takes place at national authorities level.  It is not a question of people elsewhere deciding on the outcome.  These are matters for decision by us, using our best judgment based on the best advice and information, international commentary and documentation available on these kinds of issues.  That would not be necessary.  The dialogue has been used and all these issues are being taken into account.  What one hears from the international authorities is the best estimate based on all the views they hear.  That question and answer is available to the Deputy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_59">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_97">It would appear that the interaction between the Commission officials and the Department of Finance has coloured the attitude of the Government.  It is a matter for this country to prepare its own plans.  The Taoiseach stated that Commission officials reflect on world economic trends and so they do.  It would be in the interests of Opposition parties to have available as full a spectrum of information and views as possible in order to reflect more accurately on the figures made available to them in briefings yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">If there are officials from the Commission in the country does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate that finance spokespersons from the Opposition parties should meet with them in order to get their reflections on Ireland and broader European and world issues as the spokespersons prepare their plans?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_60">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_99">That information is available by questioning the Department of Finance.  It is not appropriate to have others substituting in the role Department of Finance officials play.</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_101">They are the people devising our national policies.  At a political level, perhaps, one might see if it were possible for the Commissioner concerned, for example, to come over and discuss issues in due course with the Opposition leaders.  It might be of some help at that level but in terms of the ongoing technical exercise it is the Department of Finance, the Government in general and the national authorities which are engaged in that process and it would not help beyond that.  They can deal with any queries the Opposition might have in that regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_63">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_102">I follow Deputy Kenny's point on the role of Commission officials in the Department of Finance which the Taoiseach describes as a technical exercise.  What is the intended outcome of that technical exercise?  Is it intended there will be a report from those officials to the Commission?  Will the Government have access to such a report and is it intended that it would be made available to the Opposition parties in the course of time when completed?</p>
            <p eId="para_103">I refer to the wider batch of questions tabled, in particular with regard to the informal summit on 16 September which discussed the general economic situation in Europe.  After that summit the Taoiseach was reported as having stated there was no discussion at the summit, formally or informally, of Ireland's economic situation.  I was surprised because I would have thought there would be at least some reference to the situation at the summit meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_104">The Taoiseach stated he met the president of the European Central Bank on the margins of that meeting and had a discussion with him.  Did he raise with the ECB president, Mr. Trichet, comments he made a few days before the summit in which he was reported to have said that eurozone members in breach of the region's rules on public finances might be excluded temporarily from Europe's political decision-making?  These were comments which were made by Mr. Trichet a few days before the summit in which he is reported to have said that eurozone members in breach of the region's rules on public finances might be excluded temporarily from Europe's political decision making.  I found that an extraordinary statement and I wonder whether the Taoiseach raised that matter with the ECB president when he met him.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_64">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_105">In answer to the Deputy's first question, I was making a point in reply to Deputy Kenny that, perhaps, it might be appropriate if senior officials, or a Commissioner even, might come to Dublin to discuss matters with Opposition leaders at a political level.  That might be helpful.  Contact with the Commission by national authorities relates to forecasting regarding the ongoing technical and economic exercise.  I am not trying to categorise this initiative as a technical exercise <i>per se</i>, but rather making a distinction between discussions at the political level and the normal interaction between Departments of Finance and all member states as well as Directorates General, such as that of Commissioner Rehn. </p>
            <p eId="para_106">In this particular case, we, and the Commission and the eurozone group, have indicated that a four-year plan would be helpful in these circumstances and we are preparing it on that basis.  Clearly, we want to ensure that the basis of support for that is as broad as we can obtain.  It has always been the case that the European Commissioner is kept informed.  That is where this is at now.</p>
            <p eId="para_107">Regarding the European Council, the Irish issue was not raised by anyone or on the agenda.  It was not raised under "any other business" or anything else.  The reason is that we had indicated we were preparing a four-year plan and proceeding with it.  As the Deputy knows, there are talks with finance Ministers as well at the eurozone group level where much of that detailed discussion goes on.  It is not unusual, therefore, that it would not be raised at the Council meeting since this is a Government and Ireland is a country that is very anxious to discharge its obligations and provide the necessary detail to assist everyone to see that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_108">Incidentally, I did not raise any issue with Mr. Trichet in that regard.  As the Deputy knows, the Van Rompuy report is still ongoing.  The final draft will be with us imminently and we are preparing for the next summit where it will be discussed.  A great deal of discussion is taking place about a whole range of issues affecting different countries at the moment, and there are differences of opinion in that regard.  The discussion with Mr. Trichet was after a dinner that evening at the wind up of the summit.  My recollection is that Mr. Felipe Gonzáles, who was there as a guest, was speaking on behalf of a senior group that was working there in relation to the future governance of the Union.  In any event, when it was over, I went to speak to Mr. Trichet and that detailed discussion was taking place.</p>

            <p eId="para_109">Do I understand correctly from the Taoiseach's reply that the commitment to have a four-year budgetary plan had been agreed by Government with the Commission before the meeting on 16 September?  The Taoiseach referred to it in the course of his reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">I presume that the Taoiseach made a contribution to the meeting.  If nobody else referred to the Irish economic situation, did he mention it in the course of his contribution and can he give the House a flavour of what he told the meeting?</p>

Now that the Deputy mentions it, I will have to check whether the proposal to prepare the four-year plan had been agreed at that stage.  I was just making the point that the issue did not arise at the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">The only statement given by me in this regard was that Ireland was committed to its obligations under the Stability and Growth Pact and would be proceeding along those lines.  It is important to point out that Ireland has been taking steps, since this issue first arose in the summer of 2008, to achieve stabilisation of the deficit and, more recently, to prepare a deficit reduction programme.  The Deputy's point is a fair one and I will provide the answer for him.</p>

            <p eId="para_113">Can the Taoiseach advise us on whether the Council, during the course of the meeting of 16 September, addressed the serious impact of the current economic situation on the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly that of rising unemployment across many member states?  Was any consideration given to curbing the considerable powers of the international credit rating agencies and bond markets, which are now, by their actions and decisions, virtually dictating national policy to sitting governments of member states?  That is how serious it is.  Did the Taoiseach take note of the statement on 8 October by the rating agency Fitch that more repossessions and evictions were needed in Ireland — in its words, to help the performance of the banks?  I do not need to remind the Taoiseach, who is as familiar with our history as I am——</p>

            <p eId="para_118">The special meeting was called by the President of the European Council to discuss specific issues.  More meetings of the European Council are taking place as a result of the Lisbon treaty, but not all of these have the full agenda of a normal Council meeting, of which there were traditionally two per year — one in the summer and one in December — plus another in the spring to deal with the goals under the Lisbon agenda, as it was called at the time, of making the European economy more competitive.  We are now trying to come up with strategic goals for the European economy, and a means of achieving them, between now and 2020.  This is a far more limited set of objectives, perhaps, than the various performance indicators under the Lisbon Agenda.  At that time the meetings had become something of a box-ticking exercise rather than incorporating a strategic approach to improving the European economy generally.  That is the lesson that was learned from that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">The meeting of 16 September was about the strategic relationships we need to foster — for example, with China, India, Brazil and the United States.  Mr. Van Rompuy also briefed the Council on the progress being made by the task force on economic governance, which he is chairing, including the changes being contemplated to improve oversight and surveillance by the euro group of the budget policies of member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">The Deputy's second point relates to the influence of the markets.  In the aftermath of the financial and economic crisis, sovereign debt is an issue that is now in play in a way that would not have been the case during the time of prolonged world economic growth since the 1990s.  Due to the impact this has had on the infrastructure of the international financial system, all debt, including sovereign debt and the ability of sovereigns to repay their debt, is being taken into account through the cost of borrowing that states have to endure from those institutions that provide the money to fund deficits.  This is happening due to the impact of the recession and the need to fund those deficits in a planned way over time, so that they can be reduced and we can get back to a budgetary balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_124">With respect to curbing their power, it is a question of the way to do that and the way to manage our own destiny.  The way to effect economic control over our own country is to come forward with strategies and policies that show we are capable of funding those deficits, being able to repay our debt over time, and fostering growth in the economy.  That is a difficult thing to achieve, but it can be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_125">The purpose of our current discussions is to achieve the objective of consolidating the public finances, which is absolutely vital for confidence, job creation and investment in a predictable way, where a return on the investment can be confirmed, while at the same time allowing for the prospects of growth so that the economy can grow out of its current difficulties.</p>

           his views on circulars from his Department concerning commercial motor tax and their effect on small businesses; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [37697/10]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_76">
            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_127">There has been no change to the system of motor taxation in respect of goods vehicles.  Accordingly, I am not aware of any negative impact on small businesses due to the continued implementation of existing motor tax legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">My Department issued a circular letter to motor tax offices in August 2010 reminding authorised officers of existing provisions with regard to the taxation of vehicles on a goods basis.  This circular reiterated the terms of a 2005 circular letter.  To be taxed as a goods vehicle, a vehicle must be constructed or adapted for that purpose and used solely in the course of trade or business.  If a vehicle is adapted, it must have the same characteristics as a goods vehicle in respect of space and accommodation for carrying goods and it must have limited seating capacity.  In effect, this means that in order to be taxed in the goods category, the goods-carrying area of the vehicle must be greater than the seating area; all seats to the rear of the driver's seat must be removed and seat bolt holes welded over and all rear seat belts must be removed and seat belt anchor points welded over.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">Under Section 2 of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952, if a vehicle is used in a condition or manner which would attract motor tax at a higher rate, tax then becomes payable at that rate.  In other words, if a goods vehicle is used in a private capacity, it must, like all other private vehicles, be taxed at the private rate of motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">Under Article 3 of the  Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 1992, a licensing authority must be satisfied that a vehicle is correctly taxed, and it is thus open to a motor tax office to seek additional documentation supporting a claim for the goods rate of motor tax.  Such documentation may include a certificate of commercial insurance or evidence of registration for VAT purposes, or, at the discretion of the licensing authority concerned, any other appropriate document.  In circumstances where an RF111A goods only declaration is required, an income tax registration number is now routinely sought.  I would not expect that any person genuinely using a vehicle in the course of trade or business should have a difficulty supplying documentation to support a claim for what is, in effect, a concessionary rate of motor tax.</p>
            <p eId="para_131">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">The requirement to sign form RF 111A goods declaration form is not new and constitutes a statement by the applicant that the vehicle is being used in the course of trade or business.  I would not expect that this declaration should need to be sought at every renewal once particulars of the vehicle and its use have not changed since the last renewal.  The form would normally be sought at the time of first taxing as a goods vehicle and on change of ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_133">I reiterate that the legal provisions governing the taxation of goods vehicles have not changed.</p>

            <p eId="para_134">The Department issued a circular to all local authorities on 10 August and this has caused major confusion in respect of the taxation of commercial vehicles.  The tax could be €400 under the particular interpretation of one local authority, while it could be as high as €1,200 in the next local authority.  The Minister has caused an enormous shambles with local government financing.  Will he be issuing a new instruction to ensure that the wording of the declaration that has been insisted on will be changed so that the primary use of the vehicle is for business?  There should be no doubt that if commercial vehicle owners drop off their children at school or engage in personal business, they do not have to pay the additional taxation.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_147">In accordance with the provisions of the waste management Acts, the preparation and adoption of a waste management plan, including infrastructure provision, is the statutory responsibility of the local authority or authorities concerned, and under section 60(3) of the Act I am precluded from exercising any power or control over the performance by a local authority, in particular circumstances, of a statutory function vested in it.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">However, it is the role of the Minister and the Government to set the policy framework and I intend that Irish waste policy will focus on maximising what should be seen as a resource.  Against that background I have expressed concerns regarding the potential implications of the large-scale Poolbeg waste facility for the more progressive approach to waste management I am determined to pursue.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">On 15 July 2010, I published a draft statement of waste policy for public consultation.  This set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond with a focus on a resource management approach.  There will be clear implications for the provision of waste infrastructure as waste is driven away from residual treatment and towards recycling and reuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">The consultation closed on 1 October and I am considering the submissions received with a view to bringing a final policy statement to Government for decision at the earliest opportunity.

            <p eId="para_151">Is the Minister suggesting that when his draft statement of waste policy is in place, the Poolbeg incinerator will be affected by it?  What advice has the Minister received from his departmental officials on the likely cost to the local authority or the State generally if Covanta were not to proceed?  A senior Covanta executive recently said that if the incinerator levies the Minister has been promising were imposed, the company would not proceed.  What information does the Minister have on the cost to be incurred if Covanta pulls out of the project?</p>
            <p eId="para_152">Just before the summer in a reply to Deputy Quinn the Minister gave an update on a report he was having carried out.  He said he expected the report to be released shortly and that it would relate to the nature and extent of the financial and related risks and consequences which might be faced by Dublin City Council on the project.  I ask the Minister for an update on those matters.</p>

            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_153">Regarding that report, in February 2010 I appointed Mr. John Hennessy SC under section 224 of the Local Government Act 2001 to prepare a report on risks which may be faced by the local authority in connection with this project.  This report has recently been submitted and I am considering its findings in consultation with the Attorney General in advance of bringing it to Government.  That report goes into considerable detail on the risks and future costs, with particular emphasis on the "put or pay" clause versus the costs that will ensue if the contract is broken.  I have seen the exaggerated claims made by the company and Dublin City Council both in the media and at an Oireachtas joint committee hearing, to the effect that the taxpayer will have a substantial bill to pay.  These claims are grossly exaggerated.  In advance of the report being published I cannot say any more than that.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The company is very good at sending out its PR people.  I have seen media reports suggesting that if I introduced these levies, it would not proceed.  Government policy will not be determined by any multinational.  We are the Government and will proceed with our policy on waste management and will not be intimidated or deterred by any company.</p>

When does the Minister hope to report the figures, which would be of interest to taxpayers?  If, as the Minister claims, it is not as bad as has been reported, that information should be published as quickly as possible.  I do not understand why there might be a legal problem in publishing it.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">A recent newspaper report quoted the American ambassador, Mr. Dan Rooney, as saying that the project should proceed.  It also mentioned that the Minister had recently met representatives of Covanta.  Can the Minister give details of the meeting and was the ambassador present?</p>

            <p eId="para_157">In answer to the Deputy's last question, I met the American ambassador but have not met representatives of the company.  Her previous question asked whether the project would proceed and she talked about my claims.  However, the claims to which she referred were claims made by the company, Covanta, which stated, as far as I know in a newspaper article last week, that if these levies were introduced as part of the environment (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, it would not proceed.  That is the latest information I have.  I am saying unequivocally that I will be proceeding with that legislation.  That has always been my policy and it is the policy which, from a sustainability point of view, makes total sense.</p>

        <b>Deputy Phil Hogan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
           if, in tandem with the publication of the Bill to establish a directly elected mayor for Dublin, he will indicate the estimated cost for the establishment and running of the office; the way he intends to meet this cost; if he will publish a regulatory impact assessment with the Bill; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#JohnGormley" eId="spk_95" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy John Gormley</from>
            <p eId="para_161">The Local Government (Mayor and Regional Authority of Dublin) Bill 2010, which sets out the powers, functions and financing arrangements for the mayor and authority, was presented to Dáil Éireann on 15 October 2010.  I published a regulatory impact assessment on my Department's website on that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">A precise costing is not possible at this time, pending decisions which will be made in the coming months, in consultation with the Dublin local authorities, on the number and grades of staff employed, the facilities which will be required, the location of offices and other organisational details.  However, I can state unequivocally that the costs of funding the Dublin mayor and supporting structures will be met entirely from within the local government sector.  Opportunities to reduce costs are being taken.  The new, strengthened regional authority provided for in the Bill will have 16 elected members; the authority it will replace has 30.  There will be offsetting savings on functions currently performed by other bodies.  The staffing structure will be relatively modest and will be drawn from the local government sector.  Costs will be significantly outweighed by anticipated benefits in a range of key areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">It should be noted that in 2010, the net budgeted revenue expenditure of local government fell by €381 million compared to 2009, a 7.6% decrease.  Local government will continue to play its role in the Government's determined efforts to restore balance and sustainability in the public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">Alongside the introduction of the Dublin mayor, efficiency and saving measures will continue to be pursued across the local government sector arising from the report of the local government efficiency review group and related initiatives.  In Dublin alone, these savings are estimated at €40 million per annum over time.  In particular, it is my intention that the staffing complement, including senior manager numbers in Dublin City Council, will be reviewed in line with a recommendation made in the efficiency review, and this will be put in hand as soon as possible.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_96">
            <from>Deputy Phil Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_165">From the Minister's statement it is clear that he has no notion about the cost of this office.  He is disingenuous again today in saying he has no idea of the ballpark figure for this new office because the local authorities in Dublin have been briefed by the Department on the potential cost.  I have access to documentation from Fingal County Council indicating that this office will cost €8 million over five years and that €1.6 million will need to be provided in its estimates based on the Minister's decision to proceed with this office immediately.  This cost will ultimately need to be borne by the small business sector, the business sector generally and the consumers of services in those local authorities given that the Minister has just said it will need to be funded from existing resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">While there is no difficulty with the principle of the Bill, I ask the Minister to postpone it until 2014 when the local government elections will be held and then let us have a directly elected mayor for Dublin in the context of overall reform of the existing structures.  The Minister is satisfied to leave 133 councillors in four local authorities in place along with four county managers and an overarching regional authority with a directly elected mayor of Dublin at a cost of €8 million over five years.  In these critical economic times for businesses and consumers, I ask the Minister to postpone this until 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_174">——on the introduction of a Dublin mayor.  The document overstates anticipated expenditure considerably.  For example, an estimate of not less than €1 million in consultants' fees to assist with a mayoral strategy is cited.  There is no basis whatsoever to conclude that consultants would even be required to produce such a document.  A figure of €1 million is misleading in the extreme.  The Deputy should bear in mind — I hope he will never cite this document again — that Fingal County Council issued a press release stating:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_175">Some personal conjecture regarding the cost of running the Mayoral Office and the wider implications of the proposal was inappropriately contained in this report.  Any confusion or misunderstanding caused is regretted.</p>

            <p eId="para_178">I will make it a little bit easier for the Minister.  Will he accept there will be a cost to businesses and to consumers of services in Dublin arising from the enactment of this legislation?  For the Minister's information, Fingal County Council has indicated that 35 to 40 staff will be needed, plus a ministerial salary or Minister of State salary that the Minister has projected, plus a home for the new officeholder and a regional authority to support it with the consequent staff that it would require.</p>
            <p eId="para_179">To give an impression that such an office would pose no additional cost to the taxpayers or consumers of services or to the estimates of Dublin City Council or any other local authority in the Dublin area is off the mark.  I ask the Minister again not to introduce another charge or tax on businesses and consumers of services in 2011 and to postpone the introduction of this legislation until 2014.</p>

            <p eId="para_212">Following the Government decision not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland, an interdepartmental task force, chaired by my Department, was established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.

The commission was established in 2004 to report on the secrecy and accuracy of the chosen electronic voting and counting system.  It published an interim report in April 2004, followed by its first report later that year in December 2004.  The commission's second and final report was published in July 2006.</p>

Does he accept that if a little order had been applied initially the Government would have squandered less taxpayers' money on this expensive project?  The sum of €54 million is a huge amount of money to have been squandered by the Government.  We hear of what will happen in hospitals throughout the country following cutbacks to be introduced in the budget and the life-threatening consequences of those.  The Minister, Deputy Harney spoke today about the serious cutbacks that will be made to health services  It is a shame and a sin for such an amount of money to have been squandered by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">Can the Minister provide a  more comprehensive figure for the buy-out associated with the termination of storage leases which he admitted will be payable?  Leases were taken out for 20 to 25 years to store machines that we all know were obsolete eight years ago — they were duds eight years ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_221">The Deputy raised a number of issues.  If the Deputy is seeking the costs in regard to storage, as I understand it, cessation of the electronic voting project involves dealing with the legacy of storage.  Pending the disposal of the equipment, the machines must still be stored somewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_222">The cost of storing the machines at local premises has been significantly reduced in recent years.  In 2004 up to €658,000 was spent on storage, which was reduced to €204,000 in 2008 and to €182,000 in 2009.  It is important the job be done right in line with legal and regulatory requirements.  We do not want to expose the Exchequer to further risks or liabilities arising from the disposal of the equipment.  The key objective is to achieve the most economically advantageous outcome while limiting any further potential costs and, where possible, recovering some of the investment.</p>

            <p eId="para_229">A complaint was received from the European Commission in May 2009, through the EU pilot pre-infringement process, concerning the regulatory status of the former Irish ISPAT site at Haulbowline.  Ireland wrote to the Commission in October 2009 setting out the current position.  A response from the Commission is still awaited under this process.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">Ireland's response to the additional letter of formal notice relating to the 2005 judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities in case C-494/01 is being formulated and will be forwarded to the Commission in the two months provided for under article 260(2) of the EU treaty.  While this letter references the former Irish ISPAT site on the issue of a valid waste authorisation, this site did not form part of the original judgment.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">Consideration of the regulatory requirements relevant to the site falls within the terms of reference of the Office of Public Works-led working group established by the Government to develop a structured and coherent approach to the site's further management and development.  The future use of the site will influence the levels and extent of further works and remediation required, as well as helping to clarify the further regulatory requirements which may fall to be met.  The Environmental Protection Agency has been in contact with the Office of Public Works on the regulatory requirements applicable to the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">It is important to recognise the State has spent approximately €50 million on remediation work on Haulbowline including on investigations, surveys, site works and waste disposal.  The bulk of this expenditure was incurred since 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_234">Irish ISPAT applied for and was granted an integrated pollution control licence by the EPA.  However, the company went into liquidation before the conditions in the licence could be met.  The liquidator applied to the High Court seeking to disclaim the integrated pollution control licence.  Judgment occurred on 29 July 2004 and found the licence was granted after the company had ceased production of steel and the conditions of the licence could not be applied retrospectively.  A lacuna, therefore, arose and the resolution of this must involve a determination as to the future use of the site and, accordingly, the appropriate regulatory arrangements that should apply to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">The Office of Public Works-led group is examining how to deal with the site.  It very much depends on the future use of the site.  The level of remediation will be determined by whether the site will be used for commercial or residential purposes or returned to parkland.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_265">I propose to take Questions Nos. 67 and 69 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_266">Action to address homelessness is a matter for the housing authorities and the HSE, which have statutory responsibility for providing accommodation and health care services for homeless persons.  I have put in place a comprehensive range of measures to underpin the role of housing authorities and approved housing bodies towards achieving the ambitious objective of eliminating long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough, including an enhanced programme for procurement of accommodation.  A new tenancy support system to help such persons live independently has also been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_267">I recently approved €60 million for the purchase of accommodation to meet the needs of persons with specific categories of housing need, including persons moving out of temporary homeless accommodation.  Over 100 of these units will provide long-term accommodation for such persons, and approved housing bodies have been asked to develop proposals for the further delivery of leased units in addition to accommodation approved under this initiative.  My Department is also working closely with the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency and the Dublin local authorities, where the homelessness issue is most pronounced, to ensure that the drive to eliminate long-term homelessness is advanced as rapidly as possible.  Taken together, these measures have the potential to make significant further progress towards reaching the target in the current year.  The pace of progress is also dependent on the response of market interests, including property owners and financial institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_268">The number of homeless households that were assessed as eligible and in need of social housing support throughout the State, according to the 2008 housing needs assessment, is 1,394.  A breakdown of this figure by household on a local authority basis is available on my Department's website at <i>www.environ.ie</i>.  A more comprehensive survey, in March 2008, reported a total of 1,436 homeless households in Dublin.  Some 708 households were recorded as residing in long-term and transitional accommodation, but it would be incorrect to regard all of these as homeless.  This survey method was also used for the first time in Cork, Galway and Limerick in 2008.  The results indicated a total of 767 homeless households in these centres.  That figure also includes households in long-term and transitional accommodation, some of whom should not properly be regarded as homeless.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_173">
            <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
            <p eId="para_269">I acknowledge the Minister's personal interest in trying to rectify this situation but the Government will not achieve the target of eliminating homelessness by the end of the year.  I have three questions for the Minister.  With regard to his definition of homelessness, there is a difference between local authorities in terms of how they interpret the different definitions.  Does the Minister plan to introduce a single definition?  Most people would equate homelessness with a person not having accommodation in which to live from day to day.  That should probably be the standard definition.</p>
            <p eId="para_270">With regard to strategy, the HSE is involved in dealing with this matter as well as the Department.  Are there plans to make a single Government agency ultimately responsible for dealing with homelessness?  In terms of statistics, can the Minister confirm that there has been an increase in the number of people who are homeless as a result of the recession?  How often are statistics compiled?  As regards housing schemes, there was a target of providing 1,200 long-term lease homes for homeless people.  That has not been achieved.  Does the Minister have any plans to roll this out and, for example, use the CAS or RAS schemes to acquire these units?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_174" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment__Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Michael Finneran</from>
            <p eId="para_271">The definition of homelessness must be looked at in a number of ways.  Many people associate homelessness with people who sleep rough on the streets in the capital and in other centres of population.  The focus of the strategy is, of course, on that category to ensure that nobody would be obliged to sleep rough.  It also focuses on the other category, people who are in temporary accommodation for a long time, ranging from six months to seven or eight years.  There is another category of people whom it is probably unfair to categorise as homeless, that is, people who are in assisted living accommodation.  They are not capable of living by themselves and probably will not be in the future.  It is unfair and somewhat discriminatory to describe them as homeless.  They should be identified as people who are living, if the accommodation is suitable, where they will live into the future through assisted living.</p>
            <p eId="para_272">With regard to the strategy, I have made it clear to the housing authorities, approved bodies and others that the strategy should be their aspiration.  Recall what happened in January this year.  I am proud that the local authorities, approved bodies, outreach people and all others involved ensured that no homeless person in this country lost their life during the cold period and that nobody had to sleep rough.  That was a great compliment to everybody involved.  Across the water some 30 people died during the cold spell while hundreds died across Europe.  Recently, I allocated a further €60 million towards acquiring 430 units.  A total of 100 of those units are specifically identified for the homeless.</p>

            <p eId="para_275">Information acquired under the Freedom of Information Act shows that last January the HSE-run homeless persons unit received over 5,000 calls for emergency housing.  By July this figure had almost doubled to 9,300 calls.  I agree that the Minister is familiar with this area but the real issue in dealing with homelessness is moving people from emergency housing to long-term, more sustainable living arrangements.  In Dublin, 54% of people who are defined as homeless under the current definition are in emergency housing.  Does the Minister recognise that the way to deal with homelessness in the long term is to move people from emergency housing into long-term, more independent and sustainable living accommodation?  What type of investment is the Minister focusing on this area?  Finally, does he believe the strategy set down in 2008 is meeting its targets or is the schedule falling behind?</p>

            <p eId="para_276">It is important to identify the categories of homeless and long-term homeless.  There will be homelessness and nobody can prevent that.  It is happening on an ongoing basis for many reasons.  I will not go through them in detail but Members will be aware that it arises as a result of family disputes, health problems, substance abuse and so forth.  We are focusing on people who are more than six months in short-term accommodation.  I am anxious to move these people on so they can build a new life.  I have set out supportive measures for the local authorities and the approved bodies in that area.  Not only have I provided €66 million in 2010 but I also recently approved €60 million.  I have set up two support mechanisms.  In Dublin, the Dublin Simon Community will deal with people who might need some assistance for the first six or 12 months to go into a home.  I have set up another group in Galway under the COPE Galway, which got the tender to deal with the issue there.</p>
            <p eId="para_277">Of course, I am dependent on the local authorities and the voluntary bodies to provide the units of accommodation.  I am providing funds to purchase some of those.</p>
            <p eId="para_278">I am pushing to reach the target.  I have great faith in the Homeless Agency, local authorities and voluntary bodies and, at the end of the year, we will see what they have done on that figure.  One of the encouraging figures is that up to October this year, we had signed up 724 tenancies.  A great deal of good work has been done and whatever the difficulties in this work, the people at the coal face are putting their shoulder to the wheel and I will continue to work with them.</p>

A large public march was held in Enniscorthy, County Wexford last weekend as parents and members of the local community are incensed by the cuts affecting the most vulnerable in society and depriving them of the right to equality in education; (4) Deputy Michael Creed — to raise the matter of the implementation of a national foot screening programme for diabetics, the provision of podiatry care for diabetics and, in particular, the withdrawal of services from Macroom Community Hospital since January 2010; (5) Deputy Frank Feighan — to ask the Minister for Education and Skills to explore the possibility of providing third level education college for Carrick-on-Shannon.  Has the Minister any proposals based on the fact that Carrick-on-Shannon is now a regional town?; (6) Deputy James Bannon — the need for the Minister for Justice and Law Reform to ensure that a person who is severely brain damaged following a car accident and requires urgent treatment will be transferred to the care of the Department of Health and Children; (7) Deputy Thomas P. Broughan — the application of law in regard to an ongoing matter (details supplied); (8)   Deputy Jan O'Sullivan — the position regarding the new national paediatric hospital; (9) Deputy Joe Costello — the need for the Minister for Transport to maintain competition in the airline industry in Ireland; (10) Deputy Michael McGrath — the position regarding the construction of a school (details supplied) in County Cork; (11) Deputy Kieran O'Donnell — to call on the Minister for Health and Children to provide adequate resources to deal with the overcrowding of accident and emergency services at Mid-West Regional Hospital, Limerick and to make a statement on the progress of reconfiguration of services in the mid-west; and (12) Deputy Tom Hayes — can the Minister for Transport outline what his Department has planned in terms of providing additional signage for long-standing food and beverage facilities in towns off the motorway network, in light of the news that previously planned services on the motorway will now not go ahead, particularly on the Dublin-Cork motorway; and if facilities will be allowed signage given that services are an important facility to prevent road accidents.</p>

          <p eId="para_294">Yesterday, the Fine Gael spokesperson on finance and his colleagues were briefed by the Department of Finance on the true figures regarding the economy.  To say that the figures that were produced were outrageous is an understatement.  They were appalling and they show that, from the beginning of the banking crisis, the Taoiseach has known the situation was far worse than anything the people were being told.  Not only was the economy being destroyed by the Government but it was wilfully concealing the truth of the extent of that destruction from the people in what amounts to a national catastrophe.  This cannot go on.  We have lost trust in the Taoiseach and his Government and in their ability to tell us the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">This party will play its part in responding to this national crisis and we will produce a response to it but we will not do so on the basis of what the Taoiseach tells us anymore because every figure produced by the Department of Finance and the Government has been wrong.  How many times have we turned the corner?  How many times have the growth rates been pointing seriously upwards?  How many times have we been told, even by the Taoiseach, that the extent of the deficit could not be more than €4 billion?  I will no longer operate on the basis of the figures produced by Government.  I want an independent verification process for these figures.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">The consolidation in the public finances has been ongoing since the summer of 2008 when this issue first arose. I do not want to go over old ground because we need to look to the present and to the future but there has been a suggestion that the Government needs to begin a consolidation.  The consolidation aspect of our policies — these policies did not win unanimous favour in the House — has meant €7.5 billion less in spending and taxation than would otherwise be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">The four-year plan is being prepared and an opportunity can be given for everyone to debate it in the House.  I said earlier today that I would welcome a debate here.  It also requires us to see what measure of agreement can be found.  Obviously there are political differences and the roles of Government and Opposition differ.  However, I believe that it would be helpful and that the people would like to see to what extent we can achieve agreement.  The changes in the costs of borrowing and the great turbulence in financial markets, the medium-term prospect of the cost of funding and the question of the growth prospects for the European economy, for the world economy and, by extension, the Irish economy which is determined very much by those external circumstances, will have to be taken into account.  A prudential view has to be taken so that we can provide a credible pathway and ensure that those who fund the deficits for our sovereign debt are aware that all of us are committed to making the adjustment and correction necessary by 2014.  That is the purpose of the exercise in which we are engaged and to do so as collectively as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">The Taoiseach can take it from me now that the Fine Gael Party will continue to play its part in any necessary consensus.  We will support what we believe in and we will oppose what we do not believe in.  From the point of honesty and truth and having everything above board, if we are to start serious planning to deal with the catastrophe wreaked on the Irish people by the Taoiseach's Government, we have to know that the starting point is true and valid and can be stood over.  From that perspective, none of the figures given to us by the Department of Finance or the Government, by the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach, has stood up.  I cannot believe a word from this Government's mouth when it tells me this is the starting point for preparing my plans and my response to the crisis.  I want the integrity of the figures given to the spokespersons on finance yesterday to be independently validated.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">The Taoiseach has known since the Central Statistics Office last June reduced its estimate of the size of the economy that things were not going to be the way he had predicted.  He has known since the Minister for Finance saw the pattern of tax revenues that the economy was not going to be in the shape he was saying.  He has known since last March that the bank bailout was going to be much bigger than was predicted in the stability plan last December.  Why did the Taoiseach not act sooner when he knew these facts were coming down the track?  Why did he close down this Chamber for three months last June when he could have introduced an emergency budget to stabilise the situation?  Why did he not act in the interests of the Irish people?  He let it drift right through the summer and now the people face a financial Everest for which they are being asked to pay and for which they were not responsible and in respect of which the politicians in here, in particular, the Opposition parties, are being asked to come forward with their plans.  We will come forward with our plans but I need to know what is the starting point that can be stood over because every figure the Taoiseach has given has been wrong.

Expenditures are in line and are underneath projected targets.  Total taxation, while slightly down, is only down by 2% overall on the income tax side.

          <p eId="para_316">We should just deal with the facts.  The decisions we took resulted in €4 billion being taken out of the economy last year — they were opposed by the Opposition — and have brought us from a position of contraction in the economy of more than 10% of GNP in 2009 to stabilisation this year of 0% and very little growth, if any.  The whole purpose of further consolidation is to bring the public finances further into order, as well as identifying sectors for growth, to promote growth in the economy and to achieve a position whereby we can get to net employment in the country when coming out of this crisis.  That is the Government's strategy and it has been validated and supported by international institutions of repute, the independent institutions of whom the Deputy speaks.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">I say to Deputy Kenny that it does not add to our debate one whit to suggest that the Department of Finance did not provide a full, independent assessment of the situation, taking into account many predictions.  On the question of forecasting, by definition, forecasting has to involve certain assumptions which are put into the model and an outcome is produced.  What has been clear is that the growth forecast for the European economy, the world economy and, by extension, the Irish economy has to be modified somewhat as a result.  We would also contend that the flexibility of our labour markets has been such that we have been able to benefit from a pick-up in world trends and output better than most because of the open nature of our economy.  It is not, therefore, correct to say that every figure the Deputy received is incorrect.  The budgetary targets as set out in December 2009 for the financial year 2010 are broadly as outlined.</p>

This represents about 10% of the debt repayment that will be involved next year.  However, that is not the only source of our problem.  The real source of our problem, with which we have been contending for some time, has been the hole in the public finances as a result of reduced revenues.  There is a need to bring expenditure back progressively over time, although not in a draconian way in the first instance, albeit I recognise that any change in expenditure levels can bring its own hardships and difficulties.  This has been the Government's strategy.  The Government has moved from contraction measures to stabilisation and now we have to find growth.  One of the difficulties in the significant budgetary correction over the next four years will be how to find this balance between budgetary correction and the need to maintain growth in the economy.  This is an issue we have to further discuss and we have to examine the data.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">I remind the Deputy that the data being provided are from a series of forecasts which are precisely that, using one's best judgment in the best circumstances to try to predict what way things will go in the future.  The past two or three years have seen a degree of turbulence and change which has been unprecedented in the past 70 years.</p>

          <p eId="para_325">When the Minister for Finance came in here on budget day last year, he introduced the budget and told us the worst was over.  All through the year he has repeated that the worst is over, that we have turned the corner and that the Government's plan is working.  As recently as 19 September, in an interview with <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>, he told us we had turned the corner.  When he introduced the budget he told us there was a remaining €7.5 billion of budgetary adjustments to be made between last year and 2014.  The briefing of Opposition finance spokespersons by Department of Finance officials shows that the figure of €7.5 billion is way wide of the mark.  The figure now being discussed and considered is significantly higher than that.  The worst is yet to come.  I appreciate that not every budgetary figure and projection made by the Minister for Finance on budget day will come in bang on the button.  However, the extent to which the projections were completely wrong is utterly astonishing.  I do not know anywhere else where the Minister for Finance gives a Budget Statement and within one year the projections within the statement were so seriously out of kilter.  How did the Government get the figures so badly wrong?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_326">The answer is twofold.  Deputy Gilmore omitted the other issue over the course of the year.  It was not simply about whether the growth rate was 0%, 0.5% or minus 0.5% or whether the current budget deficit was 11.9%, 11.5% or 11%.  There was also the banking issue, which provided a spike in our current budget deficit for this year.  Given what we had to provide for in that regard, the increase in the national debt was of the order of 20%.  The increase in the deficit means the promissory note system, on which Opposition finance spokespersons were briefed yesterday, provides for paying over a longer period of time, as in a mortgage situation.  That must be dealt with.  I do not want to say that this is the sole source of our problems and annoyance, upset and frustration about this exists.  However, it is 10% of the repayment we must make next year in respect of the repayment of debt interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Regarding the change for the future, the assumptions laid out in the last budget are very clear.  The economic outlook is weaker than previously anticipated.  The figure taken for last year's budget medium-term projection was within the parameters of various forecasts made by other reputable international and national institutions.  It is also important to recognise the impact of consolidation on economic growth and that balance must be struck.  The budget framework set for December is broadly in line with projections.  As bad as things have been, it is not correct to say that things have got worse.  A contraction of 10% in 2009 has been converted to a stabilisation in the economy this year where there has not been a further contraction in the economy.  From where we were coming, this was a good performance since we did not contract by the same percentage this year.  That happened because we took decisions on spending and other areas that did not meet with universal approval from the House.  Can next year and the years after be better?  Can we have an economy that can grow in the context of this consolidation?  We must get the balance right between a measure of consolidation and ensuring the economy can grow through sectors of the economy where there was already growth this year.  There are areas of the economy growing but this is not sufficient to overcome the contraction in areas like construction and retail.  I understand the Opposition parties' predilection for rhetorical phrases but they should not suggest that we are in a catastrophic situation when we have gone from -10% to 0% and consolidating.  Difficult decisions must be taken and there are no soft options.  The level of consolidation will be greater than previously proposed for the reasons given, including weaker growth and higher borrowing costs in the main.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Structural policy is also an issue.  We must change our policies because if we continue on a no policy change basis, we will be in an unsustainable situation.  In ordinary terms that people understand, if one is spending €50 and only taking in €31 or €32 the situation cannot continue year on year or month on month.</p>

          <p eId="para_332">The Taoiseach says the economic outlook now is weaker.  Last year the Taoiseach was telling us there would be rapid growth in the Irish economy in 2010.  Now he reminds me about the banking issue.  I had not forgotten about the banking issue and he has reminded us that this is adding 20% to the problem.  The Taoiseach said the cost of the banking crisis would be borne by the sector and assured us we would have to pay nothing for it.  The Taoiseach got that wrong by €45 billion or €50 billion.  We were given the growth projections last year but the Taoiseach is now saying these are wrong and must be revised.  We were given a figure for the budgetary correction over a four-year period and the Taoiseach is now saying this must be significantly increased.  Having got it wrong so often, repeatedly and so dramatically, where is the Taoiseach's credibility?  He is offering us a process and has arranged for a meeting of the party leaders tomorrow, which I will attend, but he must examine the process he is asking us to engage in.  The Government got us into this mess and every prediction and projection made over the past two and half years has been incorrect and dramatically incorrect in most cases.  The Taoiseach wants the Opposition to solve the problem for him, he wants the people of the country to pay for it and meanwhile he wants to stay in office.  Does he seriously expect us to agree to this?</p>

I understand that during Leaders' Questions, people have the opportunity to get into a rhetorical flow but I will answer the points raised by Deputy Gilmore.  We faced a crisis in this country in 2008 and the banking guarantee was the means by which we maintained a semblance of a banking system that has since had to be repaired in full.  The proposal of the Labour Party at the time would have brought down the banking system and hundreds of thousands of jobs would have been lost.  That is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_336">Leaving that behind and moving to the budgetary issue, as late as last week there was a suggestion from Deputy Gilmore that he felt it was possible to meet the requirements of the situation while protecting major areas of expenditure in all and every circumstance.  I am sure he sincerely believed this.  All of us are having to contemplate areas of policy change which we would not wish to do in normal times.  When times were better I recall that in my budgets in the region of €4.4 billion extra was paid in welfare, and rightly so.  It was well in excess of inflation, the consumer price index, CPI, or anything else.  That is not something that could be confirmed in every year in which the Labour Party was in office.  That is beside the point.</p>

Of course it does not meet with popular acclaim, since it involves reductions in expenditure, some increases in taxation but also promoting as much growth as we can in the economy and stopping the contraction in the economy which was unprecedented in 2009.  The fact is that there was a view in this House during those two years that those decisions were not necessary when they were necessary.

I understand and respect the arguments people put in that regard, but having considered them the problem is that one's level of debt can continue to rise and that can bring its own adverse reaction in terms of being able to fund the deficits one is trying to manage as equitably and best as one can while protecting the people one wants to protect to the greatest extent possible with the resources available.</p>

Deputy Charles Flanagan has raised the question of the children's referendum on a number of occasions.  People working in the child care area in general are absolutely confused about the Government's intentions on the proposal to hold a referendum on children's rights.  I respectfully suggest that a debate in the House to tease out all those matters would be appropriate.  It is an issue that is causing serious concern for those who are involved and working in the child care area.  Will the Taoiseach make arrangements with his Whip to allow for that?</p>
          <p eId="para_400">Arising from the information we now have about the provision of the national children's hospital on the Mater Hospital site, the Minister for Health and Children appointed a chairman to a group to look at this.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I answered detailed questions on the children's rights referendum in the House last week.  Deputy Flanagan asked a relevant supplementary question and I gave the full details on the up-to-date position; there has been no change since then.   Work is ongoing and when it has been considered, it will be appropriate then to come back for discussion in the House and at the relevant committee on how to proceed and maintain the widest possible support for the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The other issue has been dealt with.  We have decided to build the national children's hospital on the site adjacent to the Mater Hospital following a rigorous analysis.  The McKinsey report was published in 2005, the Department of Health and Children, the HSE and the OPW, following extensive consultations, published a report in 2006 and RKW published a report in 2007 which included a detailed assessment of capacity at the site that concluded that all requirements can be accommodated there while allowing room for expansion beyond 2021.  That report was informed by clinical and architectural experts from major children's hospitals in Toronto, Philadelphia and Manchester.  Since then, further work has been done.  The Faculty of Paediatrics, the authoritative professional body representing paediatricians in Ireland, as late as 12 October last publicly supported the new hospital and recommended it should proceed as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Unfortunately the chairman has resigned and the issues are known.  There was a question of how the remit of the hospital was to proceed with the building of the hospital on that site.  Of the last 25 major paediatric hospitals worldwide, 24 have been built adjacent to adult hospital sites.  I thank him for the work he did at the time.</p>

He said there was a shortage of money, which he referred to as "funding shortfall", and that the Government is not clear about its policy, referring to "clarity, or lack of it" of Government policy.  He also said there is a "communications difficulty" among the stakeholders, meaning people are at sixes and sevens over what is happening.</p>

He said that he has insisted upon the establishment of a Cabinet sub-committee to consider all aspects of fraud and white collar criminality.  I have looked through the reply the Taoiseach gave me on 29 September in response to a question I asked about what Cabinet subcommittees were in existence and I do not see any sub-committee on fraud and white collar crime.  Is there a Cabinet sub-committee on white collar crime and fraud or will such a sub-committee be set up and when?</p>

Given the large number of Members from all sides of the House who have contributed on the debate, will the Taoiseach consider providing a minimum of two hours, seeing as how a number of important changes have occurred since the Minister made his statement on banking?  As the Taoiseach stated, the Government has identified that the €31 billion in promissory notes in respect of Anglo Irish Bank and the other institutions are to be treated as a "mortgage".  That was the Taoiseach's word.  This means we will have €1.5 billion in interest per year for ten years.</p>

          <p eId="para_597">I raise a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle. This is the second or third time during the course of exchanges on the Order of Business where Labour Party Deputies have asked perfectly legitimate questions,  in one case concerning when legislation would be produced and, in the case of Deputy O'Sullivan, a question on how a Minister could be on the public airwaves announcing what is, in essence, a budgetary measure before the Estimates and budgetary process have been completed.  Those are legitimate questions.  It would be better to hear out the question and allow the Taoiseach answer it rather than try to rule it out of order.</p>

          <p eId="para_629">I will explain the situation to the Deputy.  Ireland is one of the first countries to have signed that convention, subject to ratification.  There will be no undue delay in providing for ratification and it is the Government's intention to do so as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary requirements under the convention are being met.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Ireland holds to the common law tradition of not ratifying treaties until it considers that domestic law in general is in conformity with the treaty.  Therefore, although Ireland has not yet ratified it this does not mean progress is not being made in meeting the requirements of the convention.  It means that when we do ratify, the process of implementing the provisions of the convention will be enhanced.  A number of other countries have decided to ratify first and then deal with the implications for legislation and policies which could prove to be problematic for them in time regarding the implementation of the convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">In many respects, the national disability strategy comprehends many of the provisions of the convention.  A group has developed a programme on which work is progressing to address the matters that need to be aligned with the convention.  One of the key requirements prior to ratification of this convention is the mental capacity Bill which, as the Deputy knows, is due to be introduced to the House.  The detailed provisions of the Bill are at an advanced stage of drafting and it is expected that it will be published in the current Dáil session.  Work on what is involved by way of implementation of the various other provisions in the convention — which are extensive — continues in the relevant Departments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_649">I move:  "That be Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I am pleased to bring before the House today the Chemicals (Amendment) Bill 2010.  The main purpose of the Bill is to meet EU obligations to implement and enforce certain EU regulations.  These include the EU regulation on the classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures, known as the "CLP regulation"; a replacement EU regulation on the export and import of dangerous chemicals implementing the Rotterdam Convention; and periodic technical amendments to these two EU regulations and to the EU REACH and detergents regulations.  The Bill also includes some minor technical changes to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The provisions of the EU regulations, with which this Bill is concerned, are directly applicable in Ireland.  That means that their provisions must be complied with, and cannot be changed by any implementing legislation.  Therefore, the provisions of the Bill relate only to measures necessary for enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">By way of background,  the EU CLP regulation was introduced into EU law on 20 January 2009.  This has its origin in the UN Globally Harmonised System of classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals.  It is useful to understand the aims of this UN system.  Some chemicals, from their production right through to their ultimate use, can be a danger to human health and the environment.  All classes and ages of people can be confronted on a frequent basis with potentially dangerous products.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Given the global trade in chemicals and the need to develop programs to ensure their safe use, transport and disposal, it was recognised that an internationally harmonised system for classification and labelling would be desirable.  Such an approach would facilitate the creation of national frameworks to control chemical exposures and protect people.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The globally harmonised system of classification and labelling of chemicals, otherwise known as GHS, was created to meet this need. GHS classifies chemicals by types of hazard.  It generates harmonised templates for communicating hazards, including labels and safety data sheets.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">GHS seeks to ensure that information on physical hazards and toxicity from chemicals is available in order to enhance the protection of human health and the environment during the handling, transport and use of these chemicals.  The GHS also provides a basis for harmonisation of rules and regulations on chemicals at national, regional and worldwide level, an important factor also for trade facilitation.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The EU CLP regulation is the EU's expression of that global system.  As with the global system, the main aims of the CLP regulation are to help protect human health and the environment by determining which properties of substances and mixtures lead to classification as hazardous, and by correctly identifying and communicating hazards.  The changeover to the new rules will be phased and will fully replace the existing body of EU law in this area from June 2015.  The first notable change will be the requirement on manufacturers and importers to reclassify their substances from 1 December 2010.  All substances placed on the market on or after 1 December will be required to be notified to the European Chemicals Agency within one month.  I am informed that the European Chemicals Agency's feedback from industry predicts that the number of notifications could be two million or even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I indicated at the publication of the Bill last week that it is very important for our industry to meet the CLP notification deadline.  The European Chemicals Agency will maintain an inventory of all notified classifications and this inventory is one of the cornerstones of CLP.  As well as the potential health and environmental benefits of the inventory, there should also be business benefits through improved trade flows throughout the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">The Health and Safety Authority has a dedicated helpdesk to provide information and assistance to manufacturers and importers in meeting their obligations.  The second new EU regulation concerns the export and import of dangerous chemicals.  It replaces an EU regulation from 2003 and implements in the EU the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent.  The aims of that convention are: to promote shared responsibility and co-operative efforts in the international trade of certain hazardous chemicals; to contribute to the environmentally sound use of those hazardous chemicals by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics; and to provide for a national decision-making process on their import and export.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">The convention covers pesticides and industrial chemicals that have been banned or severely restricted for health or environmental reasons by Parties to the Convention.  In the context of the EU regulation, this means that dangerous chemicals and pesticides listed in the annexes of the EU regulation may only be exported with the prior consent of the importer in the importing country.  In addition to provisions relating to chemicals and pesticides listed in the annexes, the regulation contains provisions that apply to all chemicals when exported.  These provisions address, in particular, requirements on packaging and labelling as specified by EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I will now outline to the House the provisions of the Bill.  Section 1 is a standard section, and defines references to "Principal Act" as meaning the Chemicals Act 2008.  Section 2 contains technical amendments to definitions in Section 2 of the principal Act.  These changes reflect the new EU regulations being brought within the enforcement framework of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Section 3 clarifies the regulation making powers of the Minister in section 5 of the principal Act in relation to classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals, and permits the Minister to amend the Act by regulation for the purpose of giving effect to an EU act relating to chemicals.  This is an important amendment as it means that there will not be any unnecessary recourse to primary legislation for the purposes of implementing changes to the EU acts within the enforcement scope of the Chemicals Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">Section 4 amends section 8 of the principal Act by providing for the competent authorities for the purposes of the CLP regulation, namely, the Health and Safety Authority; the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, in respect of pesticides; and the Minister for Health and Children, in respect of appointing the bodies responsible for receiving information relating to emergency health response.  This allocation of responsibilities reflects the division of responsibilities under current legislation.  Section 5 amends section 9 of the principal Act to ensure that co-operation arrangements apply also to competent authorities for the CLP regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Co-operation between competent authorities is a very important feature of this legislation.  The IDA has highlighted the extent to which the pharmachem industry in general is regulated.  At the same time, Forfás identifies regulation as one of the key elements to the mix that should provide a supportive business environment in order for business to grow.  Indeed, the degree of regulatory compliance is one of the key measures in determining the competitiveness of an economy.  Putting in place such co-operation arrangements should contribute to a clear regulatory framework for business and should allow us to make optimum use of resources and to avoid unnecessary costs for both the competent authorities and industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Sections 6 and 7 amend sections 14 and 15 respectively of the principal Act.  This amendment seeks to rectify weaknesses in the provisions of the Act which deal with improvement notices.  This came to light as a result of a High Court ruling on similar provisions of the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005.  The Bill is making it clear that an improvement plan or revised improvement plan prepared by an operator and submitted to an inspector must be adequate in the view of the inspector and must be implemented by the operator.  It is important to rectify this if the section is to retain its usefulness and to avoid the need for competent authorities to use more stringent enforcement powers.  A similar amendment to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 is included in the technical amendments under section 12 of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">Section 8 amends section 16 of the principal Act to make it clear that the power to issue prohibition notices applies with regard to the enforcement of EU rules concerning major accident hazards involving dangerous substances.  Section 9 amends section 29 of the principal Act to create offences for breach of the CLP regulation and to allow the penalties under section 30 to apply.  Section 10 amends section 30 of the principal Act to increase the maximum custodial sentence on summary conviction from six months to 12 months, following the advice of the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">Section 11 has the effect of including within the enforcement framework of the Chemicals Act purely technical amendments to the four EU regulations within the scope of the Act as amended, namely, the REACH, CLP, detergents, and Rotterdam regulations.  This will keep the regulatory framework simple, avoid gaps in the legal basis for enforcement activities, and avoid unnecessary demands on the resources normally required in the preparation of regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">Section 12 makes technical amendments to the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, including the completion of the transposition of Directive 91/383/EEC, which supplements measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of workers with fixed-duration or temporary employment relationships, of 25 June 1991.  It also clarifies the Minister's obligations to carry out consultation when making certain regulations, clarifies the provisions on improvement plans and revised improvement plans, as I mentioned under sections 6 and 7, and increases the maximum penalties on conviction for summary offences from a fine of €3,000 and/or 6 months' imprisonment to a fine of €5,000 and/or 12 months imprisonment.  Section 13 is a standard section, providing for the Short Title of the Bill, collective citations and commencement.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The chemicals sector is a key economic sector for Ireland.  By its nature, this sector includes highly dangerous chemicals which have the potential to cause serious and widespread damage to human and environmental health, and it is vital that the regulatory framework is up to date.  The Chemicals (Amendment) Bill 2010 builds on the enforcement system of the Chemicals Act 2008, which aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business, aimed at ensuring high levels of compliance and increased co-operation between the various competent authorities involved in enforcement to optimise the use of State resources and, most importantly, alleviate any unnecessary administrative costs to business.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_669">In principle, I welcome the provisions of this Bill, which build on EU initiatives in this area.  Clearly, it is important for public health and safety that there be a robust regulatory system.  I understand the changes in the Bill are based on regulations pertaining to the same REACH provisions as those on which the principal Act were based, but it introduces obligations with regard to labelling and packaging.  This will provide extra protection and is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">What surprises me is that there is no regulatory impact statement accompanying this Bill.  I understood it was Government policy that such a regulatory impact statement would be introduced for any new regulation that imposed compliance costs on industry.  The parent initiative, the original REACH directive, placed substantial obligations on Irish industry with an estimated cost of €450 million.  It seems strange that the Minister of State would not advert to the cost to industry of this measure.  Just because a measure is worthy does not mean the House should not be informed of its regulatory impact.  We would not advocate the withdrawal of this Bill, but we have learned from experience that Ireland, in its desire to be a good European citizen, introduces legislation in a way that is quite inflexible and imposes unnecessary costs on industries that must comply.  At this time, when small and large businesses alike are struggling under the pressure of the recession to retain employment, we should be hearing assurances from the Government that the compliance cost and the effect of the implementation of the directive have been minimised.  However, it seems the Government is not in this instance complying with its own principle of providing regulatory impact statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The Minister of State indicated that the implementation of the provisions would involve no cost to the Exchequer.  If there are additional responsibilities involved, a zero cost estimate seems surprising to say the least.  However, we must take it at face value that something else will make room for it, or that it will be done in co-ordination with other work.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">The Minister of State rightly adverted to the need for co-operation across agencies to avoid the creation of significant compliance costs, and drew the attention of the House to a section 5 amendment that encourages such co-operation.  However, as I read that section I see that this is not a new initiative but is very much the existing approach.  We should go back and read the advice that has come to us from the National Competitiveness Council, a sister organisation of Forfás, to whose work the Minister of State referred glowingly.  The Forfás report Driving Export Growth: Statement on Sectoral Competitiveness states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_673">There is a perception that the implementation in Ireland of EU legislation such as the REACH Directive goes beyond the standard requirements and places Irish based firms at a disadvantage.  There is also a concern that Irish regulatory authorities may not always give sufficient recognition to the competitiveness implications of the legislation they develop and enforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">It goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_675">Identifying best practice in the application of EU legislation (e.g. the REACH directive) by other member states will help ensure that the implementation of EU legislation in Ireland does not present a competitive disadvantage to Irish firms.  The NCC recommends that relevant Government departments, agencies and sector representative groups monitor the application of EU legislation elsewhere to ensure that the Irish interpretation and implementation, while meeting the required standard, does not place an unnecessary or excessive burden on the Irish chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">The Minister of State did not mention in his speech the extent to which that recommendation is being acted upon, yet we have come to the House to propose additional burdens under this legislation, worthy though they may be.  We have not heard any assertion from the Minister that this is the least costly approach or that other EU countries are not doing it in a different way.  These are important principles at this time.  The document to which I referred is an important one which identifies bottlenecks in Ireland that might prevent the development of key sectors, one of which, as the Minister knows, is the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">I read in the <i>Financial Times</i>, apropos of the transposition of the REACH directive in the UK, that the Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, Vince Cable, in a letter to senior officials at the European Commission, has called for the phasing in of some aspects of the new rules to be postponed to avoid disruptive knock-on effects on large sections of industry.  The Minister of State might comment in his response on whether we are being over-diligent European citizens, applying rules that some of our competitors and colleagues are taking the opportunity to drag their feet on.  Some of these regulations have long transposition times, while others have shorter times.  The Minister needs to be alerted to these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">The report from Forfás that I mentioned earlier expresses concern that regulation could hamper development in the pharmaceutical and medical devices sector.  It is very critical of the obstacles placed in the way of research and development in these sectors in Ireland, by virtue of the very complicated system for operating clinical trials.  It points out that significant delays are being experienced by companies in establishing clinical trials in Ireland for medical technology and pharmaceutical products.  It states that the delays primarily arise from the need to obtain ethics approval from each participating centre in multi-centre clinical investigations and sequential review processes, whereby Irish Medicines Board approval can only be sought after approval is obtained from the relevant ethics, rather than in parallel.  It states that this is a significant development opportunity where an Irish based plant can capture the development and pilot stage of new devices if we are in a strong position to apply the clinical trials and develop them.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Here we have recommendations to the Minister of State's Department about how we need to streamline processes and open up opportunities.  While the Department pays lip service to the need to remove regulatory obstacles, and set a target three years ago valued at €500 million, it can only report progress on 4% of this target.  The Department has to get its finger out.  Is it serious about unnecessary regulatory burdens?  Forfás has given us specific examples where this has held back opportunities.  Deputy Penrose had an interesting presentation at his committee from some of those medical device companies, who spoke about this sort of problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">This is probably a fairly pedestrian Bill, but we really have to wake up and smell the coffee.  The reality is that we cannot rely on these sectors.  They are in a very competitive environment and we have to make sure that we anticipate the pressures that will be put on.  When bodies that study these sectors for opportunities and players in the sector tell us that we need to move on these things, we need to sound a red alert to those agencies involved.  The Minister of State's Department has volunteered to champion the cause of reducing unnecessary burdens, but it is not producing the goods.  There are many things the Department cannot influence, such as the state of economic growth, the state of external markets and so on.  However, what I have outlined above are things that we can influence and the Minister of State has set out that he is determined to do so, but is not delivering.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The annual output statement would be one of those areas where the Minister of State might be looking for progress on last year.  However, compliance burdens got no reference whatsoever in the statement.  It was not even mentioned that the Government had made this commitment.  What are we to make of a Department that claims in front of industry leaders that it will deliver on this big issue, but when setting its own internal targets, is entirely silent?  It is a Department that has lost touch with what exactly are the pressures on business at the moment.  The Minister of State and his Department have to regain that touch because we are in such dire straits that we have to sweat every asset in this time of crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">While I welcome this Bill, the Minister of State could be doing much more work to remove bottlenecks that hold back sectors in Ireland that other countries would give their proverbial right arm to have, such as the pharmaceutical and medical devices sectors.  They are strong clusters.  They provide great opportunities.  They have difficulties in seeing the flow of new products coming forward for different reasons, and we need to position ourselves to make that an easier process.  I ask the Minister of State to have a look at those issues that I have raised and see how his Department can become more engaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The new strategy statement to recognise new ministerial appointments was due in the middle of September, but I gather it has been held back to be checked out by other Departments, which may or may not be reasonable.  I would like to see some hard statements saying that in the first year, the Government will be delivering €150 million of that €500 million in compliance cost reductions.  The same is true for other areas where the Minister of State has taken responsibility upon himself to implement the competitiveness reform agenda.  We need to see timelines and dates and people being made responsible for their performance against those targets.  The public are sick of hearing that bonuses are being dished out even when targets are not being hit.  We need to bring back those bonus payments, impose the cuts in pay that those senior officials should have taken, and let them go and earn their bonus payments by delivering on this agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#WilliamPenrose" eId="spk_528">
          <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_684">I welcome the opportunity to contribute on behalf of the Labour Party on this Bill.  We are broadly supportive of the regulatory framework that has been incorporated into this Bill on foot EU regulations.  I was one of the first spokespersons for agriculture to make some of the points that were just made by Deputy Bruton.  I remember somebody saying that I was a eurosceptic at the time.  I was not a bit of a eurosceptic, but I realised that the more impositions and unnecessary burdens imposed on a business, the better chance there is that the business will go to the wall.  It is important that we examine every regulation and Bill that is brought forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Minister of State pointed out how important this is for human health, the environment and so on.  When they are used properly, chemicals such as pesticides can be very positive, but they also can have deleterious consequences if they are not used properly or if contamination arises as a result of their utilisation.  Therefore, I certainly understand the Minister of State's point.  However, the regulatory assessment regime in this country needs greater fuelling and needs somebody to drive it in order to ensure that various hurdles that are placed in the way of businesses by the legislative framework can be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">I heard the Minister of State speaking of the standard modelling cost system and he seemed to have a particular interest in it from his days with Chambers Ireland.  I wonder where would this Bill fit within that context, and I certainly concur with some of the points made by Deputy Bruton in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">There is a feeling of <i>déjà vu</i>, because only two years ago we spent quite an amount of our valuable time and energy enacting the Chemicals Act 2008, which had to be implemented as a matter of urgency to comply with pressing timelines.  This Bill has again been brought forward to amend that Act and primarily to meet the EU obligations and provide for the enforcement of two new directly applicable EU regulations.  This is part of the problem with chemical regulations, the main regulation being the classification, labelling and packaging of chemicals.  This is important in the context of the EU Reach chemical regulations, which was arduous legislative work and taxed our understanding, appreciation and absorption of complex law and legal principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">The directly applicable aspect of this legislation means that we do not get much choice, and I do not think we can make many amendments.  We are left with the baby and we have to nurse it.  We have no input other than the timeline, and rights arise from it.  The Government might be afraid of the EU when a registration process is to be put in place and we might be left behind in that context.  The Bill is necessary given that the EU's deadlines for the implementation of the two regulations have passed, although I know there is an extension to 2015 for part of it, so time is of the essence.  The Labour Party will co-operate in getting the Bill passed into law to stave off any difficulties that might arise.  However, one must take cognisance of the points Deputy Bruton mentioned that we cannot take everything as handed down.  We must put it through the rigour of evaluation and assessment of the impact it would have on pharmaceutical and chemical businesses, which are important.  He referred to the medical device area.  Members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Innovation were flabbergasted to hear that companies in the medical device sector cannot even get cohesive Government action across the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and the Department of Health and Children.  We submitted a motion in that regard to both Departments to try to get a degree of cohesion to the approach in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">In effect the Bill puts in place a series of largely technical amendments to the 2008 Act and amends in relatively minor ways the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005, particularly regarding improving notices which arose as a result of a High Court case.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">We are all aware that the development, production and trade of chemicals represent a very significant industry giving rise to approximately 9% of our international trade.  Approximately 30,000 people are employed in Ireland in the chemical and pharmaceutical sector.  Revenues from the chemical sector approximate to 10% of GDP in 2009, which indicates it is a significant area.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">We are all aware of the significant benefits that derive from chemical applications once they are properly utilised — the use of chemicals is important in the context of helping to reduce the spread of malaria and other diseases.  In the agriculture area herbicides have been important in helping to secure significant increases in crop yields.  Chemicals having been fully tested against the impacts of toxicity when used properly and not overused have a very beneficial effect.  However, there are cogent reasons to regulate the use of chemicals owing to the potential harm to human health and the environment.  In that regard strict regulation is important to minimise the risks to human and plant life, and the environment in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">The 2008 Act deals with the impact of dangerous chemicals.  The detergents regulations imposed a two-tier testing regime on the biodegradability of the active ingredients of detergents, which achieved harmonisation of rules of the biodegradability of surfactants in detergents leading to the necessity for precise and additional labelling of detergents.  This was substantial legislation and without the help of staff in the library and research section we would not have been able to get stuck into it at all.  The major regulation was EC 1907/2006, the regulation on registration, evaluation, authorisation and restriction of chemicals, REACH, which aimed to improve the protection of human health and environment through better and earlier identification of the intrinsic properties of chemical substances.  A major criticism of the REACH regulation was the fear of the imposition of the unnecessary costs of compliance on businesses, particularly in the storage and transportation of chemicals, a point made by Deputy Bruton and the National Competitiveness Council.  In his speech the Minister of State referred to the role for Forfás.  The National Competitiveness Council made a number of observations in this regard and we should not dismiss them lightly.  The Minister of State needs to balance this with the enhanced safety that has arisen as a result of the significant reduction in exposure to chemicals and the positive impact it will have on everybody's health in the longer term.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">One could ask whether there has been a significant level of compliance with the registration process.  The Minister of State stated that under the provisions of section 3 the Minister can amend the Act by regulation and therefore can act speedily to ensure any urgent EU regulation relating to chemicals is incorporated into the corpus of domestic law, which is a useful tool.  However, I would like to see that all regulations of that nature would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas in due course.  I have an abhorrence of laws being implemented by regulation.  It not as though I want to have to read Bills such as this which can be difficult for everybody concerned, but I have a deep distaste of anything introduced by way of regulation.  I remember all sorts of things were promised to be done after the introduction of the Diseases of Animals (Amendment) Act 2001, but they became embedded and were never revisited after having been laid before the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I note the HSA is engaged in a monitoring process.  Given the imposition of additional regulatory burdens, it is important to have a helpdesk to provide information and assistance to manufacturers and importers in meeting their obligations.  People should see this as an opportunity to be constructive and helpful rather than seeing it as just another burden to be placed upon the companies involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The Health and Safety Authority plays the lead role, along with other competent authorities, such as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the EPA, the Minister for Health and Children and the Revenue Commissioners, in making proposals on initiatives.  It also carries out inspections and acts as a supervisory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The essence of the CLP regulation is that substances and mixtures will need to be appropriately classified labelled and packaged before being made available on the market.  It will be effective from December 2010 for substances and from June 2015 for mixtures.  It is largely a technical Bill in so far as it incorporates amendments made to regulations and it amends the 2008 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The division of responsibilities of the various competent authorities — the HSA, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister for Health and Children — are clearly set out.  I wonder whether the 2008 Act was drawn so widely that there was an overlapping of responsibilities.  I always interpreted the HSA as having a lead role in the 2008 Act.  Great care seems to have been taken to ensure the division of responsibilities are more explicitly laid out in this legislation, but I could be wrong in my interpretation.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">National authorities will be required to co-operate together under the enhanced co-operation provisions.  While that always applied, it now seems to have become almost mandatory to have the exchange of information and advice, and the carrying out of joint inspections, checks, examinations and investigations.  The Bill allows the HSA to enter into co-operation arrangements with its equivalents in other member states, which I hope will lead to a more seamless transition to what is acceptable in all states.  If something originates here it will be possible to determine the degree of acceptability it will achieve in another market.  I hope that enhanced co-operation and information exchange will be available and useful to all the companies involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Section 14 of the 2008 Act required that where an inspector had formed an opinion that an activity was being carried out involving a risk to human health or the environment, he or she could require or direct that an improvement plan be submitted in respect of the particular activity, in other words a process or plan for remedial action to be taken.  Section 6 of the Bill amends section 14 of the 2008 Act by providing for a new procedure to be followed by the HSA inspector upon receipt of an improvement plan, which streamlines the process involved in the implementation of the improvement plan.  The Minister of State clarified that this amendment arose following a High Court case in a related area.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Section 7 provides for a simpler formulation of the contravention notice which was issued under section 15 of the Act.  Offences and penalties seem to be a significant part of all the Bills that come before the House and significant changes have been made in the Bill in respect of array of offences and penalties provided.  The maximum term of imprisonment has been increased from six months to 12 months.  I understand the Attorney General advised that change, although I do not know why it has been made.  The fines that will apply have been revised.  Furthermore, a list of individuals is specified in terms of the commitment of offences under the CLP regulation in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">This legislation is subject to the various caveats I outlined on behalf of the Labour Party.  We must recognise that the protection of human health and the environment are the main objectives of the Rotterdam regulation, the detergents regulation and the REACH regulation, which were before us two years ago.  The CLP regulation is now coming into force.  It carries a corpus of additional obligations in regard to compliance, classification, labelling and packaging of substances and mixtures.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">This regulation in terms of this Bill is directly applicable but there must have been some incongruence between that 2008 Act and the regulation, otherwise, we would not have had to revisit this legislation.  Am I correct about that?  Could the Minister of State have adopted the regulation by the simple process he will use under section 3 of the Bill?  Is that how such matters will be dealt with from now on, rather than by revisiting the relevant legislation and introducing an amending Bill?  We have to amend the principal Act, the 2008 Act, to ensure that what was brought in under the CLP regulation can now be incorporated.  Is that the position?</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Once chemical hazards are identified, the onus will be placed on the various people within the supply chain to ensure that information about the risk is disseminated or communicated with a view to reducing the risk to the environment and, principally, to human health.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Health and Safety Authority will have a significant role in ensuring that we comply with the CLP regulation.  Will the Minister of State indicate if adequate staff are available to ensure that level of compliance, or is this part of the Croke Park agreement such that another item of legislation will require significant attention in the context of the CLP regulation and the other regulations to ensure that all the various regulatory responsibilities that will be imposed on us will be carried out?  On the passing of this Act, I understand that the European Union must be notified as to what steps are being taken in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">We broadly welcome the legislation and we may table amendments to it.  I understand that it must be dealt with by the end of November and I assume it will be considered by our committee.  It is purely a technical Bill.  Given that it is directly applicable and that it amends an Act to ensure that directly applicable provisions are encompassed in the corpus of the principal legislation, there is not a great deal we can say or do in that context, other than to send out a signal that we should not simply accept measures <i>carte blanche</i>.  In terms of measures we have adopted in the agricultural sector — I note that Deputy Johnny Brady is in the Chair — other countries have not been as easily fobbed off as we have been in Ireland.  Other countries put down markers and they interpret legislation in the way that is best fitted to their particular circumstances, as opposed to us who seem to be — as I said here one day as a result of which various accusations were made against me — too good as Europeans.  We are almost lapdog-like in our attitude to any measure that comes from Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">Under the recent referendum, I thought a critical change was that we would all have a chance to have an input into much of this legislation and ensure that some of the worst excesses, which some bureaucrats seems eager to impose, would be at least addressed in a positive fashion from the perspective of Ireland before they get on to the EU Statute Book.  That might be one of the good measures that will be helpful in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I understand where the Minister of State is coming from in terms of this Bill and we will try to facilitate its passage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" eId="spk_529">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_708">I am delighted to have this opportunity to say a few words on the Bill and on the industry and sector in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">In 2011 the International Year of Chemistry will be celebrated but because of the chemical industry's diversity and the fact that most of its products are not sold directly to the ordinary consumer, the importance of the chemical industry is frequently not widely appreciated.  The chemical sector in Ireland directly employs approximately 25,000 people and is one of the major sectors in the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Unemployment, especially among honours chemistry graduates, is currently virtually unknown, even in these times.  Within the industry chemists are employed in production, research and development, quality control, environmental monitoring and chemical analysis.  However, with their strong technical background, chemists frequently move into other areas, for example, food and drink manufacturing and power stations as well as electronics and material science industries.  Despite the economic recession and the loss of traditional industries, chemistry and the chemical industry remain vigorous and dynamic areas of growth, especially in the Cork area.  The skills involved will always remain essential.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The following are some of the companies that employ graduates and manufacture a wide range of chemical and pharmaceutical intermediates in the east Cork area.  They are Alkem Chemicals, Biocel Limited, Cara Partners, Cascade Biochem, Henkel, Irish Refining Company in Whitegate, Irotec Laboratories, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, all of which are located in Little Island, Millipore and GE Healthcare in Corrigtwohill, PepsiCo in Little Island, Pfizer, which is located both in Little Island and Ringaskiddy, Novartis in Ringaskiddy and other chemical and pharmaceutical businesses, especially around the Cork Harbour area.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Ireland remains one of the leading global locations for the manufacture and development of pharmaceutical and chemical products and the sector is and will remain an excellent employer.  As it starts to move up the value chain, the demand for graduates of chemistry and life sciences is likely to increase.  In recent years, even in these times, there has been major capital investment by many companies in this sector and of great significance is the fact that most of these investments are in biotech and research and development at the cutting edge of the sector.  This bodes well for the long-term future of the industry in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">Currently, even in these times, it is well to remember that eight of the top ten companies — eight of the top world leaders —  have operations in Ireland.  Companies have spent significant capital investment during 2009.  Ten of the top selling drugs are manufactured in Irish sites.  The sector's exported products in 2009 up to a value of €44 billion, which represents 51% of the national total.  It is also important to note that Ireland is the largest net exporter of medicines in the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The Irish pharmaceutical chemical industry directly employs approximately 25,000 people and upwards of 25,000 people are employed in the provision of services to the sector — more than half of these employees are third level graduates.  This emphasises the importance of this sector to our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The Irish pharmaceutical and chemical industry remains a strong contributor to the economy and it is continuing to growth.  The sector has flourished because of deep-seated economic strengths, an innovative and resourceful young workforce, a proven level of manufacturing and compliance experience and an inherent ability to comply with tough and demanding international regulations and competitive corporation tax rates.  We have high education standards which have underpinned this performance.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Chemicals have proved to be of benefit to humans in many ways.  A substantial use of chemicals is essential to meet the social and economic goals of the world community.  Today's best practice demonstrates chemicals can be used in a cost-effective manner and with a high degree of safety.  Positive examples include the use of pesticides to reduce the spread of malaria and other diseases and the development of herbicides as a part of the 20th century's green revolution which led to massive increases in crop yield and food production.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">However, many chemicals can be harmful to human health and to the environment.  Several international agreements aim to control these associated risks.  One goal of the world summit on sustainable development, held in Johannesburg 2002, was that by 2020 chemicals will be used and produced in ways that lead to the minimisation of significant adverse effects to human health and development.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Bill's main purpose is to meet certain EU obligations and implement and enforce certain EU regulations in this area.  These will protect human health and the environment by determining which properties of substances and mixtures will lead to classification as hazardous, by correctly identifying hazards and communicating them.  To protect and ensure continued growth in this vital sector which employs over 50,000 people and contributes to 50% of exports, it is essential the regulatory framework is up to date.  This Bill builds on the enforcement system of the Chemicals Act 2008.  It aims to provide a clear regulatory framework for business and ensure high levels of compliance and increased co-operation between the various competent authorities while optimising the use of State resources and alleviating any unnecessary administrative costs to business.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_720">While this is a technical Bill, there are some issues with sections 3 and 4 which I wish to raise.  Will the Minister of State clarify if section 3 will require further amendments to this area to be introduced through regulation and directive rather than through primary legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Deputy Penrose already referred to the provisions in section 4 and the level of resources required for the Health and Safety Authority, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Health Service Executive to implement the legislation.  Have resources been set aside already?  What will be the cost of implementing the legislation?</p>
          <p eId="para_722">This legislation seems to be rushed in nature because the Government is required to introduce the regulations before the end of November.  Accordingly, the implementation of the directives in question may become draconian.  In a report on driving export growth, Forfás stated "the manner in which the regulation evaluation authorisation and restriction of chemical substances, REACH, directive is applied in Ireland will have direct implications on the competitiveness of Ireland as a location for the chemicals sector".  On the other hand, the Minister of State claimed in his speech "the degree of regulatory compliance is one of the key measures in determining the competitiveness of an economy".</p>
          <p eId="para_723">The Forfás report also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_724">There is a perception that the implementation in Ireland of EU legislation such as the REACH directive goes beyond the standard requirements and places Irish based firms at a disadvantage.  There is also a concern that Irish regulatory authorities may not always give sufficient recognition to the competitiveness implications of the legislation they develop and enforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Regulation is needed in this area but, at the same time, we cannot forget the chemicals sector accounts for 50% of goods exports.  It is concentrated in two sectors, namely organic chemicals and medical and pharmaceutical products which together account for 80% of chemicals exports.  A balance must be struck between being competitive and compliant with regulations.  We must monitor how our neighbours implement these regulations too, a task on which the Government often falls down.  For example, in the case of NAMA, why did the Government not monitor how larger EU member states resolved their banking problems?  Germany hived off the toxic assets from its banks into separate companies with a 10% to 20% discount.  The Government went off——</p>

          <from>Deputy Kieran O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_727">It is relevant to regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The Forfás report on driving export growth stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_729">Identifying best practice in the application of EU legislation, for example, the REACH directive, by other member states will help ensure that the implementation of EU legislation in Ireland does not present a competitive disadvantage to Irish firms.  The National Competitiveness Council recommends that relevant Government Departments, agencies and sector representative groups monitor the application of EU legislation elsewhere to ensure that the Irish interpretation and implementation, while meeting the required standard, does not place an unnecessary or excessive burden on the Irish chemicals and pharmaceuticals sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">In his speech the Minister of State pointed out:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_731">The first notable change will be the requirement on manufacturers and importers to reclassify their substances from 1 December 2010.  All substances placed on the market on or after 1 December will be required to be notified to the European Chemicals Agency within one month.  I am informed that the European Chemicals Agency's feedback from industry predicts that the number of notifications could be two million or even more.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">How much will these new regulations cost the Irish chemical industry and those bodies responsible for their implementation, such as the Health and Strategy Authority and the Health Service Executive?  There seems to be no regulatory impact assessment with this legislation.  Will the Minister of State give a commitment that one will be carried out?</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The problem is that it is very hard for Members of the House to have a proper debate when we do not know what the impact of the legislation transposing this directive will have.  There is a strong need for regulatory impact assessments to become standard in terms of how the Government does its work.  I am anxious to hear the Minister's views in that regard.  In future, if the Government is transposing directives, it should introduce them in adequate time for regulatory impact assessments to be carried out.  These should be provided to Opposition Members so we can have a constructive debate at an early stage on the impact a directive will have on an industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">Over half of our goods exports are produced by an industry that will be directly affected by this Bill.  Here we are, however, with a lack of information to have a proper debate on the issue.  Industry in Ireland is experiencing difficulties in the current environment, yet we are now imposing a further regulatory burden on it by 1 December, with no quantifiable indication of how much it will cost, how this directive has been implemented in other EU jurisdictions so we can assess the pitfalls, the level at which it has been implemented or what has become the norm.  When it was decided to bring this legislation before the House, did the Department carry out a review of its implementation in other EU jurisdictions in terms of the cost to industry?  In this country there are three regulatory bodies involved, the HSA, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health and Children.  Is that the case in other EU jurisdictions or does just one body carry out the regulation, which cuts down on the cost of regulation and makes it more efficient?</p>
          <p eId="para_735">Such information would ensure we could have a proper and detailed debate on something that is technical in nature but that will ultimately cost an industry which is providing an enormous number of jobs to Irish people, many in the multinational sector.  It is imperative that we retain those jobs.  I hope the Minister will address this.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
          <p eId="para_736">I thank the Deputies for their contributions.  This Bill does not impose any additional obligations on industry.  The regulatory impact assessment which was prepared for the 2008 Act included the CLP regulation, which was a draft EU regulation at that stage.  It was not adopted in time for full inclusion in the Act but we included the provisions and obligations of the CLP in the regulatory impact assessment at that time.  The regulatory impact assessment clearly showed that the regulatory framework under the Chemicals Act was the most cost effective available to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The rules we are applying apply to all operators in every member state of the EU.  I am holding a copy of the official journal of what we are trying to implement in this legislation.  It contains all the rules, regulations, appendices and everything that goes with this legislation.  It is similar in size to the telephone directory we had fadó fadó of all telephone numbers outside Dublin.  This is what we are trying to implement, and we are trying to do so in a way that minimises the burden on industry, as we did in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">There is no need for extra resources for the HSA or the EPA as a result of this.  Under the 2008 legislation, 38 inspectors were assigned to the HSA to deal with this.  It is interesting to reflect on the general approach of the HSA.  It is generally not enforcement but encouragement, specifically with regard to this legislation and compliance with the 2008 Act.  In 2008, the HSA conducted 1,480 inspections under the Act and to date this year it has conducted 1,104.  With regard to the items inspected, on the first visit compliance with the various regulations under the 2008 Act ranged from 36% to 48%.  However, following advice and encouragement from the HSA, compliance on second visits was reported in all but 1% of those who received such advice.  The HSA approach is to be helpful and to try to encourage rather than to enforce.  That is the approach it adopts across all of its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">I noted the concerns about medical devices and the chemical industry generally.  We all support the role of the medical device and chemical industries so I will follow up on the concerns.  It is important to note, however, that the difficulties Deputy Penrose has encountered have not necessarily stopped the expansion of the medical device or chemical industries.  Indeed, there was a very good announcement in my home town yesterday of 250 extra jobs as a result of a product designed in Ballina——</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_741">——regardless of whatever impediments the Deputy suggests were put in place.  However, I will convey his remarks to the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">With regard to Deputy Bruton's worry about compliance in the Department, we are absolutely committed to reducing the regulatory burden on business by 25% by 2012.  It is difficult in many areas to strike a balance — one is dealing with people's lives and daily working conditions — but it is something we are committed to doing.  We will be bringing forward the strategy statement.  I agree with the Deputy on streamlining procedures and processes.  The pharmaceutical industry's clinical trials and obligations are requirements of the Irish Medicines Board and the European medicines agencies.  They are specifically excluded from this legislation but I will convey the Deputy's remarks on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">As regards research in the chemical sector, the REACH regulation recognises that research should not be hampered by the rules applicable to chemicals that are already on the market.  There is a provision in Article 9 of the REACH legislation for exemption from the general obligation to register for product and process orientated research and development.  That is aimed to stimulate research and development, particularly in the chemical industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Deputies Penrose and O'Donnell expressed concerns about regulations instead of primary legislation.  Any proposed regulations will be placed before the House.  I agree there is a necessity to bring more power back to this House.  The Office of the Attorney General has drafted the specific provision in such a way as to respect the policy and principles that apply to this legislation particularly.  Any regulations that are changed will be brought before the House and will be subject to consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Deputy O'Donnell made a point about competent authorities.  The reason we specifically mentioned the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and Children and the HSA is that they are the agencies with specific remits and expertise to carry out any additional work.  That reflects the reality of cross-cutting policies.  There are a number of Departments with responsibility in this regard.  We have, however, given the HSA the responsibility of being the lead agency and it is has engaged in a detailed process of engagement across a large number of sectors since the implementation of the 2008 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Deputy Penrose referred to the 2008 Act.  It might be useful to inform the House on the current position since the implementation of that Act.  The HSA has recruited 33 staff with a range of very scarce technical expertise, including some of the skills mentioned by Deputy Michael Ahern.  That team has been involved in helping Irish industry to meet the demands of the new framework as well as setting up the inspection and monitoring regime that is required by the framework.  The chemicals operation has won widespread respect from industry for the manner in which it has implemented these regulations and co-operated with industry.  Since 2008, over 97,000 substances have been pre-registered for REACH by over 3,200 legal entities.  That is actually only 240 companies, so the impact is not as wide as people might suggest.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">Chemical related activity of the HSA in 2009 included 1,513 inspections, 1,198 of which specifically related to REACH, and 472 inspections of all major accident hazard sites covered by the Seveso regulations and other high risk work places storing and using large quantities of dangerous chemicals.  Our EU obligations require the HSA to inspect all major accident sites and all its targets have been achieved.  It has also signed a memorandum of understanding with other agencies in regard to this area and it has a dedicated REACH help desk, which answered 470 detailed queries throughout 2009.  The authority presented at industry and general business conferences and hosted two seminars for people working in this area.  The HSA has also participated in and given feedback to all the export committees of the European Chemicals Agency, which is a heavy workload given the documentation required, and has involved itself in UN and OECD activity regarding EU legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">In 2010 the REACH-CLP inspection campaign focused on the availability of chemical inventories in the workplace or the existence of some form of chemical amalgam system for chemicals stored and used in workplaces for compliance with the pre-registration of registration of chemical substances under REACH and the preparedness for the first registration deadline of 30 November 2110 as well as the availability of safety data sheets and preparedness for the classification and labelling notification deadline under the CLP regulation of 3 January 2011.  That is a brief outline of the detailed work and engagement of the HSA with the industry regarding this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">I thank Members for their remarks.  Committee Stage will be taken during the second week of November.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Perry</from>
          <p eId="para_771">I welcome the Minister.  The motion is simple and to the point, namely, to introduce a loan guarantee scheme for business.  Small businesses up and down the country need help.  The motion forms part of the Fine Gael plan to help small businesses survive the current economic crisis.  Fine Gael is giving Government Deputies one last chance to provide an essential credit lifeline to struggling small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Small and medium enterprises, SMEs, are the backbone of the Irish economy.  A total of 80,000 small firms employ 800,000 people in every city, town and village.  They add billions to the national economy.  They are largely absent from Government thinking and policy.  In round figures the SME sector contributes approximately €500 million in corporation tax, more than €500 million in PRSI, approximately €3 billion in income tax and €4 billion in gross VAT.  By any standard the SME sector is important to the national economy.  The Government does not consider the consequences when it increases charges and adds duplicated red tape.  Mishandling of the economy has destroyed consumer confidence and hit SMEs the hardest.  Fine Gael is committed to assisting this important sector as the national economic recovery will not happen without a healthy and thriving domestic SME base.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Ireland's recession has been longer and deeper than that of any other European country.  Far from turning a corner, as was claimed at the previous budget, 2010 has been the toughest year yet for Irish business.  The challenges facing small business are enormous.  Business has declined by between 20% and 40% in turnover.  Insolvencies are at a record level.  Most enterprises going out of business are typically small businesses, such as micro-businesses that employ one to ten people and small businesses that employ between ten and 49 people.  Local jobs have been lost throughout the country.  Small businesses have done what they can to survive, so far without any Government assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">A loan guarantee scheme is a proven approach to help viable companies get access to credit finance.  I have no doubt the Minister will refer to bank recapitalisation and the fact that we will be giving the Bank of Ireland and AIB €3 billion each in the next two years.  Unfortunately, that money is not getting through to businesses.  Promises of a "wall of cash" were made by the Minister for Finance in September 2009 when trying to sell the NAMA proposal, but it is clear that all Government promises have come to nought.  The Government still claims that the existing strategy of NAMA and bank recapitalisation will get credit moving but the real experience of SMEs proves that this has not happened.  Viable companies are going under on a daily basis.  Approximately 1,132 businesses have closed their doors permanently between January and the end of September, compared to 1,003 during the same period last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">Recent research from ISME revealed that 42% of companies which applied for funding in the past three months were refused credit.  ISME also reported that 83% of firms said banks are making it more difficult for SMEs to access finance.  I accept that some may have had unworkable business plans, but it is clear that many small viable businesses are being forced to close due to conditions outside of their control.  The small business sector can do its part to bring the country out of the present crisis through the creation of jobs at local level.  Traditional local small businesses, whether manufacturing, tourism, retail, wholesale or construction have the potential to create new jobs.  Many of those businesses are being held back because of a lack of Government support.  They must get as much attention as the smart economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">In the September 2010 Forfás report, access to finance is identified as one of the single biggest challenges currently facing SMEs.  Access to finance and the cost of finance are the most significant issues facing SMEs today.  It is a constraint as small businesses attempt to weather the recession and to survive.  It hinders them as they prepare for the upturn and invest in management development, productivity improvements and-or innovation.  Many small businesses can demonstrate commercial viability yet fail to obtain loans.  Even Forfás recommended a loan guarantee scheme because of issues relating to risk management.  SMEs find it more difficult than large enterprises to secure working capital loans from financial institutions.  There is substantial factual evidence that the representative associations for small business have identified a real and serious need for a credit guarantee system.  State agencies such as Forfás have made the same case.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">If this Fianna Fáil Government will not listen to the case being made by those bodies, perhaps it will look to international experience.  The main finding of a review of SME credit guarantee systems done for the Canadian Government was that other jurisdictions have adapted basic features of their small business support programs to align them with the changing financial institution practices, SME financing needs and available technology.  The international experience is very clear.  Small businesses in other countries are being aggressively supported by the use of credit support and loan guarantees as well as export promotion and export insurance supports.  Experience from other countries such as Chile and Taiwan is clear and decisive.  Other governments have acted in the interest of preserving jobs in small businesses.  Based on international experience, a targeted SME credit initiative can facilitate access to credit for SMEs.  Such an initiative is not a substitute for commercial bank lending nor does it facilitate credit for unviable companies.  It would place Irish firms on a more level footing with international competitors, which is not the case currently.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The OECD attributes three main factors to the success of the Chilean system, namely, a strong regulatory and supervisory system, which is now the case in this country.  It is something we are only starting to get right.  Transparency and fairness are important.  For example, the guarantees are allocated to institutions through a sealed bid auction.  An intensive publicity and promotional campaign was considered necessary to explain the scheme.  Training programmes were provided to commercial banks to inform them about the scheme and its policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Last week the Taoiseach performed a U-turn by announcing that the Government has abandoned plans for a credit scheme.  In the process he broke the promise made by the Tánaiste, Deputy Coughlan, when she was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  He also went against numerous commitments made by her successor, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.  That was a terrible shock for thousands of Irish businesses which have been starved of credit and are barely surviving.  Later there was an indication from Government that it is considering a loan guarantee system for a tiny number of specialist areas where it may not be possible for the businesses concerned to obtain a bank loan and that the State would step in.  It is intended that such a system would apply to only 2% to 4% of loans.  There is merit in this approach in that the special preferential guarantee terms may be applied to start-up and innovative companies in the emerging industry areas such as green energy, biotechnology, tourism, health care, agrifood and the creative sectors.  However, to limit the proposed scheme to a small remit is completely inadequate.  Most international schemes allow the guarantee funds to be used for any reasonable business purpose, including working capital.  A major focus for international schemes is the protection and retention of existing businesses, which is a real problem.  Financial institutions should continue to take all available collateral consistent with their normal practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">With a broader business focus to the proposed loan guarantee programme, restrictions on the use of funds would be necessary.  I would not wish to see guarantee funds being used for share purchases, owner payouts, and debt refinancing.  Some features of the proposed credit guarantee system include that it would be short term, one round would cover the next three years.  The amount of guarantee must be considered.  For example, €50 million would lever up to €500 million worth of loans.  A multiplier of ten is the experience elsewhere.  Risk sharing should be considered.  The code of conduct for business lending to SMEs issued by the Financial Regulator under section 117 of the Central Bank Act 1989 and published in February 2009 should be amended to specify the processes banks are required to adopt in facilitating access to the guarantee system, including the Credit Review Office.  The Minister should consider the issue of access to cash.</p>

          <p eId="para_781">I am pleased to speak to this motion.  It is well thought out and focuses on small businesses which are the backbone of the economy.  There must be an effort to provide guaranteed funding to them, an idea that has been lacking in all the announcements made by the Government.  I noticed the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation said at the annual Small Firms Association dinner on 16 September that departmental officials were working on such a loan guarantee scheme and that detailed discussions were under way.  However, the Government's amendment to the motion does not refer to it.  I look forward to hearing the Minister's contribution on that.  This is a significant scheme, with its operation clearly detailed, and I commend Deputy Perry for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Foreign direct investment is a significant source of employment but it will not continue at the same rate.  If we look at Ireland's share of the investment by foreign-owned companies in the eurozone, it has fallen from 13% in 2001 to 6% in 2007.  Belgium, Finland, Italy and Spain have all increased investment, according to IMF figures for last year.  There will naturally be an ebb and flow of creation and reduction in the jobs market but if we examine the figures, the number of jobs attracted here by the IDA is falling.  The focus must be on our indigenous companies, small and medium enterprises.  We must create an establishment where such businesses can be established and developed.  Export-led and export-oriented companies must be the target and must be supported.  We all campaigned for the Lisbon treaty on two occasions and the argument was that we were buying into a market of 500 million people across Europe.  We must support companies that can identify products and services they can sell to that market.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Forfás recently published the report "Making It Happen" that outlined a range of approaches that must be put in place if we are to return to export-led growth, a key driver of the economy.  We should focus on three objectives: fiscal stability, international competitiveness and access to credit.  This is continuously sited as the most significant issue facing small businesses across Ireland.  Firms that can develop and demonstrate viability are failing to obtain loans because of risk management issues.  We know the banks lack the expertise, although they know about construction and buying sites.  All that experience will not be used again but the banks have not developed expertise in the operation of business, their market potential or trends.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Does the Government realise that firms need cash?  They must weather this recession and invest for future growth, enhance their productivity, embrace innovation and focus on new markets.  The credit guarantee scheme outlined here is a way to ensure small businesses that are viable can get access to credit.  A similar programme has been established in more than 100 countries; Ireland is one of the few countries in the EU that does not have such a loan guarantee scheme.  I appeal to the Minister not to dismiss this out of hand but to look at it in a meaningful way.  This is where we have potential but these companies will go to the wall unless there is some form of intervention.  I am not saying every small company is viable but there are those, particularly those that are export-oriented, that should be protected by this form of guarantee.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael D’Arcy</from>
          <p eId="para_785">I compliment Fine Gael on tabling this important motion.  There are 1.85 million people working in the State, with 350,000 in the public sector and 1.5 million outside the employment of the State.  Of those, 800,000 work in the small and medium enterprise sector, which shows how crucial the sector is to the economy.  Those companies and businesses are being starved of cash flow.  We were told at the start of the banking crisis that there was a liquidity problem, not a problem with capitalisation, which was not correct.  All small businesses, however, are now experiencing cash flow difficulties.  Part of the problem is that much of the money has gone into NAMA and the wall of cash that would flow into the economy never appeared.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Those with small and medium enterprises often employ two, three or four people.  When someone has a business and works 15 hours a day six or seven days a week, without taking any funds out of the business, because he wants his employees to keep their jobs, because they are often friends or family, if that business does not work out, why is that person disallowed from social welfare payments for 12 months?  It is a major problem and it is particularly unfair when they put in such hours to the detriment of their families and themselves; they are told they are self-employed and will get nothing because they were sole traders.  That is wrong for those who have worked so hard in so many small businesses.  These firms are in all areas, from agriculture to services.  Solicitors' firms and architects' firms are closing and farmers are leaving the land because they are in such straits financially.  Will the Minister sit down with his counterpart in the Department of Social Protection and work that out, so those who run businesses will be entitled to a social welfare payment the same as someone who was let go?  It is crucial and would show the State has some confidence in these people, who need a safety net like everyone else.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_542">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_787">Consumer confidence is at rock bottom.  It is sad to say that this Government has done little to help the unemployed and to protect small businesses.  As previous speakers have pointed out, the Minister for Finance promised a wall of cash which would get credit going to small businesses when NAMA was established.  There was no such wall of cash, but small businesses that have run into difficulty and have had short-term cash problems have met a wall of silence from the banks, banks which we taxpayers bailed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I see it every day in every town and village my county.  Shops, pubs, small companies and post offices are all closing down and many of these go unreported because the numbers losing their jobs are small, but the closures add up and the numbers involved are significant.  Near my constituency office in Ennis for example, the owner of Tony's Menswear, which has been in the town for 21 years, has announced that it will close shortly.  He is angry because he has been forced to close.  Rents are too high and rates are an issue for many businesses.  The shopkeeper in my local shop told me that small business rates are €10,000 per year in a rural area.  People cannot afford to pay these rates.  Tony's Menswear is just one example and this could be the thin end of the wedge for other businesses if small businesses are not given a lifeline.  Deputy D'Arcy referred to an important issue in respect of people who close down their businesses, in that they are not entitled to jobseeker's benefit for 12 months.  That is wrong, given the number of businesses closing down.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Electricity prices are high.  We all know of the amount of money that small businesses must spend on fridges and coolers.  In my constituency, Kilrush town centre has seen businesses close recently.  It has a domino effect and will affect many other businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">We need a fresh approach.  Fine Gael has outlined one to the Minister.  A partial credit guarantee scheme is the way forward.  Small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, act as a lifeline for other businesses and many manufacturing businesses have gone elsewhere.  Creating two, three, four, five or six jobs in every village is the way forward.  There must be some type of market intervention.  Billions of euro have been spent on saving the banks.  It is a no brainer that the sector which provides a large number of jobs should be given a lifeline.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I commend the motion and Deputy Perry for tabling it.  I hope the Minister will take heed.  If he does not, rural Ireland will take heed of him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Deputy Tom Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_792">I join previous speakers in commending Deputy Perry on tabling this important motion.  If there is a glimmer of hope for the country in any quarter, it is in the SME sector.  SMEs can help to bring the country out of recession, but they are under considerable pressure to survive.  They are fearful.  In a recent survey by the County and City Enterprise Boards, CEBs, 29% of businesses stated they were at risk of closure.  This figure is worse in respect of smaller businesses, with 58% of those employing three or fewer employees indicating that they are at risk of folding in coming months.  This is a frightening situation, but the Government has shown no sign of taking it seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The banks' credit process is a significant problem.  From speaking with many business people in my area, they have needed to go to and fro with paperwork many times.  If the Minister is serious about getting money into the SME sector, it is time to give the banks guidelines so that they stop looking for issues and making the process more difficult and complicated.  Every time business people return to banks at considerable cost to themselves, bank managers look for something else because head office has been on to them.  It is time to take on the banks' head offices.  They are driving people to despair.  People are worried for themselves and their employees.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">A large range of issues is involved.  However, a great challenge is presenting some hope.  For example, there are many opportunities in the food industry.  As a nation, we have failed to market our products abroad.  There is an opportunity to set up many small enterprises.  Since there are more than 100,000 young graduates bursting to the brim with ideas for small business start-ups, the Minister will agree to our motion if he is serious about helping us and the many small businesses that are suffering and under significant pressure.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_795">I only have a few minutes to address the Minister across the floor.  The real nub of how we will overcome our terrible economic woes is contained in the motion.  I thank Deputy Perry, who believes in this motion.  As he drafted it, he knows what he is saying when we debate putting people back to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">If necessary, Fine Gael must get a point across to the Minister.  If he has not got it by this stage, God help us.  Where getting people back to work right, left and centre is concerned, there is no other show in town.  Some 450,000 people are out of work.  If we were able to get 100,000 back into work in a short period through this mechanism, as Fine Gael asserted in its NewERA document, can the Minister imagine the effect on the country's confidence?  It would reduce the cost of social welfare payments dramatically and, above all else, restore dignity to people who wanted to work anyway.  For the 300,000 people still unemployed, at least they could see something happening, but they cannot see anything happening now.  Can the Minister imagine a return to job creation?</p>
          <p eId="para_797">Thousands of young people are being crucified because they listened to the banks, Ministers and taoisigh over the years going on about a soft landing and that the prices they were paying for houses were worth it.  Imagine the crucifixion of so many young families across the country because of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I will use the last minute or so at my disposal to say something.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">The loan guarantee scheme is a part of the issue.  A few months ago, the Tánaiste stated such a guarantee would have a part to play.  I understand that the Minister saw some good in it.  When the Taoiseach was present last week, one need not have been in the House for too long to know that he just did not want to hear.  If someone comes up with an idea, the Government lets it out to the press if it looks even half way right and irrespective of what it entails because at least the Government would be seen to be doing something.  However, the public knows it is not doing anything.</p>

          <p eId="para_802">The problem is that the Government is delivering nothing.  If one wants to bell the cat — I hope the Minister knows what the term means, in that everyone has an answer but the Government is doing nothing — there is only one way to do it.  There are 80,000 small firms of one description or another.  Just one job per firm would put 80,000 back to work.  If one meets a man or woman who is able to employ another person, one should shake that person by the hand and call him or her a patriot.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_804">This motion is crystal clear.  For once, I appeal to the Minister to accept a positive Fine Gael suggestion.  I compliment Deputy Perry on tabling this motion on behalf of Fine Gael.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">Small enterprises are one of our few potential engines of growth and can play a key role in solving the economic crisis.  The required capital increases due to Basel II rules have undoubtedly resulted in capital hoarding by the banks.  Our banks are almost exclusively focused on rebuilding their balance sheets.  Due to the Government's softly softly approach, they continue to hoover up whatever capital is available.  Our dysfunctional system was born when even the most basic element of moral hazard was thrown out the window of Government Buildings in September 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The terms of this motion propose that the guarantee scheme would place an emphasis on start-up and export-oriented companies.  The debacle of two weeks ago in respect of county enterprise boards underlines the need for a loan guarantee scheme.  The fact that those bodies were allowed to run out of money by September speaks volumes.  That there is no seed capital for them makes this motion even more important.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">For the next six weeks, Clare County Enterprise Board will run a start-your-own-business campaign involving 14 participants.  This is the first of four such programmes over the winter.  Overall, 50 potential business ideas will be intensively teased out over the winter.  Their viability or lack thereof will be established by the end of their respective courses, but people who are in a position and want to pursue their ideas will face difficulties next spring when they seek funding to move to the next stage.  Were there a loan guarantee scheme in place, potential entrepreneurs would feel pursuing their ideas worthwhile.  This is what the terms of the motion are about, namely, an expression of absolute confidence in our small business sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have become adept at stating that we are all in this together.  They don of the green jersey of Ireland when they are in trouble and when they want us all to join together.  I ask the Government, especially the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, to put on the green jersey on behalf of the small business community of this country.</p>

        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_809">I thank Deputy Perry for tabling this Private Members, motion.  In August an Irish rural study symposium hosted by the departments of food and business development of UCC and Teagasc identified 54 distinct local economies in the country, not five or six.  Given the statistics, which speak for themselves and show that 80,000 small businesses employ, on average, ten people, it is fair to assume that most of the 54 local economies are underpinned in the main by small businesses rather than by large foreign direct investments.  The Government's ongoing love affair with the latter — trading and investing in a smart economy — can produce a relatively small number of high-end jobs that are very well paid while we still have high unemployment.  We need to develop a smart way of developing an economy, but not necessarily by developing only a so-called smart economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">In the short time I have I shall concentrate on the agrifood sector.  When the food harvest document was produced, the Taoiseach said: "At a time perhaps in the last decade when we have seen employment reduced by 1,500 in the agri-food sector, we now see a prospect of 3,500 to 4,000 jobs being created by 2020".  He was entirely correct but I believe he underestimated the figure.  The report envisages our agrifood exports growing from €7 billion to €12 billion, bringing an increased revenue to the country of €5 billion with all the associated employment, tax revenue and goodwill generated in the economy.  It would have an enormous impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">In Food Harvest 2020 and in the Pathways for Growth report commissioned by Bord Bia with the Harvard Business School, a mix of small and large businesses was identified.  We must support these in a loan guarantee scheme.  People who established food businesses in the 1980s will report that the IDA at the time provided small grants and guaranteed loans from the ACC and ICC, in particular the latter, which allowed companies get off the ground.  If the loans are properly stress tested by agencies such as the county enterprise boards and Enterprise Ireland, the failure rate, and there will be one, need only be very small.  We must embrace the view that we need a loan guarantee scheme based on the fundamentals outlined by Deputy Perry.  If we are serious about trying to get things moving, this is a very small signal that could be sent.</p>

          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_812">I wish to speak on behalf of the tourism industry.  As the Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, knows, access to and the cost of credit have become major issues for the tourism industry and for enterprises in all sectors of the economy.  Companies in the tourism industry, especially hotels, have difficulty in obtaining credit.  If they do get it they pay higher interest rates than in any other part of the EU and as a result they lose competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The near collapse of the banking sector in Ireland, the need for Irish banks to restore their capital ratios, as noted by previous speakers, and the higher prices paid for funds by the banks have all contributed to this situation and lack of  competitiveness.  As the Minister knows, the difficulties faced by the tourism industry will be greatly exacerbated by the withdrawal from Ireland of Bank of Scotland.  That bank has given loans in excess of €2 billion to the hotel sector alone and provides overdraft facilities for about 350 hotels.  There is no evidence of an appetite among the other banks to take over these loans when Bank of Scotland withdraws.  In these circumstances, Deputy Perry's proposal is very important and is critical for the tourism sector.  It is vital for the Government to introduce a loan guarantee scheme for viable small and medium-sized enterprises in the tourism industry in order for these businesses to gain access to credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Last week the Irish Hotels Federation made a major attack on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, because he would not take any action on rates.  Approximately 180 hotels may be before the courts in coming weeks, having been prosecuted by county managers.  That is why it is so important to have a scheme as proposed.  Such schemes are in operation in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and many eurozone states, including France and Germany.  The guarantee in the UK is for up to 75% of the loan amount, with a maximum loan exposure of €1 million.  Borrowers pay a premium on the interest rates.  If the scheme works in that country and in the USA, why would it not work in this country?  I appeal to the Minister on behalf of the tourism industry with which he is familiar.  This loan guarantee scheme could ensure doors are kept open for the 2011 season.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_553">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_815">I thank my colleague, Deputy John Perry, for tabling this motion.  I recognise that the Minister is sitting through the entire debate.  I hope he is listening to what Members are saying and taking it on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I have one question to ask and one suggestion to make in the short time allotted.  What has happened to the Minister's commitment to this issue?  Almost a month ago he spoke at the Small Firms Association annual conference in Dublin and stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_817">Your chairman has called on the Government to step up to the plate and set up a Government-backed loan guarantee scheme.  I am pleased to tell you that officials in my Department and the Department of Finance are looking at options for a loan guarantee scheme.  Detailed discussions on how this can be achieved are under way and I hope they can be finalised very shortly.  The scheme would target market failure in small business lending when commercially viable businesses fail to get credit because of insufficient collateral and information deficits despite having demonstrated an ability to repay.  Over 2,000 loan guarantee schemes operate in almost 100 countries.  Ireland is one of the few nations in the European Union that does not have some form of loan guarantee scheme.  Getting credit flowing to small businesses is vital to our economic recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">That was what the Minister stated, according to a press release on his own website.  When he addresses the motion, therefore, will he give the House a detailed answer as to why the commitment he made to the Small Firms Association a month ago now seems to be entirely absent?  This is suggested by Government policy regarding his strategy for supporting small businesses.  I do not understand why he has changed his tune.  Clearly, the Taoiseach shares the view this should not happen but we have not had a detailed explanation as to why the State cannot do what hundreds of countries are doing to try to ensure that banks which are risk averse at present can extend loan facilities to small businesses that desperately need cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">We understand how difficult it is for banks to access cash at present because of their mistakes.  They are being funded weekly by the lender of last resort, the European Central Bank, and therefore funds are not readily available.  None the less, we must ensure the funds they have are being made available to small businesses that have proven themselves likely to be able to repay.  The State can assist in that process by adopting the motion my party has proposed and which the Minister endorsed a month ago in his address to that conference.  I hope he will address that point in some detail.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">There are many small firms which want to be able to employ people on a short-term basis, namely, contractors such as painters, tradespeople or whoever, who are lucky enough to get a job for a month or six or eight weeks.  They want to be able to re-employ staff they had to let go in the past 18 months but cannot do so because people are not willing to come back and work on a short-term basis owing to the hassle involved in coming off jobseeker's benefit and then returning to social welfare at the end of their short-term contract.  People are not willing to come back and work on a short-term basis because of the hassle involved in coming off jobseeker's benefit and trying to go back onto social welfare at the end of the short-term contract or work on offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">It is a significant problem for small businesses at the moment that they cannot get people, even though enormous numbers are unemployed, for short-term work because of the difficulties people have in availing of the jobseeker's benefit system.  That is something the Government needs to address, so that people can come off and go on the dole quickly, when and where work is available, if we are to reduce our exposure to welfare payments as well as giving job opportunities when they arise.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">The Fine Gael motion opens with a recognition of the important role that small firms play in Ireland's economy.  This is reflected in the fact that small firms across the country support over 700,000 jobs.  They play an important part in supporting all firms in all sectors, as suppliers of the goods and services on which larger companies rely.  It is because of the important role small firms play and the recognition of the challenging environment they have operated in.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">In the past two years the Government has placed support for this sector at the heart of its strategy for economic recovery.  I have addressed the issue of the Government's jobs strategy in the House recently.  I set out that the best way to support businesses and create jobs was to fix the banks, address the deficit and improve our national competitiveness.  These actions are not aimed at firms of any particular size, in any particular sector or particular ownership.  They are aimed at improving the overall business environment in this country so that all firms can survive and grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Central to this has been the repair of our banks which are the key facilitator of business transactions in the economy on a daily basis.  Specifically, the provision of credit to our enterprise sector, especially SMEs, should primarily come from a properly functioning banking sector.  I want to take this opportunity to again acknowledge the extraordinary work done by the Minister for Finance to address the banking problem.  The code of conduct, the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency have all contributed to the stabilisation of the banking sector with a view to facilitating the flow of credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">The primary objective of the code of conduct for SME lending is to facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive businesses.  The code promotes fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by all regulated entities.  It applies to areas of banking that are key to small firms such as overdrafts and term loans.  It is specifically aimed at regulating the relationship between small firms and financial institutions.  This is not optional.  Regulated institutions must comply as a matter of law.  Not only have we addressed how banks lend to small firms, but as I mentioned already, the Government has also secured commitments on the actual levels of credit that these banks must extend to the SME sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The House will be aware that the Government secured a commitment from the main lenders, AIB and Bank of Ireland, to make available not less than €3 billion each for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs in both 2010 and 2011, including funds for working capital.  When it comes to honouring these commitments, the Government is not prepared to simply take the banks' word for it.  The Credit Review Office is making a major contribution to dealing with the outflow of credit, not only in reviewing cases where credit has been refused but in reviewing bank lending policies and in driving the process of providing our businesses with a proper, professional banking service.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">I have made it a priority to regularly meet with the banks to discuss the availability of bank credit for businesses, especially SMEs.  I have also travelled around the country to meet with businesses to hear their experiences at first hand and ensure that Government hears both sides of the story.  I have conveyed the concerns of business regarding credit availability to the banks.  I have also reminded the banks of their obligations under the recapitalisation package and of the huge investment of taxpayers' money into the banks aimed at getting our economy moving again.  The fact that we have someone of Mr. John Trethowan's calibre monitoring the banks and assessing their policies is having a positive and meaningful impact on this aspect of banking performance.  Mr. Trethowan said this month that the "worst is over" for small business borrowers, and that the situation was much more positive for bank customers than it was six to nine months ago.  This echoes the view of business representative groups that there has been a recent improvement in the level of bank credit to small companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">While fixing the banks has been a key element of our recovery, the Government has in parallel focused on maximising direct and indirect supports to enterprise with a specific emphasis on SMEs.  Remember, SMEs in Ireland benefit not only from the direct financial supports available through the CEBs and Enterprise Ireland but also from the FDI activity supported by the IDA, up to the multi-billion, multi-annual capital investment programme.  The Government has targeted interventions and supports for small firms but they also benefit from our initiatives in the wider economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Regarding targeted support for entrepreneurs, I was pleased to be able to provide additional capital funding of €3.3 million to the CEBs last week, supporting more than 450 new jobs in small firms.  This is in addition to capital funding of €15 million already provided in 2010 to the county and city enterprise boards.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">The Government also responded quickly to the rapid economic downturn by providing financial support to almost 2,000 companies through the employment subsidy scheme and the enterprise stabilisation fund.  The public sector, as a large procurer of goods and services provided by small firms must do what it can to improve the cash flow of SMEs.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">That is why we have required all Departments to pay their business suppliers within 15 days of receipt of a valid invoice.  I am anxious to see this approach extended as widely as possible.  Small firms in existence today are the product of the creativity and effort of an entrepreneur who believed in their idea and worked to make it a reality.  The Government assists these risk-takers in particular through the programmes provided by Enterprise Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In 2010, the Government increased the funding available to Enterprise Ireland by 26% on the outturn for 2009.  We did this to stimulate the development of new businesses and facilitate the expansion of existing companies through a broad range of initiatives including direct financial and non-financial supports.  We are also investing in small firms in the earliest stages of development via El's €175 million seed and venture capital programme.  We are committed to developing the venture capital landscape further and we are doing this through the €500 million Innovation Fund Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">SMEs benefit from our targeted investments but also from initiatives in the wider economy.  The Government's new integrated strategy for trade, tourism and investment creates a platform for small firms to maximise their potential either as suppliers to exporting firms or as exporters themselves.  The strategy sets a number of priorities and targets to be achieved by 2015.  These include increasing the number of new export focused jobs by over 150,000 in manufacturing, tourism and traded services, with a similar number of indirect jobs also being created; increasing the value of exports by indigenous companies by 33%; diversifying the destination of indigenous exports; increasing overseas visitors to 8 million; and by securing an additional 780 inward investment projects through IDA Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The UK market, which is key to many small indigenous firms will, along with the US, continue to be a key market for Ireland.  However, there is also considerable potential to expand business with our eurozone partners and the new and high-potential growth markets such as Brazil, China, India, Russia, Japan and the Gulf States.  Our small firms will face obvious barriers such as language and cultural attributes as well as different business practices and regulation.  The co-ordinated effort of all agencies will be focused on helping our small firms overcome these barriers, win new business, succeed in new markets and reach their potential.  In doing this, the Government is providing leadership and taking action in support of small firms.  These facts are absent from the Opposition's analysis of the Government's economic strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">One thing that has come across strongly in my dealings with small business owners is that they thrive on confidence.  They need consumers to have confidence and they too must have confidence to invest in the knowledge that the Government is doing what it can to provide the best possible operating environment.  There have been positive signs in recent weeks.  Redundancy claims are down and recruitment agencies inform me that there has been a healthy increase in the number of jobs advertised.  Three quarters of jobs advertised are for newly created positions.  Even more importantly, there has been a 55% increase in job placements in the third quarter of this year compared with the third quarter last year.  This is on the back of Ireland's improved trading performance.  The value of exports in July was up by 12% compared with the previous July.  Enterprise Ireland says its firms will recover about 70% of the export earnings that were lost last year.  These are the messages that will encourage small business owners and consumers and engender the confidence we need to get the economy growing again.  Let us compare this to the uninspiring and negative sentiment that emanates daily from the benches opposite.  The rhetoric of those Members does a disservice to small businesses that are succeeding every day and discourages potential entrepreneurs and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">I will now deal with some of the more puzzling aspects of the Fine Gael motion.  Fine Gael has been known to complain about a lack of information from the Government on economic policy.  It also claims that the Government has broken a promise to introduce a loan guarantee scheme.  This is quite bizarre, given the information I provided on the floor of this House less than a week ago.  I will refresh the Deputies' memories.  My officials are working with their colleagues in the Department of Finance, the Credit Review Office, Enterprise Ireland and Forfás to address issues regarding access to credit for viable SMEs, including the option of a targeted loan guarantee scheme.  The most recent meeting was held on Monday of last week.  A range of issues regarding SME credit were discussed and follow-up action is under way.  These meetings are aimed at building on the already substantial progress made in identifying critical elements for further initiatives.  It is important that any initiatives complement rather than provide a substitute for the lending commitments and activities of the main banks under the recapitalisation package and that they represent value for money from the taxpayer's perspective.  This activity can hardly be described as equating to a broken promise on the part of the Government.  On the contrary, it is evidence that the Government will take every step necessary to ensure that small firms have access to the credit they require, while ensuring that banks meet their obligations and taxpayers are spared undue risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">I am concerned at the implication in the Fine Gael motion that initiatives should be implemented in haste and a blind eye turned to the outcomes expected from the banks in light of measures already taken.  Even more worrying is Fine Gael's pursuit of a strategy that overlooks the potential exposure to the taxpayer.  The main source of credit for viable businesses is a functioning banking system — in this case, one which has been well supported by the taxpayer.  The Fine Gael motion implies that it is willing to put taxpayers' money at risk by promoting an all-pervasive loan guarantee scheme and allowing the banks off the hook.  It would redirect responsibility from the banks to the taxpayer.  We, on the other hand, focus on targeted measures for businesses that are critical to our economy and indigenous export growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">It is clear that the Government has a multi-faceted approach to supporting small firms.  Our strategy includes the provision of one-to-one advice and grants by county enterprise boards and a range of supports from Enterprise Ireland, the delivery of spin-off benefits from IDA Ireland and Science Foundation Ireland activities, our multi-billion euro stimulus programme and our ambitious strategy for international trade and investment.  Government is a complex business.  The idea of a silver bullet, to which the Opposition seems to turn to mask the absence of a proper economic strategy, is disingenuous and dangerous.  The Government will not be distracted from implementing its wide-ranging strategy for economic recovery.  This motion is just one more example of the Opposition taking a populist and narrow stance rather than demonstrating an understanding of the complexity of the broader business environment.  For that reason, I recommend the Government's amendment to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_557">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_859">The Opposition motion acknowledges the importance of SMEs to our economy.  On the Government side, we have always recognised the importance of the SME sector to our overall long-term economic well-being.  As we have improved the business environment, raised our competitiveness and provided direct supports to enterprises through our enterprise development agencies, SMEs have always been at the centre of our policies.  That is why we have focused our efforts over the past 18 months on the key issue of credit for viable SMEs to help them get through these difficult times and bring us through the recession.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Our first priority has been to sustain the banks and ensure that credit flows to the economy as a whole.  We also want to maintain a pro-business environment where entrepreneurship can flourish so that new and existing businesses can survive and grow.  The Minister, Deputy O'Keeffe, has already outlined in detail a number of specific initiatives included in the two recapitalisation packages of 2009 and 2010, including the commitment from AIB and Bank of Ireland in the 2010 recapitalisation package that they would provide not less than €3 billion each for new or increased lending to SMEs in 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">In August, as part of a series of regional meetings, I attended a meeting in Tallaght, in my constituency, on access to credit for SMEs.  Thirty-three representatives from business and farming organisations, including the Small Firms Association, ISME, Chambers Ireland, the Irish Farmers' Association and the Irish Hotels Federation, attended from Dublin, Kildare, Meath and Wicklow.  It was important to hear at first hand the experience of borrowers so that I could feed back their constructive views to the Government, the Credit Review Office and the banks.  Since then, Mr. John Trethowan has indicated that the environment for bank customers is much better than it was six to nine months ago.  I also note that one of the business representative groups has recently indicated that there has been an improvement in the provision of bank credit to small businesses.  This development will no doubt be welcomed by all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">If we are to build a much greater number of competitive and innovative companies in Ireland, we will need to see the creation of many new businesses, mostly small and medium-sized, now and in the years ahead.  From my perspective as Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and innovation, STI, our investment in this area is aimed at helping us compete in a highly competitive global market.  We appreciate that nations with long-term competitiveness make significant investments in research and development.  Recent analysis by the OECD which makes a strong case for public investment in research development and innovation is highly persuasive, particularly in offering a way forward from the economic crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">In December 2008, the Government reinforced the importance of investment in STI through the paper entitled Building Ireland's Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal, which prioritised continued investment in science and engineering infrastructure and research.  The decision in budget 2010 to allocate €600 million to the STI priorities of Departments, despite the challenging economic times, reinforces the Government's commitment to STI as a productive investment for the future and an engine of economic growth.  In budget 2010, we reoriented the focus of spending on STI.  Our goal for this year and the immediate future is to leverage the investment made to date in research and development to obtain a return in terms of jobs and exports while consolidating what has been built to secure long-term growth.  The tripling of public investment in STI over the past ten years concentrated on built infrastructure and productive human capital development.  After the reorientation, we are now focused on deriving maximum commercial benefit from the investment to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">For us, building a smart economy depends on the development and application of human capital — the knowledge, skills and creativity of people — and our ability and effectiveness in translating ideas into valuable processes, products and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The report of the innovation task force, which was launched in March of this year, provides a roadmap for delivering sustainable new jobs by making Ireland an innovation hub.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">There is one way out of this recession, and that is through export-led growth.  That export-led growth will be driven by companies that engage in research and development.  It is no accident that the 800 companies that work with Enterprise Ireland in research and development are adding to their export share in these difficult two years of recession.  It is also a hallmark of the success of the Government strategy that 51% of the inward investment we achieved through foreign direct investment has been in the area of research and development.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DarraghOBrien" eId="spk_558">
          <from>Deputy Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_867">I wish to speak in support of the Government's amendment to the motion.  Fine Gael's motion states that there are over 800,000 people employed in the Irish SME sector.  We both agree that it is a crucial part of our economy which needs to be protected as much as possible.  We might disagree on some of the detail behind that, but it is important that we are having this debate tonight because I welcome that part of the Fine Gael motion.  It is interesting to note that there is no mention of NewERA, which has been binned, or of Deputy Bruton's magic bank, which has gone, but we will move on from that.  Our policies in this area have been incredible.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">The Government has improved financial support for over 2,000 companies under the employment subsidy scheme.  That scheme maintains over 100,000 jobs in this economy.  We are creating long-term sustainable jobs.  The Government is supporting enterprise agencies in creating high quality sustainable jobs by attracting foreign direct investment and supporting Irish companies.  In the first six months of 2010, IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland made over 50 announcements, which have led to the creation of over 4,000 jobs across the country.  The pipeline of new job announcements from both these State agencies is very strong between now and the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">Last year was a very difficult year for foreign direct investment across the world.  FDI dropped by 30% internationally, but there was only a 4% drop in Ireland.  We brought in €19 billion in new foreign direct investment, which was half of what was brought to the UK.  That shows we are continuing to punch above our weight when trying to attract new jobs and investment to this country.  There are two crucial reasons for this.  The first is that we have reduced our labour costs significantly.  Our labour costs and our competitiveness index have improved by 6% since 2005.  We have seen a marked improvement in our competitiveness.  It has been a shock to the system, but the cost of doing business in this country has dropped.  We also have a low corporation tax regime and an educated, flexible workforce.  We only have to see what is happening in France this week to understand why flexible workforces like our own will attract high quality jobs into this country.  That is good news.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">Our exports are holding up very well.  The Minister of State pointed out that a major part of the recovery will be export led, because we cannot consume what we produce.  Eighty per cent of what we produce is exported.  Irish exports fell by 3% in 2009, whereas the international average was minus 20%.  Our trade surplus is up nearly 30% to €4 billion.  These are facts and figures.  They show that we are on the way to recovery.</p>
          <p eId="para_871">Capital investment is crucially important and we will be discussing this at length between now and the budget.  If we take the €40 billion that will be spent over the next six years, it is very easy, as the Labour Party might point out — it is absent tonight for the second consecutive Private Members' motion, just like its absence on financial policies — to talk of reductions.  We can get more for less with our investments.  In my own constituency of Dublin North, the first flight will land at terminal two of Dublin Airport later this month.  This terminal has created 900 jobs and many other spin off jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">I am very pleased that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has spoken about the county enterprise boards.  They do phenomenal work on the ground.  Since 1993 they have created a net total of 30,000 jobs.  We need to continue to support those boards.  They know what is happening on the ground.  My own county enterprise board in Fingal is doing a phenomenal job, and I was able to open a new enterprise centre there with over 40 companies up and running.  That is the type of business environment we need.  We must look at what we can create and what we can do better.  I welcome the fact that we are debating this issue tonight.  I thank Fine Gael for tabling the motion.  Obviously, I cannot support it, but the counter-motion is far more realistic.</p>

          <p eId="para_873">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this very important debate.  We all have to concentrate our efforts in the days, weeks, months and years ahead on small business and employment.  It is the key growth area for our economy and we know the vast majority of people in the private sector are working in small businesses.  Many of these are single operators that may have a small number of employees, but people often do not realise that there are such active businesses in their area.  However, these businesses are often keeping people in employment in cities, towns and in rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I am a little bit disappointed by the motion put forward by Fine Gael tonight.  In recent times, it has begun to grasp the economic difficulties that the country is facing and it has been very responsible in its approach.  After all we have been through with the banks, trying to get to the bottom of the reckless lending by these institutions, I am surprised that Fine Gael would put down a motion asking the Irish taxpayer to give a loan guarantee scheme for businesses that would involve risk sharing between the financial institutions——</p>

A credit review committee is being chaired by John Trethowan and it makes sure that loans are being paid out.  There is a fund of €12 billion over two years between AIB and Bank of Ireland to provide loans to local businesses.  Partnership companies and county enterprise boards are in receipt of such loans.</p>

The second was a specialised company in the construction industry with six employees and it cannot keep up with its work.  The third was a sales and sales support high-tech ICT company from Portlaoise that now employs 25 people, even though it did not exist two years ago.  It wanted access to the metropolitan area network and additional office space in the town so that it could increase its services.  Last Saturday I met representatives of these three businesses in Castletown and I believe the shoots exist but we need to nurture them.

          <p eId="para_894">I am aware of businesses in the small to medium-sized enterprise sector which have the ability to trade their way out of their difficulties, some of which have already reached agreement with Revenue on excise, VAT returns, income tax etc., but now find that some of the agencies of the State, including Revenue, because there is such a clamour to get money in, are changing those terms somewhat.  It is something that needs to be examined.  The motion refers to the SME sector, the loan guarantee etc.  However, we need to look to the wider aspect and the potential of the SME sector within the economy.  Where Revenue is now putting the squeeze on businesses that have the capability to trade their way out of difficulties, we respectfully suggest there might be some word from some Minister to suggest to Revenue that while it will get the tax due and every person will maintain his or her responsibility for that, it should be more relaxed in lengthening the terms so that some of these businesses are not put out of business for want of better terms from Revenue and other State agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">While it is said there is an oversupply of houses in the market, at the same time some businesses are still willing to build houses because there is still a demand by people, in rural areas in particular, who want to build, for example, one-off houses on family-owned land or in localities with which they have a connection.  Many people of my generation who have received mortgage approval are finding that such approval lasts for only three months.  However, a small building company cannot operate on the basis that someone has approval for only three months.  Extending the approval to six or nine months would also help small building firms, most of which are family-owned and intergenerational, to get up and running.  It is a case of looking at things more laterally.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">I would also like to concentrate on the issue of the regulatory burden ascribed to the small to medium-sized enterprise sector.  On 2 June, Mr. Seán Gorman, chairman of the high-level group on business regulation at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, attended the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic Regulatory Affairs to discuss the work of the group in identifying ways to reduce the administrative burden on business arising from regulation.  The high-level group was established in 2007 to act as the fulcrum which Government, business and unions could tackle issues such as administrative burdens and red tape issues, and propose simplification procedures to reduce SMEs' cost burden.  According to the terms of reference of the group as elucidated by Mr. Gorman "its remit is to identify the administrative burdens placed on businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, arising from regulation or other administrative requirements, particularly in the areas of taxation; health and safety regulation; employment law; environmental regulations; company law and statistical returns; to determine ways to reduce and simplify administrative burdens and to eliminate them where they are unnecessary."</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The bottom line for the group was to reduce the paperwork associated with regulation, and simplify and streamline the information flow between business and Government.  The question for the group is whether it has achieved its aims and whether adequate resources are attributed to this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Since 2008 the CSO, in co-operation with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, has adopted its standard cost model to compare the results.  Mr. Steve MacFeely of the CSO, who also addressed the committee that day, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_899">Previously we had been using the EUROSTAT recommended methodology.  The standard cost model measures the burden in terms of money rather than time.  From those studies, we estimate that the CSO imposes a burden of approximately €10 million per annum on Irish businesses.  That accounts for about 0.5% of total regulatory burden and is consistent with findings in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">Compared with the figures for bank bailouts etc., €10 million is probably minuscule.  For a small business, however, perhaps a sole trader or a business employing fewer than five people, reducing that kind of cost would increase turnover and should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Labour Party would seek to address the baseline target.  If the target is a reduction of 25% by 2012, it would appear there is not enough departmental staff to deal with the high-level group aspirations adequately to move forward the agenda.  I am not convinced that any target has been reached to date in reducing the regulatory burden for small businesses.  A new political impetus should drive this agenda and no more lip service should be paid to reducing the cost burden.  The Government has signed up to an EU target in this respect.  The challenge facing us now, given that this process started in 1999 and has been through two transitions, is that we are in an economic downturn.  There is a serious urgency about this because of the cost implications for those same businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">There is a 25% target for 2012 but it must be remembered that the SME sector is under significant pressure.  We clearly should have had a yearly target.  The high-level group has met only five times in 2009 and if the need to reduce the regulation burden on businesses is critical then the group should meet monthly.  This is a view that was proposed by Deputy Kieran O'Donnell when the high-level group appeared before the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The group is examining five key areas where businesses have stated they have issues.  These include the burden of complying with tax law, health and safety, employment law and environmental regulations.  The fifth area is company law and the related area of statistical returns.  At a recent meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Economic and Regulatory Affairs, I questioned the high-level group on the cost burden arising from the work of the Health and Safety Authority.  I did so on the basis that we wanted the cost of health and safety measures reduced without compromising the safety of workers.  On health and safety, the administrative costs associated with the IO/20 risk assessments were €167 million, and €146 million for the IO/13 safety statements.  As a percentage of the overall cost burden, these amounted to 51% and 44%, respectively.  How, in practical terms, is it proposed to reduce the burden of these two areas by 25% by the end of 2012?</p>
          <p eId="para_904">I am somewhat sceptical about the targets being reached.  It needs a new political impetus.  What I am saying does not necessarily speak to the motion, but in terms of the spirit of the motion and giving some kind of a fillip and assistance to the SME sector, we also need to review the regulatory burden the sector is facing.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_905">I thank Deputy Seán Sherlock in the Labour Party for sharing his time with me.  I very much support this Fine Gael motion moved by Deputy John Perry.  He has a way with understatement, given that one of the bullet points in the motion states "- notes with concern that small businesses are still having difficulty accessing credit through financial institutions for a variety of reasons".  By God that is true.  There is less than a trickle coming through.  The few tokenistic measures taken by Government are not doing anything to improve the position.  The Deputy's next bullet point states "- recognises that the Government strategy of NAMA and bank recapitalisation has not produced a ‘wall of cash' in credit for small business promised by the Minister for Finance".  That is certainly true as well.  Rather than a wall of cash in credit having been produced for the SMEs a wall of isolation has been built around them in terms of their ability to obtain funding.  The Government has done nothing practical to ensure that they will be funded.  Admittedly, it has put some money into the banks and ticked the box that it is to be lent to the SME sector but that has not happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">I will spend a few minutes to go through the speech of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, which I found most interesting.  He took a different attitude from Deputy Perry to the subject of this motion.  He said: "I want to take this opportunity to again acknowledge the extraordinary work done by the Minister for Finance to address the banking problem."  Why would he not commend the Minister for Finance on that, given that he has done nothing else only address the banking problem in the past two years?  That is not only true of the Minister for Finance but the entire Government has been dug into addressing the banking system and has ignored the rest of the economy.  It could care less about it and it has done nothing positive to bring a solution, initiative or stimulus to the SME sector — so much for commending the Minister for Finance on what he has done.  The Minister has not produced a wall of cash in credit for the SMEs, rather he has built a wall of isolation around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">The Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, also told us about the code of conduct for SMEs.  Whatever about other regulated agencies, the banks have danced a merry jig around the Government since the evening in September 2008 which they walked into Government Buildings and wagged the finger at the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance.  They have danced a merry jig around the Government since.  If the Minister says they have not done so and if he is aware of what they were at, he must have been compliant in what they were doing.  He must be supporting their carry on in not revealing — if they did not — the accurate situation to the Government.  Which is the position?  The Minister cannot have it both ways.  They either danced a merry jig around the Government or the Government was playing along with them.  Either way, the comment of the Minister, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, about this code of conduct being some kind of a lifesaver for SMEs is nothing short of ridiculous.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The Minister also said: "Firstly, the Credit Review Office is making a major contribution——</p>

          <p eId="para_910">——to dealing with the outflow of credit."  Some 20 cases have been referred to that office since it opened and it has dealt with ten of them.  It found in favour of five and in the other five cases it found in favour of the banks.  What should we take from the message that sends to the sector?  If the Minister does not know the answer to that, I will give him a hint.  It means that the SME sector has no faith whatsoever in that office, although I acknowledge the sound character of the credit reviewer.  I acknowledge Mr. John Trethowan's credibility but the office and the way it was established by the Government and the relationship between the Government and the banks is such that SMEs would take one look at that office and say: "Thanks but no thanks, hang on to your so-called Credit Review Office, it means nothing for us."  That is the message about that office that is being taken by the sector; no could message could be taken from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Mr. John Trethowan said the "worst is over" for small business borrowers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_913">Where did we here the words that the "worst is over" before?  The last time we heard those words was from the Minister for Finance when he had introduced the bank guarantee scheme and was introducing the legislation setting out the terms and conditions of it, which left the option wide open for the banks to continue to play their merry jig and thumb their noses not only at the taxpayers but at the European institutions.  We are supposed to believe there is credibility there.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The "worst is over" comment of the Minister for Finance reminds of another comment he made in the budget before last when he said that people should do their patriotic duty, by which he meant they should not go across the Border to buy a can of beer.  I would like to see the patriotic duty of this Government given some practical and credible leadership in working its way out of this economic crisis by dealing with some issues such as giving SMEs some vibrancy through a stimulus package.  We have not had a stimulus package.  Admittedly, there have been job announcements.  We have had more than 600,000 job announcements by the Government during the past year, but where have the jobs been created?  There has been a trickle of jobs here and there, but job creation, as such, is not happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">I caution other Opposition parties — who may not be in government with us if we have a good enough election performance on the next occasion — that the Government is trying to fool the people into believing that it was going to create these 600,000 odd jobs, but, guess what, the electorate turfed it out, it did not get to do that, the new Government will not do the business and the people should have stuck with it, or some such nonsense.  In any event, what it amounts to is that we have a Government of announcements and not a  Government of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">There are few other gems in the Minister's speech.  He said: "We are also investing in small firms [I give him credit for this] — in the earliest stages of development via Enterprise Ireland's €175 million seed and venture capital programme."  I commend that; I only wish the fund was bigger.  I know that seed and venture capital investment is high risk but when such investment works it yields a huge return, and it has worked substantially in recent years.  I acknowledge that.  It is one area of investment which, although it is high risk, is useful.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">The Minister also spoke about increasing "the number of new export focused jobs" and he made an another announcement of 150,000 jobs.  It is probably the fourth time that was announced but there is no substance to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">I have wasted too much time on the nonsense about which the Government is talking.  I am not a Fine Gael supporter but the Minister said that "The Fine Gael motion ... [was] promoting an all pervasive loan guarantee scheme and allowing the banks off the hook" — such a comment from a Fianna Fáil Minister.  I am sorry for laughing; I would rather not laugh and get on with addressing the seriousness of the business in hand.  However, that comment is so ridiculous and ludicrous that it is worse than pathetic.  An Opposition party in this House is being accused of letting the banks off the hook when characters are swanning around America, Seanie and few characters are still swanning around this town while the rest of them are sipping champagne in fancy restaurants in Spain and celebrating the fact that they got over there.  Deputy Perry, or whoever will reply to this debate, should remember that the Fine Gael Party is letting the banks off the hook.  I would like to hear that party's response to that comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">In regard to providing credit to SMEs, they simply are not getting it; it is a very light trickle.  The consequences of that is that one business is not paid by another and, consequently, it cannot pay its suppliers.  Therefore, a domino effect is occurring across the board which is resulting in the loss of viable jobs and the closing down of viable businesses and that will continue to happen until the Government stops its bluff and bluster.  It will continue to happen until such time as the Government finds a bit of backbone somewhere or someone on the opposite side, with a segment of entrepreneurial spirit, says to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, "Lads, cop on;  you are making a muck of this; you are costing hundreds of thousands of businesses to close and hundreds of thousands of jobs to be lost — viable companies, viable jobs."  They should wise up and get off the scene.  We should hit the decks and have an election.  Let us clear this up once and for all and see where the mandate lies and, hopefully, somebody will come in to pick up the pieces before it is too late.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_920">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this matter, an important one for Ballygarvan, County Cork.  The need for a new national school building in Ballygarvan was accepted by the Department of Education and Skills in the late 1990s.  Enrolment at the school has expanded in recent years while conditions in the existing buildings are substandard with an over reliance on expensive prefab accommodation.  There is also a lack of space for recreational and play areas for the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">The Department approved a 16-classroom school to be built on a green-field site.  The project, however, was bedevilled by the need to secure a suitable site.  Although three separate land parcels with three separate owners comprised the preferred site, after enormous work by the local community, its public representatives and the Department the site was secured.  The then Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, who also had served the constituency as a Deputy, approved the appointment of a design team and the project progressed through the various planning stages.  It was then put out to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The school was to be constructed using a modular build model in a five-month timescale.  The preferred bidder for the school building project is McInerney Holdings but it went into interim examinership recently.  I hope it will be in a position to fulfil its contract with this building and begin construction as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">The community in Ballygarvan wants to know the status of the project and if the preferred bidder will be able to proceed.  If this were not to be the case, will the project have to be retendered or can the Department select the next bidder from the original tender process?  The local community also wants funding for the project to be confirmed.  If construction proceeded, it would be a great boost to this close-knit community which has fund-raised for many years for a new school building.  Will the Minister of State give some indication as to when construction on site will begin and a reassurance the project is going ahead?</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Ciarán Cuffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_924">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Coughlan.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy for capital investment in education projects and, in particular, Ballygarvan national school.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">The allocation of funding for school buildings in 2010 is just under €579 million, including the carryover of €72 million deferred funding from 2009.  This represents a significant investment in the schools building and modernisation programme.  This level of funding, at a time of great pressure on public finances, is a sign of the Government's commitment to investing in school infrastructure and will permit the continuation of the Department's programme of sustained investment in primary and post primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">With regard to Ballygarvan national school, the need to provide for additional school places has already been determined.  Consequently, the proposed project for the construction of a new 16-classroom school was one of 25 projects announced to commence architectural planning in February 2009.  Following this announcement, detailed designs were prepared, planning permission lodged and a tender competition held.  Unfortunately, delays in securing planning permission and the acquisition by the patron of the two parcels of land required for the proposed new school building have impacted on the scheduled delivery of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">However, I am pleased that planning permission for the proposed new school was granted in May and the acquisition of the site completed by the patron in recent weeks.  The completion of the land transfers in recent weeks by the patron has enabled the Department to enter into discussions with the preferred bidder.  The Deputy will appreciate these discussions are at a sensitive stage.  Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on them.  When these discussions have concluded, the implications for the project will then be examined.  In the meantime, the Department will continue to liaise with the patron and the school authorities regarding the proposed project.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_928">With no disrespect to the two Ministers of State opposite, I regret the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is not in the Chamber to take this important matter.  She did not even attend the Chamber earlier when the matter was raised on the Order of Business.</p>
            <p eId="para_929">My only concern is for the best outcome for the country's children.  The resignation of Philip Lynch as chairman of the national paediatric hospital development board has cast a cloud over the hospital's future, however.  Several substantial issues raised by Mr. Lynch have not been adequately answered by the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">Has the €400 million funding for the project been ring-fenced?  A gap in funding, already believed to be €200 million, will have to be made up in philanthropic donations.  From inquiries I have learned no one believes such a gap can be filled by this means.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">The site for the proposed hospital has been controversial since it was first announced.  There have been constant questions about the level of consultation and transparency in this choice.  It is also believed political pressure was brought to bear on the choice.  It is now being asked whether a national children's hospital can be delivered.  Clear answers need to be provided to these questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">Mr. Lynch also raised questions as to whether funding has been secured for an ambulatory centre at Tallaght which was to be part of the national paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The public has lost trust in believing the Government has the capacity or even intends to develop a national paediatric hospital.  Questions have also been raised as to whether the preferred site is appropriate since access, in particular, seems to be a problem.  I do not just raise the question of whether it should be built on a greenfield site.  Other suggestions, such as locating it at St. James's Hospital, were put forward at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">The questions I ask must be answered in the immediate future.  Somebody must examine these issues independently, preferably somebody with expertise from outside this country.  He or she should provide the public with honest answers to all these questions.  The biggest question now is whether the funding will be available at all, irrespective of the site on which the hospital is to be built.  Is the funding secured or can it be secured?</p>
            <p eId="para_935">These questions should have been answered tonight by the Minister for Health and Children, who is responsible.  She went on the airwaves over the weekend and blustered on this.  She basically said: "I am the Minister, I am telling you it is going to happen and that will have to be good enough."  A Green Party Minister and Fianna Fáil Minister are present.  It should not be good enough for either of their parties to simply have the Minister for Health and Children say that.  This man was put in the position of chairing this group.  He is a person in whom I presume the Government had faith at the time.  He has now resigned and raised these substantial questions which were not answered in a transparent or effective way by the Minister for Health and Children over the weekend.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">I look forward to the Minister of State's reply, but this is not an adequate way of dealing with the issue.  The Minister for Health and Children has not been in the House to answer questions and there was no response from the Government today to provide for a proper question and answer session with the Minister to address this crucial issue for our children.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_586">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_937">No discourtesy is meant by my response to this important issue.  The Minister, Deputy Harney, has invested a huge amount of time, appropriately, in this very serious matter for sick children.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The Government's priority is to provide the best standard of complex hospital care for children here.  To further that priority the Government is fully committed to the construction of the new national paediatric hospital at the Mater Hospital site and to provide the associated ambulatory and urgent care centre at Tallaght Hospital.  This is an essential part of the overall development and it is expected to open at the end of 2013.  In late 2005 McKinsey and Company were engaged by the HSE to advise on the future strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services.  The resulting report, "Children's Health First", recommended that the new paediatric hospital should be located alongside a leading academic teaching hospital in Dublin.  The principle of location alongside a leading academic teaching hospital is in line with widespread international best practice and enjoys widespread support.  A joint task group, representative of the Department of Health and Children, the Office of Public Works and the HSE, was established in February 2006.  This task group had extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including the three existing paediatric hospitals, the three maternity hospitals and external experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The high level framework brief for the new hospital, prepared by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd., RKW, was completed in October 2008.  The RKW report was informed by clinical and architectural experts from major children's hospitals in Toronto, Philadelphia and Manchester.  The report includes a detailed assessment of capacity and concludes that the site adjoining the Mater Hospital can accommodate all the requirements of the new hospital and still allow expansion capacity beyond the year 2021.  The designs for the new children's hospital have demonstrated that the site at the Mater campus meets the requirements for children, young people and their families.  The Government decision to locate the new hospital on the Mater Hospital site is therefore based on the best possible expert advice and on internationally established best practice.  The decision has been widely welcomed and has recently been supported by the faculty of paediatrics of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">In addition, Dr. Ronnie Pollock of MPA Healthcare, London, was asked by the parents' group, the New Crumlin Hospital Group, whether the new hospital on the proposed site could provide the international standard of excellence in tertiary health care for children.  Dr. Pollock replied: "it most certainly can.  The synergy created by assembling some of the best clinical and research skills in the country on a single site will create the environment for Ireland to progress further in international standing with measurable benefits for children and adults."  While the debate around location has been re-opened in recent weeks, the case for locating the hospital alongside a major acute adult facility remains unchanged.  Whereas it may be possible to build the hospital somewhere more cheaply on a greenfield site, this once-off saving would be offset by higher running costs every year.  The Mater Hospital site offers economies of scale and scope for shared services that cannot be achieved in such an undeveloped location.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">In this regard the HSE has estimated that the cost of building the hospital to the same specification on a greenfield site would be in the region of €549 million whereas the cost of construction on the Mater Hospital site is estimated at €600 million.  Both amounts exclude the cost of the ambulatory and urgent care centre at Tallaght.  However, it must be borne in mind that the projected amount of €51 million would be a once-off saving.  The savings derived each year from efficiencies delivered by shared services and economies of scale which would be available at the Mater Hospital site would not be available on the stand-alone site.  It is estimated that a decision to move to a greenfield site could further delay the development by up to two years.  The Minister does not believe that such a delay is warranted or justified.  It is clear, therefore, that there is no good reason for changing a decision that was very carefully reached.  It would risk delaying the project considerably and there would be serious disadvantages if the hospital were built on a stand-alone site.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Minister established the national paediatric hospital development board in May 2007.  Mr. Philip Lynch was appointed as chairman to the board.  Mr. Lynch accepted appointment as chairman in the full knowledge that the location had been decided upon and that the function of the development board was to plan, design, build, furnish and equip the new national children's hospital on the Mater Hospital site.  The Minister reluctantly asked for Mr. Lynch's resignation when it became clear that he could not accept the Government's position on the location of the hospital.  Mr. John Gallagher, the new chairman of the national paediatric hospital development board, has experience and expertise in the areas of project delivery and philanthropic funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The board will now press ahead with work on the development.  It commenced the planning process for the hospital directly with An Bord Pleanála on 11 October 2010.  The planning process is proceeding under the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010.  The Minister believes this new Act has helped to streamline the process, by a direct referral to An Bord Pleanála.  The estimated completion date for construction of the hospital is the last quarter of 2014.  The Minister has asked the HSE to ensure that the fit out and commissioning of the hospital takes place as soon as possible after this.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">The current estimate of the construction cost for the entire project is €650 million.  This is a significant reduction on earlier estimates.  The hospital will be funded from a total of €400 million from the taxpayer; €50 million from the HSE for the ambulatory and urgent care centre in Tallaght Hospital; €90 million in respect of car park, research, education and other elements; and €110 million from philanthropic funding.  While challenging, the philanthropic element is considered to be a realistic sum for a project of this size.  It is a statutory function of the national paediatric hospital development board to develop sources of philanthropic funding, and it has been working on this issue for some time.  The Minister is confident that we will meet our objective of providing a world class paediatric service for our children in the new national paediatric hospital.</p>

          <heading>Fishing Vessel Licences</heading>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_587">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_945">Since 1 October 2010 all 15 m to 24 m vessels must have a fishing vessel safety certificate, FVSC, to continue fishing.  To obtain such a certificate, a vessel must undergo the code of practice survey with the marine survey office, MSO.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The initial cost of the survey is €100 per metre.  That is a minimum cost of €1,500 and a maximum cost of €2,400.  To complete the inclination stability portion of the survey the majority of vessels would have to engage the services of a naval architect, the cost of which is between €2,000 and €3,000.  In addition, vessel owners are usually given a list of works to be carried out on their vessel and the current experience is that the cost of these works varies from €20,000 to €100,000.  There are 99 vessels in the Irish fleet of 15 m to 24 m aged more than ten years which would be required to undergo the process outlined to obtain a fishing vessel safety certificate.  Of these 99 vessels, only 63 had applied for the survey at the end of September.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Up to date figures were requested from the MSO and the licensing section of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The MSO advised that there were 89 vessels in the 15 m to 24 m category which had obtained either final or interim certificates.  However, this figure includes less than ten-year old vessels that would have undergone the survey last year.  No breakdown of the numbers in the under ten-year category and over ten-year category was forthcoming.  It also advises that 43 vessels still undergoing the survey process have not received a certificate and they are tied up.  No updated figure was provided regarding vessels due to undergo the survey but whose owners did not apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The owners of 36 vessels did not apply for the survey and for the majority the reason they did not apply was their vessel would not have been capable of passing the survey, regardless of the works carried out on it, or they were unable to obtain the finance necessary to complete the survey process.  These vessels have been tied up and their crews face the unemployment offices.  The Irish Fish Producers Organisation estimates that 200 jobs have been lost as the 36 vessels referred to have had to cease fishing and their crews are now unemployed.  Temporary job losses are related to the vessels undergoing the survey but which have not completed a significant portion of the work and, therefore, do not have a fishing vessel safety certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">I received a letter from a fisherman from Fenit, County Kerry, who was fishing on a 23 m trawler out of that port.  He confirmed that he and many other trawler owners along the coast had been tied up since 1 October because their fishing licences will not be issued until they comply with a certificate of competency, COC, the Minister introduced three years ago.  According to this fisherman, up to 300 fishermen are out of work with no income because they are self-employed and, therefore, not entitled to social welfare.  There is also a threat to many onshore jobs in the fishing industry.  He said large sums need to be spent in order that the oldest boats comply and because there is no access to finance through the banks, the owners cannot carry out this work.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">He asks that the Minister provide a temporary certificate until a full survey is carried out.  Fisherman are more safety conscious nowadays than they were in the past and they have no intention of going to sea to risk their own lives or those of their crew.  There is no question of negligence involved in this problem; it is a matter for expediency to allow them to fish coming up to Christmas.  The MSO does not have sufficient staff to survey the boats in question anyway and it will take them some time to get around.  We do not have sufficient dry dock facilities to examine these boats either.  Will the Minister of State convey to the Minister that the solution to this matter is to issue temporary safety certificates?</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_588" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_951">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport.  I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, which relates to the Merchant Shipping (Safety of Fishing Vessels) (15-24 Metres) Regulations 2007.  We can all recall the devastation caused by the fishing vessel tragedies in 2007.  In one weekend three fishing vessels sank with the loss of seven fishermen.  In total during 2007, 12 fishermen lost their lives in fishing vessels.  Each of these was traumatic for the families involved and the devastation for them continues to this day.  We had to take action to ensure the safety of fishing vessels and their crews because of these tragedies and the public outcry about poor safety in the fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The development of these safety regulations for fishing vessels dates back to the fishing vessel safety review group, which reported in 1996.  This group was established against the background of concerns about the safety of fishing vessels and their crews.  One key recommendation made by that group was for the establishment of a safety regime for fishing vessels covering stability, strength, hull and machinery.  Such a scheme was introduced in 1999 for fishing vessels greater than 24 m and a further scheme was introduced for fishing vessels shorter than 15 m in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">Following several fishing vessel tragedies in 2007, efforts focused on the development of such a scheme for the fishing vessels in the 15 m to 24 m category.  The Department of Transport developed regulations for these vessels based on international standards and these regulations were subject to extensive public consultations, following which, the regulations entered into force in September of that year.  Fishing vessels within the scope of the regulations are required to undergo a survey and to be issued with a fishing vessel safety certificate.  The regulations were implemented on a phased basis and came into operation as follows: on 1 October 2007, for new vessels; on 1 October 2008, for existing vessels the keel of which was laid or which was at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 1997; on 1 October 2009, for existing vessels the keel of which was laid or which was at a similar stage of construction on or after 1 October 1987; and on 1 October 2010, for existing vessels the keel of which was laid or which was at a similar stage of construction before 1 October 1987.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The Department of Transport engaged extensively with those in the fishing industry to inform them of the regulations.  We held regular meetings with industry representatives after the regulations came into force in 2007 and the MSO provided regional seminars to inform fishing vessel operators of the requirements.  The office continues to work with the fishing vessel owners in connection with them achieving compliance for their vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">To date, a total of 91 vessels in the 15 m to 24 m range have been issued or have been cleared to be issued with a certificate.  The MSO continues to issue interim certification to fishing vessels that have successfully met the minimum construction, stability and safety equipment requirements but which have not completely fulfilled all the other requirements of the regulations.  This has enabled the owners of such vessels to continue fishing and to schedule the work for full compliance in agreement with the MSO.  In addition, there are approximately 40 fishing vessels whose owners have contacted the Department and whose vessels have yet to complete the survey.  These are at varying stages of completion.  A number of these will shortly be issued with certificates of clearance to operate.  However, a number have been found to have serious safety deficiencies that pose an immediate risk to the safety of the vessel and to the crew.  These cannot be issued with a certificate until such deficiencies have been rectified.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The MSO also estimates that a further 20 vessel owners in this category have not made contact with the office regarding arranging the necessary survey.  In these cases such vessels cannot be issued with a certificate.  The office works closely with the sea fisheries administration, SFA, of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as the SFA under legislation cannot issue a commercial fishing licence to a vessel that does not comply with the safety regulations.  Fast-track procedures are in place so that as soon as a vessel reaches compliant status, the SFA is informed by the Marine Survey Office, thus enabling the fishing vessel licensing process to be initiated in tandem with the process for the issue of the certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">The introduction of these regulations formed an important part of the Department's programme to improve maritime safety and in particular to reduce the number of deaths and injuries in the fishing industry, which have in the past so seriously affected our coastal communities. The 15 m to 24 m segment of the fleet is the final segment of the fishing vessel fleet to be brought under a safety survey regime.  I, therefore, encourage any vessel owner who has yet to apply to do so now and to engage with the MSO on progressing his or her vessel towards compliance.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_589">
            <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_958">I raise this issue because of the statement made in an interview in the German newspaper, <i>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</i>, today by Michael O’Leary, the chief executive officer of Ryanair, that he expects the Government to sell its 25% stake in Aer Lingus to his company.  While this is alarming, the manner in which he made this statement is even more alarming because inherent in it is a presumption that the Government needs money and it is only a matter of him waiting before the stake falls into his hands.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The danger is that such a takeover would create a monopoly in the Irish aviation industry with Ryanair and Aer Lingus combined having 80% of the air traffic.  This would be an unacceptable state of affairs as regards competition.  It would be a disaster for the Irish consumer because the monopoly would immediately begin to exercise its muscle and the consumer would suffer.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">This is an island nation and connectivity is essential for trade, travel and tourism.  A monopoly would eliminate that competition and leave the country at the mercy of Ryanair's policies and shareholders.  We have seen how ruthless Ryanair can be when it comes to implementing its policy and getting a dividend for its shareholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Last year, Ryanair made a derisory offer of €188 million for the Aer Lingus stake.  This is all Ryanair was prepared to offer in 2009 for a 25% stake.  It is clear that Mr. Michael O'Leary is still thinking of acquiring Aer Lingus for a bargain basement price.  Given the exigencies of the budgetary situation, the fact that the economy is in dire straits and the Government desperately needs money, the State might dispose of some of the national assets or part of the private asset in the possession of the State.  We must be very careful when dealing with this issue because we have seen what has happened in the financial institutions when we relied entirely on the private banking sector.  We saw very quickly that greed took over and the national interest did not loom at all on the horizon.  We must be very careful with the disposal of the State's share in this sector because it is the only way we can protect the national interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Aer Lingus has shown quite healthy and robust progress this year.  The last quarter results surprised the market with better than expected profits.  It is expected that Aer Lingus could make a profit of anything between €40 million and €50 million this year.  It has been very effective and creative in its activities.  It is looking for niche markets, especially in the area of transfer of passengers.  Ireland is the only country in Europe with US immigration control rights at the point of departure as distinct from destination which is remarkably attractive to transatlantic passengers.  It has linked up successfully with United Airlines and is doing well on the transatlantic routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The European Union has determined that such a takeover would be anti-competitive and would create a monopoly of 80% of air traffic which would not be regarded as complying with European directives.  The State and the other stakeholders, including the employee share ownership trust, ESOT, have previously rejected an application from Ryanair.  On this occasion, the Government should categorically state once and for all its position on the matter and assure the House that it will not sell the 25% stake which would allow Ryanair to take absolute control given that it currently owns 29.88% of the company.</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_590" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
            <from>Deputy Ciarán Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_964">I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, and I thank Deputy Costello for raising this matter on the Adjournment.  I note Deputy Costello has drawn attention to Mr. Michael O'Leary's statement in the German press this morning but I learned long ago that it is important to take his statements with a large pinch, if not a pillar, of salt.  That said, I have great admiration for his success in reducing carbon emissions per passenger kilometre within the airline industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">The Government's aviation strategy is to promote regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets.  Promoting competition among airlines serving the Irish market has been the cornerstone of this strategy for many years.  It has been proved that supporting competition and choice is in the best interests of consumers and the Irish economy.  This policy has served Ireland well since the European air transport market was fully liberalised in the early 1990s.  The success of the Government's pro-competition policies in the air transport market was demonstrated by the dramatic increase in the number of services into and out of Ireland and the rapid growth in passenger numbers over a 15-year period until the global recession hit the industry hard in 2008 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">The sector continues to respond to the dramatic fall-off in consumer demand for discretionary air travel.  The two main Irish carriers, Aer Lingus and Ryanair, have taken the necessary steps to match carefully capacity with demand and have sought to reduce operating costs wherever possible.  While this strategy has seen the reduction in capacity and services on certain routes, the Minister for Transport is hopeful that the long-term future of the Irish airline sector is secure and that growth in services and capacity will return when genuine seasonal demand warrants redeployment of airline capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">The Government wants to see a competitive dynamic maintained in the air transport market.  To this end, it wants to see the continued presence of at least two strong competing airlines serving our air transport needs, both in the short-haul and long-haul markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">In privatising Aer Lingus in 2006, the Government decided to retain a significant minority shareholding of 25% to protect our strategic aviation interests, particularly the company's valuable slot portfolio at London's Heathrow Airport.  This policy has not changed and there has been no recent consideration of any change to that policy.  The Government used its shareholding in Aer Lingus to block the attempted takeover of Aer Lingus by Ryanair in 2007 and again in 2008, primarily on the grounds that our competition concerns were not being addressed in the takeover proposals.  Earlier this year, the European General Court delivered its judgment in an appeal by Ryanair against the European Commission's prohibition of its takeover of Aer Lingus in 2007.  The court upheld the Commission's decision and noted that none of the arguments put forward by Ryanair was capable of calling into question the Commission's finding that the proposed merger would significantly impede effective competition.  The Government welcomed this judgment of the European Court.  In the absence of a satisfactory competition remedies package, the merger of the two largest airlines in the Irish air transport market would have had a significant detrimental effect on competition and consumer choice, with negative long-term consequences for Irish aviation.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">As an island nation on the western fringes of Europe, international air links are of much greater importance for Ireland than for countries with land transport connections to their neighbours and trading partners.  As a relatively small country and despite the ongoing recession, the Irish air transport market continues to enjoy a disproportionately high level of international air services.  The Minister for Transport believes competition in the airline industry is the main factor underpinning this level of connectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">The aviation sector has always been cyclical in nature and is also especially susceptible to external shocks.  In the last decade or so the global airline industry has been significantly affected by events such as the September 2001 terrorist attacks, the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the record peak in oil prices in 2008.  The current recession is the latest crisis to hit the sector which, historically, has had low profitability.  The Irish airline sector in particular, however, has shown remarkable resilience in the face of these challenges over the years.  Irish airlines have repeatedly demonstrated innovation and flexibility in response to changing circumstances and, for this reason, the Minister for Transport is confident the sector will play a very important part in our economic recovery in the years ahead.  For its part, the Government will continue to facilitate the development of as wide a range as possible of competitive air services for the benefit of Irish business and tourism and will continue to foster effective competition among all airlines operating in the Irish market.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_972">All interest accruing on the Becbay loans for which the Dublin Docklands Development Authority was liable was fully paid up to the end of 2008.  According to the Authority's 2009 Annual Report and Accounts, the Authority's liability arising from its participation in the Becbay joint venture company at the end of 2009 comprised a principal guarantee of €29.1 million on its 26% share of the loans and €4.8m interest accrued on its share of the loans for 2009, leaving a total liability of some €34 million.  Interest continues to accrue at a rate of some €4.8m per annum until such time as the loan is discharged.  The Becbay loans have now transferred to the National Assets Management Agency and I understand that NAMA is considering detailed business plans submitted by all Becbay parties in relation to resolution of its outstanding debts.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">In relation to the Authority's financial position, while the Authority posted an operating deficit for 2009, it has taken a broad range of measures to re-examine and prioritise all expenditure within the organisation.  For example, staffing in the Authority has been reduced from 55 in January 2009 to 27 currently, which has led to a significant reduction in the payroll bill.  Moreover, the number of social regeneration projects has been reduced and the Authority is focusing on managing existing programmes and projects to maintain momentum and progress made in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">As with many other companies with significant property portfolios, the future operating performance of the Authority will be affected by the broader economic, financial and business conditions, many of which are beyond the control of the Authority.  The Authority is in ongoing discussion with my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to plans to restore its finances to a more robust position.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_976">It is open to any person or household to apply to a housing authority for an assessment of their housing need.  The application process is the gateway to a broad range of social housing supports provided by housing authorities.  The number of households that apply for social housing support from housing authorities continuously fluctuates as new households apply for housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">Under existing legislation, households can apply to multiple authorities which can result, therefore, in an application from the same household being processed by several authorities.  In addition, households that have been in receipt of rent supplement for longer than 18 months do not always apply to the housing authority in order to receive social housing accommodation.  My Department does not hold real time information on the number of persons or households that apply to housing authorities.  The last statutory needs assessment in 2008 indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">The social housing reform programme, which was given legislative effect by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, provides for a new process of housing needs assessment.  Regulations will be made shortly to give detailed effect to the provisions of the Act.  In an effort to standardise and bring about greater efficiency in the assessment process, the regulations will provide for a single application (that is a person or household may only apply once to one housing authority) in order to access social housing support.  The regulations will also require that those in receipt of rent supplement for longer than 18 months will have to undergo the housing needs assessment process in order to be eligible for social housing support.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">All of these changes to the current assessment system are being designed with a view to being able to carry out a statutory assessment in 2011 which will give a clearer picture of both the demand and need for social housing support.</p>

            <p eId="para_981">Information in relation to vacant local authority houses is a Local Authority Service Indicator and reports on these indicators are available on the Local Government Management Agency's website. The latest available figures relate to 2008 and report a significant decrease in the level of local authority housing stock that is vacant. The 2008 report shows that a total of 3,859 dwellings were empty, excluding those that were subject to major refurbishment programmes. This represents 3.2% of the total stock of 122,446 dwellings. The 2007 report showed that some 5,090 units were vacant out of a total stock of 118,276.  Therefore there has been a decrease of 1,231 vacant units on the 2007 total — a 24% improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">I would point out that the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for individual authorities under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 and my Department has no direct responsibility for this issue.  To assist local authorities in determining measures for further improvement in their housing stock, the Local Government Audit Service is finalising a Value for Money study on housing management and maintenance, which will include specific recommendations on how best practice can be achieved in relation to vacant stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">In addition, my Department has provided a fund of €40 million under the Social Housing Investment Programme in 2010, to co-fund the retrofitting of vacant properties, both casual and planned, across local authority housing stock. Having regard to the rapid decline in local authority Internal Capital Receipts, amendments to the terms of the scheme in 2010 have included the reduction of the co-funding contribution required from within authorities own resources and a recent provision to allow local authorities to claim for higher costs in respect of works undertaken to longer term voids, to support authorities efforts to bring such stock back into viable use to meet housing needs.  These retrofitting provisions will continue to have a positive impact on the ability of local authorities to deal with vacant stock.</p>

            <p eId="para_986">I propose to take Questions Nos. 72 and 117 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">The  role of my Department during a severe weather event is to ensure that the local authorities are prepared to respond promptly to ameliorate the worst effects in relation to those aspects of an emergency for which they have direct responsibility, and that they act in co-operation with the other principal response agencies — An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive — using the Major Emergency Management Framework as appropriate, and with the voluntary agencies and the Defence Forces to limit the effects on individuals whose lives may be put at risk or who may be exposed to serious hardship. When effective emergency plans are in place, the management of the emergency response then falls to the local authorities and the other response agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">Under the Framework, the local and/or regional coordination centres may be activated to manage the response to a severe weather event, whether a major emergency is declared or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">My Department has overseen a development programme involving local authorities and the other principal response agencies to enable them to use the Framework structures effectively to manage the response to emergencies. During the two severe weather events of last winter the coordination and inter-agency arrangements set out in the Framework were implemented at local and regional level, as required by local circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">The National Steering Group on the Framework for Emergency Management, which is chaired by my Department, undertook a review of the operation of the major emergency planning procedures and sought the views of participants in the response on matters which could be improved for future such events. It established that the arrangements set out in the Framework were fit for purpose and operated satisfactorily where used by local authorities (with their partner agencies) to manage the impact of both the flood and severe cold emergencies. However, some suggested changes and further development of operational matters are being implemented in association with the Framework's regional structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">It has been widely recognised that the local authorities and the other agencies discharged their responsibilities in a commendable way and I have every confidence that they will continue to respond to such events in a like manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_994">I propose to take Questions Nos. 73 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">Ireland signed the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on 25 June 1998.  Progress towards ratification of the Convention is closely aligned with work at EU level and, in that context, the European Union has adopted two Directives as part of the ratification process for the Convention.  These Directives deal with public access to environmental information and public participation in certain environmental decision-making procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The European Communities (Access to Information on the Environment) Regulations 2007 came into effect on 1 May 2007.  These Regulations transpose the Directive on public access to environmental information.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Several new pieces of legislation have been necessary to transpose the Public Participation Directive and these have been completed over a number of years.  The judgment of the European Court of Justice against Ireland in case C427/07, concerning non-notification of the Public Participation Directive, also necessitated additional legislative amendments, which have now been finalised and signed into law. These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_998">Section 33 of the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_999">the European Communities (Public Participation) Regulations 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">the Environmental Protection Agency (Amendment) Regulations 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_1001">the Waste Management (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2010; and</p>
            <p eId="para_1002">the Aquaculture (Licence Application) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The provision in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Act 2010 addresses the ruling of the ECJ in respect of the requirement that access to justice must not be prohibitively expensive. The four sets of Regulations impose a statutory obligation on the relevant public bodies to ensure that when decisions on consent systems subject to the Public Participation Directive, such as decisions on IPPC licences and certain planning matters, are taken, practical information on how such decisions may be appealed is made available to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">These measures have been formally notified to the European Commission. Pending any further communication from the Commission, no additional transposition measures are foreseen as necessary to give effect to the Public Participation Directive at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">The effect of the measures undertaken to transpose the two Directives is that Ireland is largely compliant with the provisions of the Convention; although there are some outstanding issues to resolve in the context of the access to justice pillar. Ratification of the Convention is a matter of the highest priority and my Department is working closely with the Office of the Attorney General in order to finalise this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1007">Under the leasing initiative housing authorities can lease vacant and unsold affordable units to approved housing bodies where they feel that these units cannot be sold in the current market conditions.  During the lease period my Department recoups to the authority the interest payments liable in respect of the loans taken by the authority to fund the affordable property in the first instance.  My Department does not fund the repayment of the principal of the loan (i.e. the capital cost).</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">Lease agreements in respect of unsold affordable units must not exceed 5 years. At the end of the lease agreement the authority must review the arrangement and make a determination about its future use. The authority then has a number of courses available to it, including sale on the open market, or to those eligible for affordable housing or incremental purchase or taking the units into social stock.  It is hoped that many of these properties would be viable for sale at this point and therefore the capital monies can be repaid from the proceeds of the sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">It is a matter for the relevant local authority, where it has engaged an approved housing body in the process of letting unsold affordable housing units, to negotiate payment terms directly with the approved housing body concerned. However, in most lease agreements the approved housing body pays the local authority a nominal fee and the body collects and retains the differential rent from the tenant to support their costs in managing and maintaining the dwelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">In 2009, €20 million was made available for use under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative (SHLI). By the end of December 2009 just over €642,178 had been recouped. In 2010 a further €25 million was made available for the leasing initiative of which, €2,365,158 had been drawn down by the end of September 2010. However, my Department would anticipate that activity and expenditure patterns under the leasing initiative will increase over the final quarter to compensate somewhat for the slower than expected progress during the year to date.</p>

            <p eId="para_1012">The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes   was published in July 2009 and, since then, its recommendations have provided an important input to Government and Ministerial consideration of options for expenditure reduction.    As far as my own Department is concerned, expenditure provisions for 2010 are set out in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2010   published by the Minister for Finance.  These amount to €2.195 billion, compared to an outturn of €2.674 billion in 2009. They were determined in the context of the overall provision for public services, reflect the need to reduce public spending and, as indicated by the Minister for Finance in his Financial Statement on 9 December 2009, were guided by the Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">My Department, local authorities and related agencies are working to maximise outputs from the 2010 provisions through prioritisation, increased efficiency and lower procurement costs generally.   Recommendations in the Report relating to my Department are reflected, <i>inter alia</i>  , in savings in administrative costs arising from reductions in public service numbers and pay; the reduced Exchequer contribution to the Local Government Fund (€226 million in 2010, in the context of wider developments relating to local government finance); the review of the EPA which is underway; the ongoing rationalisation of agencies in the housing area; and more extensive use of leasing to ensure overall housing output is maintained at the highest level possible.  The Report will continue to be taken into account in the development of policy and the management of programmes by my Department. Consistent with the approach of the Special Group, the Report of the Local Government Efficiency Review Group  , published in mid-July, includes recommendations for efficiency and other savings in the local government sector.  These will be considered by Government in the appropriate policy and financial contexts.  I propose to establish an implementation group with an independent chairperson to oversee implementation of relevant recommendations.</p>

It should also be noted that a significant element of the staffing costs was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the Home Choice Loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of standard local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as tenant purchase, affordable housing, shared ownership etc.</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">The Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to the establishment of an independent Electoral Commission.  The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and identifies a range of responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">An independent Electoral Commission will require new legislation for purposes of its establishment and to transfer to it a range of roles and responsibilities including those assigned to the Standards in Public Office Commission in electoral law, the roles and responsibilities of the Constituency Commission and roles and responsibilities currently assigned to me as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  This will involve changes to over 20 primary acts and to the associated regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Towards implementing the Programme for Government commitments, and to assist in consideration of the issues involved, I commissioned a report by an expert group from University College Dublin.  I published the report, entitled A Preliminary Study on the Establishment of an Electoral Commission in Ireland, for consultation in February 2009. The UCD study recommends that an Electoral Commission should be established through the enactment of an Electoral Commission Act, which would amend and consolidate the law relating to referendums and elections to local authorities, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the European Parliament, Dáil Éireann, Seanad Éireann and the office of President of Ireland.  This is a major task and it is part of our considerations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Many of the electoral reform issues that will come within the remit of an Electoral Commission were considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution, which published its report on the electoral system in July 2010.

            <p eId="para_1029">I am currently giving consideration to the approaches that are to be taken to implement the Programme for Government commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_1033">From 2004 to 2009 my Department had an interim role in the management of this legacy site in a manner which is consistent with good practice and minimisation of risk to human health and the environment. Accordingly, my Department arranged for the decontamination and demolition of the buildings on site and, post-demolition, arranged for the procurement of a contractor for site surface clearance, back filling of voids and the disposal of the remaining surface wastes to be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">Examples of waste types removed include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">over 10,000 tonnes of scrap metal;</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">over 1,100 tonnes of hazardous dust vacuumed from the steelworks buildings before demolition;</p>

            <p eId="para_1038">millscale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1039">To date the State has expended some €50 million on investigations, site works, disposal of waste material, testing and sampling, analysis, topographical and foreshore ecological surveys, project management, professional fees and security.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">In June 2009, the Government decided that the Office of Public Works would chair a working group to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the former Irish Ispat site, and to advise on the site's most beneficial future use.  Consideration of the regulatory requirements relevant to the site falls within the Terms of Reference of the OPW — led Working Group. The future use of the site will in itself influence the levels and extent of further works and/or remediation required.</p>

            <p eId="para_1044">My Department is finalising proposals to give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce charges for water services in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. The proposals include the approach to be taken to the installation of water meters in households connected to public water supplies and to the development of a pricing structure for domestic water services, they will also address the arrangements for the collection of water charges. I will provide further details on these matters following their final approval by Government. My Department has been in regular contact with the Department of Finance, and with other Government Departments, during the development of these proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The installation of water meters in households connected to public supplies will encourage householders to conserve water and will result in savings in the significant operational costs faced by local authorities in providing water and waste water services. It will also complement the significant increases in investment on water conservation measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012 which I announced earlier this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1047">Following the Government decision not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland, an Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, was established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the Task Force has met five times, with its most recent meeting taking place in June 2010.  Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the Task Force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.  The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose. It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1054">In May 2010, the Government confirmed the end of the 10 year derogation allowing a continuation of turf-cutting on raised bogs designated as Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Natural Heritage Areas (NHAs). The Government also established an Interim Compensation Scheme to compensate those who have been cutting turf on the 31 raised bogs sites designated in or before 1999.  Some 233 valid applications were received for the €1,000 interim payment.  To date, 105 of these have been paid and the remainder are being assessed to confirm whether the individuals qualify. The expenditure will not exceed €233,000 this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">The bogs affected by the end of the derogation are limited to raised bogs designated for protection as SACs or NHAs. In area, these make up just over 4% of bogland in the State where turf-extraction is feasible. Blanket bogs, which are far bigger in area and occur in uplands and along the western seaboard, are not affected by these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The Inter-Departmental Working Group that I established to examine the modalities of the cessation of turf cutting in designated raised bogs reported on  financial implications of various options. Full details of this analysis were published in the Working Group's report of May 2010. I understand the Deputy has a copy of this report and analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">I am currently considering the long-term financial commitment required  successfully to ensure the protection of all 130 designated raised bog sites and I intend to bring further proposals to Government in this regard.</p>

As of now, there are approximately 640 affordable units available for sale or transfer.   While the sale of these units remains the preferred outcome, local authorities continue to have available to them a range of options to bring these units into effective use and are supported in this regard by my Department and the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1163">I have no immediate plans to introduce a general rent-to-buy scheme across all local authorities because I do not believe such a scheme is needed in areas where there are only very small numbers of unsold units on hand. However, Dublin City Council, following approval by my Department, has recently launched a pilot scheme of "Rent to Buy" for a number of unsold affordable homes in three developments in Dublin City. I have asked Dublin City Council to prepare and submit a report on the operation of the pilot before the end of this year. This pilot will be reviewed before deciding whether it is appropriate to make such a scheme available in any other local authorities where there are significant numbers of unsold affordable homes.

            <p eId="para_1169">My Department currently supports an ambitious programme of regeneration projects to deliver integrated physical, social and economic regeneration, ranging from large-scale urban regeneration projects such as Ballymun and Limerick City to smaller estate regeneration projects in a number of regional towns around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1170">This year, my Department is providing some €126.8 million to support this important national regeneration programme, an increase of over 18% on the €107.1 million spent in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1171">Regardless of the size and complexity of regeneration projects, each one requires the development of a masterplan for delivering the regeneration which generally provides for social inclusion interventions, a planned mix of public and private investment in housing stock and measures to address any deficits in local transport infrastructure or community/recreational facilities. The Masterplan process is ongoing for two of the projects included in the programme, Cranmore Estate, Sligo and Cox's Demense, Dundalk.</p>

            <p eId="para_1263">It is a matter for each Water Services Authority to consider what wastewater treatment works need to be undertaken in their areas. Water Services Authorities were asked in July 2009 to submit an assessment of needs for water and sewerage services to my Department by 23 October 2009. In preparing these assessments, water services authorities were required to take into consideration key environmental and economic criteria in prioritising contracts and schemes to be progressed in their areas. These assessments were a key input to the development of my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which I published in April 2010 and a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">The Programme sets out the location and estimated cost of water and wastewater contracts envisaged over the period 2010-2012, together with further schemes to be advanced through planning stages. The timing of the commencement of contracts within that period is a matter for the Water Services Authorities subject to the need for my Department's approval at key stages in the progression of projects through planning and on to construction.  Details on the progression of individual contracts can be obtained from the local authorities involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Investment under the Water Services Investment Programme is complemented by investment annually under the Rural Water Programme — a largely devolved programme of investment in relatively smaller water services schemes and the group water sector. The 2010 Estimates provision for water services infrastructure is €508 million, of which €415 million is available under the Water Services Investment Programme and €93 million under the Rural Water Programme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment; Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_1277">Under a programme established in 2009 to improve the energy efficiency of local authority social housing units, my Department approved energy efficiency improvement works to some 1,155 vacant units across the country with a view to achieving a high standard of Building Energy Rating [BER] of at least C1, where practicable.  Although the scheme only commenced in Autumn 2009, by year end my Department had recouped almost €11 million to authorities across the country for some 900 improved units, with the balance being delivered in 2010.  Of these improved units, 48% achieved a BER standard of C1 or better and 12% achieved a C2 or C3 standard. Where units achieved a lesser standard, my Department contributed only 50% of the cost of the works, up to a maximum grant of €15,000. This retrofit programme has been significantly expanded in 2010 with a total funding provision of €40 million and additional technical guidance has been developed to support authorities in providing cost optimal energy efficiency measures for their social housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed by regulations made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992.  These standards were significantly updated in December 2008 via the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008.  Further measures to update, and more effectively enforce, the regulations required amendment of primary legislation and were addressed by the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  These elements included increased penalties for non-compliance and the introduction of a more robust sanctions regime.</p>
            <p eId="para_1279">Where a property is offered for letting, the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006 — 2008 require a landlord to produce a copy of the Building Energy Rating (BER) certificate and advisory report in relation to that property to any person who expresses any interest in availing of the letting.  The BER certificate and advisory report serve to enable prospective tenants to take the energy performance of a building into account when making decisions in relation to lettings and to compare in a standard format the energy performance of a range of buildings available to them. In this way it is intended that the BER system will promote greater awareness of energy efficiency in the property market and encourage building owners to take cost effective steps to improve the energy rating, and hence the overall energy performance, of such buildings.  Failure to obtain a BER certificate when required by the Regulations is an offence, which may lead to a prosecution and a fine of up to €5,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">I have no plans to specify a minimum BER rating as standard for private rented dwellings at this time. However, the matter is kept under review by my Department in the context of both strengthening the quality of the private rented sector and growing awareness of the energy performance of buildings.</p>

        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         the number of unsold affordable housing units where agreements have been signed and commenced under the social housing leasing initiative and the length of the lease period; the average monthly cost and the full-year cost of the leases; the number of these properties that achieved the expected 20% reduction as compared to market costs; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1309">In 2008, in the context of requirements relating to capital funding, my Department, following a competitive tendering process, commissioned Ernst and Young to carry out spot-checks on capital projects under construction in the period 2006 and 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">In general, the report found good performance in relation to procurement and that local authorities comply with the relevant guidelines. The report also found that, in a large number of cases where significant capital expenditure was involved, processes adopted by local authorities mirrored the formal appraisal guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">However, the report also records deficiencies in relation to formal appraisals and project briefs, and completion of documentation, as well as delayed submission of final accounts. In particular, the report identified 11 issues relating to appraisal and management of projects and made recommendations to accompany those findings. These included increased expenditure on a range of projects. However, the report also acknowledged that cost increases "were usually attributable to changes in the scope of works to be performed and "unforeseen circumstances".</p>
            <p eId="para_1312">In response to the report, my Department wrote to local authorities on 22 March 2010 emphasising the importance of adherence to the Capital Appraisal Guidelines. All project managers were asked to review current arrangements for the management of projects to assure themselves that they are being appraised, managed and monitored sufficiently in line with Department of Finance Guidelines, as well as with relevant Departmental circulars. As far as the specific programme areas are concerned, issues arising from the report are being taken forward by the relevant sections in my Department dealing directly with those areas. In addition, my Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance, is currently devising a training programme for local authority staff involved in capital projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1313">Applications by local authorities for additional funding to meet increased expenditure are considered by my Department in the course of work on projects or at final accounts stage. No additional funding is provided by my Department to meet increased expenditure unless it is satisfied that it is appropriate to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">New forms of contracts have been in place for construction projects since May 2008. The new contract arrangements are designed to achieve greater cost certainty and better value for money for the Exchequer. The key difference from the traditional approach to contracts is the transfer of all contract risks (other than archaeology) to the contractor, who prices for that risk in a fixed-price tender bid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">In 2000, the Review Body on Higher Remuneration in the Public Sector recommended the introduction of a performance related awards scheme for County and City Managers, Assistant City Managers and Directors of Service of local authorities. The scheme was introduced in 2003 and awards were made by the local government Committee for Performance Awards on the basis of achievement of approved objectives submitted in advance: it is not possible to attribute any portion of an award to any specific capital project. The scheme has now been suspended and no performance awards have been made since 2007.</p>

A recommendation that my Department conduct an investigation into the events surrounding the flooding of Cork City in November 2009 is contained therein. The report is being considered by my Department at present and I will make decisions in respect of those recommendations for which I have responsibility as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1550">In 2002, Ireland published its first National Biodiversity Plan. This Plan contained 91 actions, grouped under a number of themes, which reflected Ireland's commitment to the implementation of the objectives of the UN Convention on Biological Diversity. The overall objective of that Plan was to secure the conservation, including where possible the enhancement and sustainable use of biological diversity in Ireland, to contribute to conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity globally, and to advance other obligations of the Convention in the EU, regionally and internationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1551">An interim review of the plan was published in 2005, and included an independent review by Comhar, the Sustainable Development Council. The review showed substantial progress in most of the Plan's actions, indicating that 23 actions had been implemented with a further 60 showing implementation was ongoing; leaving 8 actions requiring further action. Some of the actions implemented exceeded their aims, while others, which were ongoing, showed substantial achievement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1552">A further review of progress on the actions is being undertaken as part of the input to the new National Biodiversity Plan 2010-2015. I intend to publish this latest review in conjunction with the new Plan in the near future. I have invited interested organisations and members of the public to make observations on the draft of the new plan, with a closing date of 22 October 2010 for submissions. The lessons learned from the experience to date on actions in the first National Biodiversity Plan have been an important consideration in preparing the new plan.</p>

        <b>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         the extent to which he has measured the total number of families on the various housing lists in local authorities here against the total number of houses vacant, completed or near completion in estates with a view to purchase by the local authorities through the local loans fund with a view to achieving nett savings when setting the annual cost of rent support against such expenditure; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1554">I am determined to ensure that the housing programme continues to be framed in a manner which optimises the delivery of social housing.  To achieve this, it is essential that we tailor the use of available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1555">To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded. For example, in 2009 I announced the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which it is expected that a substantial number of dwellings, including newly completed but not yet occupied dwellings, will be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs, matching up oversupply, where it exists, with existing housing need.  The leasing initiative, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector. In this context there will continue to be provision for the selective acquisition of completed properties by housing authorities and bodies, subject to available capital funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_1556">I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they continue to align oversupply of new housing, where it exists, with existing housing need, and that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.</p>

            <p eId="para_1568">As recommended by the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure separate programme funding for the work of the Ireland Newfoundland Partnership and the Active Citizenship Office ceased in 2009.  The separate Offices in these areas have been discontinued which has given rise to savings on my Department's Vote of approximately €308,000 per annum.  The National Forum on Europe was closed in 2009 which also gave rise to savings of €515,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1569">In addition there has been significant savings in the National Economic and Social Development Office. The Government considered the role of the Office in the context of the report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes and the recommendations of a Value-for-Money review of the Office carried out in my Department. These took account of the evolution of policy and programmes since the various bodies were established, not least the increase in the sources of policy analysis and commentary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1570">On 1st April 2010, an Order was made under Section 34 of the National Economic and Social Development Office Act 2006, which dissolved the National Economic and Social Forum (NESF) and the National Centre for Partnership and Performance (NCPP).   As a result of this rationalisation, the budget for NESDO in 2010 was reduced by 34% from €5.059 million to €3.332 million, with potential for further administrative savings once the restructuring is implemented, of approximately €530,000 for a twelve month period.  With the dissolution of the NESF and the NCPP, there have been savings on the cost of the accommodation required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1571">The CSO are implementing the recommendations of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure and are achieving the Special Groups savings targets.  The restructuring savings are being achieved by a range of initiatives including a new organisation structure, consolidation of facilities management and re-engineering of business surveys.</p>
            <p eId="para_1572">The report recommends reducing the Census 2011 costs.  Savings will arise primarily in 2011 and will be achieved by a range of actions including reduction in administration, advertising and field collection costs.  These planned savings on the Census cost will be incorporated into the CSO 2011 estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_1573">The McCarthy Group recommended that the Law Reform Commission, which is funded through the Vote of the Attorney General, be discontinued and that work on the Legislation Directory and on Statute Law Restatements currently undertaken by the Commission be transferred to the Office of the Attorney General, along with staff and relevant funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_1574">An alternative proposal from the Attorney General was subsequently accepted to the effect that the Commission's annual budget would be reduced by 33% and this recommendation has now been implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_1575">The report recommended that the Chief State Solicitors Office should seek further reductions in expert witness fees and professional fees.  The Office and the Department of Finance responded to these recommendations in framing the 2010 Estimate for the Office, which shows a €1.8m reduction over the 2009 Estimate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1576">In common with all Departments and Offices, there has already been a reduction in staff numbers arising from Government policies introduced.  In my Department the number of whole time equivalent staff employed has reduced by 10% since the end of 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1577">In summary, I can assure the House that my Department will make significant savings on expenditure in 2010, and that this process will be managed so as to minimise the disruption to the very valuable public services they provide.</p>

However, my Department was subsequently informed in March, 2009 by an Institute that one of the applicants included in its submission had withdrawn. Furthermore, following reconsideration by the Institute, it had decided to reduce the number of proposed voluntary early retirements from 16 to 8. Therefore, in consequence of this decision, the total number of active VER proposals received in my Department for the period in question was 22.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">Prior to 2009 the policy was that consideration would be given to proposals from Institutes of Technology for voluntary early retirement with added years of staff in instances where</p>

            <p eId="para_1665">the individual staff member would not be replaced thus reducing the Institute's overall staff complement.</p>

            <p eId="para_1672">As the Deputy will be aware, my colleague Minister O'Keeffe distributed €22.3m in capital funding to primary schools last November, with a specific focus on equipping classrooms with digital projectors, teaching computers and wireless mice and keyboards. Schools are asked to prioritise the deployment of these items in each classroom, and have been given access to national purchasing Frameworks to assist them in getting best value for money in their procurement.  I intend to build on this investment with further allocations to the post-primary and primary sectors shortly. Schools will continue to be asked to prioritise the deployment of digital projectors and teaching computers in each classroom. As and when each school completes this priority deployment, it is required to use any remaining grant balance on a second tier of priority ICT equipment categories including classroom computers, printers, scanners, networking equipment and so on.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">As the Deputy may be aware, the maintenance of ICT equipment inventories for individual schools is a matter for school boards of management themselves. My officials will be reviewing the need and focus for any further investment in this domain in the new year, in light of information to be provided by schools on their grant expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">Currently over 97% of all schools are availing of the Schools Broadband Service.  Of the remaining percentage 70 schools have opted out of the scheme and the remaining schools are awaiting installation in the coming months as part of the roll out of new broadband for schools contracts. The priority for the new procurement process was to ensure that the broadband services to schools kept in line with national infrastructure improvements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1675">Since commencement of the roll out of phase II in 2009 there has already been over a 50% increase in aggregate bandwidth usage, this is due to improved bandwidth speeds being made available to schools and the substantial reduction i.e. over 50% in the number of schools who are connected via satellite.   For those schools that remain reliant on satellite, where a wireless or DSL solution becomes available they will be migrated to the improved service as soon as is practicable.  In addition my Department in conjunction with the Department of Communications Energy and Natural Resources has connected 78 post primary schools in a pilot project with 100Mbp/s broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_1681">The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has statutory responsibility for advising on curriculum and assessment issues in early childhood, primary and second level school settings.  This advice is processed through the consultative structures of the NCCA, on which my Department, along with the State Examinations Commission and the partners in education are represented.  The following is the list of groups represented on the NCCA Leaving Certificate Gaeilge syllabus committee: Association of Secondary Teachers Ireland; Teachers' Union of Ireland; Irish Universities Association; Joint Managerial Body; Association of Community and Comprehensive Schools; Irish Vocational Education Association; Higher Education and Training Awards Council; Comhar na Múinteoirí Gaeilge; An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta; Foras na Gaeilge; State Examinations Commission; Department of Education and Skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">Circular 20/2010 informs schools of the  prescribed prose and poetry which will apply for the Leaving Certificate Examinations in Gaeilge in 2012, 2013 and 2014. The material included reflects the recommendations of the NCCA which were transmitted to my Department by the Council following the course committee's deliberations.  It is not the practice of my Department to meet NCCA course committees, given that my Department has a representative on them, and that the ensuing advice is transmitted formally to my Department by the Council. My Department engages with the NCCA on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1683">A revised syllabus in Leaving Certificate Irish has begun in all schools in September 2010, for first examination in 2012. As announced in 2007, the proportion of marks available for oral assessment will increase in the 2012 examinations to 40%. The objective is to promote a significant shift in emphasis towards Irish as a spoken language, where students can communicate and interact in a spontaneous way, and where Irish is spoken every day in schools.  In order to ensure optimum time and space for increased oral interaction in the classroom, and to allow for an increase of 15% in the marks for oral assessment, the volume of literature in the revised syllabus at higher level in the Leaving Certificate has been reduced on the advice of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and the study of the history of the language as a separate item has been incorporated into the teaching of literature.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">Some concerns have been raised that this change will result in the  revised syllabus presenting insufficient challenge for students with a high proficiency in Irish, particularly in Gaeltacht and Irish medium schools, and that it is insufficient to maintain a rich speech and writing culture.  The revised syllabus is being implemented as planned. However, I have asked the NCCA to review the implementation of the programme in the light of the issues raised and the experiences of the first cohort of candidates under the revised assessment system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1692">The Summer Works Scheme (SWS) was introduced in 2004 to provide devolved funding to individual school authorities to undertake small scale building works which can be carried out during the summer months or at other times that avoid disrupting the operation of the school. Since then, thousands of projects such as gas works, electrical and mechanical works, roof replacements and repairs, windows replacement, toilet upgrades, structural improvements and access improvement works have been completed in schools.  A key principle behind this Scheme is that responsibility for the management of the project is devolved to the school authority. The school authority can make use of its local knowledge and presence on the ground to manage the project more effectively and ensure better value for money for the taxpayer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">Under summer works 2009 a total of 123 primary schools and 103 post primary schools in the Dublin area were allocated funding in the amounts of €16.9m and €22.8m respectively. 213 projects are practically complete and the Department is expecting notification of having reached practical completion from the school authorities of the remaining 13 projects shortly.  Under summer works 2010 a total of 181 primary schools and 104 post primary schools in the Dublin area were allocated funding in the amounts of €20.7m and €15.5m respectively. To date my Department has received notification from the school authorities that 78 projects are practically complete, 174 projects are ongoing and 33 projects are envisaged to advance on site shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1717">The school transport scheme, which is operated by Bus Éireann on my Department's behalf, facilitates the transportation of over 125,000 children to primary and post-primary schools each day including approximately 8,000 children with special educational needs.  The purpose of the scheme is to ensure access to primary and post primary education for children, who because of where they live, might have difficulty in attending school regularly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">School transport is a very significant national operation involving about 42 million journeys and over 82 million kilometres on 6,000 routes every school year. This service is delivered using a mix of BE, both school transport and road passenger vehicles, private contractor vehicles including private operator scheduled services, and Dublin Bus, Irish Rail, DART and LUAS where practical. The scheme therefore encourages a significant reduction in daily usage of individual cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">School Transport was also approved by Government as a topic for inclusion as part of the 2009-2011 round of Value for Money Reviews.  This review looked at the original objectives of the scheme, whether these objectives remain valid today, the extent to which the objectives are being achieved, and whether there are possibilities for economies or efficiencies that would improve the value for money of the scheme. In this context, the review also looked at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money in the Scheme. The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is currently being finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">In a wider context, the Government's Smarter Travel policy, which is led by my colleague the Minister for Transport, pursues the need to deliver a sustainable travel and transport system by 2020, including in relation to school travel. Since the publication of the Smarter Travel Policy in February last year, work has begun on developing a national cycle competency accreditation for schoolchildren. In addition, a stakeholder advisory group has been set up in relation to the delivery of the Green Schools Travel Programme. My colleague the Minister for Transport, continues to provide financial support for the Green Schools Travel Programme through the National Transport Authority. This programme reached 144,000 schoolchildren in 482 schools by the end of 2009 and yielded an average reduction of 22% in children travelling to school by car. The approved national programme aims to reach 260,000 schoolchildren by 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_1737">A total of 165 apprentices registered by FÁS with either home addresses or last employer based in County Clare are currently registered as redundant.  At end September 2010, 7,614 of a total 18,380 apprentices nationally were registered by FÁS as being redundant. Of this number, 4,320 can progress in their apprenticeship having reached the minimum qualifying standard at the relevant training phase while 3,294 must first successfully pass their outstanding assessment(s) to permit similar progression.</p>
            <p eId="para_1738">FÁS has introduced a number of measures to date which have assisted over 4,000 redundant apprentices with on and off-the-job training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1739">The rules for off-the-job training have been amended to permit redundant apprentices to progress to their next off-the-job training phases. Of those apprentices registered as redundant at end September, 2,439 had completed off-the-job training and 955 are currently attending off-the-job training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1740">The Redundant Apprentice Placement Scheme was introduced in April 2010 to provide opportunities to redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training at Phase 3, 5 and 7. The scheme provides a weekly subsidy of €250 to the employer towards employment costs. At end September 2010, 258 had commenced their on-the-job training phase, of whom 17 had completed the relevant phase.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">ESB Networks are providing on-the-job training to 252 eligible redundant electrical and motor mechanics apprentices in 2010. At end September 2010, 189 redundant apprentices had completed the training with 63 currently in training with ESB Networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">FÁS has also developed Phase 7 Equivalent off-the-job assessments for redundant apprentices for the trades of Carpentry &amp; Joinery, Electrical, Plumbing, Brick &amp; Stonelaying and Cabinet Making, where Phase 7 assessments cannot be undertaken on-the-job. At end September 2010, 91 redundant apprentices had completed the assessments and a further 52 are scheduled to take the assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">Redundant apprentices may also avail of existing specific skills training courses and evening courses available at FÁS Training Centres to enhance their employable skills. At end September 2010, some 1,133 course places have been availed of by redundant apprentices to date in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">Under the EU Leonardo Da Vinci III Life Long Learning Programme, Léargas in collaboration with FÁS, has supported 25 redundant apprentices to complete on-the-job training overseas. Eighteen redundant apprentices are currently in on-the-job training overseas and 17 redundant apprentices will be scheduled for on-the-job training in the first half of 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">At end September, 9 redundant apprentices formerly employed by S.R. Technics had commenced Phase 5 and 7 on-the-job training with the Air Corps and a further 9 are scheduled to commence in November.</p>

In this context, the review also looked at fundamental issues such as eligibility criteria and catchment boundaries, with a view to achieving efficiencies and value for money in the Scheme.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1916">The provider in question was first registered as a FETAC accredited provider in 2006, providing courses in such areas as child care, health care,  psychology,  business and finance. Monitoring inspections of the provider were conducted by FETAC in January and December 2009, with a follow-up meeting held in July 2010. The monitoring visits identified significant areas for improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1917">FETAC suspended the provider's access to certification on 13 September 2010, pending the completion of the monitoring process. FETAC also advised the provider not to enrol any new learners on programmes leading to FETAC Awards.  The provider was given until 30 September to confirm with evidence that it was in full compliance with all requirements and to furnish a report to FETAC.</p>
            <p eId="para_1918">Information from the provider was received by the deadline, but, having considered the information, FETAC decided to continue the suspension of certification as issues regarding quality assurance procedures had not been satisfactorily resolved. This resulted in a suspension notice being placed on FETAC's website on 7 October.  FETAC was notified on 10 October that the provider has ceased trading.</p>
            <p eId="para_1919">FETAC-registered providers, delivering programmes of 3 months duration or more on a commercial and profit making basis, are required to have policy and procedures for the Protection for Learners, aimed at ensuring that there are adequate arrangements in place in the event of a provider ceasing operations. Such arrangements can include having an agreement in place with at least 2 other providers, to enable learners to transfer to continue their programmes should the provider cease operation. FETAC is now examining the protection for learners arrangements in place for the provider in question and will assist affected learners as much as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1920">Separately, following an anonymous allegation of malpractice against the provider made to Skillnets Limited in February 2010, Skillnets Limited investigated the matter and subsequently put in place certain strengthened control measures from its own perspective. Skillnets Limited also promptly informed the Department, FAS, FETAC and the Comptroller and Auditor General upon receiving the anonymous allegation and where its subsequent investigations indicated potential fraudulent activity, it duly informed the Garda authorities.  The matter is covered in chapter 29 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the Accounts of the Public Services 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">FETAC assisted Skillnets Limited with its investigation of the allegation of malpractice and also reported the findings to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">An investigation conducted by FÁS' Internal Audit Unit into concerns regarding training provided by the company in question commenced on 13 May 2010.  Payments due to the company concerned totalling €50,820 are currently being retained by FÁS.  FÁS has held meetings with representatives of the company following learner and employer validation checks on a sample of claims funded by the Agency.  It has also held a number of meetings with FETAC to establish the certification status of all learners on the sampled claims funded by FÁS where it was declared to the Agency that FETAC certification was being sought by the company in question.  The investigation is ongoing and is expected to conclude in the coming weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_1931">As the Deputy will be aware, the General Allocation Model (GAM) was introduced in primary schools in September 2005 to ensure that each school has learning support/resource teaching support available to meet the needs of children with high incidence special educational needs. In general, where a school meets the criteria for developing school status as outlined in the staffing schedule for the appointment of teachers for the current school year (Department Circular 0021/2010), an appropriate adjustment will automatically be made to the school's allocation under the General Allocation Model.</p>
            <p eId="para_1932">In relation to schools which may not meet the criteria for developing school status, when the GAM commenced, a commitment was given to carry out a review after three years of operation. This review commenced in 2008. The process involved engaging with the Education Partners which includes parent, management and union interests in the context of securing their views on the model's operation. The review is at an advanced stage and is currently being considered within my Department. It is expected that the review will be completed this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">Any decision in relation to the operation of the model will be taken in the context of the outcome of the review, the resources available and the competing demands for resources generally in the education system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1949">Under the terms of my Department's Free Fee Initiative the Exchequer meets the cost of tuition fees in respect of eligible students who are pursuing full-time undergraduate courses of study which are a minimum of two years duration in an approved higher education institution.  The main conditions of the scheme are that students must be first-time undergraduates, hold inter alia EU/EEA/Swiss nationality in their own right, and have been ordinarily resident in an EU/EEA/Swiss state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">Where undergraduate students do not meet the eligibility criteria of the free fees schemes, it is the higher education institution concerned that determines, in accordance with its criteria, the appropriate tuition fee  payable by such students. Details of the number of non-EU students, as referred to by the Deputy, who are long term residents and whose parents are taxpayers are not readily available.  An example of the level of annual fee currently payable by a non EU student for an undergraduate medical course amounts to some €31,000. The total provision to the Higher Education Sector (including capital, current grants etc) amounts to some €1.8 billion this year.  This includes an amount of some €400 million in respect of the cost of the free fees schemes.  Statistical data in relation to higher education colleges is collected by the Higher Education Authority (HEA).  Available date on the number and domiciliary of origin of full-time students enrolled in universities and institutes of technology are available on the HEA website at: http://www.hea.ie/en/statistics. Data in respect of student enrolments in private Higher Education colleges is not collected by the HEA.</p>

            <p eId="para_1977">Last year, the Government announced a new framework for the promotion, quality assurance and co-ordination of international education.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">As part of this new framework, Enterprise Ireland has been given the lead role in the development, promotion and marketing of international higher education, including responsibility for the Education Ireland national brand and web site.  Enterprise Ireland has over 30 international offices, facilitating access to over 60 overseas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">The responsibility for promoting Irish higher education institutions to international students was previously split between Enterprise Ireland and the International Education Board Ireland (IEBI), a small body under the aegis of my Department.  The responsibilities, and some of the staff, of IEBI have now been fully transferred to Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">I am satisfied that these arrangements constitute the most effective use of funding to support international education initiatives.  Between 2006 and 2009, my Department provided the following funding to the IEBI to support international education initiatives:</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">2009:  €443,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">2008: €569,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">2007: €605,000;</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">2006: €436,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">Since the beginning of 2010, the majority of funding previously allocated to IEBI has been instead allocated to Enterprise Ireland, and my Department has arranged the transfer of the allocation to the Vote of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.  In 2010, this amount was on the order of €250,000, although Enterprise Ireland's expenditure in the area of international education is in excess of this figure because it is part of their mainstream activities, involving expenditure from various budget lines within the agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1986">With respect to student numbers, Enterprise Ireland has reported that in 2009, around 26,000 international students studied in Irish higher education institutions.  The Government, in its new international education strategy, has set a target that, on the basis of the new framework to promote international education, the number of international students in higher education should be increased by 50% to 38,000 students by 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1987">It should be noted that higher education institutions are themselves primarily responsible for their international activities and the main function of IEBI (up to the end of 2009) and Enterprise Ireland has been to support these efforts by promoting Ireland nationally as a destination for international study.</p>

            <p eId="para_1989">The December 2009 Budget aligned the payment of FÁS training allowances to a person's entitlement to welfare supports.  Consequently, where a trainee is entitled to a welfare payment at the commencement of their training course a training allowance is payable.  If a trainee is not entitled to welfare supports at the time of the commencement of their training course they will not receive a training allowance.  This budgetary measure was necessary in order to provide for an increase in the number of training and employment places.  However, I would emphasise that it in no way impacts on a person's opportunity to access training supports from FÁS which remain available to all unemployed persons regardless of whether they are in receipt of social welfare payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2331">The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level for the current school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009. There are currently just over 8,400 wtes (whole time equivalent posts) allocated to the VEC sector. The document below sets out the information as requested by the Deputy.</p>

In addition, due to the nature of the Department's functions many officials are assigned to specific office locations around the country. In addition, some grades such as educational psychologists, school inspectors and members of the Department's Building Unit are required to work regularly away from their office base and my Department provides them with all of the appropriate IT equipment in order that they can carry out their duties remotely.</p>

            <p eId="para_2404">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that it is assumed that the Deputy is referring to Operation Viking which was established in early 2005 in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, Dublin Region, with the objective of countering the suspected evasion of Vehicle Registration Tax and VAT on new high value vehicles entering the State.  The Operation ran until late 2005 and is no longer active.  During the course of the Operation, Revenue seized over 160 vehicles.  Almost 80 of these vehicles were in the high value category, with a combined value of almost €5.5 million.  60 of these high value vehicles were released on payment of almost €1.5m in outstanding VAT &amp; VRT including penalties and interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">Members of An Garda Síochána were not involved in the Operation.  The Operation was carried out during the normal working time of Revenue Officers from a number of Dublin Districts and Revenue Customs Enforcement Officers from Dublin Port. No additional resource costs were incurred by Revenue during the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">Revenue continues to target evasion of VRT and other taxes and customs duties as part of its normal enforcement work. For example in the period 1 January 2010 to 30 September 2010, 1515 vehicles have been seized for VRT offences.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
            <p eId="para_2408">The number of non-domestic suppliers winning public procurement contracts in Ireland has been the subject of recent controversy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">The EU Commission released a statistic, suggesting that 17% of the number of contracts awarded in 2008 went to suppliers outside the jurisdiction.  However, this statistic is based on incomplete data relating only to above threshold procurements, where contract notices were published, and the nationality of the winning tenderer disclosed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">When one compares the value (as opposed to the number) of contracts going to non-Irish companies in 2008, the figure actually amounts to less than 5% of the overall public spend on procurement.  It should also be noted that the figures quoted by the Commission do not distinguish between companies in the UK and those based in Northern Ireland, so of the contracts going "abroad", many of the contracts may have stayed on the island of Ireland.  The EU Commission agrees that an alternative interpretation of their figures is that "about 95% of all procurement by value was from domestic suppliers".</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">As regards print contracts up to 2009, the Government Supplies Agency, a Business Unit of the Office of Public Works, organised centralised procurement of printing services on behalf of Government Departments, Offices and Agencies (including An  Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces).  This role has been subsumed by the National Procurement Service, whose remit now extends to other public service organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">The OPW has always applied the relevant Directives and Regulations in its procurement operations.  Notwithstanding this, most of the work under print contracts for the GSA, and now for the NPS, is carried out in Ireland:</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">In 2008, 89.4% of the total value of OPW print contracts (amounting to approximately €10m) went to suppliers in the Republic of Ireland (90.5% to suppliers on the island of Ireland);</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">In 2009, 95.6% of the total value of OPW print contracts (amounting to approximately €6.8m) went to suppliers in the Republic of Ireland (96.7% to suppliers on the island of Ireland).</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">The National Procurement Service (NPS) has made efforts to ensure that print companies are able to take full advantage of the public procurement opportunities that arise and are available to them.  The NPS facilitated a seminar for the Print &amp; Packaging Forum in September 2009, which covered all the issues relating to competing for public procurement contracts, such as the Public Procurement regulations, accessing the market opportunities, the tendering process, and general guidance on how companies should approach the preparation of tenders.  Further seminars have been delivered to ISME in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2416">In addition, the NPS has put in place a Print Panel for small print requirements (below the new threshold for advertising of €25,000).  All print companies who are interested in public sector work should apply to be placed on the print panel.  This has been published recently, but we have not had as great a response as we would have hoped.  Of the 700 or so companies that are involved in print, only around 55 are included in the panel, which is available currently to all public sector buyers on www.opw.ie  , together with instructions on how it can be used for low-value tenders.  Without doubt, the most significant development in the area of facilitating the SME sector has been the publication by the Minister for Finance in August 2010 of Circular 10/10. These guidelines to public contracting authorities aim to ensure that tendering processes are carried out in a manner that facilitates participation by SMEs, while ensuring that all procurement is carried out in a manner that is legal, transparent, and secures optimal value for money for the taxpayer.  It addresses the concerns that SMEs have regarding access to public procurement opportunities, and highlights practices that are to be avoided, where they can unjustifiably hinder small businesses in competing for public contracts.  The new arrangements include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">greater open advertising of opportunities (threshold now €25,000);</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">a reduced requirement for paperwork (such as accounts) at the early stages of  tendering;</p>
            <p eId="para_2419">an instruction that suppliers are not to be charged for access to tender opportunities;</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">an assurance that all criteria used would be appropriate and proportionate;</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">and an instruction that turnover and insurance levels would be set at proportionate levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">All of these actions are consistent with the recently published EU commissioned research carried out by GHK on <i>Evaluation of SMEs’ Access to Public Procurement Markets in the EU </i>  (September 2010), DG Enterprise and Industry, which notes that SMEs in Ireland secured greater access to public procurement than in other countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">In addition to the work being done by the NPS and the Department of Finance, Enterprise Ireland is running strategic workshops to assist companies, such as Management Development workshops which have been run specifically for the print industry, and Strategic &amp; Change Management programmes. Enterprise Ireland also offer assistance with exports, management development, lean manufacturing, research and development, and overseas offices programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">We cannot be seen to close ourselves off from the EU marketplace, by adopting a protectionist stance, as in 2009 alone 80 companies have won €210m in overseas public procurement opportunities with the support of Enterprise Ireland, which has set up a new public procurement section.  I understand that, already this year, in the order of 63 contracts have been won, and Irish firms have secured €200m worth of contracts with the Olympic Development Authority in the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">Intertrade Ireland offers GO<sub>2</sub>tender workshops, which include mentoring, consortium and cluster development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">Many small companies with less than 10 employees can avail of the services of County Enterprise Boards, and should liaise with their local County Enterprise board to see what support is available to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">The Department of Foreign Affairs has published links on its website to other countries' public procurement portals which are open to Irish companies as well as other useful links.</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">The Government is supporting the print industry and SMEs generally through the range of initiatives outlined above, but under EU procurement law and the principles of transparency, non-discrimination and equal treatment, it cannot set out deliberately to discriminate in their favour, when tendering for goods and services.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2438">I am informed that on 1st September, Ethiopia's Central Bank devalued the Ethiopian Birr by 16.5%.  The latest in a series of devaluations since January 2009 and I understand is in keeping with a Government policy of allowing the Birr to fall against foreign currencies so as to bolster Ethiopia's competitiveness.   Ethiopia is one of the world's poorest countries.  I understand that its growth and development gains came under threat in 2008 with the emergence of twin macroeconomic challenges of high inflation (with food inflation peaking at 92% year-on-year in July 2008) and an extremely difficult balance of payments situation. In the face of these acute challenges, the Ethiopian Government took a series of corrective measures which, together with support from the international community including the IMF, led to improvements during 2009 and 2010.  However, I am informed that the economy remains fragile and under stress.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">I understand that a recent IMF mission to Ethiopia considered that the devaluation of the Birr, supported by a prudent fiscal policy and monetary policy, would help to stimulate exports, import substitution, and economic growth. Overall, the recent IMF mission to Ethiopia concluded that Ethiopia has made good progress in the first half of 2010 in macroeconomic stabilisation and that the economic outlook remains favourable with continued strong growth expected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2440">The Minister for Foreign Affairs visited Ethiopia during the summer and it was clear to him that, while Ethiopia remains a very poor country, it is making real progress towards development based on economic growth.  Ireland is playing a part in this process through Irish Aid which is having a very positive impact on social and economic development in the country. The Irish private sector is also now getting involved through trade and investment in Ethiopia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">I am informed that the impact of the devaluation of the Birr on other countries in the region is not likely to be significant as — in common with other Sub-Saharan African countries — most of Ethiopia's international trade at present is with Asian, European and North American markets rather than with African countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_2443">The requirement to have all used vehicles presented for pre-registration examination has presented some new challenges for both Revenue and the competent person appointed to carry out these functions, namely, the NCTS.  In consultation with other stakeholders, e.g. the Society of the Irish Motor Industry (SIMI), the Farm Tractor &amp; Machinery Trade Association Ltd (FTMTA), Revenue and the NCTS are facing these challenges and have implemented some revised procedures to speed up the registration process.  For example, the NCTS have recently put procedures in place to provide additional capacity in their centres, including extending the opening times in some centres, and are an advanced stage in the configuration of two additional centres, one in Carrick on Shannon and one in Donegal Town, for registration purposes in order to address current delays.  Revenue are also examining the possibility of providing electronic facilities for the registration of used vehicles that have been subjected to a pre registration examination. I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that the National Car Testing Service has informed them that, as at close of business on 12 October 2010<i>,</i>   the waiting times for appointments for the registration of vehicles in each of the National Car Test offices engaged in the registration of vehicles on behalf of Revenue, are as follows:</p>

            <p eId="para_2492">In relation to category (a), the OPW carries out inspections of these embankments and, where maintenance works are considered necessary, they are undertaken as part of the Office's annual programme of maintenance works.</p>
            <p eId="para_2493">Maintenance of the embankments forming part of the Fergus Drainage District is the responsibility of Clare County Council. However, OPW has recently agreed in principle to fund, on a once-off basis, the refurbishment of a section of these embankments, which impacts on the OPW Flood Relief Scheme in Ennis. It is proposed that the work will be undertaken as part of a single project that will also include mitigation measures for Ballybeg and St. Flannan's.  Clare County Council have indicated that a tender competition for the design of this project has been initiated, and they hope to appoint consultants during November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">As regards category (c), it would be open to Clare County Council to submit applications for funding for mitigation works to these embankments under the OPW Minor Works scheme. If applications are submitted that meet the eligibility criteria of the scheme, they will be considered, having regard to the overall availability of funding for flood risk management.</p>

            <p eId="para_2496">Prior to 1974 female officers were generally required to resign on marriage and, depending on their service, received a marriage gratuity in lieu of any pension benefits.  Following the abolition of the marriage bar, any officer appointed before 1974 has the option of resigning within two years of marriage and receiving a marriage gratuity, preserving benefits when she resigns, or of remaining in employment.   Officers who received a marriage gratuity and who are subsequently reappointed in an established capacity in the civil service may refund the gratuity and have all prior service aggregated with subsequent service for superannuation purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_2499">The promotion of the use of electronic payments is a key Government policy and a number of initiatives have already been taken in this regard, with the longer-term objective of significant reductions, over a number of years, in the volume of paper-based payments in use throughout the economy. This policy is fully aligned and is developing in tandem with market and regulatory developments at EU level, including the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), the introduction of the Payment Services Directive from November 2009 and the introduction of the revised Electronic Money Directive from April 2011. In promoting this policy objective, the Government has reduced stamp duty on combined ATM cards from €10 to €5 in Budget 2009, building upon changes in the previous year's Budget. Stamp duty on cheques was also increased from 30 cent to 50 cent per cheque, to act as a further disincentive to cheque usage.  As part of the process of increasing the use of electronic payments new governance arrangements are required. I am currently considering the recommendations made by the National Payments Implementation Programme Advisory Group in their report on the possible mechanisms and mandate to further promote the development of electronic payments.</p>

            <p eId="para_2820">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981 enables Revenue to refund the VAT paid on qualifying goods which are purchased for the exclusive use of disabled persons suffering a specific degree of disablement.   The relief applies to VAT on the purchase of aids and appliances designed to assist a disabled person to overcome his/her disability in the performance of daily functions or in the exercise of a vocation.  Typical examples of qualifying aids and appliances include necessary domestic aids (e.g. drinking and eating aids designed solely for the disabled); walk-in baths designed for the disabled; commode chairs and similar facilities; lifting seats and specified chairs designed for the disabled; hoists and stair lifts designed for invalids; communication aids designed for those unable to speak.  The installation of a domestic central heating system does not qualify for relief under the Value Added Tax (Refund of Tax) (No. 15) Order 1981.</p>

            <p eId="para_2825">The total direct costs arising from the floods in late 2009 were estimated to amount to 520.9m euro. Of this, 276.9m euro related to costs to the State with the remaining 244m euro consisting of damage to private infrastructure (residential property, commercial property, and motor vehicles) which was covered by private insurance.  My Department made an application to the EU Commission for funding under the EU Solidarity Fund based on costings of damage received from Departments and local authorities. A regional application was made as the estimate of the extent of the damage does not meet the Solidarity Fund's threshold of 0.6% of GNI or 935.5m euro for a national disaster.</p>
            <p eId="para_2826">111.5m euro of the 276.9m euro costs to the State were eligible for assistance under the EU Solidarity Fund criteria or 21.4% of total direct costs.

            <p eId="para_2854">As President of the Council of the EU, Belgium's role mainly consists of organising and managing the work of each Council configuration, including the ECOFIN Council, through its competent Ministers.  Under Lisbon Treaty rules, Belgium forms part of the Trio Presidency with Spain and Hungary and would have collaborated with both these member states in the formulation of their 18-month Trio Presidency Programme.  The Presidency of the Council ensures that the Council runs smoothly, chairs and directs discussions, tries to reconcile divergent points of view and formulates proposals for compromises so that decisions can be taken.  The Presidency also plays an important role in negotiations with the other institutions of the Union, especially the European Parliament which, like the Council, has to give its assent to most European legislation.  Belgium acknowledges in its Presidency Programme that the financial crisis and economic downturn and the related deterioration in public finances now require the Stability and Growth Pact to be strengthened.  Accordingly, the priorities of the Belgian Presidency include ensuring progress on measures aimed at reinforcing the Pact, improving economic governance and broadening macroeconomic surveillance.  This is being pursued through the high level Task Force, chaired by President Van Rompuy which was established by the European Council in March 2010, and through the work of the Eurogroup, the ECOFIN Council and the European Commission.  Proposals in this area include strengthening the Stability and Growth Pact, improving economic governance and broadening the EU's macroeconomic surveillance.  This work has been informed by the Communications on enhancing economic policy co-ordination published by the European Commission on 12 May and 30 June 2010 and by the related legislative proposals which it published on September 29.  These latter proposals are subject to the normal process of consultation with national parliaments and with the European Parliament.  The Van Rompuy Task Force is due to report to the European Council of 28-29 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_2855">I support the work of the Task Force and the broad consensus that improvements are needed in the economic governance of the EU, taking account of the EU's legal framework and the circumstances and challenges facing individual Member States.  Ireland is contributing to discussions in this area and I look forward to the forthcoming report of the Task Force.</p>

These guidelines are issued by the Minister for Education and Skills, in consultation with the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government with the consent of the Minister for Finance. The original guidelines were issued in 1999 with a further clarification document issuing in July 2005.  In order to comply with the guidelines, the accommodation must be let to the student or to the institution for on-letting to the student, for the academic year. A student means a person pursuing a course of full-time study in the institution. The development itself must be certified by an educational institution for use by its own students. One or more institutions can certify a single development.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">The July 2005 clarification document modified the "academic year" requirement to allow for a limited number of situations in which the lease may be for a period of less than an academic year. These are where the development is not completed until after the start of the academic year, the course duration is short or where a lease is unexpectedly terminated during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">The accommodation may be let to non-students for periods outside of the academic year, which generally means the Summer months, without loss of entitlement to the relief. Apart from this, only students from the certifying educational institution may occupy the accommodation. Surplus accommodation during the academic year cannot be occupied by non-students or by students from other, non-certifying educational institutions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2868">Section 117 of the Finance Act 2010 included provision to make public bodies subject to VAT with effect from 1 July 2010 in accordance with the European Court of Justice ruling against Ireland of 16 July 2009 in Case C-554/07.  In summary, the VAT Act 1972 was amended to provide that public bodies, including local authorities, are made subject to VAT.  More specifically, they are subject to VAT where they engage (i) in economic activities; (ii) in any activities as outlined in Annex I of the EU VAT Directive, unless the activity is carried out on such a small scale as to be negligible; and (iii) in the case of their regulatory capacity as a public authority, when their treatment as non-taxable could lead to a distortion of competition.  These are subject of course to the activity not being otherwise exempted from VAT.   During the debate on the Finance Bill, I undertook to look again at the provisions, in particular in relation to the supply of community and sports facilities by public bodies, especially local authorities.  Accordingly I amended the legislation to provide that the new VAT rules for public bodies, in relation to the supply of sports and community-type facilities, will be commenced by order, rather than on 1 July 2010.  This is to allow for a more complete examination of the issues, including an analysis of how the new rules might best be implemented.  In the circumstances, I have no immediate plans to introduce an Order to that effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_2870">In Budget 2010, I announced the Government's intention to launch a National Solidarity Bond, the purpose of which is to allow citizens an opportunity to invest and provide money to the State to stimulate economic recovery and to assist in the maintenance and creation of employment. The necessary legislative basis was provided in this year's Finance Act and the Bond was launched on Tuesday 4 May. I am informed by the National Treasury Management Agency that, at close of business on Monday, 18 October, a total of some €265 million had been invested in the Bond by almost 12,000 customers.</p>

Under the scheme, local authorities were invited to submit applications for funding for proposed mitigation measures that are economically viable and environmentally sustainable, up to a maximum cost of €500,000 in each instance. A maximum allocation of 90% of the total cost of a project is available, with the balance of the cost being met by the Local Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2966">Donegal County Council submitted a number of funding applications under the scheme this year. The application submitted by the Council in respect of the flooding problem in Burnfoot, which put the estimated cost of the proposed work at €75,000, was assessed by OPW engineers  and was found to meet the eligibility criteria.  A sum of €67,500, representing 90% of the estimated cost of the work, was allocated to the Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_2967">It would be open to Donegal County Council to submit further applications under the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_2969">In view of the complexity of the various issues involved, I have agreed with the Chair, Mr. Hugh Cooney, that the Group should take somewhat longer over its task. It is now envisaged that the Group will Report in the coming weeks. I must emphasise that the Group has not yet taken final decisions on its recommendations, nor has any recommendation been submitted to Government.  I would add that, in parallel to the work of the Expert Group, action has been taken to make progress on the recommendations in the Group's first Report. For example, the revised Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, through which many of the Group's recommendations from the first Report are to be put into effect, has been through a public consultation process and the Financial Regulator hopes to finalise and publish it shortly. Work on the other recommendations is also in train.</p>

As part of this ongoing operation, Revenue enforcement officers regularly conduct both intelligence-driven and random checks at shops, markets, and other points of retail sale, as well as private and commercial premises. The operation forms an important part of Revenue's strategy to tackle the problem of illicit trade in tobacco products.</p>
            <p eId="para_3010">As part of Operation Downstream, 95 seizures amounting to 2.04m cigarettes and 195kgs tobacco were made at inland locations in the course of a specific two-week national tobacco operation, which took place in July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3011">In relation to Revenue's illegal cigarettes hotline, I am advised that 121 calls have been received to date since its introduction in July 2010.  A total of 8 calls have contributed directly or indirectly to seizures of illicit cigarettes, and enquiries are ongoing in a number of other cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3012">With regard to comparisons between the levels of smuggling in Ireland and other EU states, I am informed that there is no internationally recognised method for precisely determining the levels of tobacco smuggling in any one country.  However, on the basis of a 2009 survey carried out independently on behalf of the Revenue Commissioners and the Office of Tobacco Control, Revenue estimates that approximately 20% of cigarettes consumed in the State had not been taxed in this jurisdiction.  Revenue would further tentatively estimate that this figure of 20% comprises 14% illicit product and 6% legal cross-border purchases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3013">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that as part of its obligations under a legally binding tobacco agreement signed with the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) and the Member States a report estimating the size of the illicit tobacco trade has been commissioned by a major international cigarette manufacturer annually since 2007.  This report has not been published nor has it been made available to Member States.  Each Member State is given information relating only to itself, and on a strictly confidential basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3014">Any analysis of illicit tobacco movements must take account of a variety of factors including population, geographical location, size of the illicit market, level of taxation, price in neighbouring jurisdictions etc.  A significant factor is whether or not the country is a source, transit or destination country.  Ireland is considered to be both a transit and a destination country.  For example, the brands seized under "Operation Samhna", where more than 120 million cigarettes were seized in October 2009, would indicate that this shipment was not intended for the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3015">I am also informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the European Anti Fraud Office (OLAF) has a special unit entitled OLAF Task Group Cigarettes, which co-ordinates both international operations and other countermeasures undertaken by the authorities of the Member States against cigarette smuggling. OLAF also maintains a database of cigarette seizures reported by the authorities of the Member States.  In this regard, the number of cigarettes seized by Ireland in 2009 was 9th in the table of seizures. Comparative data published by the World Customs Organisation in relation only to very large seizures, shows Ireland as the 6th and 13th highest respectively out of 18 countries in Western Europe for the quantities of cigarettes seized and the numbers of seizures.</p>
            <p eId="para_3016">I am satisfied that overall Ireland performs very well in relation to cigarette seizures. However, given that Ireland is a transit country for tobacco smugglers, simple extrapolation from the volume of seizures of tobacco products to estimate the scale of the illicit tobacco trade in the domestic market is, in my view, not valid.</p>
            <p eId="para_3017">The problem of tobacco smuggling is a global one and requires a very high level of international co-operation.  In this regard Revenue's Customs Service works very closely with enforcement agencies throughout the E.U. and with OLAF.  This high level of co-operation has resulted in many successful detections of illicit products and in the prosecution of those responsible.</p>
            <p eId="para_3018">It was my privilege last month to open an international conference in Dublin co-hosted by Revenue Commissioners and OLAF on the illicit tobacco trade.  The conference, which was the first of its kind, brought investigators and prosecutors from all 27 Member States together with their counterparts from law enforcement agencies from across the U.S.A.</p>
            <p eId="para_3019">In relation to the economics of tobacco research project, this is being conducted by economists in Revenue's Research and Analytics Branch. The research is an econometric analysis of the price elasticity of demand for taxed cigarettes in Ireland based on time series data. The econometric model measures the sensitivity of cigarette demand to a variety of economic and social factors. The current research findings are in draft form and are being considered by the Department of Finance and the Tax Strategy Group in the context of the Budget.  I am advised that the Revenue Commissioners intend to publish the research in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3020">In recent years, Revenue has signed Memoranda of Understanding with two of the main cigarette manufacturers, ITL and JTI, to further co-operation in relation to the illicit tobacco trade.  In addition, Revenue meets regularly with the trade association representing the leading tobacco companies as well as the four major global manufacturers.</p>

            <p eId="para_3024">The Valuation Act 2001 which came into effect on 2nd May, 2002, provides for the revaluation of all commercial and industrial property in the State. The Commissioner of Valuation has sole responsibility for all valuation matters under the Act, which includes the implementation of the revaluation programme.  This is a major project in nature and scale, given that such a nationwide exercise has not been undertaken since the mid-1800's. The programme began in November 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area and has since been rolled out to the areas covered by Fingal and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils.  In the next phase, it is intended to roll out the programme to further local authority areas in the coming months and the necessary process of consultation, as provided for under the Act, is underway in Dublin City and in the local authorities of Waterford, i.e. Waterford City and County Council and Dungarvan Town Council. Preliminary work is also underway on the revaluation of Limerick City.</p>
            <p eId="para_3025">The purpose of revaluation is to bring more equity, fairness and transparency into the local authority rating system and, following completion of the initial national revaluation programme, I am satisfied that there will be a much closer and uniform relationship between rental values of property and their commercial rates liability and that this relationship will thereafter be maintained by means of the recurring revaluations provided for in the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_3026">The funding for the revaluation project in general, which includes the Waterford phase of the project, is being provided in the normal way through the annual Valuation Office Vote allocation. At this stage, it is not envisaged that additional resources will be required to undertake the project which is an integral part of the Valuation Office work programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3028">The Financial Services Ombudsman  is a Statutory Officer, charged with investigating complaints from the public against all regulated financial service providers. This would include complaints against insurance providers. However, as the Financial Services Ombudsman is independent and impartial, it is solely at his discretion whether or not to accept jurisdiction on a complaint. Each complaint is taken on a case per case basis.  An insurance company's refusal to offer a motor insurance quotation would ordinarily not be sufficient grounds to warrant an investigation by the Financial Services Ombudsman. The decision by an insurance provider to decline a quotation to a potential consumer is a commercial decision by that insurance company that the Financial Services Ombudsman would not question, unless there were grounds that such a decision to decline cover was unreasonable or discriminatory in the circumstances. In essence, the insurance provider may feel the risk is too great to insure that  individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_3029">However, the Insurance Information Federation operates an agreement known as the ‘ <i>Declined Cases Agreement</i>’. This is an agreement which is adhered to by all motor insurers in Ireland. Under this agreement, the insurance market will not refuse to provide motor insurance to an individual seeking insurance, if he/she has approached at least three insurers and has not been able to obtain cover from them. In general, the insurer first approached will be required to provide the individual with a quote.</p>
            <p eId="para_3030">Where an individual has held a policy within the previous three years, the insurance company concerned is obliged to provide the individual with a quotation. Again, this is subject to the proviso that refusals have been received from three insurers (of which the previous insurer may be one). The only grounds on which an insurer can refuse cover are where to provide insurance would be contrary to the public interest.  The <i>Declined Cases Agreement</i> is administered by a Committee made up of representatives of each of the companies which have signed up to participate in the agreement. The Committee also includes a representative of the Consumers’ Association of Ireland and the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau as external observers. If it is impossible to identify which insurer was the first approached for a quote, then a rota of insurers comes into effect and the Committee allocates the risk to the insurer on the rota. The Committee can also decide whether a quote is so high or the terms so excessive as to make the quote tantamount to a refusal, in which case it will review the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3031">If a consumer wishes to seek more information regarding the <i>Declined Cases Agreement</i>, the Insurance Information Federation may be contacted directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3032">Conversely, if it is the case where the consumer is unhappy with the valuation placed on his or her motor vehicle after e.g. the car was deemed to be beyond economic repair, this is a matter which can be investigated by the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Ombudsman's findings are legally binding on both parties, subject to an appeal to the High Court. However, as pointed out previously, the decision as to whether or not to accept jurisdiction on a matter is solely at the discretion of the Ombudsman, particularly if there is an alternative option available to either the complainant or the financial service provider. Any queries regarding making a complaint against a financial service provider should be directed to the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau.</p>
            <p eId="para_3033">I have no responsibility with regard to the NCT; nor have I responsibility with regard to whether or not motor vehicles may be allowed on public roads.</p>

            <p eId="para_3066">The Adoption Act, 2010 gives force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Act, 2010, once commenced.</p>
            <p eId="para_3067">The papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption were deposited with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands on 28th July 2010.

            <p eId="para_3068">It is my understanding that the Vietnamese National Assembly has recently passed legislation which should allow for a move to ratification of the Hague Convention.

            <p eId="para_3077">In late 2005 the HSE undertook a review of tertiary paediatric services.McKinsey and Company were engaged to advise on the future strategic organisation of tertiary paediatric services. The resulting report — "Children's Health First" — recommended that the new paediatric hospital should be located alongside a leading academic teaching hospital in Dublin in order to provide a more comprehensive healthcare service with improved clinical outcomes for all patients.  The principle of location alongside a leading academic teaching hospital, in line with widespread international best practice, enjoyed widespread support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3078">McKinsey states that "the hospitals and experts cite many benefits from co-locations that support sub specialty critical mass". The McKinsey report refers to the Bristol Inquiry, in particular Recommendation 178, which states that "Children's acute hospital services should ideally be located in a children's hospital, which should be physically as close as possible to an acute general hospital"<i>. </i>In addition McKinsey refers to the Scottish Review of Paediatric Services 2004, which specified that, “Children’s specialist acute services should be co-located with adult, maternity and neonatal services”.  Of 17 hospitals examined by McKinsey, 15 were co-located with adult services, one was co-located with women’s services only, and only one — Great Ormond Street was entirely standalone.  A joint Task Group (representative of the Department of Health and Children, the Office of Public Works and the HSE) was established in February 2006.  This Task Group carried out extensive consultations with various stakeholders, including the three existing paediatric hospitals, the three maternity hospitals and external experts.</p>
            <p eId="para_3079">The High Level Framework Brief for the new hospital, prepared by Rawlinson Kelly &amp; Whittlestone Ltd (RKW) was completed in October 2008.  The RKW Report was informed by clinical and architectural experts from major children's hospitals in Toronto, Philadelphia and Manchester.  The Report includes a detailed assessment of capacity and concludes that the site adjoining the Mater Hospital can accommodate all the requirements of the new hospital and still allow expansion capacity beyond the year 2021.  The Brief includes provision for all in-patients to be accommodated in single en-suite rooms and on-site accommodation for parents and families.  The designs for the new children's hospital have demonstrated that the site at the Mater campus meets the requirements for children, young people and their families.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">The new children's hospital will play a central role in an integrated network of paediatric services across Ireland. This development will fundamentally change and improve the provision of paediatric healthcare in Ireland because merging the three existing hospitals (at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght) into a single hospital structure will ensure a critical mass of specialised skills to provide highly complex treatment and care to sick children.  In addition an Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre will be established at Tallaght.  The services to be provided will include urgent care consultations, outpatient appointments and day surgery.</p>
            <p eId="para_3081">On 12 October 2010, the Faculty of Paediatrics of the Royal College of Physicians in Ireland, which is the authorative professional body representing paediatricians in Ireland, publicly supported the new hospital and recommended that it should proceed as a matter of urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_3082">Dr Ronnie Pollock of MPA Healthcare, London, was asked by the parent's group "the New Crumlin Hospital Group" whether the new hospital on the proposed site could provide the international standard of excellence in tertiary healthcare for children.Dr Pollack replied that "it most certainly can.  The synergy created by assembling some of the best clinical and research skills in the country on a single site will create the environment for Ireland to progress further in international standing with measurable benefits for children and adults".</p>
            <p eId="para_3083">The Government is committed to proceeding with this important project at this location.</p>

            <p eId="para_3095">Aftercare is recognised as key element to achieving positive outcomes for young people leaving care, aiming to assist young people in care in bridging the transition from care to independent adult life in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_3096">Aftercare is provided for under Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991, which states: "45.—(1) (<i>a</i>) Where a child leaves the care of a health board, the board may, in accordance with subsection (2), assist him for so long as the board is satisfied as to his need for assistance and, subject to paragraph (<i>b</i>), he has not attained the age of  21 years. (<i>b</i>) Where a health board is assisting a person in accordance with subsection (2)(<i>b</i>), and that person attains the age of 21 years, the board may continue to provide such assistance until the completion of the course of education in which he is engaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_3097">Consideration has been given to the legal position with regard to the provisions of aftercare services, having regard to the existing legislative provisions of the Childcare Act 1991.  In relation to calls from agencies to place Aftercare on a statutory footing, i.e. to amend Section 45 of the Child Care Act, 1991 from a "may" to a "shall", the legal advice is that the Act creates a statutory power, and the HSE, as recipient of this power, must put itself in a position where it can exercise the power should the need arise. There is therefore no need to amend the Act as has been suggested.</p>
            <p eId="para_3098">In order to ensure that there was no doubt about the matter and to emphasise the importance of aftercare services, in accordance with Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act, I wrote to the HSE in June clarifying the issue and directing the HSE to formulate and implement aftercare policies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3099">In accordance with the findings of the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009 the Government prepared an Implementation Plan in July 2009 and funding of €1.0m was set aside by the HSE in its 2010 Service Plan, for the development of aftercare services in 2010. The HSE are in the process of recruiting ten additional Aftercare workers effective from 1st November, 2010 and have provided funding to the Irish Association of Young People in Care (IAYPIC) to develop a national advocacy and support service for young people in care, leaving care and aftercare.</p>
            <p eId="para_3100">My Office has developed proposals to ensure the implementation of Recommendation No. 16 of the Implementation Plan and a National Aftercare Policy is currently being developed to be made widely available to the relevant care staff, service providers and will be made available on the Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs website.</p>

The European Commission is supporting the Europlan Project which aims to assist countries in the development of their national plans.  A Europlan national conference in Ireland has been organised for December 2010 and this will involve relevant stakeholders as well as the Department of Health and Children and the HSE.  This conference will contribute to the consultative process in the development of a rare disease strategy.  The Department will also contribute to the work of the EU Committee of Experts on Rare Diseases which is scheduled to commence before the end of the year.  Preliminary work has commenced on the development of a national action plan and this will continue in 2011.</p>

Where children are identified by An Garda Síochána at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_3118">The HSE has developed a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis a vis indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.</p>
            <p eId="para_3119">The HSE is currently progressing plans to move to a more comprehensive model of care for these children.  It is recognised that each child should be accommodated in a service either a foster care or residential placement that meets all relevant standards as well as providing the necessary security and grounding in the community that is appropriate for their needs.  It is the intention of the Health Service Executive to phase out the hostel type of care arrangement with the provision of care for separated children seeking asylum being provided on a national basis with each child cared for in a registered care placement or equivalent.  The HSE has appointed a senior manager with responsibility for managing these changes and developments on a full time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3120">In January 2009, the HSE in co-operation with Refugee Integration Agency (operated by Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform) agreed a policy for the transfer of separated children into adult services once they reach the age of 18.</p>

            <p eId="para_3201">It is widely accepted that the way to provide the best possible paediatric tertiary care most effectively is to provide a single national paediatric hospital alongside a major teaching hospital, bringing together all the medical and nursing expertise for complex conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_3202">Services at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, National Children's Hospital Tallaght and the Children's University Hospital Temple Street will transfer to the new National Paediatric Hospital.  Pending completion of the project, and to ensure the best possible services for children, the HSE will continue to finance the provision and development of services at each of the transferring hospitals. A Paediatric Hospitals Operations Group has been established for ongoing network management and enhanced integration of the three paediatric hospitals in advance of the transfer to the new paediatric hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_3203">An Ambulatory and Urgent Care Centre will be provided at Tallaght Hospital as part of the National Paediatric Hospital development.</p>
            <p eId="para_3204">Neither the Crumlin nor Temple Street sites is owned by the State.  The long term future of these facilities will be a matter for discussion between the two hospitals, the HSE and my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_3263">I have responsibility for implementing the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which provides for a free preschool year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3264">Children qualify for the free preschool year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months in September of the relevant year.  This means that children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 are eligible for the free preschool year which commenced in September 2010, and children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 will be eligible in September 2011.  I understand that the person referred to by the Deputy has a child who will qualify for the ECCE scheme in September 2011 but is outside of the lower age limit for qualification in September 2010. There is no provision under the scheme to enrol children that are below the qualifying age.</p>
            <p eId="para_3265">The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the year before they commence primary school.  Services participating in the preschool year are expected to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  It is necessary, therefore, to target the preschool year at a particular age cohort and to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children participate in the scheme.   In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the variation in school admission policies and the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_3266">I wish to advise the Deputy that my Office received correspondence in relation to this matter in September this year and a response issued on 11 October 2010.</p>

            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_3271">From September to 14th October of this Dail term 761 PQs have received by my Department.  485 of these (64%) have been referred to the HSE for direct reply.  PQs referred to the HSE relate to operational issues, a large number of which concern individual cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_3272">The operation of the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the HSE (PAD) allows for the centralised receipt, assignment and tracking of Parliamentary Questions within the HSE's extensive network of operations. More generally, PAD monitors overall performance in relation to the timely issue of replies and provides a central contact for all requests from Oireachtas members for information relating to matters within the statutory remit of the Executive. It reports on a regular basis to the Chief Executive Officer and his management team.</p>
            <p eId="para_3273">In 2007 the Executive worked to a timeframe of responding to referred questions within 20 working days and this target was met for 65% of referred questions. From January 2008, this timeframe was reduced to 15 working days and 73% of referred questions were answered within this period. In 2009, 62% of questions referred to the Executive were answered within the 15 day timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_3274">However, between January and September 1st of this year, the number of questions answered within the 15 day timeframe dropped to 43%. This was due to a period of industrial action which commenced on a limited basis within the Health Service Executive on the 4th January 2010 and which escalated in effect from 1st March through to June 15th. In effect no new Parliamentary Questions could be forwarded to the Executive by my Department during the latter period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3275">The Executive is very conscious of the need for prompt responses to Parliamentary Questions and there is regular liaison between my Department and the Executive in this regard. While the Executive attempts to answer all questions referred to it as quickly as possible, many of the questions submitted by Deputies request large and detailed amounts of statistical data on a variety of subjects which require input and co-ordination from all areas of the Executive. Recent questions of this nature submitted to my Department include:</p>
            <p eId="para_3276">the number of home help hours provided in each year from 2007 to 2010 on a county basis;</p>
            <p eId="para_3277">the number of TB cases diagnosed in every county for each year between 2005 and 2010;</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">the number of persons on the waiting list for hearing aids in each HSE region;</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">the number of persons currently on waiting lists to see consultants in every hospital and the length of time each person has been on the list.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">Given the volume of information sought in these type of questions, the Deputy will appreciate that it may not be possible to provide responses to such questions within the 15 day timeframe. However, my officials are working closely with the HSE to try to improve the service to members of the Oireachtas generally, and at recent meetings with the new CEO of the HSE, Mr. Cathal Magee, I have stressed the importance of providing responses to Parliamentary Questions that are both prompt and of a high quality. Mr. Magee is very aware of my concerns in this regard and is committed to improving the handling of parliamentary affairs within the HSE.</p>

          <speech by="#BarryAndrewsFF" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_796">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_3288">I have responsibility for implementing the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which provides for a free pre-school year to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">I have read the correspondence referred to by the Deputy and do not accept it provides any basis for considering any change to the ECCE scheme.  On the contrary, the evidence of my Office is that the early childhood care and education sector is very happy with the ECCE scheme and anxious that it will continue in its present form into the future.  The number of services participating in the scheme has increased from approximately 3,800 in January 2010 to 4,200 this September.  This represents 95% of all pre-school services in the State and clearly demonstrates that the capitation rates provided for under the scheme are reasonable.  The fact that 94% of eligible children are availing of the free pre-school year within 8 months of its introduction, is further testimony to its success.</p>
            <p eId="para_3290">Under the Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006, a person single-handedly taking care of pre-school children in his or her own home, for a total of more than 2 hours a day, is considered to be providing a childminding service.  In general, where more than three children are being taken care of, a childminder is required to notify his or her service to the Health Service Executive (HSE) and is subject to the Regulations and to inspection.  Childminders who are not subject to these requirements are encouraged to voluntarily notify their service to their local City or County Childcare Committee which provides a range of supports to enable them to improve the standards of their childcare service.  While my Office actively promotes the notification of childminding services and the participation of childminders in quality and training programmes, it is not in a position to prevent parents entering into informal arrangements with childminders who are outside the scope of the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3291">National and international research has established that there is a close relationship between the capacity and qualifications of the workforce in early childhood care and education settings and the quality of young children's early experiences. The Workforce Development Plan for the sector, which is about to be published by my Office, includes a commitment to upskilling the workforce in the Early Childhood Care and Education sector and this is re-enforced by the condition that services participating in the ECCE scheme must have appropriately qualified staff to deliver the pre-school year.  The ECCE scheme is the first to require staff working in the sector to hold relevant qualifications.  At this point, the scheme does not require Pre-School Year leaders to hold more than a minimum qualification level.  This is intended to assist the process of improving quality and standards over time.  However, importantly, the scheme also provides for the payment of a higher capitation fee to services with more highly qualified staff and I would hope that this will further support the upward trend in qualifications held within the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_3292">I would agree that staff in pre-school services with many years of experience will generally have accrued valuable learning relevant to their role.  However, research has shown that years of experience in the workplace do not necessarily translate into relevant learning and it is important to have processes in place to objectively assess prior learning.  The processes currently in place to give nationally recognised accreditation of prior learning, are the responsibility of educational institutions and awarding bodies such as the Further Education and Training Awards Council (FETAC) and the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC).  Assessment will generally take place as part of the delivery of a programme of education and training but may also be conducted as part of a Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) process.  RPL processes usually involve an individual providing evidence of his or her learning for independent assessment and certifications from courses that are not aligned with the National Framework of Qualifications can also be assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3293">Whether a service is liable for commercial rates, under the Valuation Act 2001, is a matter for the Valuation Office under the remit of the Minister for Finance.  Following the announcement of the ECCE scheme, the Valuation Office clarified in July 2009 that services participating in the scheme which are solely and exclusively used for the provision of educational services which are available to the general public, and where the expenses incurred in providing these services are defrayed wholly or mainly by the State, would be considered exempt from commercial rates.  Childcare services which do not satisfy these conditions continue to be liable to commercial rates.</p>

            <p eId="para_3379">The development of safety regulations for fishing vessels dates back to the Fishing Vessel Safety Review group, which reported in 1996. One key recommendation made by that group was for the establishment of a safety regime for fishing vessels covering stability, strength, hull and machinery.    Following several fishing vessel tragedies in 2007 efforts focused on the development of a scheme for the fishing vessels in the 15m to 24m length category. My Department developed regulations for such vessels based on international standards and these regulations were subject to extensive public consultations, following, which the regulations entered into force in September of that year.   The Department of Transport as the maritime safety regulator does not regulate or control the number of fishing vessels; the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food carry out this function.  Compliance with the safety regulations is only required for those fishing vessels wishing to operate. Consequently, the Department of Transport only maintains figures for fishing vessels that have been issued with or made contact with the Department for certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3380">The new regulations apply to fishing vessels in the 15m to 24m length category on a phased basis from 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3381">On 1 October 2010 a total of 81 fishing vessels had been issued with a safety certificate or clearance for such and since then a further 10 vessels have received clearance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3382">In addition, a further 41 vessel owners have contacted the Department with a view to achieving a certificate, and the Marine Survey Office is processing these. From contacts between officials of my Department and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food there may still be 20 or so older vessels that have not made contact to date. It is a matter for each vessel owner in question to do so if it is his or her intention to continue to use the vessel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3383">Any decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels would be a matter for the Minister of Agriculture Fisheries and Food and I have no function in that regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3385">Proposals to deliver an upgraded route linking Dundalk to Sligo, taking in Cavan, involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible.  Such a route is recommended in the National Spatial Strategy as a strategic national transport corridor. Essentially the route involves upgrade/realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo.  The latter would involve a route that passes through Northern Ireland.  The improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads, in its area, is a statutory function of each road authority in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act, 1993. Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_3386">Funding of the national roads sections of the route are a matter for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3387">As Minister for Transport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding in relation to the national roads programme element of Transport 21.</p>
            <p eId="para_3388">Cavan County Council was allocated €600,000 in 2010 from the grant stream for Strategic Regional and Local Roads, to progress design and planning work on the section of road from Dundalk to Cavan.  The Council's consultant has identified a route corridor and is now carrying out a constraints study so that a specific route alignment can be selected.  It is also part of the consultant's brief to indicate what priority should be given to different sections of the road between Dundalk and Cavan.</p>
            <p eId="para_3389">Separately, the NRA has been asked to review investment needs for the national roads network into the future.  This review is being carried out based on a commitment in the Renewed Programme for Government agreed in October last year.  Its scope includes all matters surrounding national road development such as cross-section and routing.  Progress on particular road schemes in 2011, and later years, will be dependent on the outcome of this review and the availability of funds within a reduced capital budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_3400">I am very aware of the possible implications for Kerry of Ryanair reducing its level of services on the Kerry/Dublin route.</p>
            <p eId="para_3401">As you are aware, this service is operated under the current Public Service Obligation (PSO) contracts for services linking Dublin Airport with the regional airports at Derry, Donegal, Sligo, Ireland West Airport Knock, Galway and Kerry Airports.  These contracts commenced on 22 July 2008 and are due to expire on 21 July 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_3402">In the case of the Kerry route, following an EU public tendering process, a bid submitted by Ryanair emerged as the winner. The bid met the requirement in terms of proposed operating timetables as set out in the specifications published in the EU Official Journal, which stipulated that three return flights per day would be provided. The bid from Ryanair also set out the compensation it required in order to operate the service.  Based on that bid, Ryanair were awarded the contract to provide the scheduled air services over the three year contract period and are receiving payments in accordance with the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_3403">I can assure the Deputy that I have met all my obligations under the terms of the contract.   There are also obligations on Ryanair under the contract and it is a matter for that Company to ensure it complies with its terms.   My Department is currently in communication with the Company in the matter.  Clearly, if there is a breach of the contract, my Department will have to consider its options.</p>
            <p eId="para_3404">I am aware that discussions have taken place between Kerry Airport and Aer Arann in relation to the possibility of providing a service on the route.  My Department has also had discussions with Aer Arann about a range of issues, including the Kerry PSO.  However, my focus is currently on ensuring that Ryanair honours its obligations under the contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_3504">With regard to the funding of Waterford Airport, because of a projected shortfall in the resources available to fund this scheme, after allowing for estimated requirements for the PSO Air Services Programme for 2010, the six Regional Airports were allocated operational subventions on a pro rata basis in July of this year with no airport getting the full amount it might otherwise expect.  This allocation was in line with the OPEX contracts with the Airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3505">However, I am very much aware that several events have impacted on the regional airports since this year's applications for funding were received and that payments at the reduced level have been causing difficulties for the Airports.  To that end, my Department has been monitoring the position with management at each of the airports.  In recognition of those difficulties, I have decided to provide additional funding for the Scheme for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3506">All the Airports, including Waterford, have been invited to submit additional information in support of their applications for funding.  This updated information will be re-assessed by the Department in accordance with the terms of the scheme and allocations will be made accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_3507">The Value for Money Review of Exchequer Expenditure on the Regional Airports Programme, including the OPEX Scheme, has been completed and is at present being considered by Government.   It is expected that, in the light of that Review, decisions on funding for regional airports in future years will be made in the context of the Estimates and Budget process later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3532">I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that a valid application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to by the Deputy was received in Citizenship Division in July, 2010.   Until an application has been successful and a certificate of naturalisation issued, it is a requirement that applicants ensure that they remain lawfully in the State.  Accordingly, an application for leave to remain was received from the family (which includes the person referred to above).  This application was acknowledged on 13th August and, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), leave to remain in the State was renewed for a three year period to 18th August, 2013. This decision was conveyed in writing by letter dated 18th August, 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3533">As applications for Naturalisation and Leave to Remain applications are dealt with by different Divisions within INIS, correspondence issues separately from the relevant Division.

            <p eId="para_3538">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_3539">The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009. At present, there are approximately 60,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3540">The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates in line with periods of increased demand. Furthermore, additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other inquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  Registered organisations have been advised to take account of this in their recruitment and selection process. However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce the time to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is approximately 12 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3541">The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. Due to the high volume of applications, an additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis. In addition, overall staffing arrangements at the Unit are kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_3544">Following consideration of their cases under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 as amended the Minister signed Deportation Orders in respect of  the mother and father on 20/04/2010.  The Deportation Order in respect of their daughter was signed on 11/05/2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_3582">It would appear that the person concerned left the State around that time given that, on 19 April 2006, a formal "take back" request was received in respect of him from the United Kingdom's immigration authorities, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations.  This request was made because the person concerned was in the UK without permission at that time.  This request was accepted by Ireland and the person concerned was transferred from the UK to Ireland on 8 February 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3583">On 3 July 2007, the person concerned applied, in writing, to return voluntarily to his country of origin. The person concerned was requested by letter dated 9 July 2007 to attend an appointment with the Voluntary Returns Unit of my Department to make the practical arrangements for his voluntary return.  However, the person concerned did not make contact with the Voluntary Returns Unit and, as a result, his request to return voluntarily to his country of origin was closed on 7 September 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3584">The person concerned clearly left the State again given that, on 19 March 2009, a further "take back" request was received from the UK immigration authorities in respect of him, again in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin II Regulations.  This request was made because the person concerned was again in the UK without permission.  This request was accepted by Ireland and the person concerned was transferred from the UK to Ireland on 2 October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_3585">By letter dated 21 January 2010, the person concerned was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection and this application will be considered first. When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_3586">In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3587">I should remind the Deputy that queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by Email using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

            <p eId="para_3667">On 15 September 2010 there were 327 persons in custody with convictions for sexual offences.  Of that total 90 have been or are engaged with the Psychology Service of the Irish Prison Service in relation to their sexual offending.</p>
            <p eId="para_3668">Research indicates that there is no evidence to support the idea that mandatory attendance, or indeed attendance achieved under threat of punishment, at rehabilitation programmes is of any value in reducing re-offending. Incentives to encourage voluntary participation offer a greater chance of success.  On the contrary, all indications are that rehabilitation does not work unless the offender is motivated to engage with the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3669">The successful completion of any group treatment course depends critically on the full and willing participation of self-motivated individuals.  Otherwise, the elements of the programme concerned with challenging the offender to take responsibility for his offending behaviour will not succeed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3670">The "Building Better Lives" programme commenced in January 2009, replacing the Sex Offender Programme initiated in 1994 and concluded in 2008.  The programme comprises group interventions in three modules and is delivered in Arbour Hill Prison.  It allows more responsive and flexible delivery of rehabilitation services to a greater number of offenders. The interventions take greater account of individual risk, needs and capacity.  Priority is given to higher risk offenders.  The programme is provided by a team of psychologists, including clinical and counselling psychologists, who have developed specific expertise in clinical practice including assessment and therapeutic work with men convicted of sexual offences. Not all sex offenders are suited to group programmes therefore other prison-based therapeutic interventions including one-to-one interventions are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_3671">Sex offenders also participate in other group programmes not specifically designed for sex offenders but addressing their needs, including stress management, anger management and cognitive skills training, as well as interventions by visiting psychiatrists.</p>
            <p eId="para_3672">Because the Psychology Service provide a range of interventions to all categories of prisoners,  it is not possible to disaggregate, with any degree of accuracy, the costs element that relates solely to the treatment of prisoners with a sexual offending profile.</p>

            <p eId="para_3688">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No 138 on 12 October, which was as follows: "Ms. Mairead Maguire was refused entry to Israel on 28 September on arrival at Ben Gurion Airport on a flight from Frankfurt. The basis for refusal was that she had been previously deported from Israel, most recently in June 2010 following her detention at sea on board the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>  . She appealed this decision to the Central District Court and subsequently to the Supreme Court of Israel. Both Courts explored the possibility of a compromise solution, but no formula acceptable both to the Interior Ministry and to Ms. Maguire could be agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3689">The Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv extended full consular assistance to Ms. Maguire during this period, making contact with her, with her lawyers and her family and other concerned parties, visiting her on a number of occasions in detention, and attending both the District and Supreme Court hearings.</p>
            <p eId="para_3690">Both courts found that she had been previously deported, and should not therefore have attempted to re-enter Israel without applying for the lifting of the barring order resulting from this deportation. On this basis, the refusal of entry was confirmed, and she was put on a plane leaving Israel on 5 October. It appears that the courts in both instances did not wish this episode to be regarded as a further deportation, and no costs were awarded against her.</p>
            <p eId="para_3691">The Embassy has followed this case carefully, and it is clear that due process was correctly observed, and that both courts considered the case carefully. However, I have previously made clear, both here in the Oireachtas and to the Israeli authorities, my view that any accusation of entering Israel illegally in relation to the flotilla episode was unjustified, as neither she nor the other participants had entered Israel voluntarily on that occasion. Should Ms. Maguire now apply for permission to enter Israel, I would therefore urge the Israeli authorities to allow her to do so."</p>

            <p eId="para_3693">In late June I became aware of an allegation that one of a group of persons arrested for allegedly carrying out long-term, "deep cover" assignments in the United States on behalf of the Russian Federation had travelled to Moscow using a false Irish passport.  I immediately asked the Passport Service and An Garda Síochána to undertake an investigation into this allegation and this investigation is underway.  I understand that the Gardaí have now received information alleging that as many as six Irish forged passports using material cloned from the valid passports of Irish citizens may have been involved in the case in question.  I can confirm that a small number of citizens have been interviewed by the Gardaí and the Passport Service.  While there is no evidence that those whose passport details have allegedly been used are under any threat or have been inconvenienced while travelling, they are, as a precautionary measure, being issued with replacement passports.</p>
            <p eId="para_3694">The Government regards the fraudulent use of Irish passports as a most serious matter and we are constantly seeking to improve the security of passports.  I understand that the passport books allegedly used were of a type produced by the Passport Service prior to 2005.  There have since been major enhancements to the security features of the current passport book and the Government is satisfied that this now makes the production of a counterfeit Irish passport much more difficult, although clearly not impossible for agencies with substantial resources.  In addition, procedures for confirming the identity of first time passport applicants have been tightened with a view to preventing fraud during the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_3695">Once I have received the reports of An Garda Síochána and the Passport Service into these most recent allegations, I will consider the evidence presented to me before reporting to the Government and recommending whatever course of action I believe appropriate.  I will then inform the House on the findings of the investigation and any action the Government should decide to take.  In the interim it would be inappropriate for me, at this stage, to speculate on its conclusions.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3697">The Passports Act, 2008 requires that before issuing a passport to a person, the Minister for Foreign Affairs shall be satisfied that that person is an Irish citizen.  Proofs of identity and entitlement to citizenship are required in respect of all passport applications.  These requirements are outlined in the passport application form notes that accompany each application form.  Details are also available on the Department's website.  This person applied for a passport in July 2007.  Her application could not be finalised by the Passport Service on the grounds that her entitlement to Irish citizenship, which was based on her Irish-born grandfather, had not been demonstrated.  At that time, she was advised by the Passport Service that she had to first apply for Foreign Birth Registration through the Consular Section in my Department before a passport could be issued to her.</p>
            <p eId="para_3698">Foreign Births Registration is the legal process by which persons, who have direct family links to Irish-born grandparents and in some cases to Irish-born great grandparents, may apply for Irish citizenship.  Those persons, who are registered, are issued with certificates.  These certificates are accepted by the Passport Service as verifiable evidence of citizenship.  As no certificate for Foreign Births Registration was submitted to the Passport Service by this person, her passport application was cancelled in October, 2009 and a refund of the paid passport fee was made to her.</p>
            <p eId="para_3699">Insofar as the Foreign Births Registration process is concerned, I can confirm that an application was received in my Department from this person on 6 October 2010.  The application was not complete and the applicant was contacted by telephone on the afternoon of 6 October 2010 and advised accordingly.  An e-mail was sent to the applicant later that day advising her of the extra documentation that was required in order to process the application, the statutory fee and the requirements in relation to the witnessing of the application form.  Our Consulate General in New York was also contacted on the same day and they confirmed that they would assist the applicant in applying for the extra documents of U.S. origin.  When the applicant returns a fully completed application form together with the statutory fee and the extra documentation my Department will expedite her application for Irish citizenship through Foreign Births Registration.  Once a certificate of Foreign Births Registration is issued to her, my Department will be in a position to issue an Irish passport to her on receipt of a fully completed application form.</p>
            <p eId="para_3700">The situation for her children is different.  While both were born in America, their father was born in Ireland and as such the children are automatically Irish citizens.  They were issued passports on foot of their applications in 2007.</p>

The scheme provides for up to 15 officers to e-work, and was originally fully subscribed.  In 2008 the scheme was extended for a further two years and a reserve list of 19 officers who expressed an interest in participating was created.  It is hoped to return the number of officers e-working in the Department to 15 before the end of the year.

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Social Protection</b>
         the current waiting time for the assessment of an appeal against a decision to refuse illness benefit; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Social_Protection" eId="spk_857">
            <from>Minister for Social Protection (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_3704">I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that the average time to process an Illness Benefit appeal at present is 37 weeks.   There was a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by that Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals.</p>
            <p eId="para_3705">While this growth is clearly impacting on processing times, it must also be remembered that they cover all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal and, in the case of Illness Benefit, a second examination must be carried out by the Department's Medical Assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_3706">On the return of the papers and comments to the Social Welfare Appeals Office the case is referred to an Appeals Officer who will either make a summary decision based on the documentary evidence or, if s/he considers it necessary, will list the case for oral hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_3707">Given the logistics involved in organising an oral hearing, a considerable period of time is added to the process. During 2009, 81% of all Illness Benefit cases were dealt with by way of oral hearing but, due to some of the initiatives outlined below, this has been reduced to 45% in 2010 to date.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_3708">A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</p>
            <p eId="para_3709">2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</p>
            <p eId="para_3710">A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</p>
            <p eId="para_3711">The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</p>
            <p eId="para_3712">A project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</p>
            <p eId="para_3713">Significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_3714">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.</p>
            <p eId="para_3715">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

            <p eId="para_3794">I propose to take Questions Nos. 374 and 395 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3795">The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term support to eligible people living in private rented accommodation, whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from another source.</p>
            <p eId="para_3796">Social welfare legislation provides the Health Service Executive with the authority to refuse, suspend or terminate payment of a rent supplement in the case of a person who has been required to deliver up possession of a dwelling provided by a housing authority; this can include, for example, anti-social behaviour by the tenant.</p>
            <p eId="para_3797">In the case of private rented accommodation, tenancy arrangements involve a contract between the landlord and tenant. In these instances, tenant behaviour is a consideration for the landlord. There are a number of avenues open to landlords to resolve issues pertaining to poor conduct of tenants, including the mediation service operated by the Private Residential Tenancies Board and/or recourse to the Garda Siochana and/or the Courts in relation to the enforcement of the law in dealing with anti-social behaviour. If necessary, the landlord may seek termination of the tenancy which, if affected, would result in the termination of rent supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3798">When a person presents themselves to a community welfare officer for rent supplement their RSI number and their social welfare history are reviewed. This process also takes into account the social welfare histories of their spouse and dependent children.  This review ensures, as much as possible, that members of the same household do not claim rent supplement concurrently.</p>

            <p eId="para_3888">The five priority issues identified in the correspondence from the Carers Association are:</p>
            <p eId="para_3889">"Hands off" the half rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant;</p>
            <p eId="para_3890">Protect carer's allowance and carer's benefit and address anomalies in qualifying criteria;</p>
            <p eId="para_3891">Enhance and support carers' health and wellbeing;</p>
            <p eId="para_3892">Provide comprehensive supports for family carers, including young carers; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3893">Publish the National Carer's Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3894">The Government is acutely aware and appreciative of the contribution made by carers.  It was for that reason, that when resources were available, we invested heavily in improving social welfare rates and services for carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3895">The carer's allowance rate for carers over 66 years of age was not changed in this year's budget and remains at €239.  The rate of carer's allowance for someone under 66 is €212.</p>
            <p eId="para_3896">Since the introduction of the carer's allowance in 1990 payments to carers have been increased and expanded.   Carer's allowance was increased in 2007, 2008 and 2009 by 12.1%, 6.5% and 3.3%, respectively. As a result, even with the reduction announced in the last Budget for carers under 66, the weekly rate of payment for the carer's allowance is still almost 20% higher this year than in 2006 and more than 147% higher than in 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_3897">The means test for carer's allowance has been significantly eased over the years, and is now one of the most generous means tests in the social welfare system, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings. Since April 2008, the income disregard has been €332.50 per week for a single person and €665 per week for a couple. This means that a couple with two children can earn in the region of €37,200 and qualify for the maximum rate of carer's allowance as well as the associated free travel and household benefits.    A couple with an income in the region of €60,400 can still qualify for a minimum payment, as well as the associated free travel and household benefits package.</p>
            <p eId="para_3898">These levels surpass the ‘Towards 2016' commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3899">From June 2005, the annual respite care grant was extended to all carers who are providing full time care to a person who needs such care, regardless of their income.  The rate of the respite care grant has also been increased to €1,700 per year in respect of each care recipient since June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3900">In September 2007 a new half-rate carer's allowance was introduced for certain people with another social welfare entitlement. This allowance was introduced following commitments given in "Towards 2016" and recommendations made by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs in the "Report on the Position of Full-Time Carers".  As well as increases in the rates of payment and improvements in the means testing arrangements over the period from 2000, the introduction of the half-rate entitlement has been, by far, the most significant and costly development in support for carers in recent years. This new payment was the primary driver in a 26% increase in the number of recipients in 2008 as well as a 9% increase in 2009.  As of August 2010 there were 20,106 people in receipt of a half rate carers payment or 40% of all carer's allowance recipients.</p>
            <p eId="para_3901">As regards the National Carer's Strategy, during 2008, an interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach, with secretariat support provided by my Department, undertook work, including a public consultation process, to develop a National Carers' Strategy.  However, because of the prevailing economic situation, it was not possible to set targets or time limits which could be achieved.  In that context, rather than publishing a document which did not include any significant plans for the future, the Government decided not to publish a strategy.  This position remains unchanged.</p>
            <p eId="para_3902">The other issues identified are primarily the responsibility of the Department of Health and Children. The Government will continue to support carers within the resources available.   It would not be appropriate for me to comment further on budgetary proposals at this stage.  Full consideration will, of course, be given to the impact of any proposals on the recipients involved.</p>

            <p eId="para_3906">Workers are insured under the Social Welfare Acts as either employed or self-employed contributors. All workers, both employed and self-employed, are obliged to pay PRSI contributions as a percentage of their personal reckonable income.</p>
            <p eId="para_3907">Participation in a Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) course is not, in general, regarded as employment or self-employment. Consequently participants in such courses are not insurable under the PRSI system.</p>
            <p eId="para_3908">However, subject to certain criteria, credited contributions may be awarded to individuals who are engaged in approved training or educational programmes, such as a VTOS course.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">Credited contributions form an integral part of the social insurance system. They are designed to protect the social insurance entitlement record of insured workers who for reasons relating to either incapacity, ill-health, unemployment, professional training or the provision of care,  are not in a position to make PRSI contributions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3911">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme (SWA) is administered on behalf of the Department by the community welfare division of the Health Service Executive (HSE).  Apart from a number of excluded categories, anyone in the State who satisfies a habitual residency condition (HRC) and a means test, has registered for employment, unless they have a physical or mental disability, and can prove unemployment may qualify for a weekly payment of  SWA.</p>
            <p eId="para_3912">However, subject to the provisions of EU law which apply to EEA workers, SWA cannot at any time be viewed as a temporary or interim means of income support available independently of HRC, while an applicant awaits the outcome of either a decision — or an appeal against a decision — on a claim for a social welfare payment from the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3913">The HSE has advised that the person concerned applied for SWA in May 2010 but his application was refused, as in the opinion of the HSE, the person concerned was deemed not to be habitually resident based on an assessment of his particular circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_3914">The HSE further advised that the person concerned appealed the decision to the HSE Appeals Office in June 2010. The Appeals Office upheld the decision to refuse SWA on the basis that the person concerned could not prove habitual residency. An appeal by the person concerned was forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office in August 2010. Every effort is being made to have this appeal determined as quickly as possible.</p>

         the guidelines in place regarding a situation where a jobseeker refuses employment that would yield the same or lower net income than the net income enjoyed on welfare.

            <p eId="para_4031">In order to qualify for a jobseeker's payment, a person must satisfy certain conditions which include being available for and genuinely seeking work. If a customer fails or refuses to take up a reasonable offer of employment, he or she may be disqualified for payment for up to nine weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_4032">In determining whether steps taken to seek employment have been reasonable, the Deciding Officer considers all the circumstances of the case including the nature and conditions of the employment sought, the individual circumstances of the customer and the local economic environment. Particular matters which must be taken into account are the person's skills, qualification and work experience, the period of unemployment, the efforts made in previous weeks to seek employment, the availability and location of job vacancies, and the person's family circumstances. While these conditions relate to the efforts made by customers to seek employment, they are also applied in determining whether a person has been made an offer of suitable employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4033">There are a number of supports in place to assist people to move into employment. For example, the part-time job incentive scheme allows people who are long-term unemployed to take up part-time employment for less than 24 hours per week and receive a special weekly income supplement called the part-time job allowance. Participants in this scheme are expected to continue to make efforts to find full-time work.</p>
            <p eId="para_4034">Family income supplement (FIS) is a weekly tax-free payment for families at work on low pay. Persons on FIS may also qualify for the smokeless fuel payment and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4035">Revenue Job Assist is an additional tax allowance for people in Ireland who have been unemployed for 12 months or more and who are now returning to employment. An extra tax allowance can be claimed for each qualifying child. The tax allowance can be claimed for 3 tax years and may begin with either the tax year in which the employment commences or the following tax year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4036">In addition, various payments or supplements can be made to people in employment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, subject to certain conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_4039">Jobseeker's Allowance/Benefit</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">To qualify for jobseeker's allowance/benefit, a person must be unemployed, available for and genuinely seeking work.  A person is disqualified from receiving jobseeker's allowance or benefit while employed under the community employment scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4043">One Parent Family Payment</p>
            <p eId="para_4044">A person on a one parent family payment can take up employment on a community employment scheme and retain the one parent family payment.  However, the income from the employment is subject to a means assessment.  If the weekly income from employment is greater than the prescribed limit, currently €425 per week, the claim is disallowed.  However, if the income from the employment is less than the prescribed limit, the weekly means from employment are assessed as follows: gross weekly income is calculated (less disregards for superannuation/ PRSA contributions, PRSI, the income levy, and trade union subscriptions).  A disregard of €146.50 is then applied and half of the balance is assessed as means.  The means that are applicable are deducted from the one parent family payment that applies in each case.  However, if the means of the customer are greater than the family rate, the claim is disallowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4045">Invalidity Pension</p>
            <p eId="para_4046">If a person is receiving invalidity pension, he or she must apply for an exemption to go on a community employment scheme. All first-time requests for exemptions to commence a community employment scheme are granted automatically. In all other cases, the application, together with a recommendation from the customer's doctor, and details of the proposed training/work are forwarded to a medical assessor of the department. The application is assessed and if the CE scheme is considered to have a rehabilitative or therapeutic benefit it may be allowed.  If the person is granted an exemption, he/she may work on the scheme for less than 20 hours per week.  He/she cannot commence a community employment scheme until an exemption is approved by the Department. The person retains their invalidity pension and any secondary benefits (except fuel allowance which is means tested) for the duration of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4047">Disablement Benefit</p>
            <p eId="para_4048">Disablement benefit recipients can continue working or attending a community employment scheme while in receipt of that payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4050">If a person is in receipt of incapacity supplement, they must apply for an exemption to go on a community employment scheme. The application for an exemption is assessed under the same terms and conditions as for invalidity pension and, if granted, they will retain their incapacity supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_4051">Illness Benefit</p>
            <p eId="para_4052">It is possible for a person who is in receipt of Illness Benefit for at least six months to apply for permission to work on a part-time basis (including on a Community Employment scheme) or to attend a training course. This exemption is given for rehabilitative or occupational therapy purposes. If a person is approved for an exemption, he/she retains the full Illness Benefit payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4053">Disability Allowance</p>
            <p eId="para_4054">People in receipt of disability allowance, if approved by FÁS for participation on a community employment scheme, can retain their disability allowance payment subject to a means assessment.  For the means assessment, the customer can avail of the earnings disregard in terms of the assessment of means from income for disability allowance purposes from employment of a rehabilitative nature,  i.e., first €120 is not assessed and half the earnings between €120 and €350 is assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4055">Widow/er's Contributory Pension/Deserted Wife's Benefit</p>
            <p eId="para_4056">Widow/er's Contributory Pension is payable while the customer is on a community employment scheme provided the person is under 66 years of age.  People over age 66 cannot participate in the community employment scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4072">Self-employed workers are liable for PRSI at the Class S rate of 3%. Class S contributions provide cover for long-term benefits such as State pension (contributory) and widow's/widower's pension (contributory).</p>
            <p eId="para_4073">They do not provide cover for short-term benefits such as jobseeker's and illness benefits — these are only available to people covered by PRSI Classes A, E, H and P. This reflects the need for coverage for various contingencies, the lower rate of contributions that self-employed people pay, the practicalities of administering and controlling access to short-term payments and the annualised system of contributions that this group enjoy. A system of separate arrangements for employed and self-employed workers within a social insurance context is common in other European social protection systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_4075">A self-employed person who has paid insufficient Class A contributions may instead qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Jobseeker's allowance is a means-tested payment and, in assessing a person's means for the purposes of this allowance, account is taken of all income which the person may reasonably expect to receive during the succeeding year. In general, their means will take account of the level of earnings in the last twelve months in determining their expected income for the following year. In the current climate, account is taken of the downward trend in the economy and it is accepted that future earnings may be lower than those of previous years. The process also recognises the potential for significant upward or downward variations in income from one year to the next.  There are no immediate plans to extend cover for short-term benefits to this group of insured workers. Any such measure would have significant financial implications and would have to be considered within a budgetary context. Consideration would also have to be given to an appropriate increase in the rate of the PRSI Class S contribution.</p>

            <p eId="para_4077">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance (BSCFA) scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs. A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive (HSE) payment, or are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income at below standard levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_4078">All income from earnings should be assessed under normal supplementary welfare allowance (SWA) rules. Mortgage payments, or income provided by a spouse (or ex-spouse) to an individual to pay for a mortgage are not disregarded for the purpose of calculating household income for the BSCFA scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4179">The average time taken to process Carer's allowance appeals by the Social Welfare Appeals Office is 29 weeks and 25 weeks for Carer's benefit. There are no figures available on the shortest or longest time to process an appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_4180">There was a 46% increase in the overall number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There was an increase of a further 44% in the number of appeals received in the first eight months of 2010.  While this growth is clearly impacting on processing times, it must also be remembered that these processing times cover all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal and, in the case of some Carers appeals, a second assessment must be carried out by the Department's Medical Assessors.</p>
            <p eId="para_4181">On the return of the papers and comments to the Social Welfare Appeals Office the case is referred to an Appeals Officer who will either make a summary decision based on the documentary evidence or, if s/he considers it necessary, will list the case for oral hearing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4182">Given the logistics involved in organising an oral hearing, a considerable period of time is added to the process.  In order to be fair to all appellants, the vetting of appeals and the arranging of oral hearings are being dealt with in chronological order.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">A number of initiatives have been put in place to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows.  In that regard:</p>
            <p eId="para_4184">2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,</p>
            <p eId="para_4185">A number of additional staff were assigned to the administration area of the Office,</p>
            <p eId="para_4186">The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,</p>
            <p eId="para_4187">A  project to improve the business processes in the office was undertaken which has resulted in a number of improvements being implemented, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4188">Significant enhancements have been made to the office's IT and phone systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_4189">In addition, it was decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis and have been operating since July.</p>
            <p eId="para_4190">I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping current processes under continuous review with a view to achieving a more effective throughput of appeals, while ensuring that any progress does not conflict with due process in terms of the rights of appellants and adherence to the requirements of natural justice.</p>

Kerry and Kildare Street, Dublin 2 and the National Archives of Ireland, which is part of the Department, at Bishop Street. Dublin.

            <p eId="para_4226">Within the remit of my Department, the National Development Plan (NDP) 2007-2013 makes provision for allocations to the Tourism Programme, Culture Sub-Programme and Sports Sub-Programme.

            <p eId="para_4227">My Department's role in the Culture Sub-Programme relates to the development of Ireland's cultural infrastructure.

            <p eId="para_4228">Similarly, the Sports Sub-Programme seeks to develop our sports infrastructure by providing grants for a range of sports bodies at the local and regional level, including swimming pool facilities, and by providing supports and facilities that will allow Irish athletes to compete internationally at the highest level.  The Sub-Programme also seeks to develop national-level sports facilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_4278">The most recent round of negotiations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) took place in Tianjin, China from 4 to 9 October 2010.  According to the secretariat to the UNFCCC, the meeting was attended by some two and half thousand participants from more than 176 countries, including Government delegates, representatives from business and industry, environmental organisations and research institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_4279">Views on the outcome of the Tianjin round of negotiations are mixed.  The UNFCCC Executive Secretary considered that progress was made in defining what could be achieved, in terms of agreement on a structured set of decisions, at the upcoming 16th   Conference of the Parties (COP 16) in Cancún, Mexico.  In a statement following the Tianjin round, European Commissioner Connie Hedegaard considered progress to be patchy and much too slow.</p>
            <p eId="para_4280">At a scheduled Council meeting in Luxemburg on 14 October, EU Environment Ministers adopted conclusions in which the Council, inter alia, "notes the limited progress made at the Bonn and Tianjin sessions towards identifying elements of a balanced package in Cancún; emphasises that a very significant increase in the pace of the negotiations will be needed in order to reach a successful and balanced outcome in Cancún; in this context, expresses its support for the incoming Presidency of COP 16/CMP6 to take all the necessary initiatives in the run-up to and at the Cancún conference.".</p>
            <p eId="para_4281">Although progress overall in Tianjin was not encouraging, there will be at least eight days of further negotiations in advance of the high-level segment at COP 16.  Ireland, through its membership of the European Union, will contribute to and proactively support efforts to reach a successful and ambitious outcome at the Cancún conference.  On the outcome, I fully agree with the view expressed in the conclusions adopted on 14 October, that "there is a need for decisions that can be implemented immediately or in the near-term and for a work programme for the next steps, with a view to avoiding a gap after the first commitment period and agreeing on a global and comprehensive legally binding framework.".</p>

            <p eId="para_4505">My Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts in 2009 and 2010.

            <p eId="para_4506">I appreciate that these requirements, while not new, impose a particular degree of financial discipline on local authorities.

Louth County Council has recently submitted a formal application for approval to drawdown borrowing of €1.521m in respect of a number of schemes. This application is currently under examination and a reply will issue to the Council shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government  (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_4516">I propose to take Questions Nos. 422 and 423 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4517">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with these regulations. Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4518">This funding increased significantly between 2005 and 2009, rising from €1.5m to €4m.  For 2010 I have allocated a total sum of €5.6m to housing authorities for the purpose of carrying out their functions under the Housing Acts in relation to rented accommodation. This is an increase of €1.6m on the amount allocated for this purpose in 2009 and will bring total funding for this purpose since 2004 to over €20m. Funding for 2010 will be paid using a combined methodology based on the number of inspections carried out by each housing authority and on additional funding being provided for once-off strategically-planned programmes of inspection which may be carried out by housing authorities in addition to their usual inspection activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_4519">In general, local authorities have significantly expanded their inspection activity in recent years with the number of inspections more than doubling — from 6,815 to 17,202 — in the period 2005 to 2008.  Details of the inspections of private rented accommodation carried out, the dwellings inspected which did not meet the statutory standards and prosecutions initiated up to 2008 on a county/city basis are included in my Department's Annual Housing Statistics Bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library and on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4520">Work is underway on finalising the 2009 data which will be published later this year; however, preliminary figures indicate a further year on year increase in the number of inspections carried out of approximately 15%, with over 19,800 inspections completed in 2009. This further significant increase reflects the positive impact of the overall Action Programme on Standards, including increased funding, introduced on foot of a commitment in the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, and progress with the implementation of the Rental Accommodation Scheme. The preliminary figures also indicate that of the 19,800 dwellings inspected in 2009, 4,306 did not meet the minimum standards and 3 prosecutions were initiated by local authorities.  Information is not available to my Department on the amount of money raised to date from fines imposed in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4521">It is a matter for each individual local authority to decide the specific details of its enforcement strategy and inspection arrangements.  However, in discharging their responsibilities in relation to the rental sector, authorities have been asked to have regard to the Good Practice Guidelines for Local Authorities on Standards in the Private Rented Sector: Strategic Planning, Effective Enforcement   published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007, which makes a range of recommendations on relevant issues, including targeting inspection activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4522">Following the enactment of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, a comprehensive new sanctions regime is available to local authorities and fines for non-compliance with the Regulations have been significantly increased; the maximum fine has increased from €3,000 to €5,000 and the fine for each day of a continuing offence has increased from €250 to €400. However, a report published by the Centre for Housing Research in November 2007 points out that landlords' responsiveness to notices of non-compliance issued by local authorities has ensured that the need to prosecute is relatively low. The report also concludes that the low volume of cases taken each year suggests that most examples of non-compliance are on a relatively minor scale.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_4537">I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 to 436, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4538">A judgment delivered by the European Court of Justice in December 2007 (C-418/04) found Ireland to have been in breach of the requirements of the Birds and Habitats Directives in a number of areas. This included a finding that the designation of Ireland's original suite of Special Protection Areas (SPA's) was inadequate and did not meet the full requirements of the Directives. The Court also found that some of Ireland's SPA's were not sufficiently extensive to include all important habitat for the birds in question. The findings of the Court necessitated a re-designation programme of all of the State's SPA's, including Trawbreaga Bay SPA, which was first designated some fifteen years ago.</p>
            <p eId="para_4539">Bird data collected over the past two decades clearly show that this site warrants designation as an SPA. In addition, the approach now being taken, in compliance with the findings of the Court, has necessitated redrawing the boundaries of some sites to include all important areas for birds. In Trawbreaga Bay, this has primarily entailed extending the site to include all of the wetland area of the Bay and I do not have any plans to expand the area of the site beyond what is currently proposed. Trawbreaga Bay is also part of the North Inishowen Coast Special Area of Conservation (SAC).</p>
            <p eId="para_4540">The judgment of the Court demands that the protected species of bird are now listed as qualifying interests for the site and some activities will require my consent before they can be undertaken.  Implications for farm practices of those farmers concerned have been addressed in site packs on the proposal sent with my Department's letter of 30 July, 2010, to some 148 landowners and users identified as having an interest in the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_4541">The judgment of the European Court of Justice in case C418/04 also found that Ireland was in breach of the Habitats Directive by failing to subject aquaculture licence applications to the appropriate assessment requirements of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive. Article 6 requires that any plan or project consented to by a Member State must be assessed for its potential to cause damage to a designated site, in view of the site's conservation objectives. In order to undertake appropriate assessment for aquaculture consents, a number of steps must be followed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4542">Firstly, my Department must set detailed conservation objectives for each of the sites in which aquaculture or fishery activities are proposed. To do this, sufficient baseline data, more detailed than the data required for classification / designation, must be collected. A programme of collecting the required data is underway at a national level involving my Department and the Marine Institute. Once set, the conservation objectives will be used by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to undertake an appropriate assessment of applications for aquaculture licences / licence renewals or to open fisheries within, or impacting upon, designated sites.</p>
            <p eId="para_4543">Sufficient bird data have now been collected by my Department to inform the re-designation and to set conservation objectives for Trawbreaga Bay SPA. Within the next few weeks the Marine Institute (MI) will have gathered and analysed sufficient benthic (sea bed) data to enable conservation objectives to be set for North Inishowen Coast SAC. Once this is done, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food can proceed to undertake appropriate assessment and to make licensing decisions. The data collected for these purposes will be made available on request.</p>
            <p eId="para_4544">My Department does not have concerns about current levels of recreational activities at this site.</p>
            <p eId="para_4545">Commercial activities such as fishing, winkle picking and seaweed harvesting are subject to consent processes administered by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or me. Applications for consent to undertake these activities will be subject to screening for appropriate assessment and appropriate assessment if required. Applications for consent under the planning system will similarly be screened and/or assessed by the relevant planning authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_4546">Mink are not considered to be a significant threat to the protected species in this SPA at present and I have no immediate plans to control their numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4547">The proposal to update the designation of Trawbreaga Bay as a Special Protection Area under the Birds Directive was advertised on 4 August, 2010.   Appeals by affected landowners or users may be made by 3 November, 2010. The re-designation process will be concluded, following consideration of any appeals submitted, with the making of a new Statutory Instrument for the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_4548">My Department has met with a number of interested parties and local stakeholders regarding the re-designation of Trawbreaga Bay to clarify the implications of the designations.</p>

            <p eId="para_4634">Continued high levels of funding in recent years for the Water Services Investment Programme and Rural Water Programme   demonstrate the Government's ongoing commitment to the sector. Investment in the period 2000 — 2009 has seen an increase in water treatment capacity equivalent to the needs of a population of 1.1 million and an increase in storage capacity equivalent to1.6 million over the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4635">My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which is available in the Oireachtas library, sets out the plans for investment in major water supply projects, including increased treatment and storage capacity where appropriate, in order to meet key environmental and economic objectives over that period. Including water conservation works, the Programme's water supply component comprises 72 projects in progress with a value of about €524 million, some 182 contracts to be progressed to construction over the period 2010-2012 with a value of €828 million and some 100 schemes on which planning work will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4636">Investment in water supply facilities under the Water Services Investment Programme is complemented by investment annually under the Rural Water Programme — a largely devolved programme of investment on relatively smaller water services schemes and the group water sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_4638">The number of households on a local authority's waiting list continuously fluctuates as households on the list are allocated housing and new households apply for housing support.  A statutory assessment of housing need is carried out every three years by all housing authorities.  The last assessment took place in 2008 and indicated that there were 56,249 households in need of social housing support.  Detailed information on this assessment, including a breakdown by housing authority, is available on my Department's website — .</p>
            <p eId="para_4639">Meeting social housing need remains a high priority for the Government.  While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.  I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing.</p>
            <p eId="para_4640">To this end, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded.  For example, in 2009 I announced the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which it is expected that a substantial number of dwellings will be provided in the years ahead to meet housing needs.  This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.</p>

The construction of one off rural houses may continue to be considered by housing authorities in determining priorities under their proposed social housing investment programmes for 2011 to 2012.  However, having regard to overall Exchequer funding constraints;  the level of prior contractual commitments entered into by housing authorities for the provision of future social housing; and the shift in the  focus of future social housing supply under the expanded suite of non-construction supply options, including the Social Housing Leasing Initiative and the Rental Accommodation Scheme, authorities were informed, under the terms of Circular SHIP 2010/17, that new construction proposals, with the exception of those with regeneration benefits, will only be considered in very exceptional circumstances, e.g. infill to address anti-social behaviour, special needs etc. Authorities were also advised to have regard to the level of suitable vacant accommodation in their areas that may be available for leasing or acquisition.</p>

            <p eId="para_4651">Existing social housing tenants are afforded the opportunity to purchase the homes in which they currently reside, under the tenant purchase scheme.  This scheme, in its current form, has been in place since 1995.</p>
            <p eId="para_4652">Notwithstanding this, when I introduced the Incremental Purchase Scheme on 14 June 2010, I indicated my intention to bring forward legislation in 2011 to underpin a similar scheme for the sale of existing local authority houses to tenants.  This scheme will replace the current tenant purchase scheme in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_4653">To ensure an orderly wind-down of the existing scheme, my Department has requested housing authorities to inform all existing tenants of houses as soon as possible (and new tenants on allocation of a house) of the decision to end the scheme so that they have sufficient time to apply to purchase their home under the existing scheme if they so wish.</p>

            <p eId="para_4660">I propose to take Questions Nos. 450 and 451 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4661">The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive. This Directive was transposed into Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999. Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants: sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002); carbon monoxide and benzene (2002); ozone (2004); and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_4662">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of Irish air quality. The EPA continually monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of air quality monitoring stations located around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4663">The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants on its website at: http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_4664">The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations and a further 18 stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The Report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country, with pollution levels in larger cities highest at traffic influenced sites, and with the burning of coal and solid fuels being the most significant factor in smaller urban areas. All monitored levels met required EU and national standards.</p>

            <p eId="para_4666">The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure in County Kildare.  The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the programme in County Kildare is some €172m.</p>
            <p eId="para_4667">The Ballyna Regional Water Supply Scheme is not included among the contracts and schemes in County Kildare to be progressed under the Water Investment Programme over the period 2010-2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_4668">A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Kildare County Council.  These were subsequently appraised by my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. Inevitably, through this process, certain projects that had been proposed had to give way to others that are more strategically important at this time, as the total value of contracts and schemes proposed by local authorities exceeded the level of resources likely to be available in the period.</p>
            <p eId="para_4669">The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012 is designed better to reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.   The contracts and schemes that did not rate sufficiently for inclusion in the Programme on this occasion were those which did not feature highly on public health grounds or other environmental compliance requirements (for example those relating to European Court of Justice proceedings,  or those required in the context of the River Basin Management Plans, Shellfish Pollution Production Programmes, EPA reports etc) and projects that were proposed simply for capacity expansion (which was unrelated to the National Spatial Strategy/developing areas priorities), and which in the case of water supply can be deferred, in many cases, in favour of accelerated water conservation measures.</p>

            <p eId="para_4671">The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has, over many years, taken a number of steps designed to assist in assessing the extent of the radon problem in Ireland. Between 1992 and 1999, the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to identify the scale of the radon problem and, in particular, areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre<b/>cubed<b/>(Bq/m3  ). </p>
            <p eId="para_4672">The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4673">Some 41,000 homes have now been measured for radon by the RPII, of which 543 have had detections of very high radon concentrations above 800 Bq/m3  . The results of these tests have been compiled into a central database, which has greatly aided the knowledge and understanding as to the extent of Ireland's radon problem.  The table below gives summary results of the radon measurements carried out in each county up to 30th June 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4674">Furthermore, the RPII has carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and in some instances where areas of particularly high radon levels have been found, has written directly to householders in these areas. This will continue to be the focus of attention so as to encourage householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.</p>
            <p eId="para_4675">If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level, remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department, Radon in Buildings — Corrective Options, which is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie. The RPII has also issued guidance, Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householder's Guide, which is available on the Institute's website at www.rpii.ie, together with a a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and offer specific advice and recommendations. In addition, the RPII can also be contacted on freephone 1800 300 600.</p>

            <p eId="para_4845">I have indicated my intention to publish an Environmental (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill later this session which, inter alia, will amend the Waste Management Act 1996 to provide for greater flexibility in the setting of both the plastic bag levy and the landfill levy.  It will also introduce a waste facility levy for waste sent to incineration facilities.  The Act will also be amended later this year by regulations to be made under the European Communities Act 1972, to transpose the provisions of the Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC).</p>
            <p eId="para_4846">In addition, on 15 July 2010 I published a Draft Statement of Waste Policy for public consultation which set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond.  Its core objective will be to set Ireland on an ambitious trajectory towards high value, high quality resource and waste management, using leading edge technology with significant potential to add value and create jobs in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_4847">The period of public consultation closed on 1 October 2010 and I am now considering the submissions received with a view to bringing a final policy statement to Government for decision at the earliest opportunity.

            <p eId="para_4849">The Programme for Government agreed in 2007 signalled a fundamental change of policy in relation to waste management. Reflecting the ambition of the Programme commitment, I have made it clear that I want to see a sustainable, resource-based approach to waste management.  This involves a shift in focus from residual waste management options, such as landfill and incineration, to technologies such as Mechanical Biological Treatment which can maximise the value to be extracted from what should be viewed as a resource rather than as a waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_4850">The Programme's objectives to implement this policy change included a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions. The report, by a group of Irish and international consultants, was published in November 2009. On 15 July 2010, I published a Draft Statement of Waste Policy for public consultation which set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond.  The draft statement is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_4851">The consultation period closed on 1 October last and I am currently considering the submissions received.  I will be bringing a final policy statement, which will also be informed by the Waste Framework Directive, to Government for decision at the earliest opportunity. This will provide certainty for those in the waste management sector and a framework within which the necessary legislative changes can be brought forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_4937">The primary responsibility for managing energy customer debt resides with the energy suppliers.  The use of pre-payment meters facilitates better management by the customer of gas bills and thus reduces the risk of disconnection.</p>
            <p eId="para_4938">Over the last three years, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has been working with the gas industry to make pre-payment meters more accessible for customers who need them.  As a result of these efforts pre-payment metering is now technically feasible for all customers irrespective of supplier.  While currently only Bord Gáis Energy supplies domestic pre-payment metered customers, both Airtricity and Flogas have committed to the CER that they will set up internal systems to service this section of the domestic market within the next 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4939">The supply and fitting of domestic pre-payment meters is a service carried out by Bord Gáis Networks (BGN) on behalf of the customer or the supplier.  The charges relating to the fitting of such meters are regulated by the CER.  This is a fixed charge which is currently set at €373 (including VAT).</p>
            <p eId="para_4940">It is the case therefore that Local Authorities, on behalf of tenants of local authority housing, and other customers, who wish to install a pre-payment meter are required to pay BGN the above charge for the incremental cost of the meter and its installation.  However, I welcome the fact that the CER, in reviewing BGN's five-year revenue review, has allowed for a number of pre-payment meters to be installed under a financial hardship provision.  Customers in genuine financial hardship who have been referred by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) or Society of Saint Vincent de Paul, or whom the supplier considers have genuine difficulty paying bills, can have a pre-payment meter installed at no cost to the customer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4941">The CER considers that pre-payment meters can be a very useful budgeting tool for customers and are also beneficial to suppliers in reducing the accumulation of debt. However, the CER is mindful of the fact that pre-payment meters are not suitable for all customers, such as the elderly or vulnerable, and that the nature of pre-payment meters is such that there is no way of monitoring the frequency and duration of self-disconnection due to a customer running out of credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_4942">The key message for customers in genuine difficulty with their bills is to make immediate contact with their supplier and agree a plan before the unpaid bills begin to accumulate thus obviate the risk of disconnection.</p>

            <p eId="para_4944">I presume that the legislation in the United States of America to which the Deputy refers is the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act which, I understand, is a federal statute that was signed into law by President Obama on July 21, 2010.  While this act is mainly concerned with the financial regulatory reform agenda of the United States Government, I understand it also contains provisions related to trade in minerals originating in the Democratic Republic of Congo including what are termed conflict minerals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4945">In relation to Ireland, I can advise the Deputy that the European Community, representing all the Member States, is a participant in the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme, which seeks to impose effective control by Member States over the trade  in rough diamonds  into and out of the EU, in order to prevent  trade in conflict diamonds.  Within the EU, that Scheme is implemented by Council Regulation (EC) 2368 of 20 December 2002 as amended.  This Regulation relates specifically to trade in rough diamonds and is given effect to in Ireland by a Statutory Instrument made in December 2005 (S.I. 878 of 2005).</p>
            <p eId="para_4946">The Deputy will appreciate that this is an issue of international trade and proposals for any further regulation at EU level in this area will be considered by the Government in the normal way.</p>

            <p eId="para_4948">Government policy pertaining to the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper sets out the Government's position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible, by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_4949">This policy has facilitated significant progress in rolling out broadband services, over recent years.  This progress, measured in international comparisons, is demonstrated in a recent study of broadband services in 72 countries by the University of Oxford and  the University of Oviedo, Spain, which concludes the broadband services currently available in Ireland are capable of meeting the requirements of today's broadband applications and overall, in terms of broadband quality and penetration,  Ireland ranks 13th of the 72 countries studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_4950">Progress in delivering increased speeds is ongoing, Eircom   is currently rolling out an Ethernet service which provides speeds up to and exceeding 1Gbs to wholesale customers and other high-bandwidth users.  Speeds are also increasing for lower bandwidth users, for example, Eircom and the Vodafone/BT alliance are both rolling out speeds of up to 24 Mbps using vDSL technology and UPC is currently providing speeds up to 30 Mbps and is rolling out speeds up to 100 Mbps.</p>
            <p eId="para_4951">The June 2009 policy paper also proposed the establishment of a Next Generation Broadband Taskforce comprising industry, Government and ComReg, aimed at ensuring that the development of high speed and high quality broadband in Ireland will meet the demands of Ireland's Smart Economy by delivering next generation networks and  access.  I was awaiting various developments prior to establishing the Taskforce including:</p>
            <p eId="para_4952">(i) greater clarity from the EU Commission on the regulation of next generation access;</p>
            <p eId="para_4953">(ii) revised guidelines from the EU Commission on State Aid for broadband;</p>
            <p eId="para_4954">(iii) an outline Radio Spectrum Policy Programme from the EU Commission; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4955">(iv) completion of the roll-out of the NBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4956">All of these developments have come to pass and I signalled earlier this month that I now propose to establish the Taskforce.  The first meeting of the Taskforce will be held shortly.</p>

However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as not meeting this minimum requirement, the person in question is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports or details of a REPS or Commonage Framework Plan, which provides for a lower stocking level. My Department records currently do not show the person named as having achieved the minimum stocking density.

Responsibility for the enforcement of this legislation rests with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI). This is done through service contracts with other relevant agencies including the Health Service Executive, the Local Authority Veterinary Service, the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority and my Department.  Under current EU food labelling legislation, country of origin marking is required in cases where failure to provide such information would be likely to mislead the consumer to a material degree.</p>

            <p eId="para_5064">My Department is currently engaged in an extensive revision of the terms and conditions of aquaculture licences including licences for the cultivation of salmon. All relevant stakeholders including industry representatives have been closely involved with this process.  The aim of this review is to ensure that aquaculture licences remain fit for purpose in the context of the challenges and opportunities facing the industry in the medium term.  The review process is currently nearing completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5065">Regarding the National Development Plan for fisheries, the Irish National Seafood Programme was launched in July this year to provide grant aid from Exchequer funding to certain aspects of the fishing industry, including aquaculture.  In the course of the public and statutory consultation process of the strategic environmental assessment of this Programme, concerns were raised by the Central and Regional Fisheries Boards and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources concerning the possible negative impact on migratory wild salmonids from sea lice emanating from salmon farms.  Minister Connick and I agreed with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that, in the context of this National Programme, until such time as concerns in relation to the sea lice infestation control issue has been satisfactorily resolved, no financial assistance would be given to marine salmon aquaculture operators, on a precautionary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5066">In order to support the salmon aquaculture sector in achieving its considerable economic potential, it is necessary to effectively address the issue of sea lice infestation control.  "A strategy for improved pest control on Irish salmon farms" was launched in May 2008 by my Department and has been implemented by it and its Agencies since then. In the 2008 to 2010 period since the introduction of the new Strategy there has been a sustained reduction in the level of ovigerous (egg bearing) lice and a sustained incremental improvement in overall levels of lice infestation on farms  in critical spring period, when there is a risk of cross infection of wild salmonids. During the period of implementation of the new Strategy there has also been a sustained incremental improvement in overall lice infestation on salmon farms during the critical spring period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5067">To complement the progress made by the implementation of the Strategy, it has been proposed that a pilot project be undertaken in this area through the National Seafood Programme. It is envisaged that the project would seek to develop comprehensive measures to improve sea lice infestation control efficiency in the marine salmon farming industry.  Minister Connick and  I are presently discussing with BIM and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources arrangements for this proposal.  I understand that a strategic environmental assessment of the project would be necessary before it could commence and BIM is examining this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_5089">Dairy farmers' incomes comprise the market price paid for milk and direct income support from the EU.  There has of course been a significant increase in milk prices in 2010 compared to the previous year, and the outlook is very much more positive than it was this time last year.  As Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I am committed to developing a strong and vibrant dairy sector, and this is evidenced by the ambitious 50% production expansion target laid down in the Food Harvest 2020 Plan for the development of the agri food sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_5090">At EU level, I have and will continue to support the retention of a strong Common Agriculture Policy, including direct payments and the full array of market supports, and will continue to represent the interests of the Irish farm sector in the discussions on CAP post 2013.  The effective deployment of market supports in 2009, which I had argued strongly for, put a floor under the market and helped to reverse the downward trend in prices at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_5091">It is also critically important, against the background of volatile international dairy markets, that farmers and others in the supply chain adopt best practice to improve efficiency, reduce costs and maximise returns. In this context my Department has provided €18 million over three years to support  Dairy Discussion Groups, in order to increase the level of participation and ensure that farmer members have  access to the latest scientific and technological data, coupled to practical operational advice,  designed to reduce costs and increase margins.</p>
            <p eId="para_5092">On the question of retail prices, the Renewed Programme for Government contains a specific commitment to "implement a Code of Practice for doing business in the Grocery Goods sector to develop a fair trading relationship between retailers and their suppliers" and "to review progress of the Code and if necessary to put in place a mandatory code".  The Government will give effect to this commitment by including a specific provision in the legislation, currently being prepared by my colleague the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, to merge the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority, which will allow for the introduction of statutory Codes of Practice in areas such as the grocery goods sector.  Minister O'Keeffe expects to publish this legislation early next year.  In the interim period until the legislation is enacted, the possibility of agreeing a Voluntary Code, which would respect the interests of all parties, is being explored with all the relevant stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_5093">The Government is strongly committed to ensuring that Ireland continues to have vibrant agri food and retail sectors, particularly given the importance of these sectors to the national economy. The Government considers it important, therefore, that there is balance and transparency in the relationship between the various players in the grocery goods sector. The introduction of a Code of Practice, as provided for in the Programme for Government, is intended to achieve such a balance taking into account the interests of all stakeholders in the grocery goods sector including the interests of the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5095">My overarching view is that we need a strong and adequately resourced CAP after 2013.  This policy must support sustainable and competitive agriculture in the years ahead and, in particular, the development of our vision for the sector as espoused in Food Harvest 2020.  We need to ensure security of food supply<b/>  and maintain family farming in Europe. However, as an exporting country, we also need a policy that underpins competitiveness and innovation.  </p>
            <p eId="para_5096">The first challenge will be to secure an acceptable EU budget.  The second will be to ensure that the share going to agriculture will be sufficient to provide a strong and supportive agricultural policy.  The third challenge will be to secure that the share of agriculture funds going to Ireland is adequate for our needs.  One of my priorities in these negotiations will be to preserve the Irish national envelope.  My primary aim is to secure a direct payments system that provides our fair share of funding and that supports the viability of Irish farming.  As to market supports, I believe that the existing measures should be continued and enhanced.  I also believe we need additional tools to address the much increased volatility in markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_5097">On rural development, we need to focus on the twin goals of competitiveness and sustainability. Measures that are directed at investment and which promote competitiveness perform a key role in encouraging efficiency and innovation in farming. They should be maintained and enhanced.  We must also have strong agri-environment actions in our rural development policy including targeted payments for public goods, support for the development of bio-energy on farms, and for innovative actions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Our off–farm rural development actions should be consistent with this while focusing on genuinely rural areas and emphasising job creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5098">In this context, and looking to the CAP of the future, my priorities are to make sure that it:</p>
            <p eId="para_5099">supports farm incomes and addresses the issue of price and income volatility, while avoiding market distortions,</p>
            <p eId="para_5100">encourages competitiveness and innovation through appropriate measures, including support for farm investment, and</p>
            <p eId="para_5101">promotes sustainability, in all its dimensions, and rewards farmers for the public goods they produce.</p>
            <p eId="para_5102">By doing this we will ensure that the CAP delivers a secure supply of quality food to our consumers and decent incomes to our farmers, while protecting and enhancing the natural environment.</p>

Direct comparison with 2010 is not yet possible as the 2010 survey will not be published until next year. However, in their mid-year update, published in July, Teagasc estimated that dairy, cereal and sheep margins will improve in 2010 due to higher output prices and lower inputs costs.

            <p eId="para_5121">In March 2009 the Government announced a moratorium on promotion and recruitment in the civil service.  Under the terms of the moratorium, no posts can be filled without the prior sanction of the Minister for Finance.  Accordingly, sanction has been requested from the Department of Finance to recruit officers on a temporary basis to undertake the national forest inventory.  Discussions are ongoing with the Department of Finance in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_5122">For the purpose of the Kyoto Protocol Irish forests will sequester 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (Mt CO<sub>2</sub>) over the 5-year period to the end of 2012. This amount is 25% of the emission reductions arising from existing measures outlined in the National Climate Change Strategy. The cost saving in carbon purchases in today’s terms is €220 million.  The reporting and accounting of forests as carbon sinks under the Kyoto Protocol agreements are subject to rigorous reporting procedures which must conform to the good practice guidelines (GPG) of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). While failure to comply with the IPCC GPG guidance would result in revision and re-adjustment of the claimed emission reductions and a loss of revenue, I am confident that the National Forest Inventory will be completed by the end of 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5124">Decisions regarding the type of horse an individual chooses to breed are a matter for the individual breeder.  My Department has provided incentives and assistance through a range of measures down through the years, in accordance with European Commission State Aid Guidelines, aimed at improving equine quality.  These measures are contained within the NDP 2007-2013. Since 2007 my Department has provided €2.3m in assistance through organisations such as the approved equine studbooks, the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association and the Racing Academy and Centre for Education for the purposes of improving equine quality. Projects approved for funding included training for breeders, exchange of information, DNA testing, genetic indexing, performance testing and mare inspections and studbook improvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5125">In addition, almost €5m has been provided by my Department in grant aid to Horse Sport Ireland since 2007, the organisation established to develop and promote an internationally competitive Irish sport horse industry.  The Deputy may wish to note that it is not permitted to make payments to producers under the current European Commission State Aid Guidelines.  It is a requirement that all equines are identified in accordance with Commission Regulation (EC) No. 504/2008. Both my Department and I have reminded breeders of their responsibilities in this regard on several occasions. The Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWAC) recently reminded all horse owners that all horses must be identified and be in possession of a valid passport.</p>
            <p eId="para_5126">My Department does not have an estimate of the number of equines, of the type specified by the Deputy, which are not identified in accordance with this Regulation.  I have made the point previously that Ireland is recognised globally as a world leader in the production and rearing of equines. To maintain this position, equine producers need to ensure that they continue to produce high quality, sound and healthy animals that are ‘in demand' in the international market place. Whilst as an island, Ireland has certain advantages in protecting against exotic disease; we must continually be on our guard. The fundamentals of good animal health systems are grounded on traceability, built upon robust identification and registration systems. It is a legal requirement since July 2009 that each equine being identified, be implanted with a microchip and to have a passport issued from an approved studbook or horse passport agency, with the details relating to the animal recorded on a database maintained by the passport issuing body. Following consultation with industry representatives, I have decided that the registration process will in future be completed by 31 December of the year of birth of the animal, or six months after its birth, whichever date occurs later.</p>

A cross Departmental exercise between my Department and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the relevant Agencies of the two Departments has been underway to collect all the necessary environmental information in the relevant marine Natura 2000 areas to enable licence determinations to re-commence in compliance with the Natura 2000 Directives. When licence determinations commence in the Natura 2000 areas the number of appeals to the Appeals Board is expected to increase.</p>

         the number of Employment Appeals Tribunal cases listed for hearing in the year 2009 and January to September 2010; the number of these cases proceeded in front of the tribunal; the number that were decided in favour of the employer; the number decided in favour of the employee; the average cost to the State of an EAT case; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5167">In 2009, the number of cases, that were allocated a date for hearing, was 3,508.  Some of these would have been allocated a 2010 Hearing date.  In the period January to September 2010, the number of cases that were allocated a date for Hearing was 3,148.  In 2009, the number of cases disposed of was 5,053.  Some of these would have been allocated a 2009 Hearing date in 2008.  In the period January to September 2010, the number of cases disposed of was 4,713.  Some of these would have been allocated a 2010 Hearing date in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_5168">Data on the content of Determinations of the Employment Appeals Tribunal are not collected on a systematic basis, so it is not possible at present to readily extract information.  The Tribunal hears claims under 18 separate pieces of legislation. Some are heard on first instance and some on appeal. Some are simple cases and can be disposed of in an hour while some, e.g., Unfair Dismissals cases, are complex and can take up to 4 days. Costs will, therefore, vary greatly depending on the legislative basis of the claim, its complexity and the location of the Hearing, to such an extent that an average cost figure would have little meaning.</p>

            <p eId="para_5170">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5171">I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.  It is my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_5172">Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.  In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5173">If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.  If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

If the Tribunal rules in favour of an employee, and if the employer continues to refuse to pay the amount due, the employee should then send a copy of the EAT Decision, together with the RP50 form to the Department for payment of the lump sum from the Social Insurance Fund.</p>

            <p eId="para_5182">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5183">I can confirm that my Department received a statutory redundancy lump sum claim on 8 September, 2010 in respect of the above individual and that the claim awaits processing.  In this case, I understand that my Department has already raised some queries with the employer in advance of processing the claim.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the current processing time for these claims has improved and claims dating from March 2010 are currently being processed.  Of course in some instances, where the necessary supporting documentation for lump sum claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5184">My Department continues to make every effort to reduce processing times.  Measures already taken in the Department to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_5185">Almost doubling the number of staff working solely on redundancy payment claims through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_5186">Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_5187">Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_5188">Better quality information relating to current processing times on the  Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_5189">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_5190">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.   In 2009, my Department processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on the previous year.  Furthermore, the level of new claims processed in the first nine months of 2010 was 58,202 — up over 81% on the corresponding 9-month period in 2009 (32,127) and surpassing the total amount of claims processed for the full year 2009 which came to 50,644.  The backlog of claims is decreasing — reducing from its highest level in November 2009 of 43,608 to a current level of 29,776.</p>
            <p eId="para_5191">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50's) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.  Under Redundancy legislation the onus, in the first instance, is on the employer to pay to the employee their redundancy entitlements.  The employer is then entitled, by virtue of pay related social contributions to the Social Insurance Fund, to recover 60% of the amount paid to the employee.</p>
            <p eId="para_5216">In circumstances where the employer is unable to pay the redundancy entitlements, a claim can be lodged with the Department and the documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_5217">If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_5218">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise; Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_5220">Under the Redundancy Payments Acts all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  The scheme provides that an employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to the prevailing maximum ceiling on gross weekly pay that is currently set at €600.  The statutory redundancy scheme operated by the Department on behalf of the Department of Social Protection is concerned only with the statutory minimum payments to which employees are entitled.</p>
            <p eId="para_5221">Eligibility for persons to qualify under the Scheme requires that:</p>
            <p eId="para_5222">The employee must have at least two years continuous service (104 weeks) in the employment of the employer;</p>
            <p eId="para_5223">The employee must be in employment that is insurable under the Social Welfare Acts.  Full-time employees must be in employment which is insurable for all benefits under the Social Welfare Acts; this does not apply to part-time employees;</p>
            <p eId="para_5224">The employee must be 16 years and upwards;</p>
            <p eId="para_5225">The employee must have been made redundant as a result of a genuine redundancy situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5226">I can confirm to the Deputy that a claim in respect of the individual was received by my Department on 15 January, 2010.  Unfortunately, the claimant has insufficient service related to his particular period of employment and does not therefore qualify under the eligibility criteria set down by Redundancy legislation.  In these circumstances, his claim cannot be processed.</p>

            <p eId="para_5230">Since 2007, my Department established the National Employment Rights Authority and the National Consumer Agency.</p>
            <p eId="para_5231">The Information requested by the Deputy in relation to these bodies is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5232">(1) The National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) was established on an interim basis in February, 2007 in line with the commitment in<b><i>Towards 2016</i></b> to securing enhanced compliance with legal requirements, underpinned by adequate enforcement and to greatly enhance public confidence in the system of compliance. The Employment Law Compliance Bill, when enacted, will place NERA on a statutory footing.  The cost of NERA since 2007 is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5233">2007 Outturn — €6.957m;</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5234">2008 Outturn — €9.596m;</p>

            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5236">2010 Budget — €7.824.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_5237">(2) The National Consumer Agency (NCA) was established on a statutory basis on the 1st May 2007 following the enactment of the Consumer Protection Act 2007. The former Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs (ODCA) was subsumed into the NCA and the Act gave the Agency a much wider remit with particular functions in the areas such as consumer research, advocacy, education and awareness, information and enforcement.  The cost of the NCA since 2007 is as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5238">2007 Outturn — €7.078m (ODCA and NCA together);</p>
            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5239">2008 Outturn — €7.587m;</p>

            <p class="indent_3" eId="para_5241">2010 Budget — €7.232m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5242">Insofar as State-owned companies are concerned, none has been established by my Department since 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_5247">The <i>Building Ireland’s Smart Economy</i> document, published in December 2008, contained a commitment to publish a whole-of-Government response to recommendations contained in Competition Authority reports within nine months of their publication. The October 2009 <i>Renewed Programme for Government</i>   further strengthened this pledge. </p>
            <p eId="para_5248">Following on from the commitment, my Department drew up an initial prioritised list of 21 recommendations, based on their impact on competitiveness.  These recommendations related, directly or indirectly, to five Government Departments and are set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_5249">Earlier this year, following engagement with each of the five Ministers, Government reviewed the progress made by the relevant Government Departments in responding to the 21 recommendations and a Government Statement to this effect issued in April 2010.   I attach for the Deputy's information a copy of the Government Statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5250">Government Statement — 8 April 2010</p>
            <p eId="para_5251">Progress on the implementation of competition recommendations welcomed by Government</p>
            <p eId="para_5252">The Government, at its meeting on the 11th March 2010, reviewed the progress made by a number of Government Departments in responding to recommendations contained in reports published by the Competition Authority. The Government noted that 40% of the Competition Authority's recommendations made between 2000 and 2009 have been implemented, with a further 9% being progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5253">The reports by the Competition Authority result from studies it has carried out on various sectors or professions at regular intervals and usually contain a suite of recommendations, aimed at improving competition in the relevant area and addressed to the responsible Government Departments or body.</p>
            <p eId="para_5254">The Government, in welcoming the progress made, stressed the importance of recognising that consumers, both business and individuals, are the final beneficiaries of strong enforcement of competition rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_5255">The Government is pleased to note the progress achieved in relation to some key recommendations based on their impact on competitiveness including:</p>
            <p eId="para_5256">The reduction of the wholesale mark-up on medicines from 17.66% to 10% and the retail mark-up paid to pharmacists, in respect of medicines supplied under the Drugs Payment and the Long Term Illness Schemes, from 50% to 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_5257">The removal of a derogation preventing non-Irish qualified pharmacists from owning, operating or managing pharmacies which are less than three years old which will contribute to the further opening up of the pharmacy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_5258">The finalising of a contract allowing suitably qualified Clinical Dental Technicians to be reimbursed under the Department of Social and Family Affairs' Dental Benefit Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5259">The introduction of legislation which will facilitate the creation of a level playing field for all bus operators, both public and private, in the provision of bus services. The measures will serve the public interest by promoting regulated competition in the provision of public bus passenger services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5260">Further consideration of the Competition Authority's recommendation that legal fees should, in practice, be based (and awarded) on work done, and not by reference to the size of the award received by the client, in the context of the drafting of a Legal Costs Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_5261">The publication shortly of an Issues Paper for public consultation to help inform the drafting of new Retail Planning Guidelines. The new guidelines will strengthen the recognition of the benefits of a competition focus within development planning and development management and include a proposed methodology for incorporating a competition health check assessment by planning authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5262">Two recent publications have noted the importance of Ministers and their departments engaging constructively with this process. The National Competitiveness Council, in a June 2009 report, identified the application of competition law in all sectors of the economy as a priority for improving cost competitiveness and sustaining jobs (Getting Fit Again: The Short Term Priorities to Restore Competitiveness; National Competitiveness Council; 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_5263">In addition, the recently published OECD 2009 Survey of Ireland welcomed the initiative and stated "the proposal that government departments should be required formally to consider and respond to reports of [the Competition Authority] is useful and would bring Irish practice into line with other countries".</p>
            <p eId="para_5264">The Government acknowledges that competition can play a key role in ensuring that the Irish economy regains its competitiveness. It believes that increased competition contributes strongly to achieving high productivity and keeping prices low and therefore must operate in all sectors of the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5265">The absence of competition, whether within internationally traded or locally traded areas of the economy, has the potential to slow Ireland's move to sustainable market-based growth. While competition has been a feature of the internationally traded sector to date, there is evidence that it is not as prevalent in the locally-traded sector as it should be. The commitment in the Building Ireland's Smart Economy document, and in the Renewed Programme for Government, to respond to Competition Authority recommendations, will help address this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_5266">The Government is very aware that consumers will be the ultimate losers from any lack of competition since this will mean increased costs, less choice or lower service quality.</p>
            <p eId="para_5267">The Government also decided to visit this matter, on a half-yearly basis to ensure that progress towards a "smart economy" is not being impeded by uncompetitive barriers in certain sectors or professions.</p>

            <p eId="para_5298">It is the Government's intention to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities as quickly as possible, taking into account the need to ensure that all necessary legislative and administrative requirements under the Convention are being met. As the Deputy will be aware, Ireland does not tend to become party to treaties until it is first in a position to comply with the obligations imposed by the treaty in question, including by amending domestic law as necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_5299">The ongoing implementation of our National Disability Strategy in many respects comprehends many of the provisions of the Convention. In addition, the Inter-Departmental Committee on the UNCRPD monitors the remaining legislative and administrative actions required to enable the State to ratify the Convention. The Committee has developed a programme on which work is progressing to address the matters that need to be aligned with the UNCRPD. One of the key requirements in this regard is mental capacity legislation, which is the responsibility of the Department of Justice and Law Reform. As indicated in the Government's Legislation Programme, it is intended that the Mental Capacity Bill will be published in the current Dáil Session. The passage of this Bill will add substantially to the overall progress on implementation of the requirements towards ratification of the Convention.</p>

However, in error the applicant was not informed of the cessation of the grants at the time and the application form was returned seeking further details.

            <p eId="para_5306">While the delay in informing the application of the suspension of the scheme is regretted, the fact that the application form was not received until 3 July 2009 means that it fell outside the deadlines for acceptance of applications (i.e. 7 April 2009, or 15 June 2009 in cases where applicants had full planning permission on or before the 7 April cut-off).</p>

            <p eId="para_5453">The main objectives of the Rural Development Programme (RDP) are to improve the quality of life in rural areas and facilitate the diversification of the rural economy, and the individual measures under the Programme, including indicative allocations, are as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_5454">Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families<b> — </b>  €16.66m;</p>

            <p eId="para_5462">I am pleased with the progress to date under the RDP, which continues to facilitate access to significant financial resources for rural communities since it started in 2009. This has resulted in the proliferation of innovative and sustainable development projects all over the country, which are providing invaluable support to rural communities in these difficult times and there is no question of funds being diverted away from the RDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_5463">The RDP currently has registered project activity of €72 million, with almost €30 million at an advanced stage of development. Expenditure to date amounts to almost €47 million, which includes funding for a diverse range of projects from support for micro-enterprise in rural areas to the build and maintenance of community infrastructure and the provision of training in a variety of disciplines for rural dwellers. I am confident that all of the activity funded under the RDP to date is contributing to the creation of the right conditions for the generation of sustainable, long-term job opportunities in rural areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5464">My Department and I will be working closely with Minister Batt O'Keeffe and his Department in the coming months to promote increased co-operation between Local Action Groups (LAGs) and County Enterprise Boards in order to ensure that we maximise the impact of all of the funding available and fully support enterprise and job creation in rural areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_5579">The VFM review of the Reserve Defence Force, which was selected for review as part of the 2009-2011 phase of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review initiative, commenced in February 2010.  A Steering Committee comprising representatives from the Department of Defence, the Defence Forces and the Department of Finance was formed.  In accordance with revised guidelines for the conduct of Value for Money Reviews, an independent chair was appointed to the Steering Committee.  Details of the members of the Steering Committee are set out in Table 1 below.</p>
            <p eId="para_5580">The Steering Committee has met on five occasions since the review commenced and a further meeting was scheduled for today.  The approximate duration of the meetings that have taken place up to today are set out in Table 2 below.  A Working Group, comprising of both civil and military personnel, was also formed to assist the Steering Committee with the review.  The working group has undertaken an extensive programme of work under the direction of the Steering Committee over this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_5581">The review will examine the progress that was made with the RDF Review Implementation Plan and make recommendations aimed at improving the efficiency and effectiveness of the Reserve.  As part of the review process, the Steering Committee have established an appropriate consultative mechanism for all key stakeholders including the representative associations who have already provided written submissions and met with the Steering Committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_5582">It is expected that the findings of the Value For Money review, including the lessons learned from the RDF Review Implementation Plan process, will complement the development of the new White Paper.</p>

Since 2002, the Government has reviewed and approved, on an annual basis, the continued participation by seven (7) members of the Permanent Defence Force in ISAF.  On 29 June 2010, the Government agreed to continue to provide seven members of the Permanent Defence Force for service with ISAF for a further period from July 2010, subject to ongoing review by the Minister for Defence.  I am satisfied that the work carried out by the Defence Forces personnel in ISAF represents an important contribution to this UN mandated mission.  The seven Irish personnel currently participating in ISAF, comprising 4 Officers and 3 Non-Commissioned Officers, are located in ISAF Headquarters in Kabul.  The Irish personnel work in staff appointments in planning and administrative roles.  Irish personnel are rotated every 6 months.</p>

            <p eId="para_5627">I propose to take Questions Nos. 550, 552 and 553 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5628">In accordance with Article 9 of the Irish Red Cross Order, 1939 the Chairman of the Society must be a member of the Central Council.  In nominating persons to Central Council, the Government considers that it is highly desirable that the Society should have on its governing body, people with a wide variety of knowledge and expertise, gained through work experience in both the public and private sector and/or volunteer experience with the Society.  The Government, in recommending to the President a person to act as Chairman, had to carefully consider and nominate a person who it deemed would make a positive contribution to the affairs of the Society.  Such a role assumes even greater importance now given the imminent changes to the Society's organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5629">Taking the above into account, Mr. David J. O'Callaghan was recently appointed, by the President, as the new Chairman of the Irish Red Cross.  Mr. O'Callaghan is a former career civil servant with vast experience of public administration at senior management level.  He has experience of matters relating to the Irish Red Cross Society from his previous post as Secretary General of the Department of Defence, which he held from 1995 to 2004.  I am confident that Mr. O'Callaghan will help expedite the reform process under way in the Irish Red Cross Society.  The post of Secretary General has also been advertised recently with a closing date for applications of 28th October 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5630">The current governance proposals arise from a resolution passed in November 2007, by the Council of Delegates of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) which urged all National Societies, as requested by Action 3 of the Strategy for the Movement, to examine and update their Statutes (i.e. the rules of the National Societies) and related legal texts by 2010, in accordance with the "Guidance for National Society Statutes" and relevant International Conference resolutions.  This task is being undertaken by Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies around the world.  The current proposals have the support of the IFRC.</p>
            <p eId="para_5631">The formal report of the Working Group established by the Irish Red Cross Society to examine the issue of governance was received in the Department of Defence in January of this year.  In order to implement the recommendations made there will be a requirement for significant amendments to the Irish Red Cross Society Order 1939.  Representatives of the Society and Officials from the Department of Defence have met to discuss the specific changes required to the 1939 Order and work is ongoing in that regard.</p>

It is my understanding that the issue of the bank account in question is being dealt with by the Society.  It is also my understanding that all funds have been properly accounted for.  The Society has put in place new and revised procedures so that such circumstances do not recur.</p>

            <p eId="para_5636">I propose to take Questions Nos. 554 and 555 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5637">Within the context of consolidating the public finances, the Government is firmly focused on maintaining the operational efficiency of the Permanent Defence Force.  Government approval was secured in the context of Budget 2010 for a level of 10,000 all ranks.  This reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5638">Targeted recruitment is being carried out in 2010 in order to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  To this end I approved the recruitment of 40 Recruits to the Naval Service, limited recruitment to the Army and the intake of 30 Cadets from the Cadetship Competition 2010 which closed on the 28th July 2010.  The day to day administration of recruitment to the Defence Forces is the responsibility of the Chief of Staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_5639">I have been informed, by the military authorities that a total of 6,631 applications were received for the current general service recruitment competition.  This competition was advertised on 26th August 2010 with the closing date for receipt of applications being 20th September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_5640">The enlistment selection process to both the Eastern and Southern Brigades has commenced.  The enlistment selection process to the Western Brigade and the Defence Forces Training Centre is scheduled to follow on when this enlistment has taken place.</p>
            <p eId="para_5641">The following are the statistics in relation to the current recruitment competition with details in respect of the Southern and Eastern Brigade where the selection process is under way:</p>

            <p eId="para_5666">The Military Authorities have advised that for many years it has been Defence Force Policy that all candidates for an Apprenticeship or a Cadetship Competition, must on the day of the physical fitness test, furnish a letter from their general practitioner stating that they are fit to undergo fitness testing.  The Defence Forces has a duty of care to all candidates and they advise that such a letter is required to assist them to meet this duty of care to those who attempt the Physical Fitness Test of the selection process.</p>
            <p eId="para_5667">I am advised that prior to the Moratorium in 2009 applicants for General Service Recruitment did not enter into a formal competition but were placed on a list and called as required for interview, medical examination and physical fitness testing.  As a result of the large number of applications received, and to avoid placing over six thousand applicants on a waiting list, the Military Authorities decided to administer the 2010 General Service Recruitment competition along similar lines as the Apprenticeship and Cadetship Competitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_5668">I intend, with the support of the Chief of Staff and within the resources available, to retain the capacity of the organisation to operate effectively across all roles while contributing to the necessary public service economies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5670">The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  On the 19th September 2005, Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Her term of office was extended for a further three years from 19th September 2008.  The Office of the Ombudsman is currently located in Hatch Street, Dublin 2.  While the provision of accommodation for the Ombudsman is primarily a matter for the OPW, I am anxious to ensure that her office is provided with adequate and appropriate facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">It is a matter of record that the Ombudsman has sought alternative accommodation and that the Department has supported her request in this regard to the Office of Public Works.  I am advised that the OPW identified a number of potentially suitable premises which were subsequently inspected by officials from the Ombudsman's office.  Following on from this process the Ombudsman advised that none of the premises identified by OPW were found to meet the requirements of her office and that she had advised the OPW accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">The Ombudsman was also in contact with my predecessor regarding the need for inadequacies with her existing accommodation to be addressed while the search for suitable new premises continued.  The Department wrote to the OPW supporting the Ombudsman's request in this regard and it is understood that the OPW undertook a number of remedial works to the existing premises which sought to address issues identified by the Ombudsman.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">E-working is not currently available in the Department of Defence.  The Department's entire Dublin based Headquarters will move to Newbridge, Co. Kildare under the decentralisation programme in early November 2010.  The move entails significant changes to the manner in which the Department conducts its business and interacts with stakeholders.  When the move to Newbridge has been completed the Department intends to consider whether E-working is appropriate to our new situation and activities.</p>
